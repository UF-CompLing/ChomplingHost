economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,The Economist,[],"WHEN polling stations closed on February 26th, Fine Gael and Labour, the two parties that have governed Ireland since 2011, were hoping for a surprise result like the one Britains Conservatives achieved last May. They had come to power with the largest majority in Irish history, but five years of austerity had drained their support. Instead, the result was worse than expected: the political fragmentation seen in recent elections across Europe hit both parties hard.

Fine Gael, a centre-right party whose leader Enda Kenny has been taoiseach (prime minister) since 2011, lost nearly a third of its vote. Labour, its centre-left partner, suffered worse still, losing two-thirds. The polls had predicted Labours rout, but for Fine Gael the shock was greater. Its gaffe-prone campaign was clearly not up to scratch: at one point Mr Kenny managed to insult some of his own constituents as champion whingers. Fine Gael relied on broadcast messages aimed at all voters. This proved less effective than the Conservatives campaign last year, which targeted swing voters with tailored messages.

More tellingly, Fine Gaels slogan, Lets keep the recovery going, which it borrowed from the Conservatives, failed to resonate. As in recent elections in Portugal and Spain, the emphasis on economic competence fell flat with voters, says Dan OBrien of the Institute of International and European Affairs, a Dublin think-tank. Although Ireland recorded GDP growth of nearly 7% in 2015, one exit poll found that only 26% of voters felt better off than a year ago. The countrys GDP figures include profits of multinational firms headquartered for tax reasons in Ireland, but much of that money never reaches the Irish. GNP, which excludes income earned by foreigners, has been flat in real terms since the end of 2014.

The opposition exploited the feeling that many were being left out of the recovery. Fianna Fail, the populist centrist party that dominated Irish politics before the financial crisis, gained 24 seats. Sinn Fein, a hard-left nationalist party with strong working-class support, gained seats too, though not as many as it had hoped. Smaller left-leaning parties such as the AAA-PBP and a wide range of independents also did well, gaining a record 30% of the vote.

Because the anti-government vote was split between so many parties, Fine Gael still has the most seats. As in Spain, it is thus unclear who will form the government. Although Fine Gael and Fianna Fail together have a majority of 30, a grand coalition would be difficult. Both parties activists are tribal, and have been since their split during the civil war of the early 1920s. Besides, Fianna Fail fears it would lose support if it became Fine Gaels junior coalition partner, just as the (Irish) Labour party has since 2011. Both have also ruled out any coalition involving Sinn Fein, which they see as fiscally irresponsible and tainted by links to violence and the IRA in Northern Ireland.

Fianna Fail says it does not want to leave Sinn Fein as the only official opposition party either. That appears to leave one solution: some sort of temporary deal between Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, with another election called after the budget later this year.

The political uncertainty comes at a bad time. Slowing growth will limit what Ireland can do without breaching its EU deficit targets. And political fragmentation threatens a return to the politics of giveaways, when Ireland should instead be running a surplus to prepare for the next downturn, says Colm McCarthy of University College Dublin. Euro membership puts Irish policymakers under pressure to show much greater fiscal discipline. Whether Irish politics can withstand the pressure is unclear.",[]
economist.com,2009-06-01 04:00:00+00:00,Why You Didnt Get That Promotion,[],"Youll need to dig deep to get useful input from executives and other colleagues: Project a sincere desire to understand whats holding you back. Ask questions, but dont lobby or argue. Avoid comments or gestures that convey defensiveness, which could cause the other person to clam up or move the conversation to safer territory. And be alert to code words and phrasessuch as general observations about the need for increased leadership ability or better communicationthat may mask fundamental issues.

Many unwritten rules are especially elusive because they dont pertain to technical or business knowledge. Rather, they relate to the soft skills that give decision makers an intuitive sense of your potential for success. Complicating matters further, managers and HR professionals often give intentionally vague feedbacknot direct constructive criticismfor fear of losing good employees.

Executive placement decisions hinge on three categories of skills: nonnegotiables, without which you will not be considered for a promotion; deselection factors, which eliminate you as a candidate even if youre otherwise qualified; and core selection factors, which ultimately determine who gets the position. Leadership competency models typically fail to make these distinctions, and most dont spell out how skills should be demonstrated at different levels. In middle management, for instance, teamwork is a vital competency. At more senior levels, the imperatives are to think strategically and to acquire and develop talent.

Promotions to the C-suite are governed by unwritten rules. If you dont know what they are, youll be left to your own devices interpreting vague feedback and finding a way to achieve your career goals. Beeson has created a framework to help you identify and address any issues that may be getting in your way.

The Idea in Brief Decisions about who gets promoted can seem mysterious and arbitrary. Stellar performance reviews and a strong track recordand you still get passed over. Whats going on? In most companies feedback is vague and confusingsometimes intentionally, so as not to demoralize. Its up to you to ferret out the real reasons youre not getting the job. For example, think twice when youre told you need to work on leadership or gain more seasoning. These can be code words masking more specific concerns, like a failure to demonstrate strategic thinking or an inability to delegate.

Youve been passed over for a key promotion despite stellar results and glowing reviews. Youve asked where youre falling short, but the responses have been vague and unsatisfying, leaving you angry, frustrated, and unsure of how to get ahead. Promotion decisions seem arbitrary and political. Whats going on?

In most organizations, promotions are governed by unwritten rulesthe often fuzzy, intuitive, and poorly expressed feelings of senior executives regarding individuals ability to succeed in C-suite positions. As an aspiring executive, you might not know those rules, much less the specific skills you need to develop or demonstrate to follow them. The bottom line: Youre left to your own devices in interpreting feedback and finding a way to achieve your career goals.

Thats what happened to Ralph Thomas, the vice president of operations for Smith & Mullinss industrial products division, the companys largest operating group. (All names and identifying details in this article are disguised.) He wasnt blindsided by the announcement that Kelly Ferguson had been promoted to senior vice president and general manager for corporate marketshed been informed the week before. But Ralph had been a contender, and this was the second time in four years hed missed out on a division GM job. The first time, Smith & Mullins had hired an outsider who later left the position for a major role at a rival firm.

Ralph always had excellent performance reviews. His 360 results indicated that people loved working for him, and as far as he could tell, managers across the company were beating down the doors to join his group. In terms of execution, his track record was flawless: He and his team had met or surpassed their numbers in each of the past five years. Additionally, they had successfully implemented every major corporate program during that time, and his division had recently been selected to serve as the pilot site for an SAP installation. When hed learned of these last two GM assignments, hed also been told that he had a great future with the company and that with a little seasoning, hed be ready for advancement. Hed tried several times to get the real scoop on why he hadnt been promoted, only to hear vague comments about improving his communication skills and demonstrating more executive presence and leadership. It seemed to him that the company valued people who could look and sound good in the boardroom more than it cared about the year-over-year results of proven performers like himself.

As for Kelly? Shed hired some top people in the past couple of years, but Ralph knew that she had a reputation for being tough on her reports and having sharp elbows. To Ralph, the promotion wasnt much of an expression of the companys leadership competency model, posted on his office wall: Display ethics and integrity, envision the future, deliver results, focus on customers, engage in teamwork and collaboration, and develop talent. Ralph bore Kelly no ill will, but it looked as though it was time to update his resume and rekindle some relationships in his network. Distasteful as it was, testing the job market seemed to be the only way to advance.

The Unwritten Rules

Ralphs situation is surprisingly common, especially among people who arent politically inclined. Few organizations spell out the criteria for advancement.

Though Ralph had been considered for the GM role both times, in each instance there were bona fide concerns about his readiness. The vague feedback about his communication skills actually alluded to tensions with peers in other units: He could be overly competitive and slow to resolve conflict, whereas Kellys powers of persuasion allowed her to manage discord and achieve superior results. She was also known for developing talent. Working for her was not for the faint of heart, but she challenged her staff members, and they grew in the process. Ralph didnt recognize that his popularity reflected, in part, his reputation for being a little easy on peoplehe didnt stretch them to grow and develop. Managers flocking to his unit were often B players who knew hed cut them some slack. He was luring talent that was good but not great; Kelly was attracting A players who wanted a push. The companys competency model included develop talent but didnt specify that having a track record for doing so was nonnegotiable for anyone who wanted to rise beyond Ralphs level.

Under the heading of leadership lurked questions regarding Ralphs strategic thinking. He was a go-to guy for implementing corporate initiatives, a master of continuous improvement. But senior management had seen no evidence of his ability to conceive a large-scale change that would produce a quantum leap in performance. Can strategic thinking be developed? Thats open to debate, but the fact was that Ralph had always worked for visionaries who never gave him the chance to flex his own strategic muscles, a problem everyone had overlooked.

The information void wasnt a matter of malice; rather, it was due to assumptions that nobody thought to make explicit and an all-too-human reluctance to deliver bad news. Managers and HR professionals often provide intentionally vague feedback for fear of losing a good employee. Further, although most leadership competency models refer in some way to important management skills and attributes, they typically fail to distinguish nice-to-have from nonnegotiable skills.

Managers may provide vague feed-back to avoid losing a good employee.

Whats more, such models usually dont spell out how leadership skills should be demonstrated at different levels or how the relative importance of those qualities will change as you rise in the hierarchy. For example, in middle management, teamworkdefined as the ability to maintain cohesion and morale within ones groupis a vital competency. At higher levels, where Ralph hopes to play, it matters less. In fact, at most companies, cohesion tends to fall short at senior levels thanks to rivalry and ego, but teams function pretty well nonetheless. Acquiring and developing talent is the executives imperative, and teamwork becomes a nice-to-have. Ralphs ability to orchestrate well-functioning teams to complete complex projects, among other skills, had singled him out for previous promotions. But when he was being considered for the GM jobs, strategic thinking became a much higher priority.

Many of the unwritten rules are especially hard to nail down because they dont pertain to technical ability, industry experience, or business knowledge. Rather, they relate to the soft skills that combine to give decision makers an intuitive sense of whether a candidate will succeed at the senior level. And, as predictable career paths become more or less extinct, the confusion for people seeking advancement just gets worse.

In my 30 years of experience in and observation of succession planning and executive development at large companies, Ive found that the unwritten rules of C-suite placement decisions fall into three categories. Nonnegotiables are the fundamental factors without which an executive will not be considered for promotion. Deselection factors are characteristics that eliminate an otherwise qualified candidate from consideration. Core selection factors are what ultimately dictate promotion decisions. The exhibit Key Factors in Executive Career Advancement shows the model Ive developed for senior managers. The factors may differ at your company, but the ones highlighted in the exhibit are pretty typical.

Key Factors in Executive Career Advancement Nonnegotiables Factors that are absolutely necessary for you to be a contender Demonstrating consistently strong performance Displaying ethics, integrity, and character Being driven to lead and to assume higher levels of responsibility Deselection Factors Characteristics that prevent you from being considered as a serious candidate Having weak interpersonal skills Treating others with insensitivity or abrasiveness Putting self-interest above company good Holding a narrow, parochial perspective on the business and the organization Core Selection Factors Capabilities that breed others confidence in your ability to succeed at the senior executive level Setting direction and thinking strategically; spotting marketplace trends and developing a winning strategy that differentiates the company Building and continually upgrading a strong executive team; having a nose for talent; establishing an adequate level of team cohesion Managing implementation without getting involved at too low a level of detail; defining a set of roles, processes, and measures to ensure that things get done reliably Building the capacity for innovation and change; knowing when new ways of doing business are required; having the courage, tolerance for risk, and change-management skills to bring new ideas to fruition Getting things done across internal boundaries (lateral management); demonstrating organization savvy; influencing and persuading colleagues; dealing well with conflict Growing and developing as an executive; soliciting and responding to feedback; adjusting leadership style in light of experience

Ralph passes the test on the nonnegotiables and the deselection factors but falls short on several core selection factors, like thinking strategically, building a strong executive team, and having the organization savvy to work effectively across internal boundaries. If Smith & Mullins made a list of such factors available to its executives, along with a dose of constructive feedback, Ralph would probably be able to see where he needs to devote his energies.

But since it doesnt, Ralph has to tease out the underlying issues. Although he periodically gets feedback from 360s, such reviewsunless combined with confidential face-to-face interviews by a third partyare rarely sufficient to illuminate the core reasons behind a stalled career.

One obvious way to get insight is to approach your boss and colleagues directly for their opinions, though their input might be of limited use. They may not be straight with you, and their perspectives may differ from those of the most senior decision makers. For additional information, you might have a conversation with your former manager or your bosss boss. Try to contact the highest-level manager who is knowledgeable about your work and with whom you have a positive relationship, so your approach seems natural and appropriate. (Caveat: Dont go behind your bosss back. He or she should know about any contact with other executives and what your intentions are.) For the reasons stated above, youll probably have to dig a little to get useful information. Thats not easy, so lets take a closer look at how you can go about having a truly constructive conversation.

How to Ask, How to Listen

Getting past executives reluctance to provide direct and difficult feedback is tricky. When asking for input, project a sincere desire to understand whats holding you backand avoid appearing to lobby or argue. Your core question should be What skills and capabilities do I need to demonstrate in order to be a strong candidate for higher levels of responsibility at some point in the future?

Get into active-listening mode. Any comment or body language that conveys defensiveness will most likely cause the other person to either clam up or move the conversation to easier (and vaguer) territorysuch as the need for more seasoning that Ralph kept hearing about. Ask clarifying questions, but dont challenge the content. (You can attempt to correct factual errors with the right person later; this isnt the time.) Be alert to code words and phrases masking fundamental issuesgeneral observations about the need for increased leadership ability or better teamwork or improved communication.

For instance, a manager Ill call Terry was told by her boss that she needed to improve her leadership skills before shed be eligible for her next promotion. She was managing multiple initiatives, and her teams were functioning effectively; she didnt see how to improve her leadership except by taking on more projects. Fortunately, she had worked for her bosss manager earlier in her career and could set up a meeting. In a series of probing questions, she asked the manager to help her define what better leadership would be in her case. She discovered that in her dedication she in fact had been doing herself a disservice. Shed been given an ever-increasing number of projects because of her superior organizational and people-management skills and her ability to stay on top of details. However, senior managers were concerned that she was maxed out by her personal involvement in every initiative and wanted to see that she could delegate more and create processes and systems that would ensure flawless execution without so much direct supervision.

In response she put considerable effort into rethinking how she spent her time: which issues she should be involved in personally, which she couldwith some coachinglearn to delegate to others, and what kinds of meetings and reports would allow her to stay as close to projects as was needed. She revamped her teams staff meeting and the level of preparation required. She also designated a direct report as chief of staff to follow up on deadlines and alert her to situations that required her intervention. Terry admits that it was initially difficult to extricate herself from the details on some projects and confesses to poring over the status reports submitted by the staff. But with practice she got better at letting go. A year later she was promoted to lead a large operational unit.

Things dont always work out so well. Ed, a highly proficient finance manager, had advanced quickly because of his technical knowledge but recently missed out on several key promotions. His boss told him not to worry, everything was fine. Still, Ed met with his units HR manager, who advised him to improve his communication skills. This confused him; he took pride in his ability to write and speak clearly and devoted a lot of time to communicating with his staff. At the suggestion of the HR manager, he met with three peers to get their opinions. All three were hesitant to offer their opinions until Ed probed specifically for examples of poor communication on his part. It turned out that he was right; his basic communication skills were fine. Rather, the underlying issue lay with his ability to listen and to be flexible. Colleagues complained that he tended to get locked into his own opinions, that he lacked openness to other perspectives and shut down creative alternatives. Some considered him arrogant.

Overall, his peers recommended that Ed spend more time discussing his plans with them and soliciting input. Unfortunately, Ed saw this as politics and energy that would be diverted from getting things done. Exacerbating the situation was the fact that Eds boss was encouraging him to drive the implementation of a new corporate policy that Eds peers found onerous. When his boss took a new position within the company, Ed suddenly felt vulnerable. Using his extensive industry network, he quickly found another position with a well-regarded firm but ended up leaving his new job after only nine months. The official reason was that Ed was not a cultural fit in a highly collaborative environment. In reality Eds peers at the new company complained that he was a know-it-all who tried to sell major initiatives to his boss without taking the time to understand how the organization worked and what internal customers needed.  

If you are having trouble decoding the feedback you receive, try asking at the end of each session, What one or two thingsabove all otherswould most build confidence in my ability to succeed at higher levels within the organization? As long as the other person answers honestly, this question tends to circumvent vagueness and separate the wheat from the chaff.

Keep in mind that changing deep-seated perceptions about you, formed over years, requires visible and consistent effortwhich is why it is typically best to focus on one or two key areas of development. Think through whether your current position provides you with a platform to demonstrate needed skills. Ralph, for instance, may need to move to a position where his breakthrough thinking isnt preempted by a visionary boss. Alternatively, he may find ample opportunities to exhibit strategic thinking in his current roleif he is aggressive and creative in pursuing them and his boss gives him room to experiment.

Changing deep-seated perceptions of you takes visible and consistent effort.

Although this type of development isnt easy, the payoff can be huge for both the individual and the organization. Employees like Ralph learn whats really holding them back, and companies like Smith & Mullins get a deeper and better bench.",[]

THE Economist tracks the health of housing in 26 markets around the world, encompassing a population of over 3 billion. Prices are now rising in 21 of these markets at a median pace of 4.7% a year. Chinas housing market is one of only five countries in our index where prices are falling, joining Singapore and a trio of euro-zone countriesFrance, Greece and Italy. The government has been trying to boost the market over the past ten months which is now slowly responding.

To assess whether house prices are at sustainable levels, we use two yardsticks. One is affordability, measured by the ratio of prices to income per person after tax. The other is the case for investing in housing, based on the ratio of house prices to rents, much as stockmarket investors look at the ratio of equity prices to earnings. If these gauges are higher than their historical averages then property is deemed overvalued; if they are lower, it is undervalued. According to our measure, property is more than 30% overvalued in six of the markets we track, notably in Australia, Britain and Canada.

Explore the data in our interactive chart above (updated on October 6th 2015) and try to spot which market is looking most vulnerable. See full the article on global house prices here.

Explanation

This interactive chart uses five different measures

 House-price index: rebased to 100 at a selected date

 Prices in real terms: rebased to 100 for the selected date and deflated by consumer prices

 Prices against average income: compares house prices against average disposable income per person, where 100 is equal to the long-run average of the relationship

 Prices against rents: compares house prices against housing rents, where 100 is equal to the long-run average of the relationship

 Percentage change: the percentage change in real house prices between two selected dates

Notes

The data presented are quarterly, often aggregated from monthly indices. When comparing data across countries, the interactive chart will only display the range of dates available for all the countries selected

economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,The Economist,[],"THE reason why Hong Kong does not have democracy is because no one has died yet, says a student in the former British colony who thinks it worth shedding blood to win freedom. Fellow supporters of the territorys independence from China rampage through the streets; a protester self-immolates outside the British consulate. The government in Beijing sends tanks to crush the revolt.

Such a calamity is unlikely in 2016. But could it happen in Hong Kong within the next decade? That is the question posed by Ten Years, a popular local film that has infuriated mainland officials.

When China took Hong Kong back from Britain in 1997, it agreed to give it a high degree of autonomy for 50 years. Each of the films five vignettes portrays a dystopia in which China, explicitly or covertly, has taken control much sooner. Released on December 17th in just one cinema, the film went on to play to packed theatres across the territory until its run ended in February. In some cinemas it outsold Star Wars, another film about a big, repressive state. On March 10th the films overseas premiere will take place in Japan.

Ten Years has appealed to those concerned about Chinas efforts to stifle the development of democracy in the territory and to restrict freedom of speech. Anxieties have been fuelled recently by the disappearance of five men who sold gossipy books about Chinas leaders.

At the end of February a Hong Kong-based television channel aired interviews with the men. It said four of them were in custody on the mainland for illegally selling books there. One of them, Lee Bo, said he was helping the mainland police as a witness. Mr Lees case has aroused particular interest because he disappeared from Hong Kong itself; the others were visiting the mainland or Thailand when they went missing. In the interview, Mr Lee denied he had been kidnapped by Chinese agents and said he remained free on the mainland. But suspicions persist that China has been putting pressure on him to stop publishing scurrilous works.

Such worries have encouraged the recent rise of a localist movement, whose followers emphasise Hong Kongs separateness from the mainland. On February 8th young localists clashed with police in the citys worst violence since the 1960s. In a by-election for the legislature on February 28th, a localist candidate charged by police with taking part in the riot took 15% of the vote. Ten Years refers to the movement in its depiction of Sam (played by Liu Kai-Chi, pictured), a fictional shopkeeper who is attacked by pro-Communist fanatics for calling his eggs local.

China has made its displeasure clear. A newspaper in Beijing called the film ideological poison. Mainland broadcasters have dropped plans to air the Hong Kong Film Awards on April 3rd, the territorys equivalent of the Oscars (Ten Years has been nominated for best picture).

Hong Kongs financial secretary, John Tsang, has been trying a more conciliatory approach to localist sentiment. In his budget speech on February 24th, he described films made in the Cantonese dialect (Ten Years is one such, though he did not mention it) as a key component of the local culture. He announced a doubling to HK$500,000 ($64,300) of the governments subsidy for each Cantonese film promoted on the mainland, where films use the Mandarin dialect. Not everyone was impressed. One of the directors of Ten Years said the government would support only films that could pass Chinas strict censorship laws. Ten Years would stand no chance.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,The well runs dry,[],"OIL PRICES have perked up a bit, but producers are still reeling from the slump in crude prices last year. The boss of Pemex, Mexicos state-owned oil firm, said this week that the company faced a liquidity crunch. Malaysias state oil firm is laying off workers. Petrobras, Brazils troubled oil giant, recently secured a $10 billion loan from the China Development Bank to help it to pay off maturing bonds. The trouble at these firms underlines broader concerns about the burden of corporate debt in emerging markets. A particular worry for resources firms is the rising cost of servicing dollar debts taken out when the greenback was much weaker than it is now. Short-term dollar loans to be repaid with earnings in falling currencies featured prominently in past emerging-market crises. But the concern about the role of dollar lending in the current cycle is different.

The numbers are startling. Corporate debt in 12 biggish emerging markets rose from around 60% of GDP in 2008 to more than 100% in 2015, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Places that experience a rapid run-up in debt often subsequently endure a sharp slowdown in GDP (see article). An extra twist is that big emerging-market firms were for a while able to borrow freely in dollars. By the middle of last year, the stock of dollar loans to non-bank borrowers in emerging markets, including companies and government, had reached $3.3 trillion. Indeed until recently, dollar credit to borrowers outside America was growing much more quickly than to borrowers within it. The fastest increase of all was in corporate bonds issued by emerging-market firms.

Jaime Caruana, the head of the BIS, argues that a global liquidity cyclethe waxing and waning of dollar borrowing outside Americahelps to explain the slowdown in emerging-market economies, the rise in the dollars value, and the sudden oil glut. When the dollar was weak and global liquidity was ample thanks to the purchase of Treasuries by the Federal Reserve (so-called quantitative easing, or QE), companies outside America were happy to borrow in dollars, because that was cheaper than borrowing in local currency. Capital inflows pushed up local asset prices, including currencies, making dollar debt seem even more affordable.

As long as the dollar remained weak, the feedback loop of cheap credit, rising asset prices and strong GDP growth could continue. But when the dollar started to strengthen, the loop reversed. The dollars ascent is tied to a change in Americas monetary policy which began in May 2013, when the Fed first hinted that it would phase out QE. When the Feds bond-buying ended in October 2014, it paved the way for an interest-rate increase 14 months later. The tightening of monetary policy in America has reduced the appetite for financial risk-taking beyond its shores.

The impact of this minor shift on the value of the dollar has been remarkable, particularly against emerging-market currencies (see chart 1). Wherever there has been lots of borrowing in foreign currency, the exchange rate becomes a financial amplifier, notes Mr Caruana. As companies scramble to pay down their dollar debts, asset prices in emerging markets fall. Firms cut back on investment and shed employees. GDP falters. This drives emerging-market currencies down even further in a vicious cycle that mirrors the virtuous cycle during the boom. Since much of the credit went to oil firms, the result has been a supply glut, as producers pump crude at full tilt to earn dollars to pay down their debts.

Mr Caruanas reading of events has dollar borrowing at its centre. Yet the sell-off in emerging-market currencies has more to it. Rich countries that export raw materials, including Australia, Canada and Norway, have also seen their currencies plummet against the dollar. Falling export income as a consequence of much lower oil and commodity prices is likely to have played a similar role in the slump in other currencies.

Some analysts think the problem of dollar debt is blown out of proportion. There are countries, such as Chile and Turkey, where dollar debts loom large (see chart 2). But the average dollar share of corporate debt in emerging markets is just 10%. Chinese firms account for more than a quarter of the $3.3 trillion of dollar loans to emerging marketsand since August, when fears surged that the yuan would be devalued, they have been swapping dollar loans into yuan, notes Jan Dehn of Ashmore Group, a fund manager.

Much of the foreign-currency debt taken out by companies elsewhere was long-term: the average maturity of bonds issued last year was more than ten years, for instance. That pushes refinancing, and the associated risk of default, far into the future. In many cases, dollar debt is matched by dollar incomeeven if, as in the case of oil exporters, it is much diminished by low prices. And there are pots of dollars in emerging-market banks to which indebted companies may have recourse.

In any event, the dollars ascent has stalled because of concerns about Americas faltering economy and doubts that the Fed can raise interest rates again. Yet the cycle of dollar lending nevertheless has implications that may not be fully appreciated. A recent study of firm-level finances by Valentino Bruno and Hyun Song Shin of the BIS found that emerging-market firms with strong cash balances are more likely to issue dollar bonds. That goes against a tenet of corporate finance, that firms only borrow to invest once they have exhausted internal sources of funds. It suggests that financial risk-taking was the motivation for borrowing. On average, 17-22 cents of every dollar borrowed by an emerging-market company ends up as cash on the firms balance-sheet. Such liquid funds could go into bank deposits, or be used to buy other firms commercial paper or even to lend to them directly. In other words, the authors say, companies seem to be acting as surrogate financial firms. As a result, dollar borrowing spills over into easier credit conditions in domestic markets.

This is one of the ways the dollar-credit cycle exerts a strong influence over overall lending in emerging markets. The credit cycle took an apparently decisive turn last year. The stock of dollar credit to emerging markets stopped rising in the third quarter, says the BIS, the first stalling since 2009. Dollar credit is much harder to come by than it was. So are local-currency loans. Bank-lending conditions in emerging markets tightened further in the fourth quarter, according to the Institute for International Finance. The dollar may have peaked but, for emerging markets, tight financial conditions are likely to endure.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-08 23:00:24,The Economist explains: Why fashion week is passe,[],"DESIGNERS should love fashion week. It is the culmination of months of work. Celebrities clamour to attend their shows, then study each model as if the worlds future rested on the cut of a skirt. But designers are pouting about the biannual ritualso much so that the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) commissioned Americas perhaps least glamourous group, management consultants, to explore their complaints. The Boston Consulting Group interviewed more than 50 people, including designers, editors, bloggers and retailers. The result of that study was published last week. So why is fashion week no longer fashionable?

Fashion week used to serve a distinct purpose. Designers would prepare collections and present clothes to the press, to major retailers and to select other industry insiders. Fashion editors would then prepare sumptuous magazine spreads featuring the clothes they liked best. Retailers would order this or that dress. About four to six months later, those clothes would appear in shops.

Technology has upended all this. As soon as models sashay down the runway, photographs are posted online and shared endlessly through social media. Fast-fashion brands copy designers styles (though the industry prefers the euphemism interpret), often stocking look-alikes in their shops before designers own clothes make it to department stores. When designers clothes do arrive, they seem stale . It is no coincidence that the world's top two retailers are TJX and Inditex. TJX buys brand-name clothes from stores that can't sell them at full price, then offers them at a deep discount. Inditex owns Zara, the pioneer in fast fashion.

Few designers like the current system. Less obvious is what they should do next. One idea is for fashion houses to show clothes to only certain people, such as retailers and some press. Designers would stage a bigger, public presentation four to six months later, when those clothes are available in stores. There would, of course, be the threat that some images would leak. Another idea would be to continue the current system, but make a small subset of clothes available immediately. Designers are already testing new ideas. Burberry and Tom Ford, for example said their September fashion shows would show clothes available immediately. For the forseeable future, experimentation will be in vogue.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,The art of survival,[],"ONLY standing room is left at the civic hall in Petaling Jaya in the western suburbs of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysias capital. Inside 1,000-odd middle-class Malaysians have gathered to consider the fallout from a corruption scandal that has buffeted the country since July. The whole world is laughing at us, says a retiree watching from the back rows.

At the heart of the scandal are hundreds of millions of dollars that for unclear reasons entered bank accounts belonging to the prime minister, Najib Razak (see article). You might think such a revelation would unseat Mr Najib and spell ruin for his United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which has held power since independence. Instead, Mr Najib appears to have strengthened his grip, by purging critics within the cabinet and police. On February 29th the grand old man of Malaysian politics, Mahathir Mohamad, stormed out of the party in disgust. Dr Mahathir was prime minister for 22 years until 2003 and was once a fan of Mr Najib. No more.

Across the country, dissidents are feeling nervous. Last year at least 15 people, mostly dissenters in politics and civil society, were charged under a noxious colonial-era sedition law that Mr Najib had once promised to repeal. In late February authorities blocked one of Malaysias most popular news websites hours after it reported that not all Malaysias graft-busters are convinced that the prime minister has committed no crime. A new anti-terror law entitles the prime minister to nominate broad security zones in which police powers may be extendeda handy tool for crushing protests, critics say. The attorney-general is mulling stiffer sentences, including caning, for people who leak government secrets.

It has all appalled many urban and professional Malaysians. It has also made stars of the governments most vocal critics. At the forum in Petaling Jaya, fans seeking selfies crowd around Tony Pua, an opposition MP whom police have banned from leaving the country; at dinner afterwards people at neighbouring tables insist on paying for his meal.

Malaysia is essentially two countries, says Ben Suffian, a pollster. Outrage is widespread in the cities, with growing numbers of young, liberal ethnic-Malays as well as most of the ethnic-Chinese and ethnic-Indian minorities who make up about a third the population. It is rarer in UMNOs rural heartlands, where apathy is rife and where the party is trusted to defend racial laws designed to give the ethnic-Malay majority a leg-up.

Over the decades this rural voter base has helped keep UMNO in power. Indeed party leaders have been more concerned to protect themselves from challenges from within UMNO. Loyalty is prized over ability, while patronage and convoluted party rules discourage upstarts. Mr Najib has been playing the system more ruthlessly than many imagined. Recent sackings of subordinates have sent a signal about who is boss.

It is surely a relief to UMNO that Malaysias opposition has mostly bungled its chance to make hay from the affair. It had formed a loose coalition of three parties, reliant on an unlikely peace between two of them, a secular ethnic-Chinese outfit and a devout Malay-Muslim one. The opposition won the popular vote in a general election in 2013 but fell short of the number of seats required to take power because of gerrymandered constituencies. Yet rather than regroup and build momentum for the election that is due by 2018, it has been consumed by bickering. When tens of thousands of Malaysians rallied last August to demand Mr Najibs resignation, they did so not under the banner of any political party but at the request of Bersih, an unaligned group that has long campaigned for clean politics and electoral reform.

Rock solid, or rocky?

Some people assert that Mr Najibs hold may be shakier than it appears. Even in the countryside, worries about the economy have made the prime minister unpopular. Low oil prices have damaged Petronas, the state oil firm, slashing the amount of money the government can pour into development projects. A new sales tax has increased prices for many everyday items, while a slump in Malaysias currency, the ringgit, which has fallen by more than a fifth in the past 18 months, has put many imports out of reach. It all helps make some poorer Malays more susceptible to populists painting ethnic-Chinese and ethnic-Indian Malaysians as rent-seeking interlopers. But a new suspicion is growing among ordinary Malaysians that goings-on in Kuala Lumpur are affecting their own pocket books.

As for the party, rivals whom Mr Najib has vanquished may yet bounce back. Dr Mahathir, who has long called for Mr Najib to step down, is scheduled to attend an unusual forum of grandees and politicos from across the political spectrum who are meeting in private later this month to discuss alternatives to Mr Najib. Wan Saiful Wan Jan, of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs in Kuala Lumpur, says that some UMNO bigwigs are backing the prime minister through gritted teeth. He says that a time may come when they say that enough is enough, especially when the party starts considering its strategy for the next election. Perhaps Mr Najib may risk calling a snap election before then, both to pre-empt conspiracy and to catch out the opposition before it can patch up its differences.

For Malaysias rattled liberals, all this seems theoretical. Last year they watched plans evaporate for a parliamentary vote of no-confidence. They are doubtful that the current corruption scandal will ever unseat Mr Najib.

Back at the civic hall in Petaling Jaya, the mood darkens as the evening wears on. Microphones passed around the floor reveal frustration and anger. One person insists that the opposition draw up a list of government officials who should face trial if the opposition takes power. A second, shaking with rage, frets that the opposition has no chance of winning the next poll. This is no time to give up hope, Ambiga Sreenevasan, a prominent lawyer, tells the crowd. Once the crisis is over, she says, we must make sure this never happens to our country again.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,The appy trucker,[],"MENTION logistics and it may bring to mind shiny FedEx or UPS vans with their neatly uniformed drivers. However, the business of shifting cargo by road, especially larger loads, is far more fragmented and inefficient than the image of its best-known brands would suggest.

Even the world-famous names in parcel delivery compete with many lesser firms. Likewise, third-party logisticsthe outsourcing of a businesss transport needs, including running fleets of lorries and vans on its behalfalso has some big firms but lots of smaller ones. There is even more fragmentation in what Americans call the truckload part of the industryone-off deliveries of entire lorry trailersand in the less-than-truckload businessthe carriage of a pallet or two of goods. Whereas Americas top five airlines earn around 90% of their industrys domestic revenues, the equivalent figure for the top five logistics firms is just 20%, reckons Armstrong & Associates, a consulting firm. Official figures show that one in nine American truckers is an independent owner-operator rather than an employee.

The entire industry is a juicy target, ripe for disruption. Together, road haulage of all kinds is worth around $700 billion a year in America and more than 310 billion ($335 billion) in Europe. The rise of internet shopping and other factors will help the industry to keep growing, by around 3% a year worldwide for the next decade, according to Deloitte, another consulting firm. But it is a wasteful business. Every year American lorries travel empty for 50 billion miles (80 billion km)28% of their total mileage. In Europe, a quarter of the containers on the road are empty, reckons InlandLinks, a container-tracking service.

Some moves have been made towards consolidation. Low fuel prices, cheap finance and recovering rich-world economies have given larger companies the means and the motive to buy rivals. Last year FedEx bought TNT, a European parcel-delivery counterpart, for $4.8 billion. XPO Logistics of America, a broker in the truckload and less-than-truckload businesses, bought a French firm, Norbert Dentressangle, for $3.5 billion; and then a domestic rival, Con-way, for $3 billion. European firms have joined in too: SNCF Geodis, a French state-owned logistics outfit, recently bought OHL for $800m, to establish a foothold in America.

However, there seems little prospect so far of consolidating the multitude of freelance truckers into employees of a handful of big firms. This is because of the comparatively low barriers to entry in their business, says Jack Semple of the Road Haulage Association, a British trade body. The average cost of a lorry-driving course in Britain is less than 1,000 ($1,400). In California it can be as little as $1,100. Lorries can be leased, or bought on cheap credit provided by their makers. Britain nationalised and merged its biggest hauliers in the 1940s, but a state behemoth was outrun by one-man outfits and the business was privatised again in the 1980s.

The best prospects for efficiency and rationalisation, then, are in improving the creaky system by which large numbers of freight-brokers haggle with even larger numbers of truckers. Deals can take days of telephone calls to organise. And for their efforts, brokers charge hefty commissionsof as much as 45% of the delivery cost per load for short-haul trips. Brokers have an incentive to choose the priciest options for their clients to extract as high a fee as possible.

Inevitably, a bunch of startups are now seeking to make the business cheaper, quicker and more transparent by replacing the brokers with mobile-app platforms that match shippers loads with available trucks and truckers. Cargomatic, based in Los Angeles, lets shippers list local jobs on its app, which are pinged to the smartphones of nearby drivers. When one of them takes on a job, the shipper can track his journey in real time. Trucker Path, already a popular social app that helps around 450,000 registered American drivers find rest-stops and poker partners, is currently testing its Truckloads app, which does something similar to Cargomatic for the long-haul market.

Other systems automatically match drivers to loads, much as Uber does for taxis and passengers. Transfix, developed by a New York startup, not only scans for nearby lorries, but also rates each driver based on how many miles he would have to drive his lorry empty, how soon he will be available and his past performance. The best match is offered the job first. The whole process takes minutes, says Drew McElroy, a founder of Transfix. And the commission is just 10%, a fraction of what some brokers charge.

Other apps are attempting to do the same for containers whose journeys do not just involve the roads. Kontainers, based in Britain, aims to be a one-stop-shop for businesses that want their goods moved across the oceans. Now, to shift a load from a shipper in Britain to a customer in Australia typically requires two days, 20 phone calls and 40 e-mails to reach an agreement, says Graham Parker, one of Kontainers founders. He wants to make booking a container shipment as easy as buying a plane ticket. Its website does this by dealing directly with truckers and shipping lines, which provide real-time tracking throughout the journey. Mr Parker says one of his clients discovered though Kontainers that shipping from Britain to Australia could be done in 38 days rather than the 55 his broker had always told him.

Previously Nam Nguyen, of Skyline Steel in Seattle, would call five or six haulage companies whenever he needed to move a load from the companys yard to a customer. For local jobs he says he now uses the Convoy app, created by another firm in Seattle, which went live in September. The main gains, he says, have been the huge time savings and reliability of delivery. Although it was at first assumed that only small businesses would be interested in such apps, big companies have also started to use them too. Barnes & Noble, an American bookshop chain, was one of Transfixs first clients; Bosch, a German industrial giant, is now one of Kontainers best.

Road to riches

Drivers hours are restricted by law, so anything that helps them cut the time spent behind the wheel with no load (and thus no pay) is a bonus. Apps can help with this, and in generally helping them find more jobs. Mr McElroy says some of his drivers now average five weekly one-way trips between Indianapolis, where several publishers are based, and Barnes & Nobles warehouse in New Jersey, instead of four. So they earn 25% more, with less waiting around. The apps also arrange payments much more quickly than brokers typically do, another important benefit for drivers. Some platforms, such as Transfix, guarantee payment within 24 hours of a delivery. Others, such as Truckloads, allow drivers to filter for shippers credit ratings and thus the likelihood of getting paid.

Investors have concluded that such platforms have proved their worth, and are ready to take off. Last year $63m was raised for seven of these companies, including $12m for Transfix and $20m for Truckloads. Such sums are small change compared with the huge sums that taxi-app firms like Uber and Didi Kuaidi are raising, but it is in the haulage apps favour that they can achieve scale with such relatively modest sums. And they do not need to attract millions of users to turn profitable. Kontainers says it already has more than 100 businesses as customers in Britain, a number which many offline brokers would be more than happy with.

So far, the big names of road logistics have largely stood back and left the business of Uberising the haulage business to the startups. Dan Lewis of Convoy argues that newcomers such as his have an edge, because incumbents would need to integrate new technology into their legacy systems, and retrofit solutions rarely outperform something built from the ground up. As for the established brokers, they have an incentive to maintain the status quo and keep the market offline, argues Mr Parker of Kontainers. This will change if the apps begin to eat into brokers business and divert a significant share of work from the big parcels and haulage firms towards freelance drivers.

Brett Parker, a founder of Cargomatic, sees large, asset-heavy logistics firms like UPS and FedEx not as competitors but as future partners, and says many such incumbents are seeking alliances with on-demand-economy firms like his. Others think the incumbents will eventually buy the most successful haulage-broker apps.

Two other, deep-pocketed names are also casting an eye over the delivery business. Uber itself is testing a service in some cities in which its freelance taxi drivers also collect and drop off parcels; and Amazon is developing an app, On My Way, which allows any member of the public to get paid for delivering packages. If these two giants eventually adapted their services to cover larger loadsnot much of a technological challengethen the scale of their resources and expertise would be hard to compete with.

By then, another wave of upheaval may be in prospectincluding for todays app-based disruptersas driverless lorries begin taking to the roads. It seems likely that they will be phased in over a number of years, starting perhaps with bigger, longer-distance loads. An industry that has less need for drivers ought to tip the scales away from freelancers and towards large fleet owners. But the advantages of being able to book a shipment quickly and cheaply by app will remain.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,China sets itself a lofty growth target,[],"MARK the date on your calendar: on January 17th next year, China will report that economic growth in 2016 was no lower than 6.5% and no higher than 7%. What explains such clairvoyance? Because the government has now formally unveiled its growth target for the current year, putting it at 6.5-7%. Chinese GDP targets, once set, have a way of coming true. All the economys many uncertaintiesrising debt, rich-world doldrums, currency volatilitymelt away as if nothing in the face of its leaders conviction. But in their pursuit of their goal, Chinese leaders still have many options.

The GDP target was announced on March 5th by Li Keqiang, the prime minister (pictured), in his report at the start of the annual session of the countrys rubber-stamp parliament, the National Peoples Congress. Some credit is due to China in setting a target range as opposed to its past practice of shooting for a single specific number. There is no sense in managing an economy, especially one as big and complex as Chinas, so that it can hit a bullseye. Flexibility is far better. The problem, however, is that the target range is still too high. Before Mr Li revealed his plans, many economists had reckoned that Chinese growth would be less than 6.5% this year; the IMF had forecast an expansion of 6.3%.

By setting a high target, China creates two dangerous temptations for itself. The first is to massage data to make growth appear stronger than it actually is. There have long been concerns that China is wont to adopt such tactics; as headwinds to Chinas growth intensify, such doubts will be all the more widespread this year.

The second temptation will be for the government to gin up growth more than is warranted. It is in this respect that the other details of Mr Lis report make interesting reading. It suggests China will lean more heavily on both fiscal and monetary policy to hit its growth target. It has planned for a deficit of 3% of GDP, up from 2.3% last year. It is also aiming for 13% growth of M2 (a broad gauge of the money supply), up from 12% last year.

On the surface, neither sounds like much of an increase. But they signal that the government is ready to ratchet up pro-growth measures. Moreover, the deficit target in fact only refers to on-budget spending. Since the government has several off-budget levers, the real deficit is likely to exceed the 3% mark. As for monetary policy, it is already loose, as shown by credit growth in January, with 2.51 trillion yuan ($385 billion) in new lending by Chinese banks, the most ever in a single month.

China has an old habit of turning to stimulus when growth fades. But the nature of the stimulus is changing. In previous years, the government relied on heavy spending. This time it has actually called for a lower rate of growth in fixed-asset investment, from a targeted rate of 15% last year. Instead, much of the fiscal push appears set to come from lower taxes: China is aiming for just 3% growth in this years budget revenue, down from a target of 7.3% last year. That is consistent with the concept of supply-side economics that has gained favour in Beijing in recent months: the idea is to clear the path for private companies, not just pour more money into infrastructure projects dominated by state-owned firms.

There was also some welcome realism in Mr Lis view on global trade. After badly missing last years trade target (China had aimed for 6% growth, but both imports and exports contracted), the government opted against setting one this year. The external environment is beyond its control and it does not care to be embarrassed again.

Domestically, though, the government is still confident of its grip. As well as setting a GDP target for 2016, Mr Li confirmed a central objective of Chinas new five-year economic plan (to be approved during the parliamentary session, which lasts about ten days). It is that the economy will grow by an average of 6.5% between now and 2020. By that time, our economys size will have exceeded 90 trillion yuan, he said. Omniscience is a wonderful thing.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,Working nine to four,[],"IN THE eyes of many foreigners, two numbers encapsulate French economic policy over the past decade or so: 75 and 35. The first refers to the top income-tax rate of 75%, promised by Francois Hollande to seduce the left when he was the Socialist presidential candidate in 2012. The second is the 35-hour maximum working week, devised by a Socialist government in 2000 and later retained by the centre-right. Each has been a totem of French social preferences. Yet, to the consternation of some of his voters, Mr Hollande applied the 75% tax rate for only two years, and then binned it. Now he has drawn up plans that could, in effect, demolish the 35-hour week, too.

Mr Hollandes government is reviewing a draft labour law that would remove a series of constraints French firms face, both when trying to adapt working time to shifting business cycles and when deciding whether to hire staff. In particular, it devolves to firms the right to negotiate longer hours and overtime rates with their own trade unions, rather than having to follow rules dictated by national industry-wide deals. The 35-hour cap would remain in force, but it would become more of a trigger for overtime pay than a rigid constraint on hours worked. These could reach 46 hours a week, for a maximum of 16 weeks. Firms would also have greater freedom to shorten working hours and reduce pay, which can currently be done only in times of serious economic difficulty. Emmanuel Macron, the economy minister, has called such measures the de facto end of the 35-hour week.

At the same time, the law would lower existing high barriers to laying off workers. These discourage firms from creating permanent jobs, and leave huge numbers of outsiders, particularly young people, temping. For one thing, it would cap awards for unfair dismissal, which are made by labour tribunals. Laid-off French workers bring such cases frequently; they can take years and cost anything from 2,500 to 310,000 ($2,700 to $337,000) by one estimate.

The underlying principle, laid out in government-commissioned reports over the past six months, is simple and radical. The countrys ponderous labour code, currently longer than the Bible, should limit itself to basic protection of workers, and leave bosses and unions within firms to hammer out finer details. This is based on the belief that French employeesonly 8% of whom belong to a unionare more pragmatic and flexible than the national union leaders in Paris who supposedly negotiate on their behalf. At a car factory making Smart vehicles in eastern France, for instance, a recent deal to work 39 hours a week was approved by most employees, yet blocked by the firms unions. Under the new law, if no deal can be reached with a companys unions, employees may vote in a binding internal referendum.

The draft law does not deal with all the rigidities of the French labour code. Nonetheless, its the most important piece of labour-market legislation for 15 years, says Ludovic Subran, chief economist at Eurler Hermes, a credit-insurance firm. It is the closest France has got to the reformist Jobs Act rammed through in Italy by Matteo Renzis government. And it could be the legacy that Manuel Valls, the ambitious centre-left prime minister, seeks as he and Mr Macron try to steer the Socialists in a more market-friendly direction.

The great difficulty is political. For much of the left, the 35-hour week remains not only a badge of progress but the mark of a preference: for shorter hours, more holidays and higher productivityeven at the price of fewer jobs. French productivity per hour remains far higher than Britains and even a touch above Germanys (though yearly hours worked in France are lower, and the unemployment rate twice as high). In fact, the French already work more than 35 hours a week on average, partly because so many employees get extra holidays to compensate. White-collar employees at EDF, an energy firm, average 39 working hours a week, but until recently got 23 extra days off each year on top of the statutory five weeks holiday. (A hard-won deal has reduced this to a mere 16.) Managing so much absence has become an art. Employees prefer to work less, earn less and have more time, says Pierre Vauterin, who runs a firm that makes ball bearings on the outskirts of Paris.

Challenging this doctrine is becoming a stinging headache. Already, Mr Valls has postponed the presentation of his draft law to the cabinet, thanks to an uproar within his own party and the threat of street protests by unions and students. In a barbed article in Le Monde, Martine Aubry, mayor of Lille and architect of the 35-hour week, accused him of selling out socialist ideals. Who could imagine, she asked, that making redundancies easier...will encourage employment? Mr Hollande is enfeebled. Even Frances more moderate unionists are wary. If Mr Valls waters down the draft, his reformist credentials will be damaged. If he pushes ahead, he could find himself with a choice between unmanageable unrestor resignation.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,Allied landings,[],"BULLDOZERS and demolition teams moved into the migrant camp at the French port of Calais on February 29th, part of the latest attempt to resolve the problems that have plagued the port for years. Migrants breaking into lorries and rushing the rail tunnel to England have caused frequent delays to rail services, affecting schedules nearly every week last summer. Yet scenes of burning tents and migrants scaling fences have done little to dampen a little-expected commercial resurgence: for cross-channel ferry firms.

When the Channel Tunnel opened in 1994 between Folkestone and Calais, many thought that the speed and convenience of rail travel would put ferries out of business. In the late 1990s the tunnel and the advent of cut-price air fares hit the ferry market hard (see chart). But as new figures published last week show, ferry companies sailing to and from Dover, at least, have managed to stay afloat. They have even seen demand grow since 2012.

Operators believe that ferries will always have a role providing extra capacity. This is partly because it is still cheaper, on average, to cross the channel by boat than by train, says Torben Carlsen, chief financial officer at DFDS, a ferry company. The average price of taking a car with two passengers on the ferry from Kent to France is less than 50 ($70); the standard fare for taking the tunnel is 76. Many drivers do not like the shuttle services through the tunnel, either because they fear boarding the train will damage their vehicles or because it is less comfortable: the tunnel often gets very hot and there are no catering services onboard the trains.

P&O, DFDSs main rival on the route, has started to emphasise the comparative comfort of ferry travel in its advertising, trying to borrow the glamorous image of cruising for its more mundane voyages. This has also helped boost ancillary revenues. Although the end of duty-free shopping within the EU in 1999 cut profits from onboard shops, new revenue streams, including posher restaurants, Wi-Fi and business-lounge entry, have helped make up the difference.

Ferry firms have been hit by migrant problems, too. Immigrants have regularly tried to stow away in cars and lorries waiting to board ferries at Calais; in January dozens of them managed to storm the gangway onto P&Os Pride of Britain. The disruption led to the delay or cancellation of many sailings. Wildcat strikes by workers in Calais also contributed to a dip in ferry services last summer, as did the EUs decision to close down MyFerryLink, a service owned by Eurotunnel (which also owns the Channel Tunnel) for anti-competitive behaviour last July. The disruptions particularly affected cross-channel freight traffic, some of which was forced to use other ferry routes or air freight. However, the chaos in Calais failed to deter passengers from taking a boat to other destinations. Although numbers on the DoverCalais route fell by 800,000 in 2015, demand grew by a similar amount between Dover and Dunkirk.

Maintaining their market share helped ferry firms swing back into profit for the first time since the financial crisis. P&O made 13m in profit in 2015 after a loss of 10m the year before. DFDS broke even on its cross-channel routes for the first time ever, on the back of lower fuel costs and higher occupancy rates. Both firms are ramping up capacity in the expectation that clearance of the migrant camps will mean less disruption this summer, for both trains and boats. Two new ships have entered service with DFDS in February to meet the expected demand. It seems it will take more than a tunnel to put an end to Britains long-running ferry services.",[]
economist.com,2014-08-28 15:22:44,Choosing the right pin,[],"THE Swedish word bo means to live; sambo to cohabit. As more people struggle to get on the housing ladder, a new word has been coined: mambo, to live with your mum. After Oslo, Stockholm is Europes fastest growing capitalits population is expected to expand by 50% by 2030yet cranes are scarce. The 30,000 new arrivals each year have increased competition for housing, and record-low interest rates have allowed Stockholmers to afford bigger mortgages. As a result, Swedish house prices have more than trebled since 1996 and household debt has reached 174% of after-tax income. There is talk, naturally, of a bubble.

It is not just Sweden: in June the IMF called on policymakers to do more to curb housing prices around the world, pointing out that valuations looked high in many countries (see article). In May the European Central Bank singled out sky-high prices in Belgium, Finland and France; in July Moodys, a ratings agency, said that Britain showed signs of a new property bubble. The trend is all the more remarkable given that many of those economies have not fully recovered from the financial crisis and are growing feebly if at all.

After the collective pre-crisis boom, European housing markets took two paths. Denmark, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain dropped sharply; some continue to fall. Others including Belgium, Britain, Norway and Sweden only dipped before rebounding with worrying speed (see chart).

The ratio of house prices to rents is 65% above its historical average in Norway, 44% above it in Finland and 43% in Britain. Incomes are also failing to keep pace, with the price-to-income ratio 46% above its long-term average in Belgium and 27% in France. Things look even more outlandish in some cities. Apartment prices in Stockholm have risen 11% over the past year, after climbing 9% the year before; homes in London went up by 19%, thanks in part to foreign speculators.

Household debt is also hitting new records, as people take on bigger mortgages. In Norway, where the price of homes has risen fourfold since 1995, households now owe creditors two times their annual income after tax. Americans used to be far more indebted than Europeans. But Americans debt is now below 105% of income after tax, whereas that of euro-zone households is almost 110%. You cannot know youre in a bubble, but you can know that debt has moved too far, says Urban Backstrom, a former governor of the Riksbank, Swedens central bank. However, expectations that borrowing will stay cheap and not enough new homes will be built continue to push prices higher.

Central bankers cannot use interest rates to deflate the housing bubbles since, asset values aside, the economies of the countries concerned remain so sickly. Swedens attempt to cool the market with an increase in rates in 2010 backfired: unemployment stopped falling and the country headed towards deflation, forcing the Riksbank start reducing rates again in 2011. If anything, monetary policy is likely to provide a further spur to house prices in the euro zone, since the ECB is toying with the idea of buying bonds in an effort to bring borrowing costs down yet further.

Macroprudential tools, to discipline both banks and borrowers, are a subtler set of instruments. Setting stricter limits on the amount people can borrow relative to the purchase price (the loan-to-value ratio, or LTV) or to their household income (loan-to-income ratio) helps to curb buyers irrational exuberance; increasing the amount of capital that banks must hold against mortgages checks theirs.

The Netherlands has applied strict limits of this sort, with striking results. In 2011, with the euro crisis in full swing, the average new mortgage in the Netherlands was 112% of the propertys value, putting Dutch household debt among the highest in Europe. The authorities hastily introduced a host of restrictions: LTV was capped at 106% in 2012 and is due to fall to 100% by 2018; capital requirements for banks were raised immediately. The government is also gradually reducing the tax break for interest payments on mortgages. These changes, along with the economic downturn, were enough to push prices down 20% in three years in real terms (after accounting for inflation, that is).

In contrast, neighbouring Belgium, where house prices had moved in tandem with Dutch ones until 2010, has taken a hands-off approach. As a result, while Dutch house prices have plunged, Belgian ones have increased by 11%. Belgiums market is now so overpriced that its buyers are credited with helping revive prices in the south-eastern part of the Netherlands by moving over the border.

To make matters more difficult for policymakers, Europes property booms tend to be concentrated in capital cities, which are growing for the most part, even as other regions stagnate. Ireland provides an especially garish example. It is still full of ghostly developments of never-occupied houses. Yet in Dublin, which needs 8,000 new homes a year, fewer than 1,400 were built last year. That has helped to drive local house prices up by 23% over the past year, even as the property market in the rest of the country rose by a modest 5%.

In most growing European cities new construction is impeded by a thicket of planning restrictions, which could only be cut back with great political effort. The number of new homes completed in the European Union fell by a third between 2011 and 2013. Only three countries (Britain, Belgium and Germany) started building more homes last year than in the year before. In Paris the shortage of new homes is so acute that stories of illegal dwellings in cupboards and garages abound.

Some countries have come up with clever measures to whittle down their housing deficits. This month Britains central government launched a website that maps all its land and buildings, from offices to prisons, and invites the public to suggest better uses for them under a new right to contest. It has promised to release for sale any property whose current use it cannot justify. Another quick fix is to make it easier to convert unused offices and shops into houses.

Perhaps the most striking innovation has been in Sweden, which in July began letting landowners build tiny rental cottages in their gardens, without any need for planning permission. These Attefallshus (one of which is pictured on the previous page), can have a footprint of no more than 25 square metres and a height of no more than four metres. That is small, but it beats living with mum.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,The last refuge,[],"THE annual budget which Indias finance minister, Arun Jaitley, presented on February 29th would normally have been the big political event of the week. That is not how proceedings in Parliament in the ensuing days made it appear. Both chambers were disrupted by angry exchanges over issues close to the hearts of the more extreme Hindu-nationalist wing of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Yet again, an ugly strain of BJP politics is distracting attention from what was supposed to be the partys central agenda in power: ensuring rapid economic growth.

The partys own members provoked some of the most heated spats. This week two MPs from the BJP, including a junior minister, Ram Shankar Katheria, attended a rally in Agra, near Delhi, to commemorate a Hindu activist allegedly killed by Muslims. Inflammatory speeches at the rally called Muslims demons and warned them of a final battle. The two BJP men also spoke, leading to opposition calls for the ministers resignation. But he was unapologetic, saying that, although he had called on Hindus to unite for their own safety, and for the culprits to be executed, he himself had not named any community.

The opposition has also been attacking the minister of human resources, Smriti Irani, over her response to two recent incidents at universities. One was the suicide of a scholar at the University of Hyderabad, Rohith Vemula, who left a note that prompted national soul-searching about the discrimination he had suffered because of the fatal accident of his birth as a Dalit or untouchable, a Hindu at the bottom of the caste hierarchy. The second is the arrest for sedition of students at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, including the head of the student union, Kanhaiya Kumar. Their alleged crime had been to shout anti-national slogans at a protest marking the anniversary of the execution of Afzal Guru, a terrorist from Indian-ruled Kashmir.

The BJP has blown the incident up into one of national pride and patriotismespecially after opposition politicians came out in defence of the students. Demonstrations for and against the students have taken place in several cities. On February 27th Srinagar, the biggest city in the Kashmir valley, was paralysed by a strike in support of the students and of a Kashmiri professor also charged with sedition over an Afzal Guru commemoration.

A BJP politician decried the scruffy looks and licentiousness of left-leaning students at JNU, claiming that 2,000 bottles of booze and 3,000 used condoms are found on the campus each day. Since it only has about 7,000 students, that represents quite a feat, and the claim was greeted with derision. But other features of the case prompted justifiable outrage. It emerged that two of the seven videos incriminating the students had been doctored. Mr Kumar was badly beaten up in court by patriotic lawyers, who have as yet faced no serious consequences.

The damage to Indias image is painful. Faith in the police and other institutions has been undermined. Vigilante violence has seemed to win official backing. Street protests have proliferated; on March 2nd the police in Delhi used water cannon against protesters outside Parliament. This is not the outward-looking, investor-friendly image India hopes to project. And it threatens its liberal traditions of free speech. It is not just India-hating traitors who think that the trial of Afzal Guru was unfair and that his execution was used for political ends by the previous administration, led by the Congress party. The BJPs definition of sedition precludes almost any debate on the future of Kashmira source of tension within India and with Pakistan since independence.

All of this looks like bad news for Indias prime minister, Narendra Modi. Yet, beyond tweeting in support of a fiery speech by Ms Irani, his embattled human-resources minister, he has had little to say on the Rohith Vemula suicide and JNU furore. This follows a pattern: he rarely speaks out in ways that might alienate the BJPs hardliners. He needs them, as his most loyal foot soldiers in looming state elections, including one in West Bengal in May; and Mr Modi is probably already thinking about the next general election, due by 2019. With that in mind, and following failure in an election in the big state of Bihar last November, he and his advisers may calculate that whipping up a chorus of angry Indian nationalism serves them better than talking about touchy issues such as casteand better than promoting narrow Hindu causes such as protecting cows from beef-eating Muslims and Christians.

It also suits Mr Modis style, cultivated in his years as chief minister of the state of Gujarat, to portray himself as an outsider. He complains of plots by the press, NGOs, foreign meddlers and political pundits to destabilise his government. Despite leading Indias first single-party majority government in many years, he still governs as if he is waging an opposition campaign, with big rallies, catchy slogans and a sense of victimhood.

Hopes that Mr Modi would implement radical economic policies were clearly misplaced. He campaigned in 2014 less as a reformer than as a man who got things done. But ruling India has proved much harder than running Gujarat, and he is constrained by the lack of a majority in Parliaments upper house. So the optimism of his election campaign, when he sought to represent the aspirational new urban middle classes, has been dented.

Mother tricolour

For all that India is the worlds fastest-growing big economy, to many Indians that is not how it feels. It is not creating enough jobs for its swelling workforce. The fresh spending in this weeks budget was aimed not at the middle classes but at the poor in the countryside, the voters whom Congress has long wooed. Last October Arun Shourie, a writer and minister in a former BJP administration, mocked Mr Modis government as Congress plus a cow. This weeks budget and political battles suggest things have moved on. It has become Congress plus a flag.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,Back in court,[],"IN THEIR four-decade fight against Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court ruling of 1973 that recognised a right to abortion, pro-lifers have taken several tacks. One is to curtail the period during which women may end their pregnancies. Another is to ban particularly grisly-sounding techniques like partial-birth abortion. Recently, opponents of Roe have been waging a regulatory war of attrition that makes abortion harder and harder to obtain. On March 2nd, a Supreme Court diminished by the loss of Antonin Scalia, the conservative justice who died in February, asked whether a law of 2013 that, in effect, shuts down more than three-quarters of the 40-odd abortion clinics in Texas runs foul of a 1992 precedent prohibiting states from unduly imposing on a womans right to choose.

Under the law, abortion providers in Texas must have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and clinics must be expensively fitted out as ambulatory surgical centres. Legislators pitch the requirements as a boon to maternal health; detractors decry them as onerous, unwarranted changes that often leave women with nowhere to turn.

Scott Keller, the Texas solicitor-general, insisted that legislators had womens best interests at heart. But he faced a barrage of resistance from the courts energised liberal jurists. The first salvo came from Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 83 this month. She jumped on Mr Kellers suggestion that the new law left 25% of Texas women more than 100 miles from the nearest abortion clinic, not including El Paso, where the Santa Teresa, New Mexico facility is just a few minutes drive away. Justice Ginsburg noted that New Mexico law does not require surgical standards or admitting privileges. Doesnt Texas say that we need these things [...] to protect our women? Mr Keller repeated that women in El Paso often use the facility to obtain abortions.

Justice Stephen Breyer probed the laws justification. Go back in time to the period before the new law was passed, he said. Where in the record will I find evidence of women who had complications stemming from their abortions and could not get to a hospital under the previous regime but would have made it to a hospital under the new law? Mr Keller looked defeated. He grew meeker still when pressed by the three female justices to explain why Texas fretted so about abortion, one of the safest medical procedures, while failing to insist on surgical facilities for far riskier ones, like colonoscopies.

Despite the fun the liberal justices had with Mr Keller, Texas may not lose Whole Womans Health v Hellerstedt when a ruling arrives in June. It would take five justices to overturn the decision upholding the Texas law, and Anthony Kennedy did not seem keen to be the decisive vote. Though he noted that the law served to increase the number of surgical procedures as opposed to medical procedures, and that this may not be medically wise, he wondered whether the plaintiffs had presented enough evidence that fewer clinics led to a crisis of abortion supply.

A 4-4 split would let the Texas law stand, and allow other states in the Fifth Circuit to swipe at abortion access in similar ways (as Louisiana is already doing). But it would not bind the rest of the country. As the US solicitor-general, Donald Verrilli, neatly summed it up before the justices, the question boils down to whether the right to abortion really only exists in theory or in fact, going forward.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,Know your enemy,[],"AT 17, Eric Brown had flown only once before: on his fathers lap in a one-seater Gloster biplane, when he was eight. This time the biplane was a Bucker Jungmann two-seater, and the pilot strapped him in with particular care. Nice of him, he thought. Minutes later, the aircraft was somersaulting like a performing flea: for the pilot was Ernst Udet, a German flying ace of the first world war. He clapped Eric heartily on the shoulder as he stumbled out and roared Hals und Beinbruch! Broken neck, broken legs, but youre alive!

The old fighter pilots motto summed up Captain Browns career. In the course of it he flew 487 different types of aircraft, most of them prototypes. He changed planes so often that he kept a loose-leaf folder, meticulously handwritten, of all the different cockpit layouts, hydraulics and emergency drills, to try to keep on top of things. Many of these craft he operated on aircraft-carriers; he clocked up 2,407 carrier landings and 2,721 take-offs, both world records. He tested the earliest helicopters, jets and rocket-powered machines. His working life took him from the wood-and-canvas craft in which he started with the Fleet Air Arm, to overseeing training on the nuclear strike force at Lossiemouth in the 1960s. The rising arc of power and accuracy was so steep that it astonished him.

He faced his own demise on a regular basis. His de Havilland 108 once started oscillating so fast that he was blacking out, and just saved himself by pulling both sticks in time. His jet-powered flying-boat crashed into debris off Cowes and trapped him under water; others got him out. In a Tempest V his propeller froze in mid-flight and the engine caught fire. As a Scot, short on words but not confidence, he tended to react with a calm joke or two: Lets sort this out, he would say to himself. This time, with his feet slow-roasting, he jumped. The slipstream was so strong that he had to catapult himself clear, landing in a duckpond. In short, accidents were ten a penny. He survived for two reasons: he was careful, and he was small. Small enough to curl up in a cockpit, rather than get his legs sheared off. Hence Winkle.

In a glamorous trade he cut a neat, practical figure, but there was no lack of dash. He flew Spitfires into the black heart of cumulonimbus clouds to discover why aircraft often emerged from them in bits. He crash-landed aircraft without undercarriages, to see if that was a good idea. On aircraft-carriers he had to contend with too-short flight decks, pitching seas, failing to hook on the arrester wires or crashing into the barrier. He was such a dab hand, though, that he sometimes came in sideways, crab-wise, without a batsman, to glide to a perfect stop. And then he would wander off grinning. When he made the first-ever jet-aircraft landing on the carrier Ocean, screaming down in his favourite Vampire in December 1945, it was just such touch-down perfection, though the sea was so high that he had been ordered not to attempt it. Well, he wasnt going to let the Americans do it first.

A bump on landing

All through the war the Germans kept one step ahead with aviation technology. As each new threat appeared, he had to work out how to counter it. On the aircraft-carrier Audacity in the north Atlantic in 1941 he was pitting fiery, beautiful little Martlets against Focke-Wulf Kurier bombers; he found the only way to dispatch them was to go for them head-on, shattering the windscreen to kill the pilots. When V1 flying bombs appeared he discovered that, by overtaking very close in a Tempest V, he could clip their wings with his own and send them plunging into the Channel.

It struck him as strange that his lifes obsession had become to beat the Germans. That jaunt with Udet had sealed his passion for flying (though he already loved speed, and was the only boy at Edinburgh Royal High to ride a Norton 500cc motorbike). Udet had also inspired him to learn German and to teach there for a while. He admired the Germans for their industry and ingenuity. A colossal amount of both had been poured into fighter aviation.

At the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough after the war he studied and flew many of these experimental machines. German experts helped him. In France he worked with them to fix and fly the Dornier 335, the fastest piston-engine aircraft. He searched for, and found, the top-secret Me 262, the worlds first operational jet fighter, so swift and with such a punch that he felt untouchable. He also test-flew the suicidally dangerous Me 163B, powered with rocket fuel so volatile that a bump on landing could explode the plane; its design became the basis of craft that could attempt supersonic flight. Having tried all these, and survived, he was the natural choice to train a new generation of German test pilots in the late 1950s.

In those years he came across Luftwaffe aces whom, as a boy, he would have idolised. Having seen the walking dead of Bergen-Belsen, he was not about to repeat that mistake. But his job could be summed up as Know the enemy and in a way he had indeed come to know them, in that fellowship of death-defying souls. So when in 1945 he went to interrogate Hermann Goering, and at the end the ex-Reichsmarschall made to shake hands, Winkle cried instead Hals und Beinbruch! And they both tentatively smiled.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,"Goodbye, Rubio Tuesday",[],"TWO of the most loathed politicians in America won big on March 1st in the electoral smorgasbord that is Super Tuesday. Hillary Clinton won seven of the eleven states holding Democratic primaries or caucuses, including Massachusetts, Virginia and a clutch of other Southern states, such as Arkansas, Georgia and Tennessee. Donald Trump also won seven of eleven, carving a trail from Vermont to Arkansas that has caused yet more apoplexy among the Republican top brass. Though it is not yet certain that Mrs Clinton and Mr Trump will fight it out for the presidency in November, it is probable.

The symmetry between the despised front-runners is alarming. Mrs Clinton is mistrusted by 60% of Americans, a legacy of years of scandals and Republican slander. It is possible, though unlikely, that the Democratic front-runner could yet be indicted by the FBI over her allegedly slapdash handling of classified information while secretary of state. Mr Trump, more extremely, is disliked by 60% of Americans, especially non-whites, a contempt he has earned by pandering to white Americans ugliest prejudices.

When announcing his candidacy last year, he described Mexican immigrants as rapists. In the run-up to Super Tuesday, American media were dominated by a furore over his initial refusal to condemn the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), whose former Grand Wizard, David Duke, supports him. A Trump rally in Virginia on February 29th was mobbed by a line of hand-holding black activists, who were herded out by Secret-Service officers and a jeering white crowd. One of the officers manhandled a photographer for Time magazine. With Mrs Clinton and Mr Trump as the nominees, America, which is as repulsed by political mudslinging as it is ghoulishly drawn to it, can expect an extraordinarily ill-tempered and divisive election in November.

Mrs Clintons dominance on Super Tuesday, despite four victories for her rival, Bernie Sanders, in his own state of Vermont, in Oklahoma, Colorado and Minnesota, was based on her crushing lead among non-whites. This had been expected. Mrs Clinton trounced Mr Sanders in South Carolina on February 27th by winning over 85% of the black voters who make up over half the states Democratic electorate. That was a bigger share than Barack Obama had won in 2008, when campaigning to become Americas first black president. It indicated that Mrs Clintons vaunted Southern firewall against Mr Sanders was intact. It is the berm that has stopped the Bern.

Across the Super Tuesday states, Mrs Clinton won 83% of blacks and 67% of Hispanics. She also did better than previously with white women, winning 57% of their votes. Im very emotional because today Im going to vote for a woman, which I find empowering, said one, Laney Parrot, a teacher entering a polling station in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Mr Sanderss victories, though impressive for a candidate who launched his campaign last year in front of a few friends, were in smaller states and mostly by smaller margins.

They were also exclusively in states where blacks, who deliver around a quarter of the Democratic vote, represent less than 10% of the population. That is a guarantee of failure, as Mr Sanders tacitly acknowledged in a speech delivered on friendly Vermont soil. Effecting a political revolution had always been his main aim, the septuagenarian senator said; winning the nomination was a lesser concern. Absent an unlikely collapse, Mrs Clinton has the Democratic nomination in the bag. She leads Mr Sanders by around 200 delegates, excluding her massive lead among super-delegates, the Democratic officers whose votes will count at the partys convention in July. Given that the Democratic delegates are shared out in proportion to the votes won in primaries and caucuses, this leaves Mr Sanderss needing an improbable run of thumping majorities to catch up.

Mr Trumps wins were based on a now-familiar double whammy: a crowded Republican field, in which his more conventional rivals took bites out of each others vote, combined with his knack of tapping the anti-establishment rage evident across the Republican coalition. This looks likely to produce one of the most disliked and unpropitious candidacies in American political history. At polling stations in northern and western Virginia, conservative country, your correspondent was told by many that they had voted for the lesser evil, not for you know who, that they knew who they hadnt voted for.

Yet about one in three said they had voted for Mr Trump: Because politicians are liars, and he isnt one; because hes a businessman, and thats what the country needs to get straightened out; because hes funding his own campaign, and his rivals are on the take. Because theres no political mumbo jumbo with him and hes going to stop everybody, Syria, Iraq, you name it, treating us like a doormat, said Eileen, a teacher, working herself into a fury on a sunny afternoon in Culpeper County, one of the prettiest, most law-abiding, luckiest places on Earth. She also reckoned Mr Trump was the best man to beat the Democrats, of whom she said shed never met one she liked; though her daughter, Melissa, standing smiling besides her, had just voted for Mr Sanders.

Mr Trump won Virginia, an important swing state in general elections, with 35% of the vote. Exit polls suggested a staggering 54% of Republican voters in the state were unhappy with the prospect of having him as their nomineea pattern repeated in every state he won. Altogether he won about 40% of the available 595 delegates, who were also divvied up on a proportional basis. This gives him 319 delegates in all, which represents a less decisive lead than Mrs Clintons, but a strong one. It is above the level Nate Silver, a revered pundit, had predicted Mr Trump would need to be on track to win an outright majority of Republican delegates ahead of the partys convention.

His main rivals, the senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, are well below their comparable benchmarks, with 226 and 110 delegates. Yet both did just well enough on Super Tuesday to justify staying in the contestwhich should ensure that both Mr Trumps big advantages endure through a run of delegate-rich primaries, including in Florida, Illinois and Ohio on March 15th, where the winner will take all.

Mr Cruz won his state of Texas and neighbouring Oklahoma, which was probably better than he had expected. But it was much less than the Southern sweep his strategy of appealing to evangelicals and the very conservative was designed to deliver. In his victory speech, delivered at the Redneck Country Club (where else?) in Houston, Mr Cruz derided Mr Trump as a Washington dealmaker, profane and vulgar, and appealed to his partys patricians, who mostly despise both men, to back him as the likeliest anti-Trump candidate. There are signs that some see sense in that. Lindsey Graham, a veteran senator and failed presidential candidate who had previously described a choice between Mr Cruz and Mr Trump as akin to one between being poisoned or shot, suggested it might be time to choose poison. Mr Cruz received another fillip on March 2nd, when Ben Carson, a former neurosurgeon with a Christian following, who has long been cluttering the Republican field, suggested he was about to quit. Yet with the Bible-belt having largely voted, the going could get tougher for Mr Cruz.

That is why, for those Republicans who do not wish to gift their party to a protectionist rabble-rouser, Mr Rubios Super Tuesday results were so shattering. Mr Rubios advisers had suggested he could win four states. He won only Minnesota, whose experience of Jesse Ventura, a professional wrestler who was the states governor for four years until 2003, was cited by many as a reason not to pick Mr Trump, a former WrestleMania star himself.

In the days beforehand, the senator from Florida took Mr Trump apart in a televised debate, then ridiculed him on the campaign as a con artist, who quite possibly wet his trousers and whose fondness for fake tan promised to make America orange again. It made Mr Rubio look talented and immature, which are the two things unenthusiatic Republicans thought they knew about him already. Mr Trump countered by pulling in a couple of heavyweight endorsementsincluding from Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey and former Republican candidatewhich made Mr Rubio look even more juvenile. He could be a good president one day, but now hes copying Trump, said Chuck Mullens, a plumber in Culpeper County, as he left the polling station without voting, having disliked everyone on the ballot.

Mr Rubios path to the nomination now looks vanishingly tight. If he fails to win Florida, where he is trailing Mr Trump by 20 percentage points, he is toast. Much the same is true for John Kasich, the governor of Ohio and fourth somewhat-serious Republican candidate. He has not won a state, though he ran Mr Trump close in Vermont; he must win Ohio, where he is also trailing Mr Trump, to survive. He is meanwhile damaging Mr Rubios dwindling prospects. Had he stepped down before Super Tuesday and his votes gone to Mr Rubio, as most would have, the Floridian would have won Virginia and Vermont.

That would have made him look more credible. It would not have prevented Mr Trump being the big winner on a day in which his appeal stretched from hard-upSoutherners to well-heeled New England moderates, via the Washington D.C. commuter belt of northern Virginiaanother place Mr Rubio had hoped to flourish.

That is why a belated effort by members of the Republican elite, who will now launch a flurry of attack ads against Mr Trump, appears so pathetic. They are trying to save their party from a man who is having great success by identifying them as its biggest problem. In a victory speech delivered in the opulent setting of his seaside pile in Florida (advertised on its website as the greatest mansion ever built), Mr Trump tried slightly to allay his partys concerns. Describing himself as a unifier, he said he expected to get along famously with Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, who had criticised his soft-peddling on the KKK. And if I dont, Mr Trump added, Hes going to have to pay a big price.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,"Turkey cracks down on Zaman, an opposition newspaper",[],"LATE ON March 4th, amid a volley of rubber bullets, clouds of tear gas and water cannons, Turkish police stormed the headquarters of Zaman, a daily newspaper, clearing the way for its takeover by a panel of court-appointed trustees. The constitution has been suspended, the papers front page mournfully proclaimed on Saturday morning. The next day, its first under new management, the cover featured a photo of a smiling Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president; a story about an upcoming Womens Day reception at his $615m presidential palace; and news of the construction of a new bridge over the Bosporus strait. Overnight, a staunchly critical newspaper with the highest circulation in Turkey appeared to have become a government mouthpiece.

The takeover came at an awkward time for European leaders, who met Ahmet Davutoglu, the prime minister of Turkey, on March 7th to discuss the migration crisis in Europe. As the talks stretched from lunch into the evening, they seemed to be on the brink of a deal that would see Turkey accept thousands of illegal migrants back from Greece in exchange for an additional 3 billion ($3.3 billion) in aid, visa-free travel to Europe and progress in deadlocked membership talks with the EU. But many queried how European leaders could be striking a deal with a country that appears to have little regard for freedom of its press, let alone a strong human-rights record. A spokeperson for Angela Merkel insisted that the German chancellor had brought up the topic with Mr Davutoglu, while Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French foreign minister, spoke out against the deal in a radio interview.

A generous interpretation might see the violent takeover of Zaman as merely the latest blow in an increasingly lopsided argument between the Gulen community, the religious movement that managed Zaman, and the Justice and Development Party (AKP), which has run the country for nearly two decades. Having worked together for much of the 2000s, the two began to turn on each other about four years ago, largely over the Gulenists opposition to secret peace talks between Kurdish insurgents and Turkish spymasters. The government has since declared the Gulenists a threat to national security and vowed to eradicate them from public life. It seized a leading Islamic bank and shut down schools run by the movements followers. Last autumn, the government took over Bugun, another of the movements newspapers.

In fact, the takeover of Zaman is part of a much wider crackdown on dissent. In January this year, prosecutors placed more than 1,000 academics under investigation for petitioning the government to end armed operations against Kurdish insurgents in the south-eastern part of Turkey. Parliament has been asked to strip five leading members of the pro-Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party (HDP) of their immunity. Scores of journalists have been sacked for criticising government policy. In January a local reporter was shot in the leg in Cizre, a southeastern town, by police while filming clashes that have since reduced parts of the city to rubble.

Mr Erdogan remains as thin-skinned as ever: according to the governments own tally, 1,845 cases have been opened against people accused of insulting him since August 2014. In February, when Turkeys constitutional court ordered the release of two journalists, Can Dundar and Erdem Gul, arrested three months earlier on espionage charges, Mr Erdogan, who had earlier vowed to make the journalists pay a heavy price for exposing state secrets, pledged to ignore the court ruling. I dont obey or respect the decision, he said.

In normal countries, the president is there to ask people to obey the law, says the newly-freed Mr Dundar. But in Turkey its the people who have to ask the president to do so, he says. Both Mr Dundar and and Mr Gul continue to face the possibility of a life sentence. European leaders, desperate to enlist Turkeys help in tackling the migrant crisis, may find themselves biting their tongues. For the time being, they are merely holding their noses.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,Passive voice,[],"MANY prophets of information technology (IT) believe that the next big movement in their field will be the internet of things. This, they hope, will connect objects hitherto beyond the reach of ITs tendrils so that, for example, your sofa can buzz your phone to tell you that you have left your wallet behind, or your refrigerator can order your groceries without you having to make a shopping list. That, though, will mean putting chips in your sofa, your wallet and your fridge to enable them to talk to the rest of the world. And those chips will need power, not least to run their communications.

Sometimes, this power will come from the electricity grid or a battery. But that is not always convenient. However Shyam Gollakota and his colleagues at the University of Washington, in Seattle, think they have at least part of an answer to the problem. They propose to reconfigure a chips communications so that they need almost no power to work.

Most conceptions of the internet of things assume the chips in sofas, wallets, fridges and so on will use technologies such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to communicate with each othereither directly, over short ranges, or via a base-station connected to the outside world, over longer ones. For a conventional chip to broadcast a Wi-Fi signal requires two things. First, it must generate a narrow-band carrier wave. Then, it must impress upon this wave a digital signal that a receiver can interpret. Following Moores law, the components responsible for doing the impressing have become ever more efficient over the past couple of decades. Those generating the carrier wave, however, have not.

Dr Gollakota and his team reasoned that it should be possible to separate the jobs of generation and impression. The system they have designed has a central transmitter (which might be built into a Wi-Fi router) that broadcasts a pure carrier wave. Dr Gollakotas new chips then impress binary data on this carrier wave by either reflecting it (for a one) or absorbing it (for a zero). Whether a chip reflects or absorbs the signal depends on whether or not its aerial is earthed, which is in turn controlled by a simple switch.

Not having to generate its own carrier wave reduces a chips power consumption ten-thousandfold, for throwing the switch requires only a minuscule amount of current. Moreover, though Dr Gollakotas prototypes do still use batteries, this current could instead be extracted from the part of the carrier wave that is absorbed.

The chips in this system, which Dr Gollakota plans to unveil on March 17th at the USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation in Santa Clara, California can, he claims, transmit data at a rate of up to 11 megabits a second to smartphones or laptops over 30 metres (100 feet) away, and through walls. Though that rate is worse than standard Wi-Fi it is ten times better than the low-energy form of Bluetooth which is the current favourite for the internet of things.

Dr Gollakota has helped found a company, Jeeva Wireless, to commercialise his research and he predicts that passive Wi-Fi chips, as he calls them, will be in production in less than two years. Eventually, he hopes, the idea behind his systemof generating carrier waves centrallymight be adapted for use in mobile phones. That would mean base stations providing a carrier wave, and phone users making calls, sending text messages and connecting to the internet without constantly having to recharge their handsets.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,An Olympic oasis,[],"BACK in 2009 when the Olympic games were awarded to Rio de Janeiro, the stars seemed to be aligned. Brazil was prospering, thanks to strong global demand for its oil, iron ore, soya beans and other commodities. Federal, state and city governments were working well together as close political allies. Now cariocas (as inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro are known) might well feel that fate has forsaken them.

The country is suffering its worst recession since the 1930s. The federal government is paralysed by a corruption scandal. The unpopular president, Dilma Rousseff, faces possible impeachment for allegedly breaking budget rules. The collapse of the oil price has hit Rio de Janeiro state, the centre of the oil industry, especially hard, forcing it to slash its budgets.

Yet the city of Rio resembles an oasis in Brazils political and economic desert. Thanks partly to the games and to booming revenue from tourism, the money is still flowing. Eduardo Paes, the citys mayor since 2009, seized control of venue construction and many transport projects. While stadium-building for the 2014 football World Cup in Brazil was marked by scandal and last-minute rush, the Olympics are on track with five months to go. At the Olympic Park, the venues are all but ready. When Bello visited a fortnight ago a hose was filling the pool at the aquatic centre; at the multipurpose Arena Carioca, a taekwondo contest was about to start.

There are three worries. The state government has failed to clean up the polluted waters of Guanabara Bay, the venue for yachting. Mr Paes retorts that races will be held at the bays mouth, where the water is clean, and that two dummy runs went well. Then there is the new metro line being built by the state government to link Ipanema and Barra de Tijuca, the site of the Olympic Park. A recent leaked memo from the mayors office fretted that it wouldnt be ready in time. The state government insists it will be; it says 90% of the work is already done. School holidays have been moved back to coincide with the Olympics; traffic may be more of a problem for the Paralympics in September.

The biggest concern is Zika. Since the disease was detected in 2015, 1.5m Brazilians may have caught it. Usually it just involves a few days of mild fever and aches. But it has been linked to microcephaly (brain damage) in the babies of a small minority of women who caught it while pregnant. And a tiny number of Zika sufferers develop Guillain-Barre syndrome, a creeping (though normally reversible) paralysis.

Zika is hard to test for. Most of Brazils 641 confirmed cases of microcephaly are in the poor north-east. But Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that is the main vector, is also responsible for dengue, which Rio has suffered since 1977. The insects breed in stagnant water.

Across the country, the government has stepped up efforts to control the mosquito. In Gardenia Azul, a favela near the Olympic Park, a team of health agents does house-to-house visits. Geraldo Marques, a mosquito-control specialist, checks that empty beer bottles are dry and covered; he drizzles insecticide into a drain. The saucers under plants are the greatest villain, he says.

The problem, says Rubem Cesar Fernandes of Viva Rio, a big NGO which, among other things, runs health clinics for the city government, is that many urban spaces are beyond public control. The population knows what to do, but they dont have the discipline to do it every week. Its a cultural thing. It doesnt help that a third of dwellings in the Rio area lack a proper sewerage connection.

Mr Paes stresses that the games will take place in the dry season; cases of dengue normally drop in August and September. Part of the worry about Zika is that so much about it is unknown, and therefore scary. Though pregnant women and their sexual partners will need to seek medical advice, for the mass of sports fans the virus should not be a worry.

There is already much to celebrate about the Rio Olympics, though with their city turned into an obstacle course of road works for the new metro and bus lanes, cariocas may not yet feel like cheering. There has been no obvious waste or corruption. The city has used the games as a catalyst for a wider transformation. Mr Paes tore down an elevated motorway that scarred the old port, burying it in a tunnel. The port area now hosts new museums and public spaces; next month a tramway will open there. Apart from better public transport, the Olympics may bequeath an overdue revival of Rios decayed and crime-ridden historic centre. If urban renewal were a sport, that would win a gold medal.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,Border babies v the IRS,[],"WHEN Barack Obama vowed in 2009 to pursue tax cheats abroad, he probably was not thinking of people like Ginny Hillis. Born in Detroit to Canadian parents, the retired lawyer has lived in Canada since she was six. Like many transplanted Americans, she ignored an American law that since 1913 has obliged citizens to file tax returns regardless of where they live.

With the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), enacted in 2010, that became harder. It demanded that foreign banks report to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) details of accounts held by Americans abroad. Banks that fail to comply are subject to a 30% tax on payments they receive from the United States. Some 7m Americans outside the country (1m of them in Canada), along with an unknown number of US persons, are now caught in FATCAs net.

Unlike most, Ms Hillis is fighting back through the courts. She and Gwen Deegan, an artist who has lived in Canada since she was five, filed a suit claiming that the Canadian governments co-operation with FATCA violates a tax treaty and constitutional protections against discrimination. In September a judge denied the first claim. The second, that Canada is discriminating against citizens on the basis of their place of birth, may rest on stronger arguments.

Among the reluctant dual-taxpayers are Americans who dodged the draft during the Vietnam war, academics who went north in 1950-70 and border babies, born in the United States because that is where the nearest hospital was. Half a million snowbirds, pensioners who winter in the American South, risk liability for tax. Their biggest gripe: proceeds from the sale of a family home, untaxed in Canada, could be subject to capital-gains tax in the United States. A record 4,279 Americans worldwide renounced their United States citizenship last year.

If Ms Hillis and Ms Deegan win in court, Canadas government will face an awkward choice between complying with the decision and exposing Canadian banks to huge penalties. The Alliance for the Defence of Canadian Sovereignty, which is paying the womens legal expenses, has harvested donations from China, Vatican City and beyond. If FATCA falls Ms Hillis would still owe American tax. The real problem is the extraterritorial demands of the IRS.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,The medium is the messengers,[],"TO SOME, Facebook, Twitter and similar social-media platforms are the acme of communicationbetter, even, than face-to-face conversations, since more people can be involved. Others think of them more as acne, a rash that fosters narcissism, threatens privacy and reduces intelligent discourse to the exchange of flippant memes. They might even, these kinds of arguments go, be creating a generation of electronic addicts who are incapable of reflective, individual, original thought.

A topic ripe for anthropological study, then. And such a study, the Why We Post project, has just been published by nine anthropologists, led by Daniel Miller of University College, London.

The participants in Why We Post worked independently for 15 months at locations in Brazil, Britain, Chile, China (one rural and one industrial site), India, Italy, Trinidad and Tobago, and Turkey. They embedded themselves within families and their surrounding communities. That, the team believes, let them form a nuanced view of the roles of social media in their study sites which could not be gained by analysing participants public postings.

These fly-on-the-wall perspectives refute much received wisdom. One of the sceptics biggest betes noires is the selfiewhich is often blamed for fostering self-regard and an undue focus on attractiveness. Why We Post, however, reveals that the selfie itself has many faces. In Italy girls were indeed seen to take dozens of pictures of themselves before settling on one to post. In Brazil many selfies posted by men were taken at the gym. But at the British site, Dr Miller found, schoolchildren posted five times as many groupies (images of the picture-taker with friends) as they did selfies. Britons have also created a category called uglies, wherein the purpose is to take as unflattering a self-portrait as possible. And in Chile another unique genre has developed: the footie. This is a shot taken of the users propped-up feet, a sign of relaxation.

The often-humorous, marked-up images known as memes have also come in for criticism. They debase traditional forms of public debate, lament some, spreading far and wide with little context. But memes serve different purposes in different cultures. In India they tend to focus on serious and religious issues; Trinidadian memes are more often send-ups of politicians. Yet in all cases Dr Miller sees meme-passing not as limiting what social-media users think and say, but as enabling discourse. Many users happily forward memes laced with strong ideological messages about which they would not dare to comment individually.

Critics also often view the online personae people create for their social-media postings as false fronts designed for the medium at hand. Trinidadians, however, disagree. They see online profiles as more representative of a persons true self even than what is seen in real life. And, though the perceived loss through social media of the anonymity that once characterised online life causes much hand-wringing in the West, young boys and girls in Turkey see things differently. Social media permit them to be in constant contact with one another, in full view of their parents, but to keep their conversations and photos to themselves.

In rural China and Turkey social media were viewed as a distraction from education. But in industrial China and Brazil they were seen to be an educational resource. Such a divide was evident in India, too. There, high-income families regarded them with suspicion but low-income families advocated them as a supplementary source of schooling. In Britain, meanwhile, they were valued not directly as a means of education, but as a way for pupils, parents and teachers to communicate.

Why We Post thus challenges the idea that the adoption of social media follows a single and predictable trajectory. Indeed, the Chinese sites show that the use of such media can vary from place to place within a single country. The study also refutes the idea that social media are making humans any less human. Users are, in Dr Millers words, merely attaining something that was latent in human beings.

The sceptics reaction to new technology seems equally deep-rooted. New means of communication from railways and the telegraph onwards have always attracted critics. Sooner or later, the doubters either convert, or die. The adopters, meanwhile, chatter on until the next wave of disruption happens, an advance that some of them will reject as unnecessary and possibly dangerous flummery.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,"Follow the money, if you can",[],"IT WAS a striking move from a country better known for hiding iffy foreign wealth than for exposing it. Frustrated by a lack of co-operation from Malaysian counterparts, Switzerlands attorney-general declared in late January that there were serious indications that $4 billion had gone astray from Malaysian state concerns, some of it into accounts held by current or former Malaysian and Middle Eastern officials. The announcement fuelled an already combustible scandal that has transfixed Malaysians, battered their prime minister, Najib Razak, and could yet ensnare banks around the world.

The allegations of misappropriation centre on a Malaysian state investment fund, from which it is suspected that large sums were siphoned by businessmen and officials with links to Mr Najib. It is thought that some of this was used to help his party win an election in 2013; some was spent on buying assets at questionable prices; and some of the remainder was moved to offshore shell companies and bank accounts. All those suspected of involvement, including Mr Najib, deny wrongdoing. None has been charged with a crime.

The affair spans the globe. Caught up in it are not only Malaysian officials and moneymen but also several big banks and perhaps Saudi royalty. The money trail leads from Malaysia to Singapore and elsewhere in Asia, Abu Dhabi, Switzerland, the Caribbean and New York. Authorities are investigating in Switzerland, America, Singapore, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates. They face a daunting challenge in piecing together such a complex case, a task made harder by operators widespread use of opaque offshore vehicles.

The storys institutional protagonist is 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). It was originally a regional development fund for Terengganu, an oil-rich Malaysian state, but in 2009 the countrys finance ministry took it over and rebranded it. Mr Najib heads the ministry, as well as being prime minister. The plan was for the fund to suck in investment through tie-ups with foreign firms. Mr Najib chairs 1MDBs board of advisers.

1MDB got most of its financing by raising debt. A series of bond issues pushed its borrowings up to $11 billion. By 2014 questions were multiplying about its financial health, spurred by the fact that it had had three audit firms in five years. A flurry of investigations in the media drew on leaked documents. 1MDB denies wrongdoing.

Malaysian investigators concluded that deposits into a bank account held in Mr Najibs name came through banks and companies linked to 1MDB. They found that a firm that was once part of 1MDB and is now controlled by the finance ministry, SRC International, paid $13m into the account in 2014-15. The attorney-general, Mohamed Apandi Ali, has said that there is no evidence that Mr Najib was aware of the payment. (We all overlook items on our bank statements.)

More eye-catching was an earlier payment into Mr Najibs account, of $681m, from a shell company. This was made only weeks before the general election in 2013, which Mr Najib won narrowly. Some say it was linked to 1MDB. The official explanation is that it was a legal donation from an unnamed member of the Saudi royal family. Mr Najib has denied ever taking public money for personal gain. 1MDB says it has not paid any funds into the prime ministers personal accounts.

On March 1st the Wall Street Journal reported that investigators in two countries, whom it didnt identify, believe that more than $1 billion in total flowed into Mr Najibs personal accounts, much of it originating from 1MDB. These investigators, it is alleged, reckon that the payments were, in part, routed through a company linked toor made to look as if it was linked toa venture involving 1MDB and Middle Eastern interests.

1MDB had various dealings with an Abu Dhabi-based sovereign fund called IPIC which guaranteed some of 1MDBs bonds. The dealings included a tie-up with Aabar Investments PJS, an IPIC subsidiary. 1MDB transferred more than $1 billion to what appeared to be a division of Aabar. Yet investigations allegedly suggest the money in fact went to a firm based in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) with an almost identical name to the Abu Dhabi concern.

This transaction seems not to have been recorded on the books of Aabars parent, IPIC. (1MDB says it stands by its own accounts, which show the payment.) The suspicion is that financial sleight-of-hand may have been used to pass off the transfers as legitimate payments between corporate partners. Investigators believe much of this money ended up in Mr Najibs accounts after being routed through a second company in the BVI, according to sources cited by the Wall Street Journal.

IPIC is reported to be looking into what happened to the money paid out by 1MDB but not booked as coming into the Abu Dhabi fund. Aabar denies wrongdoing.

Also in the spotlight is a joint venture between 1MDB and PetroSaudi, an oil firm. 1MDB injected $1 billion into the venture. Two-thirds of this was moved to a Seychelles-based firm shortly afterwards, according to a draft report by Malaysias auditor-general. 1MDB later sold its interest in the venture, using some of the $2.3 billion raised to invest in a Cayman-based vehicle. 1MDB then reportedly sacked its auditor, KPMG, after the firm expressed concern over the identity and financial standing of the vehicles owners. 1MDB asserts that all the Cayman money is accounted for. PetroSaudi has denied doing anything wrong.

Investigators are also looking into who drove 1MDBs complex transactions. Assuming it is genuine, correspondence obtained by Sarawak Report, an investigative website, appears to show that a key figure in the funds dealings with PetroSaudi was a Malaysian financier, Low Taek Jho, a family friend of Mr Najib. Mr Low reportedly also helped direct some election spending for Mr Najibs ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional. 1MDB and Mr Low have insisted he merely advised the fund, unpaid. He denies wrongdoing.

Banks, too, face awkward questions. Several global banks handled large payments that are under scrutiny, among them arms of JPMorgan Chase and Royal Bank of Scotland. One question is whether there were grounds for the banks to suspect that any of the transactions were questionableor whether especially rigorous checks on public officials and other politically exposed persons, or PEPs, were called for and carried out.

The role played by Goldman Sachs is also notable. The investment bank led 1MDBs main bond issues, earning unusually high fees on them (Goldman has said this is because it temporarily held the risk on its own balance-sheet). Goldmans chairman for South-East Asia, Tim Leissner, grew close to Malaysias elite. Last year Goldman put him on leave and now says he has left the firm.

Mr Najibs response to the scandal has been to swipe at his critics. Muhyiddin Yassin, a deputy prime minister who wanted investigations stepped up, was sacked from the cabinet last year, and the attorney-general was replacedsupposedly on health grounds, though Sarawak Report has published documents appearing to show that charges were about to be brought against Mr Najib.

On February 27th Mr Muhyiddin called for the prime minister to resign, saying the outgoing attorney-general had shown him proof that Mr Najib acted criminally in connection with 1MDB. The government said this was part of a politically motivated conspiracy to topple Mr Najib.

The new attorney-general, Mr Apandi, has moved swiftly to exonerate Mr Najib, closing a probe into the $681m donation and asserting that it had nothing to do with 1MDB. The government says that most of the money was sent back to the donor after the election. Why, some ask, was so much of the payment returned if it was legal?

Not all Malaysias institutions have been supine. Last year the central bank urged the attorney-general to begin a criminal prosecution of 1MDB managers after concluding that the fund had moved $1.8 billion overseas based on inaccurate disclosures. This money was supposed to go to the PetroSaudi joint venture and related loans. Instead, much of it went elsewhere and is unaccounted for, according to the auditor-generals draft report. (The final report was supposed to be released last December, but has twice been delayed.) The central bank requested a review of the finding by Mr Apandi that 1MDB did not commit any offences. This was rejected.

Malaysias anti-corruption commission, an independent agency, investigated the payments into Mr Najibs account and handed its findings to Mr Apandi late last year. He returned them to the commission in January, requesting more information. The commission has denied reports, based on unauthorised briefings, that it recommended charging Mr Najib.

It was the haste with which Mr Apandi ruled out criminality that prompted the sharper tone from the Swiss authorities, who are investigating suspected bribery, corruption, misconduct in public office and money-laundering linked to 1MDB. They appear to be unimpressed with the blanket exoneration, though they say Mr Najib is not a suspect.

Through a brass plate, darkly

Singapore is also investigating suspected money-laundering and says it has frozen a large number of bank accounts. The case is a test of the city-states resolve in dealing with financial crime. Like Hong Kong, it has seen big inflows of wealth in recent years, including money of dubious provenance from Switzerland.

But the sleuths face many hurdles. The corporate secrecy offered by offshore centres makes the task of penetrating structures used to move money slow and difficult. The OECD and others have begun to try to lift this shroud, but transparency reforms are at an early stage.

Then there is the complex and clunky international system of mutual legal assistance, or MLA, under which countries ask each other for help in investigations. Piecing together the jigsaw is all the harder if the country at the centre of the probe is unhelpful. Malaysia has said it will assist the Swiss, but that looks unlikely. Indeed, it is using blocking tactics, for instance by telling Switzerland to file its MLA request through Malaysias foreign ministry. That is unusual: such requests would more typically go through the justice ministry, which is viewed abroad as less political.

Malaysian officials reacted angrily to Switzerlands announcement about misappropriation, accusing it of spreading misinformation. When the Swiss and Malaysian attorneys-general met last year, the Malaysians are believed to have said they would arrange for those caught up in the affair to provide testimony in depositions, but this has not happened. Without Malaysian help, it will be hard for foreign sleuths to complete their probes. For now, though, they seem determined to keep digging, causing anxiety in the Malaysian capital, parts of the Middle East, and some of the worlds largest financial centres.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,A rust-belt revival,[],"IN 1984 Ronald Reagan ran a re-election ad on the theme of Its Morning Again in America. Todays presidential hopefuls ought to run a follow-up called Its Almost Midnight. Donald Trump laments the loss of Americas greatness. Bernie Sanders says the country is being wrecked by greedy businesspeople. Americas leading intellectuals are equally gloomy. Charles Murray, a conservative, says that America is coming apart; and George Packer, a liberal, agrees that it is unwinding.

Mercifully, not everyone is a doom-monger. In his annual letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, on February 26th, Warren Buffett noted that for 240 years its been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start. The March issue of the Atlantic magazine has a cover story by James Fallows on How America is putting itself back together. The author undertook a three-year journey across the country in a single-engine plane and saw signs of reinvention and renewal wherever he wentand not just in trendy tech hubs. A new book by Antoine van Agtmael, who coined the phrase emerging markets, and Fred Bakker, a Dutch journalist, called The Smartest Places on Earth, argues that the rust belts of the rich world, especially in America, are becoming hotspots of innovation.

Boosterism is as American as apple pie. But this time the boosters can point to some hard data. The Kauffman Index of Startup Activity, which measures business creation, had its biggest increase in 2015 for two decades. Bruce Katz of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, reckons that Americas 50 most research- and technology-intensive industries have added nearly 1m jobs since 2010. These industries are disproportionately based in cities and, since they pay high wages, have a galvanising effect on local economies. Three powerful forces are breathing life into bits of America that had looked as if they were permanently left behind.

First, old industrial skills are acquiring new relevance thanks to such things as advances in materials science. As Messrs Van Agtmael and Bakker note, Akron, in Ohio, has capitalised on its heritage as home to Americas four biggest tyremakers by turning itself into Americas capital city of polymers. The University of Akrons Polymer Training Centre houses 120 academics and 700 graduate students. Companies such as Akron Polymer Systems and Akron Surface Technologies are inventing new ways to commercialise synthetic materials. North Carolina has done the same for textiles. Its state university is home to the Nonwovens Institute, which does research on textiles that can resist heat and chemicals, including ones used in weapons.

Second, old industrial towns are realising that they have a vital asset: cheap property. Disused mills and warehouses, with their high ceilings and exposed bricks and beams, can make attractive homes and workspaces for knowledge workers. In Watervliet, New York, firms such as Cleveland Polymer Technologies occupy space in an old US Army arsenal. In Manchester, New Hampshire, the old and once-crumbling riverside mill district now buzzes with knowledge businesses and fancy restaurants.

The hunt for Lebensraum is driving young entrepreneurs to explore the neglected peripheries of big cities, such as Bostons South Side (Southie), Seattles South Lake Union Area and San Franciscos twin city of Oakland. Some entrepreneurs are cutting the cord completely and swapping broom-cupboard-sized premises by the Bay for mansions in flyover territory. Mr Fallows also found older industries reviving in out-of-the-way places, such as in north-eastern Mississippi, where a steel mini-mill was expanding and a $300m new tyre factory was opening.

The third trend combines elements of the first two: the rise of manufacturing entrepreneurs. Startups are beginning to transform manufacturing just as they transformed service industries like taxi-hailing and short-term room lets. New techniques such as 3D printing, combined with a rapid decline in the cost of computing power, are making it easier for small firms to compete with big ones. Crowdfunding sources such as Kickstarter are making it easier for them to raise capital. And big companies such as GE are trying to crowdsource innovation by providing small manufacturing firms with space and seed-money. Exponents of this hardware renaissance frequently locate themselves in old industrial towns such as Pittsburgh and Detroit, in part because there is lots of cheap space available and in part because they can draw on established manufacturing skills.

Formidable problems, formidable resources

There are plenty of reasons to be sceptical about rust-belt revivalism. The overall number of jobs in manufacturing has been declining for decades, and is set to continue falling as automation keeps advancing. Brain-intensive manufacturing will not provide many jobs for high-school dropouts. Such rebirths have been heralded in the past, only to come to nothing. The rate of business creation is still 50% lower than it was in the 1980s.

Still, Americas old industrial cities have formidable resources as well as formidable problems. Akron and North Carolina point to one of the countrys strengths: it has first-rate universities almost everywhere. GE built a factory for jet-engine parts in out-of-the-way Batesville, Mississippi, largely because Mississippi State University is a centre of expertise in the new materials needed for them. Americas success in software also gives it a huge advantage in a world in which ever more software is being embedded into hardware, be it cars or smart watches. American firms also enjoy much cheaper energy than their European and Asian rivals, thanks in large part to an American innovation, fracking.

It is too early to remake Reagans Its Morning Again ad. But it is time for Americans to recognise that, for all its troubles, their country has not lost the ability to remake and revitalise itself. As Hillary Clinton put it, America has never stopped being great. Messrs Trump, Sanders et al should take note.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,The Najib effect,[],"ONE of South-East Asias richest and hitherto most stable countries, Malaysia ought to be a beacon. Its constitution is liberal, and its brand of Islam generally tolerant. Its diverse, English-speaking population, combining ethnic Malays, Chinese and Indians, gives it zest and vim. Yet under the prime minister, Najib Razak, the country is regressing at alarming speed. Its politics stinks (see article), its economy is in trouble, and there are worrying signs that the government is not above stirring up ethnic and religious divisions.

For the past year allegations of corruption have swirled around Mr Najib. They centre around hundreds of millions of dollars that made their way into his bank accounts before the most recent general election, in 2013 (see article). Investigators are looking into whether the money is linked to a troubled state investment firm, 1MDB, whose advisory board Mr Najib chairs. He denies wrongdoing. His attorney-general has ruled that the money was a legal donation from an unnamed Saudi royal, and that much of it has been returned.

For Malaysians, the precise nature of what happened is not the main point. Mr Najib presented himself as a liberal out to remake the sleazy system of money politics by which the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) has held power since independence. He was to open up a crony economy. And he was to do away with repressive colonial-era laws, such as that for sedition.

Now Mr Najibs credibility is in tatters. Facing inquiries around 1MDB, he has engineered the retirement of a pesky police chief, replaced an attorney-general and promoted members of an inquisitive parliamentary committee into the cabinet, where they can do less harm. Far from loosening colonial laws, the government is wielding the sedition law with new zeal. It is blocking news websites and hounding opponents (the opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, is in prison on charges of sodomy). Even yellow T-shirts have been outlawed since citizens protesting against corruption took to wearing them. The more Mr Najib cracks down, the more he alienates those who were once inclined to support him.

Foreign investors and others should be worried. The government is floundering in its responses to a sharp slowdown in the economy and to a falling currency. Cheap oil has hurt Malaysia, but its wretched politics will hold it back more in the long run. The government is now using dog-whistle politics to appeal to its ethnic-Malay, Muslim base, and is refusing to distance itself sufficiently from Islamists seeking the introduction of harsh sharia punishments. Pro-government bigots in the street have told ethnic-Chinese Malaysians to go back to China. This is dangerous. Malaysia has seen race riots before, and could see them again. Nearby Singapore, with its different mix of the same ethnic groups, should also be alarmed.

1 Massive Development Balls-up

Malaysias problems run deep. UMNO is out of ideas and seems incapable of rejuvenating itself. The fractured, rudderless opposition does not have the winning combination to overcome UMNOs gerrymandering and harassment. And the next election is anyway still two years away. Restoring confidence will be tricky. But for as long as Malaysia is governed in the style of Mr Najib, ordinary Malaysians will suffer and their country will be deprived of the standing that it surely deserves in the world.",[]

High ho silver lining

I was disappointed by The right way to do drugs (February 13th). It didnt go far enough in calling for cannabis to be legalised. There is no lethal dose of cannabis, though there are lethal doses of the government-approved alternatives to cannabis. Getting users off deadly alcohol, say, and towards cannabis will save lives. Marijuana should be as cheap and as accessible as possible. Taxing and restricting it will not fix the problem. There is a functional black market and it is not going to end just because the government sort of legalised pot.

DAN KING

In my experience a cost calculation drives the preference among occasional users for higher THC content in cannabis. Only one or two tokes are required to give occasional users the desired high, so a little weed goes a lot further. It follows that, to the extent there is price sensitivity, higher prices and taxes would have the perverse effect of pushing your 80% of occasional users towards inhaling more smoke.

The calculus for the 20% who are heavy users is different. There is an intensity factor. Even though heavy users may be high for longer, they are not nearly as high as the occasional user. They do indeed prefer higher THC content, just to achieve any effect at all. So in their case higher prices and taxes would encourage the continuation of a black market.

Anchors away (February 20th) submitted that it is no coincidence that the three anchors who left their TV programmes in Japan are robust critics of the government, implying the government had intervened in their leaving. However, Yoshihide Suga, the chief cabinet secretary, clearly stated at a press conference on February 9th that freedom of the press and editorial rights must be guaranteed.

Small but mighty

Lexington noted that if no presidential candidate gets 270 electoral-college votes, the contest is decided by the House of Representatives, which will be Republican-held (February 20th). However, in such a circumstance each state gets only one vote in the House, regardless of how many representatives are elected from that state. Presumably, Texas would vote Republican and California would vote Democrat. But numerous smaller states would have an equal weight with the more populous ones.

Mix it up

It is true: diversity undermines trust (Schumpeter, February 13th). But this may be its greatest gift. When ethnically different others are present, people tend to remain cautious, scrutinise information and reach better decisions. Our research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that ethnically diverse markets are significantly less likely to bubble compared with homogenous ones. The results held for North America and South-East Asia, notwithstanding the differences in culture, history and ethnic composition.

In homogenous markets, we reason, trust in other peoples reasonableness can cause erroneous beliefs to spread more readily. Diversity makes you better precisely because it makes you less trusting.

Divide and choose?

I read Bagehots fascinating article on the divergent views of the European Union from people in Cambridge and Peterborough (February 20th). This divergence has little to do with nativism or nationalism or even class. It is a pertinent fact that because of its role as a centre for agriculture, food processing, packaging and logistics, Peterborough has borne a heavy burden in respect of unskilled immigration from the EU: more than 30,000 new migrants from 2004 to 2011. This puts huge pressure on public services, and has arguably kept wages low and entrenched welfare dependency among many indigenous and low-skilled workers.

Business, and the Treasury, have reaped the economic benefit of this large-scale migration, but local taxpayers have footed the bill and seen the pressures consequent in this unprecedented demographic change. Local people cant have helped noticing, and are canny enough to understand the role of the EU Free Movement Directive.

People in Peterborough have seen the cost of unrestricted immigration and, as a result, are more conscious than most of the benefits or otherwise of Britains membership of the EU. Is it any wonder that they are more sceptical?

STEWART JACKSON

Member of Parliament for Peterborough

I am not sure about Bagehots educational-cultural divide over Europe. The Brexit referendum has not come about because of an outcry across the land by ordinary folk or because public opinion has been consistently against EU membership, or because people are calling for an immediate exit. We are having a referendum because of a battle within the educational and political elite. It is symptomatic of the division within the Tory Party, not within the country, yet at least.

However, with in campaigners like Jeremy Corbyn ranting something along the lines of Workers of the EU, unite!, the divisions could get very real, very soon.

Double entendres

Johnson, ruminating on the secret meaning of feisty (February 13th) would have done well to have provided a whiff, as it were, of etymology. In Mark Forsyths marvellous book, The Etymologicon, and largely corroborated by the Oxford English Dictionary, feisty, in the sense of spirited, is derived from fist or feist, meaning a small dog. This in turn comes from the phrase a fisting hound, where to fist means to fart.

economist.com,2016-01-09 00:00:00,After the dips,[],"MIGHT Made in Russia labels become common? If currency depreciation alone could boost exports, then yes. According to our latest Big Mac index, the Russian rouble is one of the cheapest currencies around, 69% undervalued against the dollar. The index compares the cost of the famous burger at McDonalds outlets in different countries by converting local prices into dollars using market exchange rates (as of January 6th, see chart 1). It is based on the idea that in the long-run, exchange rates ought to adjust so that one dollar buys the same amount everywhere. If a burger looks like a bargain in one currency, that currency could be undervalued.

Americans hunting for cut-price burgers abroad are spoilt for choice: the index shows most currencies to be cheap relative to the greenback. This is partly owing to the Federal Reserves decision to raise interest rates when the central banks of the euro zone and Japan are loosening monetary policy. The euro is 19% undervalued against the dollar, according to the index, and the yen 37%. Another force weakening many currencies, including the rouble, has been the ongoing slump in commodity prices since mid-2014. Shrinking demand from China and a glut of supply have sapped the value of exports from Australia, Brazil and Canada, among other places, causing their currencies to wilt, too. By the index, they are respectively 24%, 32% and 16% undervalued. If commodity prices continue to fall, they could slide even further.

These large currency devaluations can hurt, by raising the price of imports and spurring inflation. But although devaluations may not be pleasant, they are meant to be nutritious. Pricier imports should encourage consumers to switch towards domestic products and stimulate local production. A cheaper currency should also boost growth by spurring exports.

Between 1980 and 2014, according to an analysis of 60 economies by the IMF, a 10% depreciation relative to the currencies of trading partners boosted net exports by 1.5% of GDP over the long term, on average. Most of the improvement came within the first year.

But devaluations do not seem to have provided quite the same boost recently. Japan is the best example. The yen has been depreciating rapidly. A Big Mac was 20% cheaper in Japan than in America in 2013; now it is 37% cheaper. Yet export volumes have barely budged (see chart 2). This is a surprise: the IMF calculates that Japanese exports are around 20% lower than it would have expected, given how the yen has weakened. Devaluations in other countries, including South Africa and Turkey, have also disappointed.

A global contraction of trade in dollar terms may be obscuring devaluations benefits. Although exports from countries with weakening currencies may look limp, many of them are still securing a bigger slice of the shrinking pie. The collapse in commodity prices is also masking some signs of life. Take Brazil, where the volume of exports rose by 10% in 2015 even as their value plunged by 22%. Some of that is caused by commodity exporters compensating for falling revenue by selling ever more minerals and oil. But not all of it. In Australia, for instance, exports of goods other than raw materials jumped by around 6% in mid-2015, according to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

But there are also signs that Dutch disease has taken a toll on the capacity of commodity-producing countries to ramp up other exports. When prices were high, capital flowed in, pushing up their currencies and thus making their other exports less competitive. Labour and investment flowed mainly to commodity firms. That has left other industries too weak to pick up the slack now that these once-soaring currencies have fallen back to earth.

Russia is a good example. Non-energy exporters appear to be struggling despite the roubles plunge. Over the first half of 2015, as the volume of energy exports surged, non-energy exports fell, according to Birgit Hansl of the World Bank. She points out that it is not enough to have a price change: First you have to produce something that someone wants to buy. The roubles weakness is an opportunity for industries that already export, such as chemicals and fertiliser. But boosting other exports requires investment in new production, which takes time.

Both the IMF and the World Bank have highlighted another possible explanation for the weak performance of exports in countries with falling currencies: the prevalence of global supply chains. Globalisation has turned lots of countries into way-stations in the manufacture of individual products. Components are imported, augmented and re-exported. This means that much of what a country gains through a devaluation in terms of the competitiveness of its exports, it loses through pricier imports. The IMF thinks this accounts for much of the sluggishness of Japans exports; the World Bank argues that it explains about 40% of the diminished impact of devaluations globally. That leaves many manufacturing economies in a pickle.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-08 05:00:00,American jets kill 150 al-Shabab fighters,[],"IT HAS been a bad start to 2016 for Somalia. This was meant to be the year when peace would at last begin to take hold in a country which has not known it for a quarter of a century. An election would finally create a functional government and al-Shabab, a jihadist group allied to al-Qaeda, which has plagued the country for years, would be knocked back; or so hoped the international diplomats who fill up Mogadishu's airport.

It does not appear to be working out like that. An American air strike, launched on March 5th, which may have killed as many as 150 fighters, was a serious blow to the militants. But it also underlined how confident the fighters had become.

Related topics Kenya

Somalia

Parts of Somalia have been occupied by troops from its neighbours since 2006, when Ethiopia invaded. Since 2007, this has become a formal, UN-mandated African Union mission of roughly 22,000 soldiers. The idea is that African troops, paid for by western donors, provide stability while Somalis negotiate peace. This is meant to culminate in elections to create a permanent government this year.

Yet over the past three months or so, al-Shabab have struck several blows against the government and AU forces. In late January, a base manned by Kenyan troops in the south-west of the country was overrun by militants. Perhaps hundreds of soldiers were killed (Kenya has refused to release a number, but the Somali president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, has said that 180 died). A few days later, an attack on a Mogadishu beach-front restaurant left 20 dead. Then in early February, a bomb exploded on board an aeroplane as it took off from the city's airport, almost causing it to crash.

The American air strike was targeted at al-Shabab fighters planning another such attack, according to the Pentagon. The militants had massed together for what officials described as a ""graduation ceremony"", and were hit with bombs dropped from fighter jets, which flew several passes. It was the largest American air strike in Somalia in recent yearsbefore now, American attacks have mostly used drones, not jets, and have targeted leaders rather than foot soldiers.

The strike probably does not signal a dramatic change in America's policy towards Somalia, reckons Matt Bryden, a Nairobi-based analyst who was part of the UN's Somalia and Eritrea Monitoring Group until 2012. Rather, it is ""a reaction to al-Shabab stepping up its own operations"": in the past, the fighters rarely concentrated troops into such a compelling target. Western attempts to bolster Somalia's security have grown. Britain has deployed 70 troops to help train Somali security forces, whose troops it also pays stipends to.

Yet that will not help much if political divisions are not fixed, says Mr Bryden. And though negotiations continueusually in expensive hotels in places like Istanbulthey have not got far. Politicians from Somalia's four main tribes and its 10 new federal states still cannot agree on how to elect parliament or a president. Those from Somaliland, a region in the north which declared independence in 1991 (though no country recognises it), have no interest in the debates at all. And so Somalia's government will stay weak and al-Shabab will continue to attack, American air strikes or not.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,Still a mans world,[],"IT IS still common to see headlines announcing the first woman to occupy some important post or other. Asako Suzuki has just been appointed the first female board member at Honda, a Japanese carmaker. In January the Irish central bank appointed its first female deputy governor. And of course Hillary Clinton could become Americas first female president. But such milestones may not be much of a guide to the opportunities women have to make progress in the workplace.

So, in 2013, we created a glass-ceiling index, ranking countries by how good it is to be a working woman in each of them, to be published each year to mark International Womens Day (March 8th). Our index now covers 29 countries; our website has a full, interactive version of the adjacent chart. Besides taking into account such things as womens access to higher education, their labour-force participation, pay, business-school applications, representation in senior management and the cost of child care, this year we have added a new indicator: as well as measuring maternity-leave rights, we now include paternity leave.

Studies show that where new fathers take parental leave, mothers tend to return to the labour market, female employment is higher and the earnings gap between men and women is lower. Among countries in the OECD, a group mostly of rich countries, paid leave for new daddies generally remains short, averaging just eight weeks. Nine countries, America included, offer them none. Although they fare poorly on a number of other indicators, Japan and South Korea now offer the longest paternity leave in the OECD. In those two countries, fathers (and mothers) are entitled to more than 50 weeks paid leave.

Under Japans latest change to the law, in 2010, new mothers and fathers have 14 months from the birth in which to take up to a years paid leave, as long as they both take it. The idea is that men have the same career gap as women, and the career slippage among women of childbearing age is reduced. But cultures are hard to change, and so far the uptake has been low.

Depending on nationality, new parents take home very different proportions of their usual pay while on leave. Turkey and Spain, for example, both offer 16 weeks maternity leave, but in Spain new mothers receive 100% of salary whereas in Turkey it is just 66%. Our index takes this into account: it includes a full-rate equivalent leave entitlement for Turkey of 10.6 weeks, to reflect the pay difference.

Unsurprisingly, the Nordic countriesIceland (a newcomer to our index), Norway, Sweden and Finlandcome out top overall. In these countries, women are present in the labour force at similar rates to men. Finland has the largest share of women who have gone through higher education compared with men (49% of women have a tertiary degree, and 35% of men). Norways gender wage-gap (6.3%) is less than half the OECD average (15.5%).

Women have 44% of seats on listed-company boards in Iceland; strong representation in Scandinavian boardrooms is common thanks to quotas. Norway and Iceland also have voluntary political-party quotas, as does Sweden where 44% of parliamentary seats are occupied by women, one of the highest rates in the world. Hungary ranks fifth, having the lowest gender wage gap, of 3.8%. Despite having few women on boards (11%) and in parliament (10%), Hungary has generous paid leave for mothers (71 weeks at 100% of recent pay) and low child-care costs.

At the bottom of the ranking are Japan, Turkey and South Korea, where men are more likely than women to have degrees, to be in the workplace and to hold senior positions. Their pay gap is also wide. In Japan and South Korea the favourable parental-leave system is mainly a response to their ageing populations and shrinking labour forces; but in other respects they are far behind the Nordic countries, whose commitment to sexual equality goes back a long way.

Even among better-ranked countries though, there is room for improvement. On average, across the OECD women are more likely to have a degree than men, but they are still less likely to be in the labour force and are paid significantly less. This is partly because of career choices (boys tend to choose things like engineering and computing; girls go for education, health care and welfare). But much of the difference also comes from child-bearing. Although the share of women on listed-company boards has increased since last year by 2.5 percentage points to 18.5%, women still hold less than a third of positions in senior management (a pipeline for board membership). Those that are in the higher echelons of management, according to the UNs International Labour Organisation, are clustered in specific areas: human resources, public relations and communications management, and finance and administration.

Although American firms have fewer women on boards than European ones, according to MSCI, a financial-data firm, they are more likely to have a female CEO or chief financial officerthe top jobs that bring headlines. But MSCI also found that of the rich-world listed companies where the CEO is a woman, 58% had at least three others on their board. This suggests that once one woman breaks through the glass ceiling, others find it easier to follow.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-09 15:02:08,One ring to fool them all?: The twisting tale of Joan of Arcs ring,[],"A MODEST, 15th-century silver ring for which an ambitious London dealer might ask 1,000 sold for an astonishing 297,000 at TimeLine Auctions on February 25th, a world auction record for a medieval European ring. There could not be a better example of the degree to which a stellar provenance affects the market value of an object: It was suggested, with the aid of documents sold with the ring, that the original owner of Lot 1220 was Joan of Arc, who led the French army against English invaders, a martyr and patron saint of France.

The high bidder was Puy du Fou, a history theme-park in central France created by Phillipe de Villiers. French media erupted in exclamation marks. Honour is saved! The ring is coming home! Hearts may swell and eyes tear; facts, however, remain. Or, perhaps, it is more accurate to say, an insufficiency of facts. There is a scarcity of the sort of archival evidencewills, inventories, letters, diary entriesthat scholars need to produce a solid provenance. And yet the conviction that Lot 1220 was Joans has taken hold. It is a tale in which politics, mistaken identity, passion, hope and mystery all play a part.

Joan was tried for heresy, found guilty and burned at the stake in 1431. During the interrogation which preceded this, in response to questions from Bishop Cauchon, the Maid of Orleans said that she had had two rings. The one given to her by her parents was by this time in the possession of the Burgundians, England's allies, who had caught her. On it were the names of Jesus and Mary and also, she thought, there were three crosses. The other ring, given to her by her brother, is not described. That wasnt necessary, after all, since it was in the possession of her interrogators. After her death, that ring passed from Bishop Cauchon to the English Cardinal Henry Beaufort, who had been present at her execution. During the 500 years that followed there are no contemporary records of Joan of Arcs rings.

This changed in the early 20th centurya time when interest in Joan and her achievements, rekindled in the 19th century, was high; she was beatified in 1909. Lady Ottoline Morrell, a British aristocrat and a frequent hostess of the Bloomsbury group of writers, had a silver medieval ring she thought might have belonged to Joan. In time she gave it to Augustus John, a painter, who sold it in 1914. The first published association of the ring with Joan was three years later. Its then owner, F.A.H. Oates, included an illustration of it in the privately printed catalogue of his collection. It is the same ring as Lot 1220. Thirty years later, James Hasson, who owned it, commissioned a genealogy that traced Lady Ottolines ancestry back to Cardinal Beaufort. The name of the person in each generation who would have owned the ring was highlighted. Dr Hasson was reassured by this of the rings authenticity. The museums in France to which he loaned it seemed to agree. It was displayed as having been Joan of Arcs. And yet a family tree by itself is not a widely accepted provenance. It might have been; it could have been; this does not mean it was. The new owner of Lot 1220 evidently was not deterred by this.

Nicolas de Villiers, son of Puy du Fou's founder and president of the theme-park today, concedes that the attribution is hard to believe. However, he was convinced that the ring is Joan's after a telephone conversation with Jacques Tremolet de Villers, a lawyer, monarchist and author whose works include an account of Joan of Arc's trial. During the call, which took place only days before the sale, Mr Tremolet pressed him to buy the ring which he said matched Joan's ""precise"" description of itthe three crosses and all. After hearing this, and acting on ""instinct"", Nicolas de Villiers decided to go for it. A 36hour canvas of his rich friends produced the war chest for his successful bid. On March 20th, Joan of Arc's ring, the prize, will be unveiled to the public at the park. Or will it?

There is no reason to believe that the ring with Jesus and Mary and the crosses that Joan described to Bishop Cauchon is the one he handed over to Cardinal Beaufort. There is no description to identify it. Well then, did the ring already possessed by the Burgundians, about which nothing more was recorded, suddenly reappear in the 20th centuryeffectively out of nowhereand land in the jewellery box of Ottoline Morrell? No one can prove that it did not, of course. But neither has anyone proven that it did. What can be said is that some believe that it matches Joans description of her ring, closely, and that it is unique. Others, however, including the specialists consulted by this reporter, do not agree.

""I have yet to talk to a museum curator, an art dealer or an independent scholar who believes that the association with Jeanne d'Arc dates back to her lifetime,"" says Sandra Hindman, a medievalist, professor emerita at Northwestern University and dealer in medieval art and rings. ""I personally believe that the attribution of the auctioned ring was part of the Jeanne d'Arc mania that begins in the 19th century and continues until about the mid-20th century."" Her opinion was echoed by the other experts consulted by this reporter.

The attention given to the sale of Lot 1220 has brought international publicity to the auction house, which has posted a new video about it; its cataloguing of the ring as associated with the one given to Joan by her parents and later owned by Cardinal Beaufort remains unchanged. The theme-park has been widely publicised too. The vendor got far more for Lot 1220 than he expected. France bubbles with national pride, and may become even more joyful on hearing that the vanquished, next-highest bidder was Berganza, an English dealer. Politically, too, the ring is providing a boost: Joan of Arc is a particularly potent symbol for right-wing parties.

Indeed, some centrist and left-leaning Frenchmen feel that the Maid of Orleans, heroine of their schooldays, has been hijacked by the right. Every year on May 1st, the xenophobic and populist National Front gathers at her statue in Paris. Marine le Pen, its leader, tweeted ""Thank you to @PhdeVilliers for bringing Joan of Arc's ring back to French soil."" Was this a generous move, or a pre-emptive one? Philippe de Villiers is a leader of the Movement for France, a smaller rival to the National Front. Now his family appears to have won Joan of Arc for his followers. There is talk of national fundraising campaign to build a chapel at the theme park to house its precious relic. Whatever their politics, its millions of visitors will be awed. For many, it would seem, this tale has a happy endingbut not for all.",[]
economist.com,2016-01-23 00:00:00,The collaboration curse,[],"IN MODERN business, collaboration is next to godliness. Firms shove their staff into open-plan offices to encourage serendipitous encounters. Managers oblige their underlings to add new collaborative tools such as Slack and Chatter to existing ones such as e-mail and telephones. Management thinkers urge workers to be good corporate citizens and help each other out all the time.

The fashion for collaboration makes some sense. The point of organisations is that people can achieve things collectively that they cannot achieve individually. Talking to your colleagues can spark valuable insights. Mixing with people from different departments can be useful. But this hardly justifies forcing people to share large noisy spaces or bombarding them with electronic messages. Oddly, the cult of collaboration has reached its apogee in the very arena where the value of uninterrupted concentration is at its height: knowledge work. Open-plan offices have become near-ubiquitous in knowledge-intensive companies. Facebook has built what is said to be the worlds biggest such open space, of 430,000 square feet (40,000 square metres), for its workers.

Hitherto, knowledge workers have largely suffered in silence or grumbled in private because their chances of promotion have come to be influenced by their willingness to collaborate. But a backlash is setting in: the current Harvard Business Review (HBR) has a cover story on collaborative overload; and Cal Newport of Georgetown University has just brought out a book called Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World.

A growing body of academic evidence demonstrates just how serious the problem is. Gloria Mark of the University of California, Irvine, discovered that interruptions, even short ones, increase the total time required to complete a task by a significant amount. A succession of studies have shown that multitasking reduces the quality of work as well as dragging it out. Sophie Leroy, formerly of the University of Minnesota (now at the University of Washington Bothell) has added an interesting twist to this argument: jumping rapidly from one task to another also reduces efficiency because of something she calls attention residue. The mind continues to think about the old task even as it jumps to a new one.

A second objection is that, whereas managers may notice the benefits of collaboration, they fail to measure its costs. Rob Cross and Peter Gray of the University of Virginias business school estimate that knowledge workers spend 70-85% of their time attending meetings (virtual or face-to-face), dealing with e-mail, talking on the phone or otherwise dealing with an avalanche of requests for input or advice. Many employees are spending so much time interacting that they have to do much of their work when they get home at night. Tom Cochran, a former chief technology officer of Atlantic Media, calculated that the midsized firm was spending more than $1m a year on processing e-mails, with each one costing on average around 95 cents in labour costs. A free and frictionless method of communication, he notes, has soft costs equivalent to procuring a small company Learjet.

Mark Bolino of the University of Oklahoma points to a hidden cost of collaboration. Some employees are such enthusiastic collaborators that they are asked to weigh in on every issue. But it does not take long for top collaborators to become bottlenecks: nothing happens until they have had their sayand they have their say on lots of subjects that are outside their competence.

The biggest problem with collaboration is that it makes what Mr Newport calls deep work difficult, if not impossible. Deep work is the killer app of the knowledge economy: it is only by concentrating intensely that you can master a difficult discipline or solve a demanding problem. Many of the most productive knowledge workers go out of their way to avoid meetings and unplug electronic distractions. Peter Drucker, a management thinker, argued that you can do real work or go to meetings but you cannot do both. Jonathan Franzen, an author, unplugs from the internet when he is writing. Donald Knuth, a computer scientist, refuses to use e-mail on the ground that his job is to be on the bottom of things rather than on top of things. Richard Feynman, a legendary physicist, extolled the virtues of active irresponsibility when it came to taking part in academic meetings.

What gets measured...

Why have organisations been so naive about collaboration? One reason is that collaboration is much easier to measure than deep work: any fool can record how many people post messages on Slack or speak up in meetings, whereas it can take years to discover whether somebody who is sitting alone in an office is producing a breakthrough or twiddling his thumbs. The more junior the knowledge worker is, the more likely he is to spend his time doing things that are easy to measure rather than engaging in more demanding but nebulous work. A second reason is that managers often feel obliged to be seen to manage: left to their own devices they automatically fill everybodys days with meetings and memos rather than letting them get on with their work.

What can be done to restore balance in a world gone collaboration-mad? Few people have the freedom of a Franzen or a Feynman to unplug themselves from the world. But employeesparticularly young onesneed to recognise the long-term costs of working in a constant state of distraction. The HBR article points out that there is an overlap of only 50% between the top collaborative contributors in any organisation and those individuals deemed to be the top performers. About 20% of company stars keep themselves to themselves. So organisations need to do more to recognise that the amount of time workers have available is finite, that every request to attend a meeting or engage in an internet discussion leaves less time for focused work and that seemingly small demands on peoples time can quickly compound into big demands. Helping people to collaborate is a wonderful thing. Giving them the time to think is even better.

Clarification: This article was amended after publication to clarify that Sophie Leroy is now at the University of Washington Bothell.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,The big schmooze,[],"IN EUROPEAN politics a useful distinction is sometimes drawn between the clean right, a group which can include pretty flinty conservatives, and the dirty right, meaning those who cross the bounds of democratic decency, whether with race-baiting, threats of political violence or snarling challenges to the rule of law. That distinction has proved powerful in its day. In the French presidential elections of 2002, the main parties of left and right united behind an unprincipled machine politician, Jacques Chirac, to defeat his opponent, Jean-Marie Le Pen, a brutish demagogue. Parisians fondly remember the posters that popped up, urging: Vote for the crook, not the fascist.

Donald Trump, front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, is of the dirty right. He showed that when he called for a blanket ban on Muslims entering America, and advocated both the use of torture and the punitive killing of terrorists families, a war crime. He whips up crowds by lamenting that he cannot punch protesters in the face. He accuses the Mexican government of sending rapists to America, and promises to round up and deport 11m migrants who are in the country without papers (though, like Caesar weighing lives in the Coliseum, as president he would let good ones back in). In a television interview on February 28th he declined three times to disavow statements of support from a veteran leader of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), murmuring that he needed to research that white-supremacist group. Bringing history full-circle, the ageing Mr Le Pen sent word from France that, if American, he would vote Trump.

After months of near-silence, many conservative grandees suggested that Mr Trump had crossed a line. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, called his KKK response disgusting and disqualifying. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a rival presidential contender, offered a rebuke that blended principle with calculation: Mr Trumps equivocation was not just wrong, he explained, it makes him unelectable.

Yet nobody is reviving the spirit of France in 2002, when parties united to keep a bad man out of power. At the time of writing a single Republican senator, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, has declared that if Mr Trump is his partys nominee, he will back an independent conservative. Many more Republicans have said, queasily, that they will back whoever the party nominates. Others are not even that squeamish. On February 26th Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey endorsed Mr Trump, calling him the strongest candidate against Hillary Clinton. During his own, ill-fated presidential run, Mr Christie called the tycoons proposed Muslim ban ridiculous. Now he is proud to back him. Members of Congress have begun to endorse Mr Trump, and their numbers will grow.

There is a temptingly simple explanation for this embrace of Mr Trump: that the Republican Party is a consciously racist project, from top to bottom. The backlash against Mr Trumps half-dalliance with the KKK suggests something more complicated. History matters, for one thing. Nothing scars modern Europe as deeply as memories of fascism, Nazism and collaboration with the Holocaust: many nerves jangle when strutting authoritarians question the loyalties of religious minorities or suggest that undesirable outsiders should be rounded up. In America, nothing casts a darker shadow than slavery and racial segregation, so that overt anti-black racism is uniquely taboo. When Mr Trump seemed to test that taboo, lots of Republicans were sincerely horrified. Even Mr Trump knows he went too far: he now says he misheard questions about the KKK and spurns their support.

Dismayingly, attacks on Muslims and Mexicans do not set Republican nerves a-jangle to the same extent. In the 2015 American Values Survey, a large poll, 76% of Republicans said that Islam is at odds with American values. Many grassroots conservatives would call a Muslim entry ban an act of self-defence against terrorism, not bigotry. As for immigrants, 80% of Trump voters told the same survey that they are a burden rather than a source of strength for the country, by taking jobs, housing and health care.

At the same time, an unhappy America is more divided than ever along partisan lines. Many Republican politicians think of Mrs Clinton as actively wicked. They see a patriotic duty to keep her out of the White House, not least because the next president will choose at least one Supreme Court justice, after the death of Antonin Scalia. Some hope that Mr Trump may prove malleable. Others suspect that his views will doom their party, but dont know how to win without his voters.

Pandering as contempt

There is one more explanation for all the bigwigs and pundits rationalising Trump-support, while considering themselves good people who deplore racism. Mr Trumps critics, they contend, show snobbish contempt for the tycoons votersnotably older, often less-educated whites who feel left behind by wrenching social and economic changes. One congressman backing Mr Trump, Tom Marino of Pennsylvania, uses a term much in vogue just now, calling Trump voters the unprotected. It comforts Trump-endorsers to think they are standing up for underdogs, but they are letting themselves off too easily. Other Republicans seeking the presidency endlessly promise to protect anxious Americans, with everything from air strikes on Islamic State to curbs on work visas. Mr Trump stands out for the savagery with which he vows to frighten, punish and hurt those who he says are doing America down. Thats not protection, but vengeance.

Conservative grandees preparing to back Mr Trump are arguably the worst snobs of all. For they know that he is making promises to his supporters that are both nasty and impossible to keep. Like every tribune of the dirty right, Mr Trump thinks his voters are dupes: that is why he panders and lies to them without a qualm. If Republican bigwigs have shame or sense enough, there is still timejustto disown him.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,Toe in the water,[],"RUSSIA last issued a dollar-denominated bond in 2013. Since then it has annexed part of Ukraine, launched a proxy war in another bit and destabilised the rest. That prompted Western financial sanctions on Russias banks and oil firms. Its government, though, can still tap foreign debt markets. On March 1st the ministry of finance said it would appoint advisers this month to help it issue a $3 billion bond.

One explanation might be a need for foreign cash. As Russias recession has eased, the governments cost of borrowing has fallen. It could be planning to filter the dollars to favoured companies. That would help firms struggling to service foreign debt thanks to sanctions and the halving of the value of the rouble since 2014. Alternatively, the government could use the money for itself. The budget assumes an oil price of $50 a barrel and a corresponding deficit of 3% of GDP in 2016. Now the oil price has crashed to $30, the deficit could reach 7% of GDP.

But the private sector is not as desperate as it was, having reduced its external debt by about a third over the past two years. No big foreign-debt repayments are looming. Many firms still have high levels of foreign assets, according to Liza Ermolenko of Capital Economics, a consultancy.

Nor is the government in dire straits. The reserves of its sovereign-wealth funds, which Russia is already using to fund the budget deficit, still exceed $100 billion. The finance ministry is expected to propose a new budget in April, which will trim the deficit through spending cuts and tax rises. The government can readily borrow roubles, and the interest rate on dollar borrowing is likely to be high.

That suggests that the Russian government sees the bond as a long-term, strategic move. It has tapped domestic markets in the past when running budget surpluses, to prove that it could borrow more if it needed to, says Ms Ermolenko. A successful trial would be reassuring to the Kremlin, since Russias sovereign-wealth funds are likely to run dry within a few years if oil prices stay low. There will be much more to come, says one banker, who reckons that Russia will seek to borrow $6 billion-8 billion next year.

A successful international bond placement would also be a public-relations coup. Russia must tread carefully, since Western banks are wary of cavorting with the Kremlinhence the small sum to be raised. Yet all the signs suggest that Russia will find willing partners.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,"Lights, camera, no budget",[],"A PIXELLATED helicopter destroys skyscrapers in Kampala. A shoot-out ensues, with cut-and-paste explosions and blood splats. The special effects in Who Killed Captain Alex?, a Ugandan action comedy, resemble a 1990s video game. But what do you expect for a budget of less than $200?

Isaac Nabwana has written, directed and edited more than 47 films since 2008, featuring everything from flesh-eating zombies to kung-fu kids. His set is the dusty yard outside his home in Wakaliga, a slum that sometimes has month-long power cuts. (Inevitably, the area is now called Wakaliwood.) The actors make their own costumes. A local samosa seller, Dauda Bisaso, forges guns and camera tripods from scrap metal. (He has also played villains in 11 of Mr Nabwanas films.) Make-up artists used to splash on cow blood to simulate wounds. But then someone caught tetanus and they switched to red food colouring.

Filmgoers in the slums like lots of violence. They also enjoy live commentary from a  video joker, who usually stands in the cinema keeping the tension high. On the soundtrack of Who Killed Captain Alex? , VJ Emmie plays the same role. Action is coming, I promise you, he assures viewers.

Established Kampala distributors once refused to take Luganda-language films featuring unknown actors. Now they clamour to sell Mr Nabwanas oeuvre. His sales team hawk DVDs door-to-door for 1,500-2,000 shillings (45-60 American cents), keeping 50% of the proceeds. But they have stiff competition: you can buy a DVD with four American or Nigerian films on it for 1,000 shillings.

There is also a window of just five to six days in which to maximise sales before pirates copy the work. Harriet Nabwana, Mr Nabwanas wife and accountant, estimates that 20,000 legitimate copies of a film are usually sold in that crucial first week and around 60,000 in the first month. They still lose money, though. Blank DVDs cost 600 shillings each. Copying equipment, electricity and transport are pricey, too. All the actors have day jobs; Mr Nabwana, a former brickmaker, films music videos. He complains that the police are ignorant or careless of anti-piracy laws.

Wakaliwood has been on a steadier footing since raising more than $13,000 on Kickstarter a year ago. The trailer for Who Killed Captain Alex? has been watched more than 2.5m times on YouTube. Mr Nabwana can now afford hard drives to back up his films, and a scrap-metal helicopter is taking shape in his yard. His dream is to buy land for a studio to teach the next generation of Ugandan film-makers. Mr Bisasos dream is to be Bruce Willis in Uganda.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,Premium grade,[],"AT CHARTER Academy, a small, immaculately kept secondary school in Portsmouth, children who qualify for free school meals63% of the schools pupilsare also given a free uniform. Mums are invited in to chat about their childrens progress over a glass of wine; dads prefer watching their children on boxing nights, says Dame Sharon Hollows, the schools headteacher. A lot of the parents had a poor experience at school, its about making them feel more comfortable, she adds. If a child is taken into care, someone from the school takes them shopping to make sure they have enough clothes. When a child doesnt turn up to school, staff head out in a leased car to look for them. The turnaround has been fast: in 2009, the year the school became an academy, 23 children applied for 120 places; last year, 200 applied. During a 2014 visit to the school, the prime minister, David Cameron hailed the extraordinary achievement.

Some of these measures would have been introduced anyway, but many have been made possible by the huge boost to the schools funding provided by the pupil premium, says Dame Sharon. The policy was introduced by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition in 2011 to improve the academic performance of the poorest children. Schools receive additional funding for every child on free school meals (now 1,320or $1,850for primary schools, and 935 for secondary schools) and can spend the money how they see fit, with parents, governors and inspectors keeping tabs. In 2014-15, 2.5 billion was spent on the policy, 6% of the schools budget. Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister, called the premium one of his proudest legacies.

Evidence suggests academic progress may be slow. The gap between children on free school meals and others at GCSEthe exams taken aged 16has remained high if measured by the percentage of children attaining five A*-C grades. Indeed, the gap between the performance of rich and poor children in Britain is larger than average for the OECD club of mostly rich countries. But there are signs of progress: the gap in exam results taken aged 11 has narrowed, as has GCSE performance if measured by results in eight core subjects.

Headteachers appreciate the flexibility the funding gives them. It has allowed us to be much more creative, to take more risks, says Hazel Pulley of Parkfield Community School in Birmingham. One of the schools successful interventions was hiring teachers to work solely on communication in early years, since most of its pupils dont speak English as a first language. Many schools use the money to help individual pupils: one in Sheffield bought a bike for a pupil struggling to care for his siblings and get to school on time.

Meanwhile, the government has poured funding into studies looking at how best to spend money, providing the Educational Endowment Foundation (EEF), a charity, with 137m. It collates evidence from abroad and funds studies at home: around one-quarter of English schools are involved in randomised control trials run by the charity.

Schools increasingly turn to the research for guidance: two-thirds now consult the EEFs advice, up from one-third in 2012, according to a report by the National Audit Office (NAO), which scrutinises government spending. Surveys by the National Foundation for Educational Research, a charity, found that the most common interventions in the first years of the pupil premium were to reduce class sizes and increase numbers of support staffneither of which are judged to be effective by the EEF. Now schools are more likely to put in place one-to-one tuition and pupil feedbackboth of which are highly rated.

Yet, for some headteachers, the idea that you turn to evidence is just not part of the culture, says Sir Kevan Collins of the EEF. A number of cheap, effective approaches, such as using older children to tutor younger ones, are still rarely used. Some 44% of schools have spent part of the pupil premium sprucing up classrooms or the school environment, which has little impact on student performance. Nearly eight in ten schools use the extra money to support activities that benefit all pupils, which makes sense only where there are many pupils on free school meals.

Some argue that pupil-premium spending should be subject to tighter scrutiny. Others suggest that schools have become too reliant on research by the EEF for evidence of what works. Yet such debates are partly proof of the premiums success. How to raise the attainment of children from poor backgrounds is now a focus for educators. Before the premium, 57% of school leaders said they aimed support at their most disadvantaged pupils; 94% now do, says the NAO. With such a wide gap in attainment between children from rich and poor families, that is no bad thing.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,The Economist,[],"EVERY second three more Indians experience the internet for the first time. By 2030 more than 1 billion of them will be online. In June last year one in four mobiles used in India was a smartphone, up from one in five just six months earlier. Add in two more factsIndia boasts the worlds fastest-growing large economy, and the planets biggest population of millennialsand you can see why the likes of Facebook, Uber and Google are falling over themselves to establish footholds there.

No battle for the online future of India is more intense than the one now being waged in e-commerce (see article). Sales are still tiny, at $16 billion last year, but the country is the worlds fastest-growing e-commerce market and is prized by Americas and Chinas internet titans. India has become the biggest test of Amazons international ambitions. Jeff Bezos, Amazons founder, wants it to be his second-largest market, after America, and has backed his plans with billions of dollars of investment. His opponents are platforms like Flipkart and Snapdeal, founded by locals and funded by some of the biggest names in tech, among them Alibaba, Chinas e-commerce champion.

As these companies jostle for market share, they are spending feverishly on logistics and discounts to lure consumers online. Capital may dry up for some; in February a Morgan Stanley mutual fund sharply lowered the valuation of its stake in Flipkart. But whoever wins or loses in this frenzied contest, the importance of e-commerce stretches beyond individual firms and into the wider economy. In the West e-commerce companies piggybacked on an existing infrastructure of shops, banks and logistics firms. In India the game being played by the e-commerce pioneers is leapfrog. It could become a model for emerging markets around the world.

Pay as you grow

Indian e-commerce has such potential because it can bring three changes more profound than convenience and keen prices. The first is faster financial development. China already provides one example. Alipay, an arm of Alibaba, overcomes mistrust between buyers and sellers by holding on to customers money until they have safely received their goods. Now run by an affiliate called Ant Financial, Alipay has more than 400m accounts that let consumers buy products, pay bills and transfer money. The torrent of information that Alibaba gathered on merchants and consumers was the basis for a lending business.

Something similar is under way in India. Paytm, which provides digital wallets and is itself backed by Ant Financial, has 120m accounts, nearly six times the number of credit cards in India. E-commerce companies are also helping small businesses obtain loans that they would otherwise have struggled to raise. Amazon India rolled out such a programme for its sellers last month. In January Snapdeal announced a partnership to streamline loans from the State Bank of India.

Second, e-commerce firms could help overcome Indias ropy infrastructure and vast geography. Where roads are clogged and infrastructure is decrepit, the rival firms are melding warehouses and local outposts into idiosyncratic distribution networks. About half of Flipkarts and Snapdeals customers are outside Indias biggest cities. Some are still farther afield: Amazon claims to be helping more than 6,000 Indian businesses sell abroad. China again shows what can be done. Alibaba is connecting remote rural areas to the online economy; there are now 780 Taobao villages, rural communities in which at least 10% of households are shopping or selling over the internet.

The third big impact of e-commerce in India is on retailing itself. Shopping malls and chain stores account for only about one-tenth of total retail sales. Already, the combined sales of Indias top three e-commerce sites, Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon, surpass those of the ten largest offline retailers.

Two-thirds of Indians are below the age of 35. For these young people, armed with smartphones, shopping is likely to be very different from what it was for their parents. Malls and chains will not disappear, but they may never be as prevalent as they are in the West.

That in turn will stimulate the rise of other digital firms. Indias tech scene is thriving. Tiger Global, a Flipkart investor, also backs an Indian online classified business and a messenger app that helps users avoid data costs. SoftBank, which backs Snapdeal, funds a mobile-advertising platform. In 2014 only America, Britain and Israel saw more new tech startups.

Platform boost

Simply to assume that e-commerce will conjure up growthparticularly of the labour-intensive sort that India needswould be a mistake. The market in China had a very different starting-point, for instance. When the likes of Alibaba got going, it helped that China was already home to many manufacturers looking for new ways to sell excess inventory. Indias manufacturing base is much smaller, especially for electronics, e-commerces best-selling category. India is also poorer. A smaller share of its population is online32% last year, compared with 52% in China. Indians speak more than 20 languages, which complicates marketing. The budget unveiled by Narendra Modis government this week includes plans to upgrade 50,000km (30,000 miles) of roads, but India is not about to possess a gleaming motorway network to rival Chinas. Mr Modis continued failure to install a harmonised goods and services tax blunts the benefits of e-commerce.

Yet in its heft, governance and manufacturing clout, China is also an outlier. India is a better template for the e-commerce battle in other emerging markets. Its logistical woes provide a test of firms ingenuity. If they find a way to deliver goods profitably there, they may succeed elsewhere. If they falter, their stumbles will provide lessons. That is all the more likely because Indias e-commerce is so international. Naspers, a Flipkart investor, backs ventures in Nigeria, South Africa and Egypt, among other places. E-commerce in India is a local battle for customers, but it is also a battle for the future.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,"Ray Tomlinson, who sent the first e-mail, has died",[],"WHEN historians of the future study the ways information technology affected peoples lives in the late 20th century, they will surely recognise e-mail as one of the most profound. Today, about 2.5m e-mails are sent every second. The first e-mail of all, though, was sent 45 years ago by Ray Tomlinson.

Mr Tomlinson did not invent electronic mail. The practice of transmitting messages between terminals attached to the same central processing unit (CPU), using programs such as SNDMSG (sendmessage), had been around for a while. He did, however, transmit the first message between terminals attached to separate CPUs, albeit that these two computers stood side-by-side in the same room. There had been no command from on high to invent network e-mail, he said. It just seemed like a neat idea.

The messages he sent then, late in 1971, were, he said, entirely forgettable. I have, therefore, forgotten them. Later, he would send a message to the rest of his group of programmers telling them how to send messages over the network. The first use of network e-mail, he said, announced its own existence.

In those messages Mr Tomlinson also pioneered the e-mail address format that is used to this day, separating the users login name from the host computers name by the hitherto obscure @ symbol that lurked, unloved on most standard keyboards of the day. Until then it had been employed in Spanish and Portuguese to abbreviate arroba, a unit of weight equivalent to about 11kg. In English, it sometimes denoted the price or weight of an item: 25 pears @ 5p, for instance. Few, then, would have suspected that this sign was about to undergo a semiotic revolution.

Eeee lad

After studying electrical engineering, first at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr Tomlinson joined Bolt Beranek and Newman in 1967. This firm (now a division of Raytheon), offered research-and-development services, mainly to defence contractors, and has been a home to many notable computer scientists. He was to spend his working life there.

At the time, researchers at Americas Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) had come up with the idea of an experimental computer network to link machines at different sites. In 1969, ARPA contracted Bolt Beranek and Newman to build it. The network the company constructed was ARPANET, now recognised as a precursor to the internet. One of Mr Tomlinsons jobs was to modify SNDMSG so that it would work on an operating system called TENEX, itself being modified for use in ARPANET. He did that, but then added more code so that SNDMSG could also send messages between machines connected by the new network. Dont tell anyone! he said to a colleague afterwards, according to an article about him published in Forbes, in 1998. This isnt what were supposed to be working on.

These days, Mr Tomlinsons neat idea is one that many argue has outlived its usefulness. Rival systems, each claiming some advantage over the protocol Mr Tomlinson pioneered, have come and gone. Yet e-mail stubbornly remains the favourite way of communicating electronically at work and at home. About 300m of the @-bearing missives will have been sent since you started reading this article. That is about 50 times the number of Google searches initiated in the same period. On the news of Mr Tomlinsons death, the Twitter account of Googles Gmail tweeted Thank you, Ray Tomlinson, for inventing e-mail and putting the @ sign on the map. #RIP. Succinct and accurate. Mr Tomlinson, who was not an obsessive checker of e-mail himself, would surely have appreciated the tribute.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Progress for women in Saudi Arabia has gone into reverse,[],"WHEN Hind Al-Otaibi went to the Riyadh Personal Status Court to have her father struck out as her wali, or guardian, the judges seemed sympathetic. Her father had raped and bruised her, Ms Otaibi, who was a teenager at the time, told the court. He refused to let her travel abroad, even to her mothers funeral, and when she escaped from home he had persuaded social services to send her back. After consideration, the judges determined last year that her father, an imam from the Saudi interior of Nejd, remained her legal guardian; but that a guardian only had powers to approve his wards marriage. If upheld on appeal, the ruling could topple the legal edifice of male control, depriving walis of their power over whether their women can study, work, travel or open bank accounts. Emancipation from slavery, says Ms Otaibi.

In recent years, male power over female actions in Saudi Arabia has begun to erode. Under King Abdullah, who died last year, men stopped receiving automatic text messages reporting the coming and going of their women outside the country. (If I argue with my husband, he can still ground me, gripes a PR consultant.) An increasing number of malls, gated communities and private beaches, where women swap burqinis (the all-envelopping swimwear Saudi women must wear) for bikinis, were put off-limits to the prying eyes of the religious police. And the Al Sauds sent tens of thousands of women abroad on generous stipends to study in Western universities, where they could experience the freedom of moving, dressing and driving as they pleased. Those left behind could gawp at the gap between their own world and the virtual one to which many Saudis escape for hours every day.

Armed with doctorates, many have returned to prise open the job market. In 2012, the courts licensed their first female lawyers and last December, women for the first time stood for election to local councils. Bayan al-Zahran, a lawyer in Jeddah, has set up the first female-led law firm, and law faculties in womens colleges churn out fresh attorneys.

The numbers, though, remain paltry. Only 18% of working-age Saudi women are employed (against 65% of men), one of the worlds lowest rates. And for all the headlines, the kingdom has only 67 female lawyers (out of 3,400), and 21 female councillors (out of 3,150). Female lawyers say they have to contend with judges who tell them to sit down when they stand up to represent clients. But over time, the taboos on women in public life seem to fraying. Women are better at representing other women because women natter more than men, and women understand them better, says Judge Faisal Orani, fresh from sentencing a whisky-drinker to 80 lashes. He opposes the introduction of female judges, he says, but over time, anything can change. Maybe Ill change too.

The kingdoms joyless gender segregation persists. Banks maintain separate entrances for men and women, Starbucks restricts women from its open-air balcony and McDonalds makes men and women queue separately for its burgers. In Riyadh and in Jeddah, though not in a few more liberal places such as Qatif, the clericswho always opposed female participation in the electionshave stopped the new female local councillors from sitting in the council chambers with men.

But to clerical consternation, (veiled) women now operate the tills in Ikea, a Swedish furniture outlet, in a poorer part of Riyadh, and men can now make eye-contact through the slits in womens veils while they queue in mixed aisles. At the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, a private co-ed college in Jeddah, male and female students attend the same lectures and mingle freely. Architects of new office blocks locate male and female toilets on the same floor.

Most Saudi women have yet to take the liberties their Iranian counterparts do with the veil. Parents would object if I didnt cover my face, says a primary school headmistress who longs to remove it. But growing numbers of high-school girls are donning headscarves only, no matter that their elders consider that scandalous. In Jeddah, a more liberal port city, seamstresses design abayas with dashes of bright colour and women smoke water-pipes out of doors. Even in conservative Riyadh, girls can be found in a few ritzy restaurants flashing their hair.

But worryingly, King Abdullahs incremental reforms seem to be drying up and even going into reverse under his successor, King Salman. His young son, Muhammad, who operates most of the levers of power, says he is anxious to increase Saudi productivity, and to lower birth-rates, by getting women out of the home and into the workplace. But even so he seems nervous of confronting the religious establishment, on whom the Al Sauds depend for legitimacy, and of being labelledGod forbida Westerniser. Many of King Abdullahs reformers have been shifted; and a host of hardliners are back. The only female minister, in the education ministry, was dismissed soon after Salman took the throne.

Four women who publicly defied the still unreformed ban on female driving were barred from contesting local elections. Shoppers in Jeddah report that the religious police are back, demanding that department stores black out any glimpse of unveiled women on their packaging. One executive at an international financial-services firm says that the snoops carried out three spot-checks on her office last year to check for signs of the sexes mingling. She is once again being forced to enter through side-entrances when visiting clients, while her male counterparts go through the front door; and they have to travel to meetings in separate cars.

In the new, more conservative environment, perhaps the best hope for women is that the country might start to revert to its own traditions. A senior official admires footage of the Saudi states founder, Abdulaziz, holding court in 1930s Mecca, while women riding on horseback bring their wares to market. At Jeddahs annual festival, the organisers display the colourful costumes women used to wear before the puritans imposed the black abaya of the central desert on the whole country. Most striking of all is the Prophet Muhammads own requirement that women and men perform the pilgrimage to Mecca together; and that when women go round the Kaaba, Islams holiest place, they show their face. Saudi Arabias new rulers might take note.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,The party declines,[],"POLITICAL parties are never monoliths. As those inside them are ceaselessly aware, they are fractious and fractured. And yet, especially in two-party democracies, they endure. A mixture of delivering the goods their voters desire, dividing spoils between internal factions and adapting to external change allows them to overcome their centrifugal pressures. They even manage, much of the time, to look more or less coherent while doing so. For most of the 20th century most Americans knew, more or less, what their two parties stood for.

These times, though, are out of step. Though political scientists proved slow to pick up on it (see article), Americas parties are more fragmented than usual. The state of the Republicans is particularly parlous. But the contradictions among Democrats, though less obvious, also run deep.

Donald Trumps run for the presidency has prospered despite lacking all the things parties usually provide for a front-runner: not least strategists and policies, money. It is hardly surprising that the Republican Party failed to see Mr Trump coming. What is odder, and much more culpable, is its failure to address the mismatch between its grassroots supporters and its policy agenda into which Mr Trump has tapped so effectively. In its subsequent disarray, the party has come to resemble a newspaper that has just discovered that its readers no longer need it to mediate between themselves and the world.

The Republican Party arrived in the 21st century as an alliance of small-state, low-tax, pro-business voters with religiously inspired social conservatives and national-security hawks. It enjoyed a disproportionate popularity among white voters, the result of its successful recruitment of southern whites who disliked the innovations of the civil-rights era and, under Ronald Reagan, of blue-collar workers across the country. This mixture of interest groups had proved pretty successful: it held the White House for 28 of the 40 years from 1969 to 2008. During this time the pro-business lot were the senior partners in the arrangement, not least because they paid for the partys election campaigns.

This is the first primary season in 50 years where that has not held true. The Koch brothers, who have built the wealthiest network of political donors in America with the aim of electing Republicans who will cut regulation and taxes, disapprove of Mr Trump. They have said they will not fund his campaign; and yet he thrives.

Faultlines exposed

Mr Trumps ascendancy cannot merely be ascribed to his wealththough that certainly helps, by allowing him to appeal directly to the concerns of the base rather than those of his donors. He has exposed faultlines within the different camps, as well as between them. Even before his rise, some pro-business Republicans were beginning to despair of the party, the congressional wing of which seemed to enjoy nothing more than shutting down the federal government and playing chicken with the debt ceiling. After the financial crisis, when a Republican-led administration bailed out several large financial institutions, denunciations of crony capitalism became a Republican theme as much as a Democratic one. Mr Trump has deepened the divide on the business wing. In December the head of the national chamber of commerce said he viewed Mr Trumps candidacy as a form of entertainment.

He has also spilt the social conservatives. A libertine history and the look of a roue gone to seed would not in themselves preclude the support of evangelical Christians, who are, after all, keen on repentance. But Mr Trump is not very religious and does not go out of his way to seem so; his adoption of pro-life positions seems insincere. Christian Post, the countrys most popular evangelical news website, recently ran an editorial with the headline, Donald Trump is a scam. Evangelical voters should back away. Hitherto powerful socially conservative organisations such as the Family Leader have endorsed Ted Cruz, a Texas senator, instead. But such exhortations have had little effect: Mr Trump has won comfortably with self-described evangelicals in most states.

The reason evangelicals vote for Mr Trump has little to do with faith or specifics of policy. It is more a question of attitude. A study by the RAND Corporation, a think-tank, has found that the most reliable way to tell whether a Republican voter was going to support Mr Trump was whether he agreed with the statement: People like me dont have any say about what government does. Trump voters feel voiceless, and whatever attributes Mr Trump lacks, he has a voice. He lends it to them, to express their grievances and their aspirations for greatness, and they love it.

It is also a voice that says things which other politicians do not, such as that Mexican immigrants are likely to be drug-dealers and rapists. Such untruths fit into a broader, if largely tacit, racism that has made Mr Trump popular not only with the Ku Klux Klan, but also with the considerably larger number of whites who harbour some racial resentment. Geographically, his support correlates with the frequency of racial epithets in Google searches.

Americas primary agenda: our interactive 2016 election calendar

The weakest of the three Republican factions, the defence hawks, might even prefer a President Hillary Clinton to a President Trump. Mr Trumps constant refrain about American troops always losing, his tendency towards isolationism, his insulting of prominent veterans such as John McCain, his attacks on George W. Bush as commander-in-chief and, most of all, his apparent enthusiasm for soldiers committing acts that would have them court-martialled, are a recipe for these Republican voters to the Democratic camp.

Again, though, part of Mr Trumps appeal reflects what at least some Republicans like about hawkishness; its association with authority. The Republican Party has spent the past half-century opposing the might of the federal government in every arena other than foreign policy. It now faces the prospect of going into the election led by someone who, surveys suggest, draws his most ardent support from those who would like a more authoritarian president in the White House. At that point it would be hard to say what, if anything, the party stands for.

A battle of generations

Mr Trumps ability to blow Republican cracks asunder is unprecedented. But it has been helped by a long-standing unwillingness to face and fix those contradictions. For years the party has concentrated instead on opposing Barack Obamas policies and, indeed, his legitimacy. With Mr Obama on the way out, that is moot now.

He has, however, helped Democrats to know what they must jointly do. As Republicans long to tear down achievements they associate with Mr Obama, Democrats want to protect and uphold them. This has tended to keep the members of the partys own coalition in agreement. Yet the ties between the voting blocs that favour DemocratsHispanics, blacks, those with postgraduate degrees, single women, the non-religious, union members and millennialsare subject to change. The primaries have also revealed a powerful urge among activists to move the party leftward.

Democrats fare exceptionally well with non-whites: in 2012 one in four of those who voted for Mr Obama were in this category, compared with one in ten of those who voted for Mitt Romney. But the interests of blacks do not always align with those of Hispanics. Fearing more competition for low-wage jobs, the congressional black caucus, allied with the unions, was partly responsible for defeating a push for immigration reform under George W. Bush. The party has found ways round this clash, presenting immigration reform as a question of civil rights; when Mr Obama meets caucus members, immigration reform tends to be omitted in a mutual show of good manners. But the division remains.

The current crop of primaries has also made it clear that Democrats are divided along generational lines. Bernie Sanders has thrashed Mrs Clinton in every contest among voters whose formative political experiences were the Iraq war (which she supported) and the financial crisis (blamed on her Wall Street supporters). For those born before the Reagan years, by contrast, the fact that Mr Sanders honeymooned in the Soviet Union disqualifies him from consideration. Older Democrats remember the partys move to the centre in the 1990s as pragmatic, correct and fruitful; younger ones consider it a betrayal.

When its members actually turn out to vote, the Democratic coalition is still formidable. Non-whites make up an ever-increasing share of the electorate. Polling by Gallup shows that the number of Americans who describe themselves as liberal has increased over the past 20 years, while those who call themselves conservative has held steady (see chart.) Self-declared moderates lean Democratic. But oftenespecially in non-presidential election yearsthe coalition cant be bothered.

This has led to a party unable to refresh itself. Were Mrs Clinton (68) to win the nomination and then fall under a bus or an indictment, the names often mentioned as possible replacements are John Kerry (72) and Joe Biden (73). During Mr Obamas presidency Democrats have lost 900 seats in state legislatures, 11 governors, 69 seats in the House and 13 senators. This helps to explain why Mrs Clinton has had no young pretender to voice the opposition to her from within the party. Mr Obama relied on his own apparatus, separate from the party, in his two presidential campaigns. Mrs Clinton has vowed to rebuild the party if she wins. But that supposes that its constituent interest groups continue to see the Democratic Party as the best way to get what they want. Once the presidential election is over, they may find apathy more attractive againnot least because, now that it has acted on heath-care reform and (to an extent) on climate change, the party has been remarkably poor at setting out new worlds to conquer.

There is nothing immutable about the way the two parties currently line up. Republicans used to be the big-government progressive party, formed in opposition to slavery and pushing to remodel the South after the civil war; they have also been the small-government party, not only now, but in opposition to the New Deal in the 1930s. Democrats were once the small-government party, opposing those who wanted a more powerful federal government and defending the interests of white southerners against Washington; now they are famous as the big-government party, pushing federal anti-poverty programmes in the 20th century and government involvement in health care in the 21st.

Furniture-moving

This election could see the furniture rearranged again. Some Republicans wonder if a Trump candidacy might redraw the electoral map, winning over blue-collar whites who dont normally vote in rustbelt swing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan or Wisconsin. If he loses, the party might still conclude that it needs to pay more attention to the economic anxieties of those who feel left behind.

For their part Democrats are counting on Mr Trump to energise members of the coalition that voted twice for President Barack Obama, and to put in play moderate Republicans, notably women, who can expect to be bombarded with Democratic messages about the billionaires misogyny. If Mrs Clinton marshals a broad anti-Trump coalition that peels off some habitual Republican voters and combines it with high turnout among traditional Democratic supporters, she will have an opportunity to create a new centrist coalition that may long outlast her.

Nobody yet knows whether what is happening in 2016 is an anomaly caused by the one-off political persona Mr Trump has created, or if it is tracing the outline of the future. Whatever the parties look like after November 8th, though, Mr Trumps success to date has already changed the system, in part by proving that voters value ideological consistency (and rhetorical restraint) much less than the political classes assumed. That could be liberating, if it allows elected representatives to stray from the party line. It could be damaging if the only lines they can stray towards are brutally populist ones.

Parties exist to distil a complex set of questions into a binary choice; it is impossible to imagine a big democracy staying healthy without them. Yet in 2020, with Mr Trump in mind, the strongest candidates may start from the assumption that they do not need their parties much at all.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,The Economist,[],"STORMY seas can wreak havoc on ships and oil rigs, but the damage they do pales beside that which a rogue wave can dole out. These behemoths, which may be up to 30 metres (100 feet) high, can badly damage, and even sink, all but the largest merchant vessels. They form when smaller, harmless waves meld into one. Until now, predicting them has proved impossible. But Will Cousins and Themistoklis Sapsis, two mechanical engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, think they have cracked the problem.

Most ocean waves move independently of one another. Sometimes, though, they travel in groups. Waves within a group have the potential to share energy via a phenomenon called modulation instability, in which one wave grows at the expense of the others and all of the groups power is thus concentrated into it.

Past teams of researchers who have attempted to predict such rogues have tried monitoring every wave in a region using radar, and then forecasting the behaviour of each of them. This needs a lot of processing powerfar more than is carried on board an average merchant vessel. Moreover, it can take hours to run the calculation, which rather diminishes its value. Yet Dr Cousins and Dr Sapsis suspected they could bypass these problems by ignoring most of the waves in an area and homing in on only a tiny, relevant subset of them.

Their system starts by tapping into statistics collected over the years by instruments such as buoys about a particular part of the ocean surface. Using these data, it works out how that sea area normally behaves. It then analyses this behaviour alongside data on wave heights and movements collected in real time by ships radar, looking for groups of waves that might possibly end up forming a rogue. Only when it has identified these does it bring the full power of the computer to bear on them. It thus conserves its resources for those analyses that actually matter.

The two researchers report in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics this week that because their algorithm is so parsimonious, it runs well on the sorts of laptops skippers often take to sea. They also report that when they tested it on 100 simulations containing 336 rogue waves, it was able to run all of the calculations needed to predict such waves in a matter of seconds. There were false alarms91 of them. But, crucially, the algorithm successfully flagged up all 336 real rogues, and did so an average of 153 seconds before a putative wave would have struck. That is not enough time to get out of a waves path. Nor, in the researchers view, is reorienting the vessel so that it meets a wave bow first (which would be a natural response to stop a ship rolling and capsizing when hit) of much value in the face of rogues of this magnitude. The system does provide enough time, though, for a crew to batten down the hatches, both literally and metaphorically, and to brace for impact before they are hit, thus increasing the chance that both they and the vessel will survive.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,Living off the people,[],"FOR as long as there have been organised economies, people have been employed to look after the wealth of others. More than 4,000 years ago landowners in Akkad, an early Mesopotamian civilisation, hired local managers to look after their farms.

In their new book, Investment: A History, Norton Reamer and Jesse Downing explain how the industry has changed over time. Their fundamental idea is that investment has become democratised, available to a wider range of individuals.

Early investment was conducted on behalf of the wealthy, often by individuals with low statuscurrent or former slaves in the Roman Republic, for example. In the Biblical parable of the talents, a master entrusts his wealth to a range of servants. Two of the servants doubled the masters money but the third buried it in the ground, rather than investing it with the bankers. For this failure, the poor performer was cast into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Todays clients might welcome the ability to add this penalty clause to their contracts.

Looking after the assets of the richor high-net-worth individuals, as they are known in the jargonis still big business. But the fund-management industrys growth has been turbocharged by the evolution of a much wider client base. In the rich world, most people have some money available for savings after they have paid for the necessities of food, clothing and shelter. With a retirement age of, in effect, around 65, they have two decades or so of old age to provide for. In America, retirement savings grew from $368 billion in 1974 to more than $22 trillion by 2014a fivefold increase in assets relative to income.

This has transformed the industry. Investment management was once a dull business, consisting mainly of helping trust funds stock up on government bonds. The standard joke was: Why dont fund managers look out of the window in the mornings? Because then theyd have nothing to do in the afternoons. Nowadays fund management is a much more glamorous professionmore masters of the universe than keepers of the paper clips.

Another key to the change in the industrys fortunes is its reward system. Fees are linked to the value of the assets, even though the cost of managing $10 billion is little more than the cost of looking after a measly $1 billion. So fund managers have benefited twice over: first, from the expansion of pension and other savings and, second, from the huge rise in asset prices since the 1980s. The latter has been driven by falls in inflation and interest rates which have reduced the yield (and thus increased the price) of financial assets. When markets faltered in the financial crisis, central banks stepped in to buy assets through quantitative easing (QE)in effect, an indirect subsidy of fund managers profits.

As Messrs Reamer and Downing point out, some fund managers have become very wealthy by looking after other peoples money. A quarter of all American billionaires work in finance and investments, an industry that employs less than 1% of all workers. In ancient times, the poor looked after the assets of the rich; in modern times, it is the other way round.

Successful managers deserve decent rewards, but a lot of mediocre managers have prospered too. Just because they are rich does not mean they are clever. Their position is slowly being eroded by the emergence of index-trackers and exchange-traded funds, which charge much lower fees. But the transformation is not occurring fast enough.

A world of low inflation and low nominal returns should prompt clients to pay a lot more attention to fees. Instead, many pension funds and endowments are moving into higher-charging alternative asset categories like hedge funds and private equity, a Hail Mary strategy that cannot work in aggregate. There may be market inefficiencies that are profitable to exploit, but none large enough to give a big, across-the-board boost to the returns of a $22 trillion industry.

The authors are right that the democratisation of investment is, on the whole, good news. Millions of people have access to diversified savings vehicles that will deliver, on average, returns that are better than those available from a savings account. But, these days, technology means that such funds can be provided for a fraction of a percentage point a year. This is becoming a utility business, and you dont get rich by running a utility.

economist.com,2016-03-07 15:36:11,Daily chart: The 2016 presidential money race,[],"EVERY four years Americans elect a president. And every four years, campaign-finance experts predict the coming of the most expensive election in history. The 2016 presidential campaign is no exception. It is reckoned that political candidates, parties, and outside groups will spend at least $5 billion on the 2016 election, more than double the cost of the 2012 campaign. Hillary Clinton alone is expected to raise and spend about half of that if she wins her party's nomination and goes on to November's election for president.

Thus far, the presidential candidates are proving the experts right. Up until the end of January the campaigns raked in $494m in donations: $229m by Democrats and $265m by Republicans. Super PACs, ""political action committees"" that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money, and other outside groups affiliated with the candidates have contributed another $400m. Although both parties have raised similar piles of cash in total, they have done so in very different ways. Democrats (notably Bernie Sanders) have relied more heavily on small donations, whereas Republicans (with the exception of Ben Carson) have obtained most of their money in larger amounts and mostly through associated super PACs.

Fundraising has differed across the country as well. Democrats have tapped ultra-liberal cities such as Washington, DC, and Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Republicans have raised lots of cash in southern cities like Dallas and Miami (two leading Republicans, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, are from Texas and Florida respectively). The most bipartisan city is Buffalo, New York, the home town of presidents Millard Fillmore and Grover Cleveland. Buffalonians donated $421,411 up until the end of January, roughly half to each party.

How these vast sums will influence the race is unclear. Campaign spending tends to have a relatively small impact on election outcomes. But high levels of giving from many donors, all else being equal, suggests an enthusiastic base of supporters. Judging by the numbers, American voters this year are more enthusiastic than ever before.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-09 13:17:52,Daily chart: Chinas debt binge: putting off the inevitable,[],"DEBT in China is piling up fast. Private debt, at 200% of GDP, is only slightly lower than it was in Japan at the onset of its lost decades, in 1991, and well above the level in America on the eve of the financial crisis of 2007-08. Chinas binging borrowers seem to have run out of good investments. The value of non-performing loans in China rose from 1.2% of GDP in December 2014 to 1.9% a year later. Some big firms are earning too little to service their debts; instead, they are making up the difference by borrowing yet more.

The IMF reckons that surging credit is the single best predictor of financial instability, but China might be able to avoid a crisis. Very little of its debt is owed to foreigners, and the government has room to borrow to cushion the economy against loan defaults and failing banks. Yet when Chinese firms eventually flip from borrowing to repaying their loans, growth will probably slow sharply. That could make for difficult times for people in China, and in the rest of the world as well.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,Bang to rights,[],"FRED McNEILL, an American-football player, died in November at the age of 63. Between 1974 and 1985 he appeared for the Minnesota Vikings. After leaving them he became a lawyer but in later years suffered from dementia and was told that he had signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease. His recent death has become a milestone in the understanding of brain disorders, for post-mortem examination has confirmed this diagnosisretrospectively making him the first person to be so diagnosed while alive.

CTE is the physical manifestation in the brain of punch-drunk syndromeor dementia pugilistica, to give its Latinised, medical name. As that name suggests, this form of dementia particularly affects boxers, who are hit on the head as a matter of course. But doctors now understand that it is also a problem in people like Mr McNeill, who get hit on the head accidentally in contact sports. Mr McNeill, along with several other retired players, volunteered to let researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) use a scanning technique called positron-emission tomography (PET) to look at their brains.

In his case, and in those of others who had suffered concussion (a form of brain injury that leads to headaches, dizziness and nausea, and causes blackouts in 10% of those who experience it), this revealed a pattern of abnormal protein deposits. Mr McNeills death enabled his scans to be compared with the results of an autopsy. That confirmed the PET-based diagnosis. Specifically, PET was recording deposits in his brain of a protein called tau, which is tied to CTE and other neurological disorders, including Alzheimers.

Knocked about

Until quite recently, according to Julian Bailes, a director of the NorthShore Neurological Institute in Evanston, Illinois, it was thought that concussion from accidents in contact sports such as American football was a temporary malfunction rather than a permanent injury. This view began to change in 2005, when Bennet Omalu, a pathologist at the county coroners office in Pittsburgh, wanted to find out why another footballer, Mike Webster, had suffered mental ill-health before dying unexpectedly at the age of 50. Webster had become confused, angry and violent, and even bought a Taser gun to treat his own back pain. Dr Omalu discovered tau-protein deposits in his brain, and proposed that the footballer had died of CTE, something which had previously been recognised as a cause of death only in boxers. This revelation, and his fight with the National Football League, which regulates the game, was the subject of a recent film called Concussion. Since then, he and Dr Bailes have been collecting the brains of former athletes, and also of old soldiers who have been exposed to explosions, to try to understand who gets CTE, and why.

The road to CTE, their research suggests, does indeed start with concussion. One incidence in five of this then leads to post-concussion syndrome, a period of cognitive impairment that may last months, in which patients have headaches, unsteadiness and other problems. And it seems increasingly likely that, in some cases, repeated concussions may lead to CTE.

In recent years the underlying biology has started to become apparent. Mostly, this relates to the release of certain chemicals when axons, the filamentous connections between nerve cells, are damaged. Concussion is different from blunt-force trauma, such as that which results from getting hit on the head by a rapidly delivered cricket ball. Then, the injury is caused by directly transmitted shock from the impact. Concussion, by contrast, is caused by the internal movement and distortion of the brain as it bounces around inside the cranium after an impact. This bouncing, research has shown, stretches and deforms bundles of axons that connect different regions of the brain. The deformation shears some axons directly, releasing their protein contents, including tau, which with time can form abnormal tangles similar to those found in Alzheimers disease. It also causes abnormal inflows of sodium and calcium ions in unsevered but damaged axons. These, in turn, trigger a process which releases protein-breaking enzymes that destroy the axon, further disrupting the brains internal communications.

Concussive injury also damages the blood-brain barrier. This is a system of tightly joined cells surrounding the capillaries that service the brain. Its purpose is to control what enters and leaves the central nervous system. One consequence of damaging it is to release into general circulation a brain protein called S100B. The body mounts an immune response against this protein, and the antibodies it generates can find their way back into the brain and harm healthy brain cells. Researchers propose that repeated damage could set the stage for a continuous autoimmune-type attack on the brain.

The relationship between brain injury and behavioural symptoms is, nevertheless, unclear. The work at UCLA suggests a characteristic pattern of protein deposits in people who have suffered repeated concussions. The death of Mr McNeill suggests that may lead to CTE and dementia pugilistica. But many uncertainties remain, according to Huw Morris, a clinical neuroscientist at University College, London.

One challenge is to connect concussion, post-concussion syndrome and CTE itself. The immediate relevance of this will be to help understand whether a particular injury is likely to have long-term consequences. In this context yet another protein released during concussion, SNTF, is of interest. Work on concussed ice-hockey players suggests its level in the blood after a blow to the head predicts the severity of a concussion. A test for this, or for S100B, might provide a way to determine an injured players prognosis.

That is a matter of interest both to sportsmen andwomen, and to the clubs they play for. Neither coaches nor athletes tend to be good judges of fitness to play after a head injury. It seems likely that many people return to the field long before the brains physical healing is complete. And players tend to underreport symptoms. A survey of American university athletes in 2014 found that 20% believed they had suffered a concussion, but almost 80% of those decided to continue to play rather than seek medical attention. Most felt their concussion was not serious and were concerned that revealing their injury would affect their standing with the team.

To try to find an objective measure of the damage an episode of concussion has caused, Dr Morris and his colleagues are studying players at Saracens, a rugby club in London. Participants will wear impact sensors to monitor collisions and give blood samples at the end of every game. The study hopes to find chemicals associated with brain injury that could be used to develop a blood test. A similar project is under way at the Translational Genomics Research Institute, in Phoenix, to study American-football players at Arizona State University.

Brain scanning, too, may have something to contribute. Magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI), a mainstream and widely available technique, can reveal reduced blood flow in the brains of athletes who have had concussions, even long after the injury. An MRIbased test might thus be developed to determine when or whether a player is well enough to return to play. There are also commercially available apps called HeadCheck and Braincheck, which are intended to help athletes work out their baseline brain performance and allow the organs health to be tracked. They are not approved as medical devices, so cannot be used to diagnose concussion. But they may let players, especially amateurs, monitor themselves after blows to the head to search for signs that they might need medical advice.

Suffer the little children

In the end, adult athletes can make up their own minds about what risks they wish to take. Children, though, cannot. It is therefore children who should attract the greatest attention. Not only are some children obliged to play contact sports at school, but they may also be participating in an environment that encourages a stiff upper lip when they are injured. Yet it has been clear since a study published in 2012 by Andrew Mayer at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque that subtle brain changes in children who have sustained a concussion persist for months after the injury, even when there are no longer any obvious symptoms.

Work published last December by Charles Hillman of the University of Illinois found that children who had sustained a single sports-related concussion still had impaired brain function two years later. Ten-year-olds with a history of concussion performed worse on tests of working memory, attention and impulse control than did uninjured confreres. Among the children with a history of concussion, those who were injured earlier in life had larger deficits. This study was small (it involved 15 injured participants) but if subsequent research confirms it, that will be great cause for concern.

Concussiononce an invisible injuryis rapidly being illuminated. Many sports-lovers have been disturbed to learn that injuries on the field have caused their heroes to undergo profound personality changes. And many parents now worry, with good reason, about their children playing sports. Taking one for the team is all very well. But the price of doing so may be paid over a lifetime.",[]
economist.com,,"Incorporating STEM into business education: Four letters, big leap",[],"Feb 9th 2016, 15:39 by C.S-W.

THERE was a time, not that long ago, when executives at big businesses would not even type their own letters. Today technology is at the fingertips of executivesand ought to be on the tips of their tongues, too. For around three years, there has been a slow march towards integrating science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) into business education. That move is picking up pace.

Business schools are eager to persuade bright young things with scientific backgrounds to take MBAs. But as well as importing talent, they also want to improve the language skills of straight-laced executives-to-be in STEM subjects. Business schools are unlikely to be building workshops around the back of their sleek campuses. However, the hope, says Johan Roos, chief strategy officer at Hult Business School, is to produce management graduates who are as conversant in biotechnology as balance sheets. These will then be able to work better with the STEM graduates that large companies are hiring in greater numbers.

Mr Roos draws a comparison with a curiously old-fashioned example: the Renaissance man, able to work his way around a broad variety of subjects with a generalists knack. That said, STEM teaching must do more than scratch the surface. Superficial classes give managers only the ability to waffle and baffle with buzzwords. Likewise, says Mr Mr Roos, schools should avoid creating a STEM elective, or a STEM primer. The idea is not to place the subject in a silo. Rather a smattering of science should imbue the whole curriculum across a business school.

Last month a plenary session hosted by the European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD), a management networking body, was dedicated to STEM. How quickly it will move from theoretical panel discussions to curriculums is a big question. I wish I could say itll take three weeks, Mr Roos says. Ultimately it boils down to having interested faculty members that will take the ball and run with it.

For students who applied to business school to learn about profit and loss, but who are taught about DNA and nanotechnology, the concept may sound as radical as Newtons law of universal gravitation. Yet there is a precedent. At the turn of the century, after the Enron scandal flashed across the pages of newspapers, business schools introduced new courses to deal with ethics. More than a decade on, ethics education is now interspersed through all parts of an MBA programme.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,Not so espresso,[],"CAFE culture may be quintessentially Italian, but it took an American firm to make it global. Howard Schultz says visiting Milan and its cafes in the 1980s inspired him to develop Starbucks into what it is today. More than three decades later, the Seattle coffee giant is poised to enter the Italian market itself. On February 26th Mr Schultz announced a deal with Percassi, a retail developer, to open the chains first location in the country next year, in Milan.

Starbucks is not the only firm to have stolen a march. An Italian developed the first espresso machine, but a Swiss firm, Nestle, conquered the market for personal espresso-makers with its Nespresso system. The worlds second- and third-largest coffee groups, which merged in 2015 to create Jacobs Douwe Egberts, were American and Dutch, respectively.

Italys coffee firms are trying to grab more of the global industry for themselves. Italys re-exports of beans, mostly roasted, have more than doubled over the past decade, to the equivalent of 3.2m standard 60kg sacks, increasing their share of global trade from 6.7% to 8.9%.

Last year Lavazza, Italys biggest coffee firm, bought Douwe Egberts Carte Noire premium brand for 800m ($870m), making it the market leader in France. That followed an initial public offering of 40% of Massimo Zanetti, to raise capital for expansion. Zanetti owns a score of brands, including Boncafe, an Asian roaster; and it is buying a stake in Club Coffee, a Canadian firm with which it has developed compostable capsules. Besides continuing to develop its business-to-business side, Illycaffe is expanding its younger direct-to-consumer arm. It has opened flagship coffee shops in big cities, from Seoul to San Francisco, and plans to open more.

Jeffrey Young of Allegra World Coffee Portal, a consulting firm, doubts if all this is enough in what has become a highly competitive and consolidated market. Many Italian firms have rested on their laurels, he says, believing their product to be superior. That was once true, but the emergence of coffee-shop chains, and then of craft coffee brands, has changed that. Quality is now a given; branding and the ambience of coffee shops are ever more important.

The industry is now in the grip of a fad for the science of coffee-makingimproved grinding methods, better monitoring of water quality, and so on. Illycaffe was an early innovator, having pioneered the use of pressurised cans when most others were still selling coffee in paper bags. More recently it has created an app that lets coffee-lovers design and buy their ideal blendit will be rolled out in some of the firms shops later this year. But if innovation and product development continue to be important routes to growth, even Italys biggest firms may be outgunned by global giants with much deeper pockets.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,A far from dismal outcome,[],"SCIENCE works for two reasons. First, its results are based on experiments: extracting Mother Natures secrets by asking her directly, rather than by armchair philosophising. And a culture of openness and replication means that scientists are policed by their peers. Scientific papers include sections on methods so that others can repeat the experiments and check that they reach the same conclusions.

That, at least, is the theory. In practice, checking old results is much less good for a scientists career than publishing exciting new ones. Without such checks, dodgy results sneak into the literature. In recent years medicine, psychology and genetics have all been put under the microscope and found wanting. One analysis of 100 psychology papers, published last year, for instance, was able to replicate only 36% of their findings. And a study conducted in 2012 by Amgen, an American pharmaceutical company, could replicate only 11% of the 53 papers it reviewed.

Now it is the turn of economics. Although that august discipline was founded in the 18th century by Adam Smith (pictured above) and his contemporaries, it is only over the past few decades that its practitioners (some of them, anyway) have come to the conclusions that the natural sciences reached centuries ago: that experiments might be the best way to test their theories about how the world works. A rash of results in microeconomicswhich studies the behaviour of individualshas suggested that Homo sapiens is not always Homo economicus, the paragon of cold-blooded rationality assumed by many formal economic models.

But as economics adopts the experimental procedures of the natural sciences, it might also suffer from their drawbacks. In a paper just published in Science, Colin Camerer of the California Institute of Technology and a group of colleagues from universities around the world decided to check. They repeated 18 laboratory experiments in economics whose results had been published in the American Economic Review and the Quarterly Journal of Economics between 2011 and 2014.

For 11 of the 18 papers (ie, 61% of them) Dr Camerer and his colleagues found a broadly similar effect to whatever the original authors had reported. That is below the 92% replication rate they would have expected had all the original studies been as statistically robust as the authors claimedbut by the standards of medicine, psychology and genetics it is still impressive.

One theory put forward by Dr Camerer and his colleagues to explain this superior hit rate is that economics may still benefit from the zeal of the newly converted. They point out that, when the field was in its infancy, experimental economists were keen that others should adopt their methods. To that end, they persuaded economics journals to devote far more space to printing information about methods, including explicit instructions and raw data sets, than sciences journals normally would.

This, the researchers reckon, may have helped establish a culture of unusual rigour and openness. Whatever the cause, it does suggest one thing. Natural scientists may have to stop sneering at their economist brethren, and recognise that the dismal science is, indeed, a science after all.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,Fog of uncertainty,[],"MORE herbicides contain glyphosate, a weedkilling chemical, than any other agent. Monsanto, an agricultural giant, first sold Roundup, a product containing the stuff, to farmers in the 1970s. Since then use of glyphosate-based concoctions has increased about 100-fold; gardeners as well as farmers have taken to it for killing weeds and keeping paths clear. The firms last patent on it expired in 2000, and farmers from Brazil to Russia spray it as never before. But as larger quantities are used, concerns grow over the harm some say it may cause. On March 7th a European Union (EU) committee will vote on whether to renew approval of glyphosate for the next 15 years.

Farmers value glyphosate for reasons that have changed since it first appeared. Once a kill-all for unwanted weeds, it was transformed in 1996 when Monsanto developed genetically engineered crops able to withstand it. In 2014 selling Roundup and modified seeds earned the company $5 billion in America alone. It is also useful in drying crops before harvests. Estimates suggest that two-thirds of all the glyphosate ever sprayed in America has been applied in the past ten years.

Glyphosates benefits vary depending on what crop it is sprayed on. But no organisation tracks pesticide use by type across Europe, making comparisons difficult. Monsanto claims that using glyphosate can raise crop yields between 30% and 60%a huge boost. According to a 2011 estimate by Michael Schmitz, head of the Institute of Agribusiness, a German research organisation, a ban on glyphosate in the EU could cause annual losses of 1 billion-3.1 billion ($1.1 billion-3.4 billion).

Some scientists claim that dousing crops in glyphosate may be harmful, however. It lingers in soils and water for much longer than studies once suggested. Low levels of the stuff have been detected in products from bread to pantyliners. And as resistance to glyphosate increases in plants, as it has in recent decades, changes to cropping and tillage patterns may be neededalongside gallons of other pesticidesto ensure good harvests.

The hottest debate surrounds glyphosate and human health. Last July the WHOs International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) found that the herbicide is probably carcinogenic. But six months later the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which oversees the assessment of active chemical substances within the EU, cleared glyphosate of causing cancer.

The two bodies traded furious letters throughout January and February; the spat is unprecedented. IARC argues that the research on which EFSA based its decision, completed by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, ignored an association between non-Hodgkin lymphoma and glyphosate seen in certain research and relied on studies not publicly available, while it denigrated peer-reviewed ones. The furore led Frances Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (ANSES) to step in. It concluded that glyphosate arguably could be classified as a substance suspected of being carcinogenic to humans.

EFSA plays an active role in the EUs pesticide-approval process; IARC does not. But the European Ombudsman, Emily OReilly, found that process flawed after a long inquiry that ended on February 22nd. She criticised the European Commission for approving chemicals before there was sufficient information to say that they were completely safe. The authority now has until 2018 to ensure that those keen to clear a substance provide more data to show that it is harmless.

The dispute suggests that more research is needed. For one thing, certain ingredients with which glyphosate is mixed to form pesticides are more toxic to humans than the substance itself. But regulators examine only the compound, not the cocktail. For another, traditional toxicological tests could miss the weedkillers possible effects on endocrinological, reproductive and developmental systems.

Others, too, struggle with what to do about glyphosate. The Canadians have little problem with it. Americas Environmental Protection Agency failed to produce a planned risk assessment on it last year. Californias ultra-cautious environmental agency added the herbicide to a list of carcinogens last September. Monsanto is challenging the move in court.

Robust studies into glyphosates effects should be considered carefully alongside better data on the role it plays in feeding the world. The ways farmers use the compound have evolved. The ways regulators evaluate its safety should, too.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,Too many holes to last,[],"IT WAS a brave attempt to generate diplomatic momentum. Four days into the American and Russian sponsored cessation of hostilities agreement that came into force on February 27th, Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy to Syria, said he was expecting the warring parties to return to the negotiating table in Geneva on March 9th. Mr de Mistura had pencilled in an earlier date for the resumption of peace talks, which were suspended before they could begin a month ago when the Syrian opposition walked out. But he hopes that by allowing a couple of extra days for the ceasefire to better settle down, the chances of success will be greater.

Mr de Misturas use of the expression ceasefire is itself an indication of hopes likely to be dashed. A cessation of hostilities is more an orchestrated lull in the fighting than a formal ceasefire. Thus far, however, the agreement, although partial and fragile, is holding better than many expected. The intensity of the fighting has dwindled more than during previous attempts. Americas State Department said it had not heard of any significant violations of the agreement, though that depends on what is meant by significant. The Syrian Network for Human Rights, a British-based NGO, reported nearly 80 breaches (including the possible use of poison gas) in the first few days, resulting in 13 civilian deaths.

On the same fairly positive note, Bashar al-Assads government has allowed deliveries of humanitarian aid to besieged communities, including some in rebel-controlled areas. The UN was aiming to have reached 150,000 people by the end of the first week. It reckons that there are at least 450,000 people trapped in towns and villages across the country. Mr Assad told a German television station on March 1st that his government would do our part so that the whole thing works.

Some scepticism is warranted. The agreement excludes both Islamic State (IS) and Jabhat al-Nusra (JAN), al-Qaedas Syrian branch. It labels them terrorist groups. As such both can be targeted, either by the regime with its Russian and Iranian backers, or by the American-led anti-IS coalition. But JAN, in particular, operates alongside more mainstream rebel groups supported by America and its allies.

There are thus many potential flashpoints where the regime can say it is attacking designated terrorists, but is actually going after groups supposedly protected by the agreement. In largely rebel-held Idlib province, the Western-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA), Ahrar-al-Sham (a powerful Salafi outfit) and JAN all share control. It is doubtful whether either Russian or Syrian aircraft, equipped only with dumb bombs, can target one group without hitting others. The regime also says that JAN and IS are operating in Ghouta and Daraya, suburbs of Damascus that it has long wanted to wrest back. Rebels say this is untrue.

An interactive guide to the Middle East's tangled conflicts

The biggest test case seems certain to be Aleppo. Russian air strikes in recent weeks have made it possible for regime forces, augmented by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and various Iranian-backed proxy militias, to come close to a complete encirclement of pre-war Syrias biggest city. The Russians insist that Aleppos defenders are dominated by JAN. FSA sources say that JAN has fewer than 1,000 fighters in Aleppo, a small fraction of the groups in the city that are affiliated to it.

An all-out attack on Aleppo can probably be ruled out. The regime does not have enough troops to fight street by street against well-prepared localsthe kind of battle that causes heavy casualties. Nor is Russia able to deploy enough precision-guided munitions to make air power count for much in such a densely packed city. The Institute for the Study of War, a think-tank in Washington, DC predicts that the regime and its allies will instead pursue a slow siege-and-starve campaign to wear down the citys defenders without getting so many of their own men killed.

As part of the plan to isolate Aleppo, the regime is depending on Kurdish YPG fighters and Russian air strikes to cut off all the northern supply routes from Turkey. That is another reason to fear that the cessation of hostilities will be short-lived. The Kurds have said they will abide by that agreement unless attacked. But Turkeys president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, says that it has no bearing on his countrys military campaign to prevent the Kurds from controlling Syrias northern border, which he sees as a threat to Turkeys own security.

For now, a pause in the fighting, even if confined only to some areas, suits almost everyone. But the chances are slim that an agreement so rickety will last long enough to provide a platform for serious peace talks in Geneva.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,Loyal to the core,[],"WITH all the pomp, pageantry and protest-deterring security, which are traditional at such affairs, the annual session of Chinas rubber-stamp legislature, the National Peoples Congress (NPC), will open on March 5th. Its agenda includes an unusually weighty topic: the discussion (and inevitable approval) of a plan for the countrys economic development in the next five yearsthe Communist Partys recipe, in effect, for ensuring that the worlds second-largest economy does not stall. But many of the officials at the meeting will be worrying about a more pressing matter: their jobs.

The biggest reshuffle in five years of leadership posts at every level of the Communist Party is getting under way. Hundreds of thousands of party bosses and their colleagues will be replaced, in everything from township party committees to state-owned enterprises. These changes will affect a series of other appointments: party leaders at every level are sometimes given concurrent titles such as mayor, CEO, or, in the case of Xi Jinping, whose main job is as the partys general secretary, the largely honorific role of president.

The drawn-out process will culminate late in 2017 with sweeping changes at the very top of the party. This will involve the retirement of five of the seven current members of the Politburos Standing Committee. The only members of that body who are almost certain to keep their jobs are Mr Xi and the prime minister, Li Keqiang. Six out of the 18 ordinary members of the Politburo are also due to retire.

For Mr Xi these changes both high and low will be vital to the success of his policies for the rest of the time he has in power. When he took over in 2012, Mr Xi inherited a party bureaucracy stuffed at the highest levels with appointees of his two immediate predecessors as party chief (Hu Jintao, and before him, Jiang Zemin), and at the lower levels by officials used to running their localities in a manner suited to Mr Hus priorities. With the upcoming reshuffle, Mr Xi has an opportunity to stack the party hierarchy with his own loyalists. No wonder, then, that foreign dignitaries find Chinese leaders distracted.

As much as the five-year plan, the five-yearly cycle of job uncertainty and related tension has determined the working rhythm of Chinas bureaucracy since the 1980s, when a two-term limit was imposed on most leadership positions. Da huanjie, or big changeovers of personnel, occur in the build-up to, and right after, each of the partys five-yearly congresses, the next of which (the 19th) will take place late in 2017 (not to be confused with the NPC, which is not concerned with party affairs).

Mr Xi took over immediately after the 18th congress. By party convention, he too is subject to a two-term limit. That makes the 19th congress crucial for the consolidation of his power. It was Mr Hu (with help from a retired but ever-solicitous Mr Jiang) who supervised preparations for the 18th congress. So the build-up to the 19th will be Mr Xis first opportunity to make his mark on the appointment of so many officials. It will also be his last such opportunity before he prepares to retire at the 20th congress in 2022, assuming that is his plan.

Mr Xi will only concern himself with the most important job changes; it is the partys all-powerful and highly secretive Organisation Department that will decide on most of them, based on his guidelines. These, it would appear, suggest that candidates must be unswervingly loyal to Mr Xi. In recent weeks, several provincial party chiefs have hailed Mr Xi as the core of the party leadership, a term that had long been abandoned in favour of language that suggested a more collective style of rule. Mr Xi, it appears, has no scruples about being seen as the pre-eminent strongman.

Whos up?

During the NPC, which normally convenes for about ten days, foreign journalists will have a rare opportunity to see the provincial party bosses who are likely to get jobs in the Politburo after the 19th congress (media are given access to many of the meetings at which delegates, grouped by province, parrot the party line). But it is still far from clear which of them, if any, are being groomed by Mr Xi to replace him and Mr Li after the congress in 2022. At this point ten years ago, there was already speculation that Mr Xi and Mr Liboth then provincial chiefswere front-runners.

Today the field looks more open. The party boss of Guangdong province, Hu Chunhua, and that of Chongqing, Sun Zhengcai, are possibles. But they may be handicapped by their lack of strong connections with Mr Xi. Others include Chen Miner, the party chief of Guizhou province who once worked closely with Mr Xi, and various officials in the central leadership including Ding Xuexiang of the Central Committees General Office and Zhong Shaojun of the partys Central Military Commission (which Mr Xi heads).

Unlike a decade ago, there are rumours that Mr Xi may be thinking of flouting convention and staying on after 2022. If this is so, it has not resulted in any less scrambling for top positions. The confusion this contest has caused among subordinates, says Chongyi Feng of the University of Technology in Sydney, Australia, is slowing down implementation of the market-oriented reforms that Mr Xi has promised. So too is Mr Xis campaign against corruption; officials fearful of being accused of graft by rivals prefer to keep their heads down rather than get involved in projects involving large amounts of money. Minxin Pei of Claremont McKenna College in America describes a Chinese bureaucracy paralysed by fear. The Organisation Department is looking out for anyone who is at risk of daibing, or carrying sickness, meaning transferring a habit of corruption from one job to another.

One attribute that may help candidates for promotion is being well-versed in the Communist canon. In recent days, official presses have been rolling out copies of an obscure Maoist text: Work Method of Party Committees, first published in 1949. Mr Xi has ordered officials to study the tract, which includes an instruction that party bosses must (metaphorically) learn to play the piano. This, Mao explains, means they should attend to everything just as a pianist uses all ten fingers. They should not give all [their] attention to a few problems, to the exclusion of others. Mr Xi himself, with pressing economic matters to attend to as well as the reshuffle, should perhaps take note.",[]

economist.com,2016-02-27 00:00:00,Russia calls the shots,[],"PEACE in our time or a cynical diplomatic fudge? The best that can be said of the provisional agreement on a cessation of hostilities between at least some of the warring parties in Syria, hammered out (again) on February 22nd between John Kerry, Americas secretary of state, and Sergei Lavrov, his Russian opposite number, is that it appears to have slightly more solid foundations than a similar attempt earlier this month.

The agreement, which is due to come into force on February 27th, was endorsed by Vladimir Putin in a rare television address after he conferred by telephone with Barack Obama. As The Economist went to press, details of how it would be implemented were still being worked through. It looks likely that at least one of the requirements of the UN peace plan outlined by the UN Security Council late last year may be fulfilled: the lifting of sieges of rebel-held towns by government forces and the delivery of humanitarian aid to their starving populations. Some aid convoys began to roll from Damascus last week and more will follow. Bashar al-Assad, Syrias president, has also promised to hold (meaningless) parliamentary elections on April 13th. Just about everything else remains unclear.

The Russians have given themselves and Mr Assad plenty of latitude in the way they wish to interpret the agreement. The Syrian regime refuses to describe it as a ceasefire, instead referring to a mere suspension of combat operations. In practice, it may not even amount to that.

Islamic State (IS) and Jabhat al-Nusra (JAN), al-Qaedas Syrian affiliate, are officially designated as terrorist groups by both Moscow and Washington, and are thus explicitly excluded from the agreement. But JAN, intermingled with other rebel groups, is active on almost every front in the civil war, from Daraa in the far south of the country to Aleppo in the north. JAN is also the leading player in a rebel alliance that includes Ahrar al-Sham, a powerful Salafist outfit, and other less extreme groups. It controls most of Idlib province to the west of Aleppo. Having largely completed the encirclement of Aleppo, the regimes next priority is to cut off and squeeze Idlib. Fabrice Balanche of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy argues that if Russia continues air strikes against JAN, as the agreement entitles it to, it will be impossible for other groups fighting alongside it to respect the ceasefire.

An interactive guide to the Middle East's tangled conflicts

Before the assault on Idlib can begin in earnest, regime forces will need to lock in the gains of the Russian-backed assault of the past few weeks. The offensive has retaken swathes of rebel-held territory and cut off supply lines to Aleppo from Turkey with the help of Syrian-Kurdish YPG fighters, whom the Americans regard as their principal ally on the ground against IS. Such has been its speed that Mr Assads forces are in need of a breather. The timing of the ceasefire will thus be very convenient if it allows them to construct defensive lines against possible counter-attacks and foments division between those of their enemies abiding by the agreement and those ignoring it.

Mr Putins willingness to use hard power, and the Wests fear of confronting him, are allowing him to call the shots. A ceasefire on his terms, at a moment of his choosing, looks uncomfortably like a version of the Minsk 2 agreement struck a year ago to bring an end to the fighting in eastern Ukraine. Soon after, the town of Debaltseve fell to Russian-backed separatists after a devastating artillery assault. Since then there have been thousands of ceasefire violations by pro-Russian forces. Around 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed.

As things stand, the ceasefire meets all of Mr Putins diplomatic and military requirements. It confirms the survival of Mr Assads regime, potentially divides the rebels, puts Turkey on the back foot and panders to Western concerns by promising a more concerted effort against IS and the possibility of a political settlement that helps staunch the flow of refugees into Europe. From the perspective of Moscow and Damascus, whats not to like?",[]
economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,When elephants battle,[],"AS SAUDI ARABIA and Iran jostle for power in the Middle East, Lebanon has managed to maintain an uncomfortable balance between the two. Saudi Arabia has long been chummy with Lebanons Sunni politicians and some of its Christians. Iran supports the Lebanese Shia, not least through Hizbullah, a militia-cum-political party. It has also snuggled up to some Lebanese Christian groups. Nonetheless, an uneasy calm prevailed between Lebanon and the two regional powers. Apparently no longer.

On February 19th Saudi Arabia said it had suspended $4 billion in funding for the French and Americans to train and equip the Lebanese army and security forces. Ostensibly the kingdom objects to Hizbullah, and therefore Irans influence, which they see as exemplified by Lebanons failure to condemn an attack in January on the Saudi embassy in Tehran. Saudi Arabia then warned its citizens against travelling to the tiny country, and accused Hizbullah of smuggling drugs into the kingdom and sending mercenaries to Yemen and Syria. On March 2nd the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council designated Hizbullah a terrorist organisation.

Hizbullah and Iran are certainly amassing power in the Middle East, often in unsavoury ways. They have propped up Bashar al-Assad, Syrias blood-spattered despot, and provided men and weapons to help Iraq fight Islamic State. They are also thought to be helping Yemens rebel Houthis. But although in Lebanon Hizbullah has been blocking the nomination of a new president, it has done little new to ignite Saudi anger there. The move probably has more to do with a bolderand often clumsyforeign policy under King Salman and his favoured son, Muhammad. Their fear of Iran has bordered on panic, not least since Iran concluded a nuclear deal with America and other powers.

Saudi Arabias moves against Lebanon seem amateurish. Even if the Lebanese parties wanted to, they could do little to diminish the role of Hizbullah, which acts as a state within the state and also dominates the government. Saudi Arabia sometimes acts with bombast and violence that makes it look like the Donald Trump of the Arab world, says Rami Khouri of the American University of Beirut.

The result is likely to be that the Saudis lose influence in Lebanon, possibly to Iran. The squabble risks destabilising a divided nation that is already buckling under the weight of Syrian refugees. Lebanons politicians, divided by their attitudes to Saudi Arabia and Iran, among many other things, are already trading accusations. Hizbullah and the Future Movement, the main Sunni party led by Saad Hariri, the son of a revered former prime minister, may call off their regular meetings.

This probably makes Lebanon less secure. It is facing threats from the war next door in Syria and from terrorists inspired by it at home. Signalling its concern, the UN has called on other countries to make up the $4 billion. Many Lebanese fear that if the row escalates, the economy will suffer. They worry that the Gulf will kick out Lebanese residents, who send home hefty remittances. Saudis and other Gulf spenders may well ignore the travel warnings and still spend their money on holidays in freewheeling Beirut, but far fewer have come since the carnage started in Syria.

The squall looks unlikely to blow over. Hassan Nasrallah, Hizbullahs leader, piled on the rhetoric against the Al Sauds on March 1st, accusing them of crimes and massacres. Hussein Shobokshi, a Saudi columnist, does not think the kingdom will back down. Any rise in Irans role will hurt the Lebanese more than us, he says.

Hizbullah has even suggested that Saudi Arabia has cut the cash because it is going bankrupt as a result of low oil prices. Loth to miss an opportunity, Iran has offered to make up the money. The Iranians aim may be nothing more than to tweak royal Saudi noses; they can barely afford such a sum.",[]
economist.com,2016-02-11 15:44:24,Diversity fatigue,[],"RONALD REAGAN once said that The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, Im from the government and Im here to help. Today they are run a close second by 12 words: Im from human resources and Im here to organise a diversity workshop. Most people pay lip service to diversity in public. But what they think in private can be very different. Some HR consultants have even started to worry about diversity fatigue.

The arguments in favour of diversity are powerful. The most obvious is that diversity is simply a fact about the modern world. Women have entered the workforce in huge numbers. Mass immigration has transformed Western societies: even in once-homogeneous countries such as Sweden, foreign-born people make up 14% of the population. Gay men and women increasingly feel no need to stay closeted, in or out of the workplace. Companies that ignore this may starve themselves of talent, as well as be out of touch with their customers. Adding to the evidence for diversitys benefits, a study published this week by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that the more female executives firms have, the more profitable they seem to be.

There is also evidence to support the commonsense idea that encountering people with different ideas and different perspectives can boost creativity. Ronald Burt, a sociologist at the University of Chicago, has produced several studies which suggest that people with more diverse sources of information consistently generate better ideas. Sara Ellison of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has shown that mixed-sex teams can produce more creative solutions than those dominated by either men or women. And internal surveys at Google have found that diverse teams are often the most innovative.

Given all these benefits, why the talk of diversity fatigue? David Livermore provides some interesting thoughts on this question in his new book, Driven by Difference: How Great Companies Fuel Innovation through Diversity. As president of the Cultural Intelligence Centre, a consulting firm, Mr Livermore is a card-carrying member of the diversity industry. But over the years he has been struck by how many companies complain that they are not getting much return for their investment in diversity. Tomorrow I have to go to a diversity-training workshop, he heard one man say to another in the gym. Oh God! came the reply. Thats right up there with getting a root canal.

Mr Livermore says that one reason for this is that talk of diversity often comes accompanied with a faint air of menace. Managers are dragooned into sitting through lengthy seminars on equal opportunities. They are fearful of saying anything that departs from the correct line on any diversity-related matter. And they feel under pressure to hit their recruitment quotas. The more important reason, however, is that proponents of diversity often fail to acknowledge that there can be a trade-off: to get the benefits, employers must be prepared for, and deal with, some problems. Diversity does not produce better results automatically, through a sort of multicultural magic. It does so only if it is managed well.

The biggest challenge is to do with trust. Employees need to trust each other if they are to produce their best work. This is particularly true if that work involves tackling creative projects that have a high risk of failure and a circuitous path to success. But it is easier to establish trust with those you have a lot in common with. Mr Livermore notes that diverse teams have a higher degree of variance in their performance than homogeneous teams. They are more likely to produce truly innovative ideas, but they are also more likely to fail completely. He suggests that managers of diverse teams need to work hard at establishing bonds of trust. They need to set lots of short-term goals so that teams can see the benefits of working together. They also need to recognise that different groups forge trust in different ways. Westerners tend to think that getting straight down to the task at hand is the best way to do this, whereas South Asians believe in establishing rapport over cups of tea first.

A second challenge is to do with culture. Too many companies fail to rethink their management styles as they open their doors to new groups. They issue ambiguous instructions which presume that everyone comes from the same background. For example, one Western company urged its employees to act like an owner without realising that, in some cultures, acting like an owner means playing golf all day. They evaluate people on their willingness to speak up without realising that some peoplewomen especially, in many countriesare brought up to hold their tongues and defer to authority. Mr Livermore argues that managers need to work harder at getting members of silent minorities to speak up and, failing that, give them other ways of contributing to the collective effort.

Beyond box-ticking

Your columnist would add a third challenge: distinguishing between genuine cultural diversity and the box-ticking sort. It is easy for companies to think that they have embraced diversity if they appoint the right number of people with the right biological characteristics. That can be hollow if they all come from the same backgroundsif, say, all the black people a firm promotes to management are Harvard-educated sons of diplomats.

The growing diversity of the workforce should be a cause for celebration. Getting rid of discrimination against minorities represents a triumph for natural justice as well as a chance to make society as a whole stronger. But the celebration needs to be mixed with hard work and clear thinking. Companies will find it hard to make a success of diversity if they refuse to recognise that it brings challenges as well as opportunities. And they will find it impossible to confront these challenges if they dismiss any reasonable question that is raised about diversity policies as if it were a plea to go back to the age when white men ruled the roost.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-09 19:35:49,The second George: How George Martin earned his title as the fifth Beatle,[],"THE term Fifth Beatle conjures up the impression of a Svengali or sinister eminence grise. Everyone wants to be the fifth Beatle, not limited to Eddie Murphys disgruntled sax man Clarence Walker on ""Saturday Night Live"", and even Apu from ""The Simpsons"". It's also been a question of debate among Beatles fans and scholars: was it their original bassist, Stu Sutcliffe, their devoted roadie, Neil Aspinall, their manager, Brian Epstein, their occasional keyboard player, Billy Preston, or even their long line of drummers, Pete Best, Andy White, and Jimmie Nicol?

The answer, of course, is none of the above. George Martin was a man of rarer quality. Every rock-and-roll story involves talent and luck, and no band was more talented or luckier than the Beatles. After a purely mediocre audition and subsequent dismissal by Decca, they had nowhere left to go until, as legend has it, George Martin took a chance on them. The story of Mr Martin, the last man in London giving the Beatles their lucky break, is a good one. But also romantically far-fetched.

The Beatles, and for that matter, The Rolling Stones and the London R&B scene, would have happened anyway, but their timing and its impact would have been far different. Mr Martin would probably have remained an anonymous producer of novelty hits like Hole in the Ground, and the Beatles brief brushes with a recording studio would have yielded up some scorching covers, and maybe an obscure B-side original on a Rhino Records compilation.

What the Beatles really found in George Martinbesides a musician friend, a patrician headmaster, a father figure, and a championwas a producer who was also a listener. He let this scruffy band be a bandnot a slick front man with faceless backup handsand allowed them to record original material during their very first sessions. This was unheard of; it made no sense. John Lennon and Paul McCartney had a negligible track record as songwriters. But they had taste, style, attitude, chops, and talent matched by collective ambition. Mr Martin respected that enough to fire their drummer, and bench his replacement, Ringo Starr. Mr Martin put Mr Starr on tambourine and brought in a session drummer for ""Love Me Do"", refusing to let the young quartet do less than their best. When Lennon brought in Please Please Me he was embarrassed that Mr Martin spotted the flaw in the lethargic tempo. He sent them packing back to Liverpool to work on it, eventually suggesting the dynamic coup de grace ending that would cap this, their first number-one record, a last barnstorming idea in a song full of them. The Beatles, beyond their abilities as performers of catchy music, constantly found ideas that were wholly lacking in the music of their day, the mediocrity by which we measure heroes. Mr Martin was the uncredited man behind many of those ideas, and so belongs in that pantheon of heroes.

Lennon summed up the bands working relationship with George Martin: George had done no rock and roll when we met him, and we had never been in the studio, so we did a lot of learning together. He had a very great musical knowledge and background, so he could translate for us and suggest a lot of things, which he did. Look chaps, I thought of this this afternoon, and I came up with this, and we said, Oh, great! Great! Oh, put it on here! These few words are a condensed history of Mr Martin's greatest hits: the opening chord of Hard Days Night, the Baroque piano solo on In My Life, the stately string quartet on Yesterday and the contrapuntal octet on Eleanor Rigby, the technical legerdemain of Strawberry Fields Forever, and the epic suite that closes the second side of Abbey Road. Often missing from that highlight reel is the fact that George Martin was all the while mentoring another Fab Four: his engineering proteges Norman Smith, Ken Townsend, Geoff Emerick and Ken Scott, all of whom contributed plenty to the music of the Beatles before their own brilliant careers.

Mr Martin embodied and innovated the role of the studio producer and arranger at a time when the world still didnt know the names Leiber and Stoller, Sam Phillips, Joe Meek, Shel Talmy or Phil Spector. Its hard to imagine Nelson Riddle or Billy Strayhorn cutting up magnetic tape and piecing it back together again, or figuring out the sonic demands of a backwards guitar solo. Mr Martin and mates got their hands dirty.

Mr Martin was not the only great musical midwife, of course: think of Willie Dixon and Muddy Waters, Kit Lambert and Pete Townsend, Jerry Wexler and Aretha Franklin, Andy Warhol and Lou Reed, Peter Jesperson and Paul Westerberg, Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson. The reason why Mr Martin was the fifth Beatle was because he contributed as much, if not more, than anyone to the Beatles music and its timelessness by dressing it up and enshrining it in timeless musical idioms--by producing it. To some critics, he softened the music or blunted the edge. But he never kowtowed to the band, even walking out on them during The White Album and damning it with faint praise forever after. Its just as important that he walked back in to Abbey Road and ""Abbey Road"" as well, the headmaster of boys become the dutiful father of men.",[]
economist.com,,MBA diary: Why you probably don't need an MBA,[],"Adnan Sarwar, a former MBA student and current Economist intern, gives prospective MBAs five things to consider

Dont fund yourself.

In my case it was 24,000 ($33,800), distance learning, over three years. You get books and some tuition, but mostly you are on your own. Students get together to form study groups; some work hard while others are busy with their jobs and families. Everyone passes.

I managed to find 8,000 for the first year. Then the second year came around and I struggled. I spoke to my student support officer who offered little support. I should have had all the money sorted, he said. Welcome to the real world.

I was working in a bar at the time to pay for the course. Most of my cohort were funded by their companies and then locked into contracts for a few years. That is the way to do an MBA: your firm pays and then guarantees you a job.

Do not believe it is for the elite.

The interview to get admitted to business school wasnt robust. Conversation quickly moved to making sure Id paid my deposit. If you can pay, you can play. Once on the programme, I had assumed I would be in a room with just the business elite. Not so: some students were excellent, some good, some terrible.

There were foreign students on my course who could not speak English well. You will be up until 4am trying to explain to people in your study group why they can't write the presentation slides because their language skills arent up to it. And they will simply change your PowerPoint before you present it.

Some teams tried the inclusive approach and were marked down. The smart approach was not to let these students near the laptops. But they had funding and, with help, they got through. They are currently sat at some management consultancy in London forecasting your company into the ground while you pay thousands of pounds a day for it. An MBA does not infer quality.

It will not make you a genius.

Businesses have been run well without MBAs for millennia. The merchants of Carthage did not need them. Kanye West does not have one. That said, an MBA will get you up to speed on business in a general sense. But so will a good book, for far less money and time.

The MBA is a club like any other: you are either in or out, that is its main selling point. Incompetent people will get in, and theyll leave incompetent. But they will beat non-MBAs at job interviews because they had the money to attend a prestigious school and scraped through on Cs. You will not leave business school with the next Google, YouTube or Twitter in your head; if it is to happen, it will happen anyway. Reading case studies about Steve Jobs is not enough for you to become like him. To start something takes imagination and courage.

Do you really want to meet these people?

Business schools constantly boast about the network students can tap into. Dont be fooled. Do you need to pay thousands to meet middle managers from industries that you have no interest in? I keep in touch with exactly one person from my year at business school, but if I'd met him in any other situation, we'd have become friends. I see a couple of others on occasion. But that's it, one person. If you gave me 24,000 now and asked me to go and network, Id join a club like Soho House or fly to Gstaad and spend a season working in a ski-rental shop. Id meet everybody I needed to, or at least someone who knows someone.

Do it because you want to.

I was trying to please Asian parents. I had failed them in my teens by not getting into medical school, and instead joining the army. You cannot impress Asian parents. Unhappiness is their default. And honestly, I believe they enjoy it. My mother has berated me for over twenty years for not getting an arranged marriage. She never tires of it. I call home to tell her how my job at The Economist is going and there it isthat painful pause, hear it?and then When are you going to get married? If I did get married, my mother would be unimpressed by my choice. If she chose my wife, she would be unimpressed that I was not yet Lakshmi Mittal. My mother is unrelenting.

Which is to say: remember, you do not need an MBA. Only do it if you want to. Food and water are needs; an MBA is an expensive want. Like a Rolex. And that didn't impress my mother either.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,The Economist,[],"OF ALL the theories to explain the unexpected success of Donald Trumps presidential campaign, this, surely, is the most novel. Forget about a disaffected working class buffeted by globalisation and automation, pent-up racial resentments finding an outlet or the advent of the 24-hour news cycle. No: in the assessment of Daniel Drezner, a professor of international politics at Tufts University, its the political scientists who are to blame.

Although clearly tongue-in-cheek, this hypothesis sounds less absurd now than it would have done before 2008, the year that four American academics brought out a book called The Party Decides: Presidential Nominations Before and After Reform (TPD). The books main thesis is that political parties have formidable power to influence voters in presidential primaries.

TPD was never a bestseller. Nonetheless, it has gained more attention from journalists than any political-science book in recent memory. According to Google News, 763 articles have cited TPDs title since the start of 2011. Just over 500 more contain its catchphrase invisible primary, which describes how candidates compete for support from party grandees before the first votes are cast. Such coverage is comparable only to that received by bestsellers like Dreams From My Father by Barack Obama (758) or Michael Lewiss Moneyball (784).

During Mr Obamas presidency, a new generation of young journalists has emerged who are focused on Washington, DC. They eschew the sources, leaks and scoops that are pursued by their more traditionally minded colleagues in favour of the sage counsel of academic political science. Many of these whizz-kids have treated TPD with awed reverence. For much of 2015 they dismissed Mr Trumps chances in the Republican primaries by relying on the books claim that parties usually guide voters towards acceptable nominees. But it was precisely by making such overconfident pronouncements, Mr Drezner argued recently in the Washington Post, that the authors sowed the seeds of their own demise.

Scientists are well acquainted with the observer effect, which, in physics, for example, stipulates that the characteristics of a subatomic particle can never be fully known because they are changed by the act of measuring them. Similarly, wrote Mr Drezner, The Party Decides has been the primary theory driving how political analysts have thought about presidential campaigns. It seemed to explain nomination fights of the recent past quite well. However, in previous elections, there were no crowds of journalists citing TPD. This time, says Mr Drezner, Republican decision-makers read smart take after smart take telling them that Trump didnt have a chance...so GOP party leaders didnt take any action. Except that the reason smart analysts believed Trump had no chance was because they thought GOP leaders would eventually take action.

The 2016 primaries are putting political scienceas exemplified by TPDto a very public test. Republicans in Congress have already sought to cut off public funding for research in the discipline. Now, if it is seen to have failed, it will slow down the steady advance into the mainstream media that the field has made over the past eight yearsand could possibly bring it to a halt.

When journalists write about gravitational waves, they talk to scientists. When they write about interest rates, they talk to economists. But until recently, when they wrote about elections, they often pretended that academic expertise did not exist. In 2005, when I came to Washington, writes Ezra Klein, a founder of Vox, an explanatory-journalism site, knowing political science wasnt a legitimate form of knowing about politics, or at least it wasnt presented as one to young journalists like me. The numbers bear him out: since 2006 there have been 7.5 references to economist in the New York Times for every mention of a political scientist.

A political (journalism) revolution

Theories abound to explain this imbalance. One hypothesis is self-segregation: journalists with a penchant for numbers are likely to gravitate towards covering obviously quantitative fields, whereas those with a more narrative bent may prefer politics. Another is the availability of sources. There is no one person who can speak for, say, consumers or debtors as a whole, so economic journalists must resort to experts who study aggregate behaviour. In contrast, politics is conducted by a small number of individuals who are usually keen to talk to reporters, making outsiders analysis seem redundant. Arthur Lupia of the University of Michigan argues that, whereas fields like economics can seem objective and technical, political issues are visceral, emotional and tribal. People hold immovable beliefs about politics, he concludes, and have no inclination to defer to impartial experts on such topics. And Mr Drezner thinks that there is little appetite among either reporters or readers for the dispiriting structural analyses that are professors stock in trade.

Throughout George W. Bushs presidency, most American political reporters were allergic to any numbers more advanced than a cherry-picked poll result. The tide did not start to shift until 2008, when Nate Silver, a baseball writer who developed statistical expertise by predicting how players would perform, began posting forecasts for that years topsy-turvy primary elections online as an anonymous blogger. Mr Silver used techniques that any political scientist would find familiar.

Thanks to rigorous analysis and a sterling track recordhe was bullish on Mr Obamas chances long before the Iowa caucuses, and correctly called 49 of 50 states in the general electionMr Silver developed a devoted following. Eager to test the audience for what would soon be called data journalism, in 2010 the New York Times began hosting his blog, which he called FiveThirtyEight for the number of votes in Americas electoral college. Even Mr Silver, who by that point was a well-known forecasting whizz, could not have predicted how big the market for his cleverer-than-thou takes would become: on the eve of the 2012 election 20% of the visitors to the papers website read FiveThirtyEight.

Mr Silvers success set off a modest paradigm shift in political journalism. Perhaps his biggest draw was his thinly veiled disdain for the innumerate punditry that ruled the airwaves. Mr Silver delighted in savaging commentators who relied on vapid cliches like momentum shifts and game-changers. And unlike any other commentator in Washington, he was willing to put his money where his mouth was.

In October 2012 Joe Scarborough, a television presenter and former congressman, took aim at Mr Silver, writing: Anybody that thinks that this race is anything but a toss-up right now is such an ideologue, they should be kept away from typewriters, computers, laptops and microphones for the next ten days, because theyre jokes. Mr Silver promptly tweeted him an offer of a $2,000 bet that Mr Obama would win, which Mr Scarborough wisely passed up. Mr Silver had brought the rules of political science to Beltway journalism: no longer were all opinions equally valid. Some interpretations were right, some were wrong, and every election provided a new opportunity to put them to the test.

Like all good businesses, FiveThirtyEightwhich was acquired by ESPN in 2013quickly attracted imitators and competitors. Mr Klein started Vox, the New York Times established a new quantitatively minded section, called The Upshot, and the Washington Post annexed a blog, called The Monkey Cage, dedicated to political science. What was once Mr Silvers lonely crusade soon became an echo chamber. And although these sites occasionally conducted their own statistical studies, they mostly relied on existing academic work, giving political scientists an audience of unprecedented scale.

At the same time a movement was developing within political science to expand its reach beyond the ivory tower. In 2013 the American Political Science Association devised a plan to increase the fields impact. Mr Drezner began advocating loudly for political scientists to publish papers on subjects where a consensus existed among the media and policymakers that was strongly refuted by academic literature. We got tired of hearing people say things like Values voters determine the outcome of this election, says Lynn Vavreck of UCLA. We got tired of hearing things written into the history books that werent true.

One group of professors who heard this message were the authors of TPD. Although their writing style does not quite qualify the book as a page-turner, TPD is essentially organised as a chronological narrative that is free of jargon and is sometimes outright funny. For example, it calls the share of delegates a candidate has won when a nomination is decided the fat lady share, in homage to the saying It aint over til the fat lady sings.

The books argument is simple, convincing and provocative. Following the debacle of the Democratic convention in 1968, when police and street protesters clashed violently for days while delegates chose a pro-Vietnam-war candidate against the electorates wishes, Americas two major political parties introduced binding primary elections to let the public select nominees. But in the very first election cycle under the new system, Democratic voters made the disastrous choice of an anti-war insurgent, George McGovern, who went on to lose 49 of the 50 states to Richard Nixon. As a result, TPD claims, the parties soon set about undermining their own reforms. After a brief period of trial and error, they succeeded, maintaining a veneer of democratic legitimacy while all-but-inevitably guiding voters towards the preferred choice of party heavyweights and interest groups. The reformers of the 1970s tried to wrest the presidential nomination away from insiders and to bestow it on rank-and-file partisans, the authors write. But the people who are regularly active in party politics have regained much of the control that was lost...Insider control is not unshakable, but it has usually been sufficient to the task at hand for some two decades.

The arrow of causality

TPD backs up this claim with resounding evidence. For every contested primary between 1980, when the authors believe parties recovered their power over the process, and 2004 they measure the relative effect of polls, endorsements, fund-raising and media coverage on candidates delegate shares. Although successful candidates tend to fare well on all these indicators, the authors find that endorsementstheir preferred measure of party supportare the best single predictor of delegate-winning. More important, early endorsements tend to yield cash, news coverage and popularity later on. In contrast, an early fund-raising push, media bubble or poll surge does not usually produce a flurry of endorsements. They conclude that parties tell the electorate how to vote, rather than voters telling the party whom to support.

When TPD was first published on the eve of Mr Obamas election, it had virtually no impact on American politics. It was not until 2011, after Mr Silver cited the book in an article in the New York Times Magazine and the Republicans invisible primary to challenge Mr Obama was in full swing, that the public began to take notice: a look at Google searches reveals no significant interest for the phrase invisible primary before Mr Silvers article. By May 2012 invisible primary had caught up with a well-known term like efficient markets hypothesis by search volume. And just when awareness of TPD was growing, its thesis was bolstered by an extraordinary performance. From the summer of 2011 until the Republicans South Carolina primary in January 2012, a parade of candidates with no support from the political elite (Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich) took turns leading the polls. In the end it was Mitt Romneywhom many non-quantitative journalists dismissed as too moderate and establishment-friendly for an angry Republican electorate, even though he led the race for endorsements early onwho waltzed to the nomination.

So three years later, when a clownish insurgent called Donald Trump leapt to the top of the Republican polls, data journalists had their ammunition ready. In a story last July entitled Heres Why He Wont Win, Andrew Prokop of Vox predicted it would be hard for candidates like [Mr Trump] to appeal to party elites. Dear Media, Stop Freaking Out About Donald Trumps Polls was the title of a piece in November by Mr Silver. Donald Trump...will most likely follow the classic pattern of a party-backed decline, concurred Nate Cohn of The Upshot in July. And we wrote in late September that Outsiders dont win presidential nominations any more...barring a stunning reversal of precedent, [Mr Trumps] failure to impress GOP elders...all but precludes [him] from becoming the partys flag-bearer. In a daily reminder to readers that Mr Trumps bubble was sure to pop, FiveThirtyEight has paid homage to TPD by maintaining an endorsement primary tracker, which is updated each time a senior elected official announces support for a candidate. After Mr Trumps poor showing in Iowa, such observers had reason to feel smug.

One month later, however, it seems clear that Mr Trump is no Herman Cain. The first panic bells went off after his dominating performance in the New Hampshire primaries, which occurred in tandem with Bernie Sanderss trouncing of Hillary Clinton, the establishment favourite. (Bad Night for The Party Decides, Ryan Lizza of the New Yorker tweeted as the polls were closing.) Mr Trumps thumping win in South Carolina forced Jeb Bush, the original leader in the Republican endorsement primary, out of the race, setting off a new wave of sober predictions that the party would now clear the field for Marco Rubio to eviscerate Mr Trump one-on-one. Then came Mr Trumps 22-percentage-point win in Nevada, his victories in seven of the 11 Super Tuesday states and the continuing division of his opposition. Since late February the very Republican governors and senators who previously swore he had to be stopped have begun to offer him their endorsements. There isnt much time left for TPD to be proved right.

What good is political science if it flubs the biggest development in American politics in generations? The authors of TPD themselves are responding cautiously to what might look like humiliation. Martin Cohen, of James Madison University, plaintively maintains that the books statistical model has actually held up rather well. TPD did include a crucial caveat in its argument: The party and not individually powerful candidates decide nominationsbut only if the party can make up its collective mind.

TPD found that a high share of early endorsements usually leads to the nomination. Although Hillary Clinton was widely considered the insider favourite in 2008, her endorsement totals on the eve of the Iowa caucuses lagged far behind her husbands at the same stage in 1992 or Al Gores in 2000. Meanwhile, TPDs authors noted that Mr Obama, the eventual victor, had already amassed a healthy share of endorsements from low-level party insiders. This year, Mrs Clinton really has been the overwhelming endorsement leader, and looks set to cruise to victory. In contrast, among the Republicans in 2016, no candidate received significant endorsement support by historical standards. Mr Bush, the endorsement leader, had 30% less backing from the party ahead of the Iowa caucuses than the lowest previous total on that date by an eventual Republican nominee. The party really didnt decide, Mr Cohen says, and as a result it was left to the voters.

Yet Mr Cohen is not hiding behind this technicality. We think that its in the partys interest to decide, and that they should be deciding, he says. The fact that they failed to is a lack of foresight on their part. Even if TPDs statistical model is sound, its central claimthat American political parties have successfully beaten the reforms intended to entrust nominations to the electorateis hard to reconcile with Mr Trumps winning streak.

For political scientists, The Donalds success paves the way for a host of new questions. What determines which are the elections where a party can make up its collective mind? How far can a party stretch the preferences of its voters before they revolt? Within the academy, no one will suggest that the authors of TPD should be muzzled or ignored just because they failed to foresee Mr Trumps ascent.

For data journalists, however, the stakes are higher. Mainstream audiences will not be satisfied with excuses or technicalities: the best and the brightest said that Mr Trump could never win, and it looks as if they were wrong. One crucial corrective would be to actually read the original versions of academic political-science texts rather than relying on caveat-free summaries: a close reading of TPD applied to the 2016 Republican race might have been entitled The Party Hasnt Decided, So Anything Goes. Another would be to take a nibble of humble pie and recall that there is a reason political science sounds like an oxymoron: there are no iron laws in politics. There is only so much a study of ten primary campaigns between 1980 and 2004 can tell people about a new set of circumstances and candidates in 2016.

Ultimately, however, popular evangelists for political science need to stand their ground. For years, sceptics cited the failure of baseball teams assembled by Billy Beane (the protagonist of Mr Lewiss book, Moneyball) to win a championship as proof that statistics had no place in baseball. Today, virtually all these flat-earthers have been forced into early retirement. Every statistical model has its flaws, but presidential elections are still far easier to predict months in advance than, say, economic growth or the weather. Just like Mr Beanes Oakland Athletics, Mr Silvers disciples need to keep offering wagers to the Joe Scarboroughs of the world. In the long run, theyand therefore the voters who depend on them for information and analysiswill win more often than they lose.",[]

economist.com,2016-01-14 16:35:21,The other side of paradise,[],"SOFTWARE firms are supposed to be a paradise for talent. Not only are their workers fabulously paid, but they are showered with perks as well. They can gorge themselves on free food cooked by Cordon Bleu chefs. They can snooze in nap pods or, if they feel more energetic, work out in on-site gyms or take yoga classes. There are dry-cleaners on the premises to do their laundry and buses to ferry them to and from work.

There is some truth in this. Such companies have few resources other than their employees brains. And the battle for those brains is becoming more intense as the digital revolution reconfigures swathes of the business world. Giants such as Google and Facebook are seeking to reinforce their position at the heart of this new economy by investing heavily in research and expanding into ever more areas. Googles headcount has grown by 157% in the past five years, to about 60,000. Smaller startups are also scrambling to attract talent; and manufacturers are responding to the digitisation of their industries by hiring coders and other tech geeks. Carmakers such as GM, Ford, Nissan and Toyota have all set up research outposts in Silicon Valley.

This is producing a pay-and-perks arms race. The biggest companies are building awe-inspiring headquarters: Apples spaceship, designed by Norman Foster, will cover 2.8m square feet (260,000 square metres) and Googles new offices will sit under a vast, translucent dome. Some firms, such as Netflix, offer staff unlimited holidays. Facebook is offering up to $20,000 to female employees who want to freeze their eggs. Uber and Airbnb, two stars of the sharing economy, have lured away a couple of Googles top chefs, Alvin San and Rafael Monfort.

However, a career as a software developer or engineer comes with no guarantee of job satisfaction. A survey last year of 5,000 such workers at both tech and non-tech firms, by TINYPulse, a specialist in monitoring employee satisfaction, found that many of them feel alienated, trapped, underappreciated and otherwise discombobulated. Only 19% of tech employees said they were happy in their jobs and only 17% said they felt valued in their work. In many areas they were even more discontented than non-tech workers: 36% of techies felt they had a clear career path compared with 50% of workers in areas such as marketing and finance; 28% of techies said they understand their companies vision compared with 43% of non-techies; and 47% of techies said they had good relations with their work colleagues compared with 56% of non-techies.

Tech firms that offer lavish perks to their staff do not do so out of the goodness of their hearts. They offer them because they expect people to work so hard that they will not have time for such mundane things as buying lunch or popping to the dry-cleaners. As Gerald Ledford of the University of Southern Californias business school puts it, they are golden handcuffs to keep people at their desks. Some of the most extravagant perks are illusions: take as much holiday as you like may really mean take as little as possible, and as much as you dare. Some have vaguely sinister undertones: might the option for women to freeze their eggs end up becoming the expectation?

The tech economy is a ruthless meritocracy. A great lathe operator commands several times the wage of an average lathe operator, Bill Gates once said, but a great writer of software code is worth 10,000 times the price of an average software writer. The most talented workers can command princes ransoms. Google reportedly offered a star engineer $3.5m in stock to dissuade him from defecting to Facebook. And Facebook paid $1 billion for Instagram, mainly to hire its 13 employees. But in this business those who are merely good, rather than great, are expendable; they can expect to labour in obscurity while the stars get the credit.

On top of this merciless meritocracy is a layer of cruel fortune. No amount of talent or effort can make up for having chosen to work at Sidecar, a ride-sharing service which shut down in December, rather than Uber or Lyft, its still-expanding rivals. Moreover, tech startups typically attract talent by offering shares. Employees work like dogs in return for supposedly making a fortune when the firm goes public. However, such firms often use multiple classes of shares that preserve the biggest gains for insiders, leaving the employees with common stock that can easily lose value. In particular, startups have taken to offering later-stage investors guarantees that they will get their money back, if either a subsequent funding round or an eventual initial public offering (IPO) values their shares at a lower price than they are paying. When firms have to pay out on such guarantees, they generally do so by issuing extra shares, which dilute other common shareholders such as their staff.

Unicorns and unicorpses

Disappointments of this sort are becoming more common. A succession of startups, such as Square and New Relic, have sold their shares at substantial discounts to their previous valuations on going public. Others have been bought at a discount after abandoning hopes of an IPO: Gilt Groupe, an e-commerce firm, sold itself to Hudsons Bay Company for $250m, having reportedly enjoyed a unicorn valuation of above $1 billion in its earlier fundraising. Michael Moritz, a venture capitalist, talks about subprime unicorns and James Clark, an entrepreneur, talks about unicorpses. If there is another tech bust, it will be the employees who will be most hurt.

The tech industry offers fabulous rewards for a fortunate few: almost half of the worlds billionaires aged under 40 are tech types. It offers a wonderful life for many thousands more: they get to make serious money by turning science fiction into reality. But the industry is also rife with disappointments: endless toil that produces meagre returns; and dreams of reinventing the world that turn into just another tough and insecure job.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,A game of dare,[],"PEOPLE from many walks of life poured onto the streets of Rawalpindi near Islambad, Pakistans capital, on March 1st to honour a convicted murderer. Among the 100,000 or so mourners who crammed into Liaquat Park and surrounding streets were lawyers wearing the black suits of their profession, labourers bused in from around the country and even the odd expatriate businessman who had flown in for the occasion. The crowd was full of fury, directed at the government of Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, for the hanging the day before of Mumtaz Qadri. A former police bodyguard, he had assassinated his boss, Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab province, in 2011.

Taseer was a liberal-minded businessman turned politician who had earned the hatred of religious hardliners by lobbying for a presidential pardon for a poor Christian woman. She had been sentenced to death under Pakistans infamous blasphemy law that bans disrespect towards the Prophet and other holy personages. It was, Taseer said, a black law. It is often invoked against religious minorities on the flimsiest of grounds; evidence can rarely be challenged in court for fear of repeating the alleged blasphemy.

For killing Taseer, clerics declared Mr Qadri a ghazi or warrior. A mosque in Islamabad was named after him. Support for him among the 500,000-strong armed forces was so strong that the army chief at the time told foreign ambassadors that he was unable to issue a condemnation.

This week the government was careful to manage the backlash. It ordered broadcasters to downplay news of Mr Qadris execution and imposed a news blackout on his funeral. No leading politician dared comment.

Given the strength of support for Mr Qadri, it was not obvious that the government would dare to execute him. His legal team had exhausted all options. In a bold ruling in October the Supreme Court not only roundly rejected the teams arguments; it also asserted that the blasphemy law was not beyond criticism since it was man-made. Even so, Mr Sharifs party, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), or PML (N), could have sat indefinitely on Mr Qadris request for a presidential pardon, so ducking the risk of enraging its religiously conservative base.

That it did not do so is evidence of a growing readiness to stand up to intolerance and extremism. It follows a firestorm of terror attacks from the late-2000s onwards, culminating in the Pakistani Talibans assault on a school in Peshawar in December 2014 that killed more than 130 children. That event galvanised public opinion like nothing before. Since then the army, which in the past has used rabble-rousing Islamists to bash domestic and foreign opponents, has also turned its efforts to curbing extremism.

Politics no longer favours the hardliners, who tend to flourish during periods of military rule. Religious parties win few seats in a parliament dominated by the PML (N), while hardliners are divided over ideology. Mr Qadris sympathisers come from the usually non-violent Barelvi movement, Sunnis heavily influenced by Sufism. Barelvis are locked in competition for adherents with the Deobandi movement, to which the Taliban and most other militant groups belong. With their puritanical outlook and belief in going back to the basics of early Islam, Deobandis are deeply critical of Barelvi enthusiasm for such traditions as worshipping at the shrines of local Sufi saints. Barelvis have largely cheered the crackdown on militant groups, which has targeted Deobandi mullahs and seminaries. A leading Deobandi cleric, Mohammad Khan Sherani, backed the execution of Mr Qadri.

Mr Sharif cuts a strikingly more liberal figure than during his last stint in power, in the 1990s. Then he attempted to introduce sharia (Islamic law) and have himself declared commander of the faithful. Recently his government has pushed for Hindus, who make up 2% of the countrys population of 182m, to be allowed legally to register their marriages for the first time. On February 24th Punjab, which is controlled by PML (N), passed a law to protect women from violence (a move which a constitutionally empowered body of mullahs quickly declared to be un-Islamic). Mr Sharif has also thrown his support behind an Oscar-winning documentary critical of the widespread sanctioning of honour killings of women. He has vowed to change the law.

Much more remains to be done, including reining in a notorious mullah, Abdul Aziz, who has praised the Pakistani Taliban and promotes sectarian hatred from right under the governments nose in Islamabads Red Mosque. And there are still no signs of a crackdown on army-backed jihadists who restrict their activities to Afghanistan and India.

The blasphemy law also needs to be reformed or, even better, scrapped. But that is unlikely, given how many men may be ready to emulate Mr Qadri. Those who got close enough to Mr Qadris garlanded corpse this week reported a face with the beatific glow of a martyr.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,The big schmooze,[],"IN EUROPEAN politics a useful distinction is sometimes drawn between the clean right, a group which can include pretty flinty conservatives, and the dirty right, meaning those who cross the bounds of democratic decency, whether with race-baiting, threats of political violence or snarling challenges to the rule of law. That distinction has proved powerful in its day. In the French presidential elections of 2002, the main parties of left and right united behind an unprincipled machine politician, Jacques Chirac, to defeat his opponent, Jean-Marie Le Pen, a brutish demagogue. Parisians fondly remember the posters that popped up, urging: Vote for the crook, not the fascist.

Donald Trump, front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, is of the dirty right. He showed that when he called for a blanket ban on Muslims entering America, and advocated both the use of torture and the punitive killing of terrorists families, a war crime. He whips up crowds by lamenting that he cannot punch protesters in the face. He accuses the Mexican government of sending rapists to America, and promises to round up and deport 11m migrants who are in the country without papers (though, like Caesar weighing lives in the Coliseum, as president he would let good ones back in). In a television interview on February 28th he declined three times to disavow statements of support from a veteran leader of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), murmuring that he needed to research that white-supremacist group. Bringing history full-circle, the ageing Mr Le Pen sent word from France that, if American, he would vote Trump.

After months of near-silence, many conservative grandees suggested that Mr Trump had crossed a line. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, called his KKK response disgusting and disqualifying. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a rival presidential contender, offered a rebuke that blended principle with calculation: Mr Trumps equivocation was not just wrong, he explained, it makes him unelectable.

Yet nobody is reviving the spirit of France in 2002, when parties united to keep a bad man out of power. At the time of writing a single Republican senator, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, has declared that if Mr Trump is his partys nominee, he will back an independent conservative. Many more Republicans have said, queasily, that they will back whoever the party nominates. Others are not even that squeamish. On February 26th Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey endorsed Mr Trump, calling him the strongest candidate against Hillary Clinton. During his own, ill-fated presidential run, Mr Christie called the tycoons proposed Muslim ban ridiculous. Now he is proud to back him. Members of Congress have begun to endorse Mr Trump, and their numbers will grow.

There is a temptingly simple explanation for this embrace of Mr Trump: that the Republican Party is a consciously racist project, from top to bottom. The backlash against Mr Trumps half-dalliance with the KKK suggests something more complicated. History matters, for one thing. Nothing scars modern Europe as deeply as memories of fascism, Nazism and collaboration with the Holocaust: many nerves jangle when strutting authoritarians question the loyalties of religious minorities or suggest that undesirable outsiders should be rounded up. In America, nothing casts a darker shadow than slavery and racial segregation, so that overt anti-black racism is uniquely taboo. When Mr Trump seemed to test that taboo, lots of Republicans were sincerely horrified. Even Mr Trump knows he went too far: he now says he misheard questions about the KKK and spurns their support.

Dismayingly, attacks on Muslims and Mexicans do not set Republican nerves a-jangle to the same extent. In the 2015 American Values Survey, a large poll, 76% of Republicans said that Islam is at odds with American values. Many grassroots conservatives would call a Muslim entry ban an act of self-defence against terrorism, not bigotry. As for immigrants, 80% of Trump voters told the same survey that they are a burden rather than a source of strength for the country, by taking jobs, housing and health care.

At the same time, an unhappy America is more divided than ever along partisan lines. Many Republican politicians think of Mrs Clinton as actively wicked. They see a patriotic duty to keep her out of the White House, not least because the next president will choose at least one Supreme Court justice, after the death of Antonin Scalia. Some hope that Mr Trump may prove malleable. Others suspect that his views will doom their party, but dont know how to win without his voters.

Pandering as contempt

There is one more explanation for all the bigwigs and pundits rationalising Trump-support, while considering themselves good people who deplore racism. Mr Trumps critics, they contend, show snobbish contempt for the tycoons votersnotably older, often less-educated whites who feel left behind by wrenching social and economic changes. One congressman backing Mr Trump, Tom Marino of Pennsylvania, uses a term much in vogue just now, calling Trump voters the unprotected. It comforts Trump-endorsers to think they are standing up for underdogs, but they are letting themselves off too easily. Other Republicans seeking the presidency endlessly promise to protect anxious Americans, with everything from air strikes on Islamic State to curbs on work visas. Mr Trump stands out for the savagery with which he vows to frighten, punish and hurt those who he says are doing America down. Thats not protection, but vengeance.

Conservative grandees preparing to back Mr Trump are arguably the worst snobs of all. For they know that he is making promises to his supporters that are both nasty and impossible to keep. Like every tribune of the dirty right, Mr Trump thinks his voters are dupes: that is why he panders and lies to them without a qualm. If Republican bigwigs have shame or sense enough, there is still timejustto disown him.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,The Economist,[],"GREECES migrant crisis is getting worse. Macedonia has closed its border to all but a trickle of migrants, following the example of Austria and other countries along the so-called West Balkans route to Germany. Yet desperate Syrians and Iraqis continue to arrive at the Idomeni crossing point. On February 29th Macedonian police used tear gas against scores of migrants trying to break down the border fence. As The Economist went to press, more than 12,000 people were crammed into a tent camp with facilities for only 1,500. Food is in short supply. Its a tense situation, says Panagiota Siafaka, a social worker with the UN High Commission for Refugees.

So long as the border remained open, Greece could manage the flow of arrivals from Turkey. Now almost 30,000 migrants are bottled up in Greece. Nikos Kotzias, the foreign minister, expects the number to reach 150,000; local aid agencies worry that 200,000 people may arrive in March alone. Reception centres around Athens for migrants are hopelessly overcrowded. Half a dozen new ones, mostly refurbished former military camps, are quickly filling up. Local and international charities provide food and medical care. The state seems absent, but luckily ordinary people are here every day to help, says Mariana, a paediatrician working at Piraeus port, gesturing towards a group of elderly Greek women handing out bananas and chocolate bars to harassed mothers in headscarves.

Things will improve, if only gradually. Greece expects to receive a large chunk of the EUs new 700m ($760m), three-year humanitarian aid package for countries that host a lot of migrants. Of that, 300m would be spent this year. Athens-based aid agencies hope that funds will bypass the slow-moving Greek bureaucracy, going straight to needy migrants in the form of vouchers for food and housing.

INTERACTIVE: A guide to Europes migrant crisis, in numbers

But stemming the flow of migrants from Turkey is proving hard. A NATO naval mission was due to begin monitoring the strait between Greece and Turkey on February 29th, electronically locating smugglers boats so Turkish coastguards could nudge them back to shore. But on March 2nd the NATO vessels were still in port. The Greek defence ministry said Turkey had raised technical problems.

EU leaders hope for a breakthrough at a summit on March 7th with Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkeys prime minister. The Turkish government has yet to crack down on the people-smugglers. Diplomats in Athens believe the Turks will make a deal conditional on EU countries resettling Syrians from refugee camps in southern Turkey. Meanwhile, Turkey has agreed to take back economic migrants who crossed to the Greek islands from Turkey. After weeks of bureaucratic exchanges between the Greek and Turkish police, a first group of 270 Moroccans, Tunisians and Algerians were handed into Turkish custody on March 2nd at the land border in Thrace. A group of 150 Pakistanis will be next. It is a modest start, yet even a small reduction in numbers helps relieve Greeces migrant burden.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,We the networks,[],"IF A satirist were to create a parody of an international conference, amping up the insularity and tedious intricacies for comic effect, he might come up with something rather like the meeting that will take place this week in Marrakech. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, known as ICANN, will bring together 1,300 participants for 346 sessions. The gatherings include NCPH Reception and Informal Meeting: CSG with the NCSG and CJK Generation Panels Co-ordination Mtg with Integration Panel.

Barring any last-minute hiccups, though, something remarkable will happen at the meeting. After two years of negotiations, ICANN is set to agree on a reform that would turn it into a new kind of international organisation. If this goes ahead, a crucial global resource, the internets address system, will soon be managed by a body that is largely independent of national governments. And some of ICANNs champions reckon this is just a start. In future, similar outfits could be tasked with handling other internet issues that perplex governments, such as cyber-security and invasions of privacy.

The beauty of the internet is its openness. As long as people stick to its technical standards, anybody can add a new branch or service. For everything to connect, though, the network needs a central address book, which includes domain names (such as economist.com) and internet-protocol addresses (such as 216.239.38.21). Whoever controls the address book can censor the internet: delete a domain name and a website can no longer be found.

That is why, as the internet grew up, America decided not to hand control to the United Nations or another international body steered by governments. Instead, in 1998 it helped create ICANN, a global organisation that gives a say to everybody with an interest in the smooth running of the network, whether they be officials, engineers, domain-name holders or just internet users. Because few precedents existed, and because of a fear that ICANN would lack legitimacy, America kept it on a long leash. American approval is still required in some areas, including changes to the innards of the internets address system.

Most were happy with the arrangement at first. But American oversight came to seem odd as the internet grew into a vast global resource with much traffic no longer passing over American cables (see chart). Then came revelations that the National Security Agency had spied on internet users in America and elsewhere. The snooping was unrelated to the management of internet addresses. But Americas Department of Commerce, which oversees ICANN, was provoked to announce in March 2014 that it would relinquish its role if it were convinced that ICANN would be truly independent and able to resist power grabs by other governments and commercial interests.

Americas decision to let go triggered much wrangling and some stalling by those who benefit from the status quo. Gradually, though, plans for an independent organisation have come together. The new ICANN will resemble a state, says Thomas Rickert of eco, Germanys internet association and co-chairman of one of the main negotiation committees.

It will have a government (the organisations board), a constitution (its by-laws, which include its mission and core values), a judiciary (an independent review process, which leads to binding recommendations) and a citizenry of sorts (half-a-dozen supporting organisations and advisory committees, which represent the different interest groups). These will have the right to kick out the board and block its budget.

Even some of ICANNs harshest critics, such as Milton Mueller of the Georgia Institute of Technology, say the proposals are pretty good on balancethough he would like the citizenry to have more powers. One point, however, could cause trouble in Marrakech. More than a dozen countries, including Brazil, France and Russia, argue that governments will have too little sway in the new structure. ICANNs board is obliged formally to weigh advice from a government advisory council only if that group has adopted such advice with full consensus, meaning no government openly objects. The dissenting countries say that full consensus will be tough to achieve. Governments are being expected to jump over a higher bar than others, complains one representative from a dissenting state.

Discussions are likely to be heated, if incomprehensible to outsiders, but few expect the reform plans to be derailed in Marrakech. How American politicians will react is another matter. Some Republicans, in particular Senator Ted Cruz, who is running for president, dislike the idea of America letting go of ICANN. Opponents have not managed to pass legislation that would give Congress the right to stop the change: as things stand, a report sent to the relevant committees would suffice. But Republicans have blocked the commerce department from spending any money on the transition. Reform could well become mired in the presidential race, and other hurdles could pop up. Some lawmakers now argue that giving ICANN more independence amounts to the transfer of government property, which requires a vote by Congress.

Dissenting governments and recalcitrant Republicans notwithstanding, an independent ICANN is not only likely to come to pass but also to become a model for other sorts of internet governance. The network is becoming Balkanised, with each country seeking to control what goes on within its own borders. Without generally accepted global rules, governments are bound to create their own, even if these cannot be implemented. Multi-stakeholder outfits like ICANN, where all opinions are aired, might well be the best hope to come up with rules that work.

The consensual model is hardly perfect. It seems to work well for settling technical questions (see article) but can stumble when things get more political. And it is not clear who would launch other ICANN-like organisations. NETmundial, an initiative created in 2014 to do just that, has only produced some worthy internet governance principles.

Perhaps Fadi Chehade, ICANNs president and one of the instigators of NETmundial, will be more successful getting such efforts off the ground in his new job. He will step down after the meeting in Marrakech, to be succeeded by Goran Marby, a Swedish telecoms regulator, and join the World Economic Forum to create all sorts of multi-stakeholder groups. We need many little ICANNs, he says.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,Mr Rohanis complicated victory,[],"THE clerics disqualified the candidates, but they could not disqualify the people. So long were the queues outside many polling stations that Irans election commission postponed closing five times. Secular Iranians with pink hairdos stood in line waiting to vote against the mullahs. When a self-important hardline politician tried to queue-jump, they booed him to the back of the line.

In Jamaran, the Tehran district where Ayatollah Khomeini once berated western Satans, citizens cheered the architects of Irans overtures to the West as they came to vote. Muhammad Zarif, the foreign minister who negotiated the nuclear deal, got polite applause. A former president, Muhammad Khatami, who is perhaps Irans most popular politician despite being banned from state media, won a heros cheer.

By contrast, the turnout in south Tehran, a poorer, more conservative place, seemed dismal. Voters queued for hours in the north, but registered their ballots in the south within minutes. Organisers in the mosques which doubled as polling stations tried to rally their flock. They pinned posters in their porticos mocking Americas president, Barack Obama, and played nationalist songs over loudspeakers.

The Council of Guardians, a body packed with the Supreme Leaders followers, had done its best to rig the results in advance. They had banned most reformist candidates for the Majlis, or parliament, and for a body of Shia clerics, the Assembly of Experts, who select the Supreme Leader. But the reformists outsmarted them. They compiled lists of those who remained, and when they had run out of their own candidates, filled them with the most innocuous of their rivals. They cut deals with pragmatic conservatives, like parliaments speaker, Ali Larijani, whose deputy appeared on Tehrans reformist list.

The upshot was a List of Hope, that was reformist in parts. Sometimes voters had a choice only between hardline and moderate conservatives. Many candidates appeared on both the List of Hope and the hardliners list. We didnt know half the people on the list, and the half we did know we didnt like, said a Tehran businessman. But if you want change in the Middle East, you have two choicesreform what you can, or follow Syria.

In the capital the List of Hope won all 30 parliamentary seats and all but one of the 16 Assembly of Experts seats. Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, who has openly questioned the system of a single Supreme Leader, came first; Hassan Rohani, the president, third. Eight of the 30 were women. The reformist list won majorities in other cities including Isfahan, which hardliners had swept in 2012. In the Assembly of Experts, out went harshly pious hardline icons including Ayatollah Muhammad Yazdi, the current head of the body, and Muhammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi, the Revolutions chief surviving theorist. It was, as President Rohani put it, a demonstration of people power. They said in a loud voice: We want interactions with the world, not confrontation.

Given the overlap between the lists, the results are not quite so clear-cut. On a rough assessment of the 216 seats that were decided (69 have been pushed to a run-off round in late spring and five are reserved for minorities), the conservatives won just under half, far worse than their tally at the previous election in 2012. The reformists got almost 40%, up from about 10%. So independents, including Mr Larijani, will hold the balance of power.

That should give Mr Rohani more room for manoeuvre to push through the laws he needs to open Iran for foreign investment and claw back some of the assets Irans big conglomerates, controlled by clerics and Revolutionary Guards, amassed when Iran was cut off from the world. Most independents will depend on his budget if they want to bring roads and other goodies to their provinces.

Democracys messy

But parliament will also be a chaotic place. Having culled each others upper tiers, both parliamentary factions look rudderless. Mr Rohani, a consummate centrist, must decide whether to concentrate on the economy, as the Supreme Leader wants, or to pursue social change, as his supporters want. He has yet to keep his promise to release political dissidents incarcerated after the 2009 elections.

The situation with the new Council of Experts is equally murky, but crucial. It will hold office until 2024. Since Mr Khamenei is 76, it may well have to choose his successor as Supreme Leader. It, too, has shifted in a more moderate direction, which could presage a battle of critical importance to Irans future if the time should come for it to perform its task.

The conservative establishment is far more powerful than the president. The Supreme Leader can veto laws. Judges and Revolutionary Guards do his bidding. Isolation has served the hardliners well, allowing them to muscle into sectors, particularly oil, previously filled by foreigners. While Mr Zarif, Mr Rohanis foreign minister, was meeting his American counterpart, the hardliners tested a ballistic missile to spoil the mood. Conservative goons have arrested western journalists and businessmen, presumably to undermine Mr Rohanis diplomacy towards the West. The day Britain reopened its visa section in Tehran they put up a billboard of the Queen in a nearby square, showing her with the snout of a camel.

But they are a little less rigid than they used to be. Nudged by the Supreme Leader, who prefers to hide behind his president, even some of the hardest-liners approved last summers nuclear deal, and many, like Mr Larijani, have tacked to the centre. Muatalifa, a conservative faction, holds senior posts in Mr Rohanis own staff. The morality police have stopped barging into peoples homes and offices quite so often.

The difference between the two electoral lists is muddier than it appears. Conservatives may denounce their opponents as western stooges; reformists may mutter that the conservatives are the Shia equivalent of Islamic State. But in reality hardline and softer clerics intermarry, shift positions, and hedge their bets to keep power, says an Ayatollah in Qom who was once Ayatollah Khomeinis Guardian Councillor, and is now one of the Supreme Leaders turbulent priests. The views of voters count for far less than they should in Iran, but they do count for something.",[]

economist.com,,How accurate are GMAT practice tests?,[],"Recently a GMAT student asked me the following question:



How accurate are the GMAT practice tests? Why is there such a huge increase in my sentence correction score even though I havent studied for it since the last time I took the test (3 weeks ago)? There was also a huge increase in my quant score. Do you think I had a lucky shot in the math section? I scored 670 on my practice test and need to score the same on test day.

Heres my advice:

There is always going to be some variation between the score you get on a practice test and the score you get on test day. There can easily be a difference of +/- 30 points between consecutively-taken, real GMAT exams! You may get questions on test day that are on topics you are particularly confident in. The reverse could also happen.

In addition to that variation, which could go in either direction, I believe that it is indeed possible for practice tests to exaggerate your score. The degree of this score inflation is difficult to estimate exactly, but GMAC estimates it to be 30 points.

Remember the purpose of practice tests

The main purpose of practice tests is not to try to obtain a perfectly accurate prediction of what you will score on test day. Rather, the main purpose is to provide you with the best replication of the test possible. These simulated exams are also valuable for consolidating your knowledge and to practice your stamina and timing.

Having said that, it is of course very encouraging that you are seeing such improvements and scoring so highly. What your practice test score does tell us is that it is indeed possible to reach your target score of 670.

Specifically, the improvement in sentence correction that you cited may have come from your own improved application of the rules you have learned since you last took the GMAT. It is also possible that your previous poor GMAT score could have been the result of having a bad day. Either way, it is certainly true that on your next test day, you will have to deliver your best possible performance in order to reach the higher score reflected in your practice test. Most people are able to do that despite being somewhat nervous on test day. The fact that they know that the test really counts this time around helps them to concentrate and perform well.

If you want to get a more accurate picture from practice tests, I suggest you take at least four or five of them and calculate the average of your resulting scores.

Learning from your practice tests

It is important to learn as much as possible from the practice tests you take. For a detailed guide on how to do so, read our head tutors blog post on how to debrief after your practice test .

I think you can take great encouragement from your good performance on your practice tests. Achieving similarly good results on test day is possible. Now is the time to intensify your efforts towards achieving that goal. Keep going with your dedicated preparation!",[]

economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,Revolt against the reactionaries,[],"THE conservatives did everything they could to prevent it, abusing the power of the state to disqualify thousands of candidates they judged too prominent, too moderate or both. But the election on February 26th of Irans parliament, the Majlis, was a slap in the face to them nonetheless. Though complete results are not yet in, moderates and centrists look likely to control the new chamber (see article). The hardliners, who won handily in 2012, before Western nuclear sanctions began to bite, were pushed back. They call themselves principlists because of their stern promotion of premodern values. Iranian voters, it seems, reject their principles.

The election is good news for Irans reform-minded president, Hassan Rohani. It demonstrates just how solidly the nations voters support the deal he negotiated with world powers to roll back the countrys nuclear-enrichment programme in return for relief from sanctions. The principlists in the old parliament had tried, but failed, to block it.

The poll will also make it easier for Mr Rohani to continue with his economic reforms, which involve opening Iran to more foreign investment and freeing the private sector to compete against inefficient state firms that serve largely to enrich religious and military bigwigs. And it is surely a good omen for his chances of re-election as president next year.

Still, one should not overstate the significance of the vote. The new parliament is a weaker, less reliable ally than Mr Rohani might have hoped. Due to all the disqualifications, the new moderate list is less impressive and less reformist than it could have been. The parliament itself, though not irrelevant, is not a very powerful body. Its decisions have to be vetted by the Council of Guardiansthe reactionary grandees who disqualified so many moderates. And over the whole political edificeparliament, president and allstands the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields vast powers, especially over foreign and security policy.

Even if he wanted to, Mr Rohani could not act as an Iranian Mikhail Gorbachev. Mr Khamenei insists that the nuclear deal has no implications for any other forms of co-operation with the West; and he has set his face against any relaxation of the countrys strict Islamic legal code. Besides, it is not at all clear that Mr Rohani, a member of the old revolutionary elite, is setting out to be anything more than an economic reformer.

Still stirring up trouble

Iranians have lived through this before. The election in 1997 of President Muhammad Khatami, who genuinely sought political reform, was followed by the election of a supportive Majlis. But the mullahs stifling grip loosened not at all. So do not expect Irans dismal record on human rights to improve. (In one village last year, every adult male was reportedly executed on drugs charges.)

Nor should the West count on a more pliant partner in the Middle East. At the moment, Iran is standing tall in the region. Its support for Bashar al-Assads homicidal regime in Syria has been reinforced by Russian bombers. It is the dominant force in Iraq, its mostly Shia neighbour. And it is giving its old Sunni rival, Saudi Arabia, a bloody nose in Yemen.

Having asked them to dismantle Irans nuclear programme, Mr Khamenei will need to placate Irans hardliners in other ways. Funding for the Revolutionary Guards, including its Quds Force, which operates in several countries, is likely to go up, not down. Irans support for Hizbullah, its battle-hardened proxy in Syria and on Israels borders, will probably grow. Free from sanctions, Iran is likely to remain prickly, no matter how moderate its parliament appears.",[]

Kevin Murphy, a performance-review guru at Colorado State University, sums up the general feeling about them: an expensive and complex way of making people unhappy. The problem is, they are not in fact being scrapped.

A survey in 2013 by Mercer, a consulting firm, of 1,000 employers in more than 50 countries reported that 94% of them undertook formal reviews of workers performance each year and 95% set individual goals for employees; 89% calculated an overall score for each worker and linked pay to these ratings. It is true that a number of big companies have announced that they are abandoning annual performance reviews; this month IBM did so, joining Accenture, Adobe, Deloitte, GE, Microsoft and Netflix. In reality, though, they are no more getting rid of performance reviews than a person who shifts from drinking whisky to wine is becoming teetotal. Employee reviews are being modified, not abolished, and not necessarily for the better.

Four changes are proving particularly popular. First, companies are getting rid of ranking and yanking, in which those with the lowest scores each year are sacked. GE, which practised this system with particular enthusiasm under its previous boss, Jack Welch, has now dropped it. Second, annual reviews are being replaced with more frequent onesquarterly, or even weekly. Third, pay reviews and performance reviews are being separated. And fourth, some performance reviews are turning into performance previews, focusing more on discovering and developing employees potential than on rating their past work.

Is this new system of employee reviews any better than the old? There are good arguments for getting rid of ranking and yanking: the ritualistic decimation of the workforce on the basis of a single number routinely paralysed businesses in the run-up to each years reviews, killing creativity and setting workers against each other. Thereafter the picture is murkier.

Some of the arguments being advanced for the new-style reviews are hoopla. Deloitte says its new system is about speed, agility, one-size-fits-one and constant learning. The consulting firms employees sit down once a week with their team leaders. But good managers should give their charges constant feedback anyway. Adding another regular meeting to everyones calendar sounds like a formula for time-wasting. One-size-fits-one assessment is meaningless: a vital part of assessing people is measuring them against their peersparticularly when you have to think about who to promote or how to divvy out bonuses. It sounds nice to focus on peoples potential rather than their past performance. But how do you assess the former without considering the latter? And if decisions about pay are not based on performance, what will they be based on?

Some of the arguments are not just hoopla, but dangerous hoopla. Social scientists have repeatedly demonstrated that performance reviews are distorted by two things: office politics and grade inflation. Managers are susceptible to lobbying. They also have an incentive to put a positive spin on things, often against their own better judgment, because in assessing their subordinates performance they are, to a large extent, evaluating their own ability to manage. Deliver a series of damning verdicts on your team and you inevitably raise a red flag about your own leadership. But the more subjective the reviewing process becomes, the more powerful these distortions are likely to be: instant feedback sessions can easily become orgies of mutual praise that do not teach anybody anything.

For purists, such as Samuel Culbert of UCLAs Anderson School of Management, this is proof that performance reviews are unsalvageable: better to get rid of them entirely than to replace one imperfect system with another. In fact there are good reasons why almost all organisations this side of Utopia use employee reviews of one type or another.

Insurance against lawsuits

Companies are always having to make difficult decisions, whether allocating limited resources (such as promotions and bonuses) or sacking people if they hold the organisation back or if the market turns down. It is preferable to make such decisions on the back of robust criteria rather than on the basis of managerial whim. Increasingly, firms also have to defend those decisions in the courts against people who feel hard done by. Firms that embrace more touchy-feely assessment systems, let alone get rid of them entirely, may be setting themselves up for legal nightmares.

Annual performance reviews can certainly be improved. Companies need to put more effort into guarding the guardstraining them in how to conduct reviews and holding them accountable if they are overgenerous or otherwise sloppy. Google wisely encourages its managers to review each others assessments. Bosses also need to be more rigorous about acting on what they discover: there is no point in amassing information about weak performers if you only act on it in a crisis.

However, provided they are carried out consistently, rationally and fairly, and supplemented with more frequent feedback, annual performance reviews have many virtues. They provide a way of measuring an employees development over time (it is odd that some of those who criticise annual feedback for being too slow also criticise companies for being too short-term). They also provide a way of measuring all a companys employees against each other rather than just their immediate colleagues. Bill Clinton once said that the best approach to affirmative action was mend it, dont end it. The same is true of annual performance reviews.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,The end of Heile Welt,[],"MORE than 1m refugees arrived in Germany last year, mainly young Muslim men. They entered a society that, relative to other Western countries, has embraced multiculturalism only recently. Suddenly these foreigners are in co-ed schools, discos, swimming pools, hospitals and parks. Some of their interactions with their hosts go easily. Others do notas epitomised by New Years Eve in Cologne, where gangs of North African men sexually assaulted scores of German women who had come to watch the fireworks.

Germans who only a year ago oozed confidence about their economy and their country are now losing faith that they can manage, as Angela Merkel, the chancellor, likes to put it. Many fear the crisis will render Germany unrecognisable. A sense of loss pervades many conversations.

To grasp this trauma it helps to understand the German zeitgeist that developed (mainly in the former West Germany) in the post-war years, and lingered in the reunited country. Germans call it Heile Welt. The term means something like wholesome world, and describes an orderly, idyllic state. It may connote the nurturing environment parents create for their children to protect them from lifes ugliness, or a private oasis of peace amid public chaos. It was a state of mind that Germans clung to after the second world war.

Because it implies a degree of escapism, the term can be used sardonically. In 1973 Loriot, West Germanys most incisive humourist, chose it for the title of an anthology of cartoons skewering his countrys bourgeois pretensions. In 1998 it was the title of a novel by Walter Kempowski, set in 1961, in which a teacher moves to an idyllic village but discovers that behind every silence and glance lurks a demon of the Nazi past.

In the immediate post-war years, with Holocaust, firebombing, mass rape and the carving up of their nation still recent memories, Germans flocked to watch Heimat (homeland) films. Usually shot in the Alps or in heaths and forests, they featured clean, simple tales of love and friendship between pure women and men dressed in regional garb. Outside the cinemas, Germans revelled in their economic miracle, as they rebuilt a devastated country into a commercial powerhouse.

Foreigners were allowed into this Heile Welt, but not entirely accepted. To man its assembly lines, Germany invited workers from southern Europe and especially Turkey. The millionth arrived in 1964 and got a motorcycle as a gift. By the time the programme ended in 1973, 4m foreigners lived in West Germany. But they were called guest workers rather than immigrants, on the premise that they would ultimately leave again. Unsurprisingly, most stayed. Yet mainstream Germany continued to see itself as ethnically homogenousa Heile Welt in a tribal sense.

As part of Heile Welt, West Germans atoned for their past by becoming good democrats, good Europeans and ardent pacifists. But they did so like a teenager who experiments with increasing autonomy, confident that his uncool but protective parents are always standing by. For West Germany, dad was America, which held its aegis over the country throughout the cold war. Mum was France, which despite its nervous vanity gracefully accepted Germany back into the European family.

The dystopian flip side of Heile Welt was never far away. If the cold war had ever turned hot, Germany would have been vaporised first. (The shorter the range, the deader the Germans, missile strategists used to quip.) West Germany even had terrorism. But its terrorists were native white leftists who killed industrial tycoons. Ordinary Germans never felt threatened.

In their private lives Germans created micro-idylls. They kept garden plots orderly, guarded by the requisite gnome. East Germans seeking refuge from the cynically implausible Heile Welt offered by communism retreated to the niches: private book readings among intellectuals, or nude bathing with friends by pristine lakes. East or west, order was paramount. Visitors were impressed (if not intimidated) by how fastidiously Germans separated their white, brown and green glass for recycling.

One by one, these facets of Heile Welt are becoming brittle. Russia is aggressive again; Germans fret that, when it comes to it, the ageing American dad may not show up. Having cultivated non-violence to the point of pacifism, they now realise that defence of their state and their values may someday require them to fight, kill and die again. The terrorists they now face are not German leftists, but foreigners ready to kill women and children. Globalisation no longer just means exporting BMWs, but also allowing in Muslim refugees, some of them with attitudes on gender and Jews that Germans find offensive.

Gnomic wisdom

Some Germans react by fleeing into ever tinier Heile Welten. We are becoming ever more like our garden gnomes, says Wolfgang Nowak, one of Germanys most astute social observersinward-facing rather than open-minded. Every Monday a movement called Pegida, or Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the Occident, marches through Dresden. For many in the surrounding area of Saxony, these gatherings have become convivial rituals similar to American tailgate barbecues, but to outsiders they appear xenophobic and menacing. Even moderate Germans are turning against globalisation. Many see a free-trade area being negotiated between America and the EU not as an opportunity but as yet another threat to their way of life.

Above all, the tone of German conversations is changing. Language in the era of Heile Welt was sanitised, with political correctness often taken to ludicrous extremes. Now, in the name of telling it as it is, it is becoming coarser and aggressive. It is not clear what kind of world will replace the wholesome one the Germans once dreamed up. But it will be a rougher one.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-09 21:55:31,"Sex, celebrity and privacy: Hulk Hogan goes to the mat",[],"HULK Hogan made a career out of pummelling his rivals while wearing flamboyant outfits. On March 8th, the 62-year-old man less well known as Terry Bollea, clad in sombre black on a Florida witness stand, said he was completely humiliated by a video published in 2012 by Gawker, a media company that trades in celebrity gossip. The opening day of Mr Bolleas trial came a day after Erin Andrews, a sportscaster for Fox, won a $55m verdict from a jury in Nashville for a secret video recording showing her in the nude in 2008; the hotel and the voyeur were both found responsible.

The edited, 90-second excerpt of a longer video that was accessible on Gawker for months depicted Mr Bollea, now 62, having sex with Heather Cole Clem, the now ex-wife of Bubba the Love Sponge, his former friend. It was accompanied by 1,400 words of prose vividly describing the encounter. The former WWE heavyweight champion of the universe says Gawker invaded his privacy and caused him emotional harm by posting the misbegotten footage of his tryst and owes him $100m. Gawker replies that since Mr Bollea bragged in public about his sex life, his affairs are fair game.

The media companys defence of its actions refers to the legal standard in invasion-of-privacy cases that says publications may report on private facts about public figures as long as they are a matter of public concern. In the eyes of Garrett Epps, who teaches law at the University of Baltimore, Gawker may have crossed the line by posting Hulk Hogans sex video. Although media outlets can and should enjoy an extraordinary degree of protection, he said, Gawkers contention doesnt pass the laugh test. Is Hulk Hogan having sex with someone a matter of public concern? I dont think so, he said. A nice spanking might be in order. Rodney Smolla, dean of the Delaware Law School and an expert in defamation law, agrees. While the sex lives of movie stars and entertainers probably qualify as matters of public concern, he said, that doesn't mean that there aren't barriers. Publishing information about an affair is one thing, but a video that shows them naked is another. If posting footage that peers into their private space is protected, then there's no such notion as a right to privacy.

Mr Smolla points to Bartnicki v Vopper, a Supreme Court case from 2001 involving a radio station that broadcast an illegally recorded phone conversation. The justices sided with the radio station, but only because the conversation between two union officials about a proposed teachers strike was, in the words of Justice John Paul Stevens, unquestionably a matter of public concern...over the proper level of compensation for teachers. Justices Stephen Breyer and Sandra Day OConnor emphasised in a concurring opinion that their vote was tied to the fact that the union leaders had little or no legitimate interest in maintaining the privacy of the particular conversation because it included a suggestion about blow[ing] off ... front porches...thereby raising a significant concern for the safety of others. The privacy interest in not having moving images of ones sex life broadcast to the world is much greater, Mr Smolla points out, than an interest in keeping a phone conversation about law-breaking under wraps. Airing a recording of an unsuspecting person's most intimate moments in the bedroom is outrageous and outside the bounds of human decency and is not itself a matter of public concern. The Vopper precedent is a signal to me that an appellate court could leave a verdict against Gawker alone.

Leonard Niehoff, a law professor at the University of Michigan, sees the case differently. He said Gawker's odds on appeal are favourable, should Mr Bollea win at trial. But since Florida law requires the losing party to post full damages pending the appeal, even a provisional $100m verdict could endanger Gawkers survival. Would such a large verdict frighten other media organisations away from publishing sensitive information about famous people? Mr Niehoff does not think the media are easily cowed, but a nine-figure verdict gets the attention of any rational person. There is a real chance, he says, that some stories will be untoldor told incompletelybecause of the risk of a lawsuit.

A surge in litigation against journalists happens to be one of Donald Trumps campaign promises. He pledged last month to open up libel laws such that newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post will have problems when they publish hit pieces. Under a Trump administration, he said, we can sue them and win lots of money. Legal experts are sceptical about this. As president, he would have many powers, Mr Niehoff says. But changing the First Amendment isn't one of them"".",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,Sisis foaming mouthpieces,[],"THAT precision! Look at that car! Wait for the missile to come down! No one gets away. Ahmed Moussa, an Egyptian television host, sounded like a kid playing a video game when he showed satellite imagery of Russia striking Islamic State in Syria last autumn. Perhaps that is because Mr Moussa was, in fact, showing clips from a video game. We arent making anything up, said Mr Moussa, as he made it all up.

Mr Moussas programme, called Ala masuliyati (My Responsibility), epitomises the absurdity of Egypts popular talk shows. In February a host called Khairy Ramadan was suspended after a guest claimed that women in Upper Egypt are generally unfaithful. Another host, Reham Saeed, was sentenced to six months in prison for airing the private photos of a sexual-harassment victim (whom she also blamed for the attack).

Most hosts not only support the government, but take direction from it. I would say anything the military tells me to say out of duty and respect for the institution, Mr Moussa told the Guardian. Others mix conspiracy and sycophancy, as when Amr Adeeb worried that [foreign] intelligence officers who are trying to ruin our country might kill Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the president.

Mr Sisi says back him or stay mumbut some have not. Egypt has locked up more journalists than any country save China. Media outlets that supported the Muslim Brotherhood have been closed down. Most network heads are anyway disposed to self-censor. Nearly all support the regime, which protects their business interests. So critics such as Bassem Youssef, the former host of a satirical news programme, have been taken off the air.

Egypt is the target of many conspiracies, claims Mr Sisi. Hosts detail the plots. In October Tamer Amin interviewed Hossam Sweilam, a former deputy defence minister, who claimed that America was behind the uprising in 2011 and now controls Egypts weather. Lyrics from an obscure American hip-hop group were cited as proof. The conspirators vary, but often include America, Iran and Israel, sometimes (oddly) working together. Mr Moussa says he would like to see Barack Obama impaled.

Though their ranting is often nonsensical, talk-show hosts sway opinion in Egypt, where over a quarter of people are illiterate. Fortunately, some hosts have stiffened their spines of late, criticising the government for a poor economy, among other things. The recent murder of a young Italian student prompted a few to ask, obliquely, whether the state was involved, as evidence suggests. Perhaps sensing a shift, Mr Sisi has warned Egyptians, Dont listen to anyone but me. I am dead serious.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,Capital in fetters,[],"THE chairman of Barclays, a big British bank, was asked in a conference call last year whether the firm might draw back its investment in its listed African subsidiary. Actually, he replied, we would probably be biased to own more than less. Yet on March 1st Jes Staley, Barclays CEO since December, announced that it hopes to reduce its 62% stake in Barclays Africa over the next two or three years, to focus on its main business in Britain and America.

On the face of things, the reversal is surprising. Barclays has been in Africa for over a century. Its blue eagle logo can be found in shopping centres from Nairobi to Lagos. Moreover, Barclays Africa made a healthy return on equity of 17% last year. It has grown quickly in recent years and plans to keep doing so. Over the past year it has acquired licences of various sorts in Ghana and Nigeria and part of an insurance business in Kenya. This will continue despite the sale of Barclays stake, Maria Ramos, Barclays Africas CEO, insisted this week.

But Barclays is one of the most weakly capitalised big Western banks. As well as the sale of its African division, Mr Staley announced this week that it would cut its dividend by more than half. (The not-so-prescient chairman, John McFarlane, had also suggested last year that the dividend would soon go up.)

Selling Barclays Africa would help boost Barclays capital in two ways. The proceeds of the sale could be retained to bolster the buffers directly. In addition, a sale would make Barclays existing capital go further. At the moment, even though Barclays owns less than two-thirds of the business, international rules oblige it to hold enough capital to absorb all its likely losses. If Barclays stake falls below 20%, however, it is off the hook, freeing it to use its capital more efficiently. Its capital ratio would rise by a percentage point.

The heavy capital requirements also make Barclays Africa less profitable for its parent, reducing last years 17% return on equity to 8.7%. (That is still better than Barclays struggling investment bank, which made a return on equity of just 5%.) Declining currenciesparticularly the South African randand slowing growth in its main markets have further diminished Barclays Africas allure. Its branches outside South Africa are expensive to run and, thanks to falling commodity prices, may get less profitable in the future. And then there is the fear that it may inadvertently abet crime or corruption, earning its parent a swingeing fine in America.

Unfortunately for Barclays, there is no obvious buyer. In South Africa, its main market, where it is listed, competition authorities would probably prevent a local rival from snapping it up. Atlas Mara, an African investment fund run by Bob Diamond, a former CEO of Barclays, might bid. But with a market capitalisation of roughly $300m, it will struggle to raise the $8 billion or so it would need to buy the whole stake. There is vague talk of Chinese or Japanese buyers. If none appears, Barclays may have to reverse itself yet again.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,The Economist,[],"FOR more than a decade Elliott Management, the hedge fund led by Paul Singer, was the pantomime villain in Argentinas dispute with its bondholders. Rather than accepting a big write-down of debt on which the country had defaulted, as other creditors did in 2005 and 2010, Elliott, along with several other holdouts, pursued full payment through the New York courts. That led to a fresh default in 2014.

Now the drama is entering its final act. On February 29th Daniel Pollack, the court-appointed mediator, announced that Argentina had reached an agreement in principle with four of the largest creditors, led by Elliott. Argentinas payment of $4.65 billion will be 25% less than they were demanding. Even so, it is a big pay-off for investors who bought the debt at a fraction of its face value. With this agreement, Argentina has settled with creditors who hold 85% of the disputed debt.

It is a coup for Mauricio Macri, Argentinas recently elected president (pictured), and will help end the countrys long isolation from the international credit markets. Together with other steps Mr Macri has taken since assuming office in December, including relaxing exchange controls and removing taxes on some exports, the credit deal helps restore normality to an economy that had been distorted by populist controls during 12 years of rule by his two Peronist predecessors, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and her late husband, Nestor Kirchner. Addressing Congress, which began its new session on March 1st, Mr Macri blamed his predecessors for Argentinas weak economy and high inflation. Isolation from credit markets, he declared, had cost the country $100 billion and 2m jobs.

Argentinas negotiators paved the way back by reaching deals with smaller groups of holdouts. On February 2nd Argentina agreed to pay a group of Italian bondholders $1.35 billion; two weeks later it settled for $1.1 billion with two of the six largest holdouts, Montreux Partners and EM Ltd. But Mr Singers Elliott Management led the most intransigent group; an agreement with them is the real prize.

Thomas Griesa, the judge overseeing the case, had contributed greatly to Argentinas predicament in 2012 when he ruled that the country could not pay bondholders who had agreed to a restructuring, or issue new debt, unless it settled with the holdouts. That precipitated Argentinas default. On February 19th this year the judge in effect switched sides, saying that Mr Macris election had changed everything. He said he would lift the injunction barring Argentina from paying other creditors from March 1st under certain conditions. That was a severe blow to the holdouts, who had used the injunction to press Argentina for full payment. The message to non-settling plaintiffs, many of whom have had no opportunity to negotiate with anyone, is unmistakable: settle by February 29th, or else, wrote their lawyers.

The deal is not quite sealed. The injunction will not be lifted until Argentina repeals two laws that block agreements with the holdouts. The Ley Cerrojo (Padlock Law), enacted in 2005 during the first round of debt restructuring, was intended to prevent Argentina from offering holdouts a better deal than that accepted by holders of restructured bonds. The Ley de Pago Soberano (Sovereign Payment Law) of 2014 was a failed attempt to circumvent Mr Griesas injunction by re-routing payments to bondholders who had accepted a deal through Argentina or France.

Opening the lock

The government is confident that it can secure the votes in Congress to repeal the laws. In early February, 13 deputies from the Front for Victory (FPV), Ms Fernandezs party, broke away to form a more moderate Justicialist Bloc. The move deprived the FPV of its position as the largest grouping in the lower house. The defectors have said they are willing to work with the new government to repeal the laws. In the upper house the government plans to enlist the support of Peronist governors, who are also keen to tap international credit markets. They are likely to persuade the senators over whom they have influence to support the repeal of the legislation.

Once the laws have been scrapped, the government hopes to raise up to $15 billion through a bond issue, which it will use to pay the creditors. Some analysts doubt that the market can absorb such a large sum. But Argentinas finance secretary, Luis Caputo, is bullish. All the banks weve spoken with are confident that we can raise the money we need in the market, he said.

The government then plans to return to the market in an effort to finance its budget deficit, which was a daunting 5.8% of GDP last year. Under Ms Fernandezs administration the central bank financed the deficit by printing money, pushing up inflation. The bond issue will help the central bank to end that harmful practice, but the relief from high inflation will not come immediately. Propelled by the devaluation of the peso, the annual inflation rate, already high, has risen to around 30%; the government had hoped inflation this year would be 20-25%. It is trying to persuade trade unions not to demand excessive wage rises, which would drive inflation even higher. The unions are unwilling to make sacrifices, however. On February 25th teachers extracted an agreement from the government for a 30% salary increase; other unions are demanding pay rises at least as big.

Mr Macri has so far taken a cautious approach to bringing down the budget deficit. Energy subsidies have been cut, but the president is reluctant to slash other spending, which would further rile Argentines already angry about inflation and, he fears, would weaken growth and employment. But until the government brings the deficit substantially down, the central bank will struggle to regain credibility. A return to the bond markets is not enough.

Nevertheless, the debt deal should boost the governments confidence. It has until April 14th to repeal the legislation and pay Elliott and its fellow litigators. It must also settle with the holders of the remaining 15% of the debt. But the exhausted negotiators are allowing themselves a moment of satisfaction. It seemed like a thousand years to me, Mr Pollack said of the seemingly interminable talks. Mr Macri hopes not to take up much more of his time.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Inside the growing business of divorce financing,[],"IN MANY Western countries, including America and Britain, divorce lawyers are not allowed to represent a client in exchange for a share of whatever settlement they secure, rather than for a fixed fee. Such arrangements, it is feared, would beget more and nastier divorces. Yet the same rules do not apply to financiers: they are free to fund legal battles over marital assetsand a growing number do.

Novitas Loans, a British firm, is currently lending to 1,500 would-be divorcees (most are women) or divorces, at 18% annual interest. The loans are intended to cover legal fees; applicants typically expect to win assets worth three times their borrowing. Without the loans, many would have to give up and settle for much less, says Jason Reeve, the firms managing director. It gets lots of thank-you letters from borrowers, he claims. Demand for loans of this kind has jumped, notes Nigel Shepherd of Resolution, an association of family lawyers, since the British government restricted legal aid for divorces in 2013.

Related topics United Kingdom

Brendan Lyle of BBL Churchill Group, an American firm with cases in 27 states, says his role is part financier and part therapist. Vengeful clients, determined to fight over every last teaspoon, must be restrained. The firms average loan is $306,000 in New York state and somewhat less elsewhere. They attract annual interest of 16% or so. The default rate is a modest 2%, although there is some forbearance for struggling customers.

The big risk for divorce funders is that a couple might get back together. When that happens, assets are not sold and a borrower may not be able to pay back the lender. Novitas therefore prefers to fund cases that have been grinding through court long enough to make reconciliation unlikely. The Iceberg Partnership, Novitass biggest competitor in Britain, transfers this risk to the 374 law firms that refer clients for funding. They must agree to guarantee their clients loans, repaying Iceberg themselves if the client defaults.

Rather than lend money, some firms invest in divorce cases, asking for repayment only if a settlement is reached. Novitas bought an American firm, National Divorce Capital, that offers such non-recourse cash advances a year ago. Since then, applications for advances have doubled. It plans to open branches in Australia and Canada later this year.",[]
economist.com,2014-07-24 15:49:38,A basket of sliders,[],"COUNTRIES with McDonalds fast-food restaurants may only rarely become embroiled in military conflict (Russia and Ukraine are obvious exceptions at the moment), but currency wars are another matter. In recent years central banks in many rich economies fired up big bond-buying schemes to put some sizzle into economies that had only recently emerged from a deep freeze. Emerging-market governments complained that the capital that flowed their way as a result was hard to digest. Meanwhile Americans griped that China was serving up an undercooked yuan. Burgernomics provides one way to keep track of the food fight.

Our Big Mac index is based on the theory of purchasing-power parity. It says that in the long run exchange rates ought to adjust so that a basket of goods and services costs the same across countries. Our basket contains just one item, a Big Mac (except in India, where we substitute the Maharaja Mac, a chicken sandwich). Since a Big Mac costs 48 kroner ($7.76) in Norway and only $4.80 in America, the kroner is overvalued by 62% according to this lighthearted, protein-rich analysis, making it the most puffed-up currency in the index. The same burger costs just $1.63 in Ukraine, by contrast, making the hryvnia the feeblest currency of the bunch.

The latest dispatch from the world of burgernomics suggests that despite the Federal Reserves best efforts, the dollar has been fattening up. The average valuation of the currencies in our index (weighted by GDP) has moved from roughly neutral in 2009 to about 15% undervalued against the dollar this year. Crises of various sorts are partly to blame. Political turmoil is depressing the hryvnia. And quite a lot of the dollars relative appreciation can be linked to the woes of the euro area.

Flailing French firms may fret about the crazy euro but there is little to justify their beef; the euro is near fair value now, down from overvaluation of as much as 50% in 2008. Nordic currencies that looked wildly overvalued by our greasy metric fell closer to fair value during the worst years of the euro crisisto the relief of Swedish and Danish exporters. Despite its recent rise sterling also remains below its hearty level of six years ago, and is now close to fair value.

Some central banks have helped their currencies slim down. The Swiss francs decline is thanks in part to the Swiss National Bank. It put a styrofoam lid on the francs value when capital began flowing in from panicked European investors, lest the rising cost of Swiss exports abroad drive Switzerland into recession. The Bank of Japan has also taken a bite out of the yens value. Its generous portion of quantitative easing has helped push the currency down from close to fair value to 24% below it.

The Chinese yuan, once the most undercooked currency in the index, is now only the 12th-most-undervalued, thanks to slow but steady appreciation in recent years. Yet because Chinas economy has grown so quickly, it has piled on weight in the index, helping to push the average undervaluation even lower.

It is not on the whole surprising that currencies globally are looking a bit less supersized. A healthier American economy and reduced asset purchases by the Federal Reserve are a recipe for a stronger dollar. But American firms need to maintain their competitiveness. History suggests that even when Fed tightening is well done, it is rare that global credit conditions shift without a little scorching.",[]

The Oxford approach to learning is not about giving instruction, but about providing stimuli and structuring conversations so that you make connections and develop your thinking independently. Women Transforming Leadership brings together a number of different teaching styles and experiential opportunities to create a rich and intense learning environment. This encourages you to push yourself both intellectually and emotionally to develop greater insight and confidence.

Some sessions work by deliberately unsettling you and taking you out of your comfort zone, so you do have to be open to trying something new, but these exercises all take place in a safe and supportive environment. Previous participants have said that reflecting on what they found difficult or did wrong gave them some of their most important insights into themselves and their usual work environment.

economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,The Economist,[],"A SIGN on the door of a Wild Bean cafe in Zurich shows the nine different cards accepted for payment inside. Below the logos is a picture of a purple bank note, crossed out in red. From behind the counter, Aymen Kandil explains that for everyday transactions, thousand-franc notes are not so good.

Although many merchants will not accept them, the SFr1,000 ($1,000) note makes up over 60% of all Swiss cash in circulation. It is the most valuable banknote issued by a Western country and is worth twenty times its weight in gold. Rather than being a way of paying for things, it is meant to act as a convenient store of value. In 2008, as banks were failing and the value of most assets collapsed, demand for the SFr1,000 note jumped by 16%, having grown by only 1-4% in previous years.

Yet lawmen suspect that most high-denomination notes are in the hands not of jittery savers, but of criminals. Good data on the use of such notes are scarcetheir anonymity is one of their attractions. But a report in 2010 from a British police unit that focuses on organised crime claimed that only 10% of 500 ($542) notes were used for legitimate purposes. A report from Europol recounts how criminals will sometimes pay more than face value for high-value notes because of how convenient they are to transport. And it seems telling that the 500 note accounts for around 30% of euros in circulation, yet 56% of Europeans surveyed by the European Central Bank say they have never seen one.

David Lewis of the Financial Action Task Force, an international body that co-ordinates efforts to prevent criminals using the financial system, says big notes are used mainly in drug- and people-trafficking, money-laundering and racketeering. Finance for terrorism is another concern. A courier for jihadists caught travelling to Turkey in 2014 with 40 500 bills (20,000) in her underwear would have needed knickers of epic proportions to transport the same sum using 100 notes.

To make life difficult for criminals, Britain has barred banks and money-changing firms from providing 500 notes; the biggest British note is a mere 50 ($70). Canada started withdrawing its C$1,000 note (then worth $670) from circulation in 2000 for the same reason. Singapore is phasing out the S$10,000 note, the worlds most valuable (worth $7,100). The ECB seems to be moving in a similar direction. In early February it announced an investigation into the use of the 500 note.

The ECB will report to euro-zone finance ministers by May 1st, but resistance to scrapping the 500 note is already strong. Some (particularly in Germany) fear that the withdrawal of big notes is a precursor to the eventual abolition of cash, and thus a vast increase in the states power to pry and meddle. There are other benefits to the state from getting rid of high-value notes than hitting big-time criminals. Withdrawing them could help fill government coffers, by making tax-avoiding cash payments more awkward. It might even grease the wheels of monetary policy, by making it easier to impose negative interest rates. Yet the slippery slope argument need not hold: Canada still has smaller notes, long after it binned the C$1,000 bill.

A weightier concern is that the process of eliminating big notes has less impact on criminals the more slowly it proceeds. But central banks are reluctant to cancel or even put an expiry date on notes, for fear that this would undermine trust in those left in circulation. Instead, they tend to ask commercial banks to filter out the offending notes whenever they receive any. That is what Canada did in 2000 and, 16 years on, some 20% of C$1,000 notes remain in circulation.

Moreover, getting rid of one kind of big note will have only limited impact as long as there are others in circulation, points out Peter Sands of Harvard University. He would like to see the ECB scrap the 200 and 100 notes as well, and the Federal Reserve withdraw the $100 bill, which would be a huge inconvenience to drug-traffickers moving money across the Mexican border.

The Swiss National Bank has stated categorically that it has no plans to get rid of high-value notes, so criminals will have at least one option for the foreseeable future. As Mr Lewis says, Whatever you do, the problem is going to get pushed somewhere else. Nonetheless, he continues, What youre doing is making it harder for criminals to smuggle cash and easier for authorities to detect them. That is nothing to sneer at.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,To the land of good hope,[],"SOME African migrants forge across the Mediterranean in flimsy boats. Others take a somewhat less risky (and cheaper) journey, heading for the bright lights of South Africa. Unemployment may be a shocking 34% south of the Limpopo river, but there are still plenty of opportunities for those who are prepared to work hard.

Many migrants follow in the footsteps of their compatriots. Malawians and Mozambicans are often found tending lush suburban gardens. Somalis run tiny convenience stores, known as spaza shops, in black townships. Johannesburgs Little Addis bustles with Ethiopian traders and the sound of Amharic. Congolese and Cameroonian vendors hawk cassava and plantains in Yeoville, another Johannesburg neighbourhood. Zimbabweans, who are typically better educated than their South African peers, can be found totting up company accounts, working as mining engineers or, failing that, waiting on tables. For many Africans, South Africa seems a stable, functional, prosperous place. It is also a potential stepping stone to the rest of the world.

Getting there is not easy. Many do it in stages, finding work along the way. Some are arrested and locked up. On South Africas border with Zimbabwe migrants must ford crocodile-infested rivers. Happily, the main fence is so tattered that you can simply walk through it. At many posts, border guards demand bribes.

Some of the greatest dangers for migrants arise after they arrive. Last year seven people were reportedly killed in a spate of anti-foreigner violence, though the real number is probably much higher since most attacks never make the news. Thousands of immigrants fled their homes and businesses. Among them was Salat Abdullahi, 20, who moved from Somalia to Soweto to run a spaza shop with his older brother. They ran away when xenophobic locals looted and destroyed it. We came here with nothing, and made a business, Mr Abdullahi said. They dont like that.

After the violence against migrants came a crackdown on the victims: more than 15,000 immigrants were arrested and deported in a government sweep. Many were held in a detention centre notorious for overcrowding, corruption and abuse.

Xenophobia has spread since 1994, when the fall of apartheid led to an inflow of black migrants from across the continent. The South African government has discouraged immigration, despite a shortage of home-grown skills, by tightening border controls and laws. It sees foreigners as competing with locals for scarce jobs rather than as boosting the economy with their talent and entrepreneurial nous. Despite a widespread perception among South Africans that their country is packed with immigrants, the latest census found just 2.2m of them, or less than 5% of the population (though people in the country illegally probably dont confess this to census officers, so the true figure is higher). In Johannesburg, the most cosmopolitan of South African cities, 13% of the population was born abroad.

Many of those who come seek asylum: the South African government lets refugees work and even obtain some public services while their papers are being processed. Between 2008 and 2012 South Africa received 778,000 asylum applications, in a system that is slow and riddled with corruption. Despite the well-documented hostility and harassment, foreigners are still more likely to be employed than South Africans. Often they work in the informal sector, or do jobs that locals are not willing to take. Enterprising migrants rent shops from South Africans and thereby create jobs. Johannesburg, built on gold mines and migrant labour, is becoming a truly international city. But local elections this year could be the catalyst for more foreigner-bashing.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Food processing affected human evolution even before the invention of cooking,[],"IN 2009 Richard Wrangham, an anthropologist at Harvard, published an intriguing thesis. He was trying to answer a question that had long puzzled workers in his field: how was it possible for an organ as energetically expensive to sustain as the human brain to evolve?

Before Dr Wranghams work the conventional answer was: meat-eating. Archaeological evidence such as lack of tool marks on animal bones suggests humanitys ancestors, the Australopithecines, were largely vegetarian. By contrast Homo erectus, the first widespread human being (pictured below), also ate meat, which is a more compact source of calories than most plant matter, and might thus have provided the extra brain-food needed.

Dr Wrangham, however, had a different answer: cooking. He showed that the ease of digestion and additional nutritional value made available by treating food with fire (which alters starch and protein molecules in ways that make them easier to digest) boosts its calorific value enough for a reasonable daily intake to power both brain and bodyso much so that modern humans who attempt to live only on raw foodstuffs (there are a few who try) have great difficulty remaining well nourished. On top of this, the softening brought about by cooking could explain a second evolutionary trend, that to smaller teeth and less-powerful jaws.

Just when Homo erectus did start cooking is controversial. The oldest definitive evidence dates back only 500,000 years, though the species evolved 1.9m years ago. But the Wrangham thesis does not depend only on the beginning of heat-treating food. It also includes food preparation using tools to chop or pound meat and vegetables. This presumably makes them easier to digest. It also makes them easier to chew, which might account for the reduction in jaw and tooth size.

A paper published in this weeks Nature by Katherine Zink and Daniel Lieberman, two of Dr Wranghams colleagues at Harvard, brings some evidence to bear on these questions, particularly that of chewing. Dr Zink and Dr Lieberman used replicas of the stone tools available to Homo erectus to process food, and looked at the consequences for those who attempted to masticate the result.

The pseudo-Palaeolithic diet the two researchers chose comprised beets, carrots and yams as root vegetables, and goat as meat. They prepared the vegetables four ways: raw and unprocessed; raw and hit six times with a copy of a Palaeolithic hammerstone; raw and cut into small slices; and roasted for 15 minutes. The goat was also served four ways: raw and unprocessed; raw and pounded 50 times by a hammerstone; raw and cut into small slices; and cooked on a grill for 25 minutes. Dr Zink and Dr Lieberman then fed each preparation to a group of volunteers, to see how easy it was to chew.

To measure this, they wired up the skin of their volunteers jaws using electrodes which recorded the force a volunteer exerted chewing. Once wired, volunteers were given samples to chew and asked to do so until they felt what they were chewing was ready to swallow. Sometimes the volunteers were then allowed to swallow it. On other occasions, though, they were asked to spit it out, so that the bits could be analysed. (The raw meat was always spat out, to prevent foodborne illness.)

Dr Zink and Dr Lieberman found, in line with Dr Wranghams original thesis, that chewing cooked root vegetables required a third less force than was needed to chew an equivalent amount of raw and unprocessed root. Slicing the vegetables did not provide any benefit, but pounding them reduced the force required to chew by about 9%. Pounding meat, by contrast, brought no benefit, whereas slicing it did. As with cooking the vegetables, it reduced the chewing force needed by around a third. Intriguingly, roasting meat actually increased the masticatory force required.

On top of this, when Dr Zink and Dr Lieberman looked at food spat out by their volunteers at the point it was deemed ready to swallow, they found that the unprocessed and the pounded meat usually came back as a single large lump that would be hard for the gut to break down. In contrast, when the meat was sliced or cooked before being chewed, participants were consistently able to chew it into tiny, digestible particles.

Putting all their results together, Dr Zink and Dr Lieberman conclude that a diet of one-third sliced meat and two-thirds pounded vegetables, such as Homo erectus might reasonably have been expected to consume even in the absence of fire, would need 27% less effort to chew than an unpounded all-vegetable diet. Specifically, the inclusion of meat contributed a 15% reduction and the slicing and pounding a 12% reduction, which Dr Lieberman calculates equates to 2.5m fewer chews a year.

That could certainly account for the shrinkage of jaw and teeth undergone by Homo erectus. As to its consequences further down the digestive tract, those remain the province of further research.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Britains borders see a surge in attempted illegal migration,[],"ON MARCH 7th European leaders announced that they had agreed with Turkey the outlines of the latest plan to ease the continents migration crisis. On the same day, Britain said its Royal Navy would join NATO efforts to intercept and return people attempting to reach Greece illegally by crossing the Aegean sea. Yet figures obtained by The Economist under the Freedom of Information Act (after an unexplained six-month delay) provide a reminder of problems closer to home.

According to the Home Office, the number of detected clandestine entry attempts to Britain via European ports and train tunnels increased from around 1,000 per month in 2008-12 to 2,000 in the late 2013, before rising to 4,000 in 2014 and almost 13,000 in July 2015 (see chart). The increase is caused both by a rise in the number of people trying to enter Britainmany of them fleeing war-torn parts of the Middle East and Africaand by the fact that they are more tenacious. Most are now willing to try 11 or 12 times, up from five or six times a year ago, reckons Franck Duvell of the University of Oxfords Centre on Migration, Policy and Society.

The border is among the tightest in Europe since the Iron Curtain, he says. Lorries are X-rayed for stowaways, carbon-dioxide sensors detect human activity and sniffer dogs patrol regularly. The few who do manage to sneak in from Europe represent only a small fraction of the half-a-million or so people thought to be living illegally in Britain. (Most enter using false passports and papers or outstay their visas.) Indeed, those seeking entry via the Channel Tunnel and seaports are among the most likely to have a good case for asylum, since many are from countries that have high rates of successful applications. Common nationalities in a notorious refugee camp in Calais include Syrians, Eritreans, Sudanese and Iraqis. Many have family members already in Britain.

That will provide little solace to In campaigners in the EU referendum on June 23rd, who are aware that immigration from Europe is one of the main factors persuading people to vote to leave. In August 2015 there were 3,000 people in the Calais camp; there are now 4,000, with another 2,500 in Dunkirk. French authorities are currently dismantling the camps. But residents are unlikely to move on, says Zoe Gardner of Asylum Aid, a charity. The number of clandestine entry attempts may be even higher by the time voters head to the polls.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,Trudeaumania 2,[],"SINCE leading his Liberal Party back to power in Canada last October, Justin Trudeau has been profiled in such glossy magazines as Vanity Fair and Vogue; Hellos photo spread featured his wife and children. On March 10th he will sit down with Barack Obama at a state dinner in the White House, the first for a Canadian leader in 19 years. I cant think of a Canadian politician who has attracted as much attention in the United States, says Laura Dawson of the Canada Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Centre in Washington.

Mr Trudeau owes his celebrity to more than glamour. He succeeds Stephen Harper, a prickly Conservative, who in ten years as prime minister conducted an ideologically charged foreign policy at odds with Canadas multilateralist traditions. His relationship with the United States, by far Canadas most important, was tense. Mr Trudeau replaces a scowl with a smile. He personally greeted some of the 25,000 Syrian refugees Canada agreed to admit. Such gestures have helped bring back to life the Trudeaumania inspired by the prime ministers father, Pierre Trudeau, a dashing Canadian leader of the 1960s, 70s and 80s. But how, Ms Dawson wonders, do we translate celebrity into influence?

Mr Trudeaus answer: by returning to Canadas diplomatic traditions. It is the worlds tenth-largest economy; as a military power, it counts for less. It has historically sought to increase its modest clout by working through international bodies such as the UN and the Commonwealth. Mr Harper spurned them as talking shops for despotic regimes. He refused to support a global accord on climate change (or introduce a credible policy in Canada).

Co-operation is back in, says Stephane Dion, the new foreign minister. His mandate letter from Mr Trudeau directs him to resume working through the UN. Mr Trudeau signed the global climate agreement reached in Paris in December. He was due to meet Canadas 13 provincial and territorial leaders on March 3rd to talk about a national climate strategy and may announce a climate initiative with Mr Obama.

The prime minister intends to re-establish diplomatic relations with Iran and to revive Canadas relationship with Mexico, its partner, along with the United States, in the North American Free-Trade Agreement. He promised to lift visa restrictions on Mexicans, imposed in 2009 to stem an influx of asylum-seekers and an irritant ever since.

He is not rolling back all Mr Harpers policies. Canada is likely to ratify the free-trade agreement with the European Union, which Mr Harper negotiated. It may also join the Trans-Pacific Partnership among a dozen Asian and American countries. We should not change everything, said Mr Dion in a recent speech.

If Mr Trudeau just gets along with Mr Obama, that will be a significant change. The two sporty leaders have engaged in pre-prandial raillery about which countrys ice-hockey teams are better. Mr Obama has taken with equanimity Mr Trudeaus decision to withdraw Canadas six fighter planes from the United States-led fight against Islamic State; Canada is increasing humanitarian aid and the number of troops advising Iraqi Kurds instead. The Keystone XL pipeline to carry crude from Alberta to the southern United States, greatly desired by Mr Harper but vetoed by Mr Obama, is unlikely to figure much in the dinner-table conversation.

That leaves trade and tax. The United States is the market for three-quarters of Canadas goods exports and the source of two-thirds of its imports, but commerce could flow more freely than it does. The beyond the border agenda is supposed to accomplish that but has hit a snag: a disagreement over what law will apply to United States officials stationed in Canada to pre-clear goods for import. A row over Canadian softwood lumber, which the United States says is subsidised, could get worse. Canada objects to a United States law that obliges its banks to hand over information about accounts held by expatriates (see article).

But the main threat to Canadian-American relations will not come from anything the two leaders feasting in the White House might do. It comes from the loud-mouthed property mogul who aspires to be the buildings next occupant.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,The new mediocre,[],"THE launch, a year ago, of the European Central Banks programme of quantitative easing (QEcreating money to buy bonds) sparked elation. Growth was picking up, consumers had a spring in their step and stockmarkets were jubilant. A year later spirits are sombre as the recovery flags, stockmarkets languish and deflation returns. After prescribing more medicine in December, the ECB is expected to increase the dose again on March 10th. But there are increasing doubts about its effects.

Consumer prices fell by 0.2% in the year to February (see chart), reinforcing the case for greater stimulus. Though this fall was driven by a renewed collapse in oil prices, the core inflation index, which excludes volatile items such as energy, is also looking wan. Prices rose by just 0.7% in the year to February, among the lowest readings since the euro was born 17 years ago. Despite a year of QE, during which the ECB has bought 60 billion ($65 billion) of bonds a month, it appears to be no closer to its goal of inflation of nearly 2% than when it started.

Unemployment has at least carried on falling, to 10.3% in January, reflecting the continuing economic recovery since the spring of 2013. But the upturn has failed to live up to the promise of early 2015, when GDP growth reached 0.5% (an annualised rate of 2.2%). That turned out to be the (not very) high point. Expansion subsequently slowed, to 0.3% (an annualised rate of 1.1%) in the final quarter of last year. GDP in the single-currency club is still below its peak in early 2008, whereas Americas is almost 10% above its pre-crisis high from eight years ago.

Consumers have sustained the euro-zone recovery as household budgets have stretched further thanks to lower energy prices. But investment growth lacks the vitality of previous upturns. That has left the currency union vulnerable to the recent setback in emerging economies, especially in China, which is hurting exporters. Industrial output fell in December in Germany, France and Italy, the three biggest economies in the euro area.

Whereas European stockmarkets were buoyant in early 2015, they sank in the first six weeks of 2016, with particularly sharp falls in bank shares. Though they have since recovered some of their poise, the Stoxx Europe 600 index remains 7% down this year; its banking component has fallen by 15%. An index of business and consumer sentiment compiled by the European Commission, which tends to mirror GDP growth, has fallen from a recent high of 106.7 in December to 103.8 in February, with especially big declines among French and Italian consumers. German industry and trade is more worried about business prospects than at any time since late 2012, not long after the euro zone skirted a break-up, according to the latest Ifo survey.

All this will probably spur the ECB to do more when its monetary-policy council meets this month. In December it extended QE by six months until March 2017, raising the programmes total size from 1.14 trillion to 1.5 trillion (14% of euro-zone GDP). It also cut interest rates, which first fell below zero in 2014, deeper into negative territory. The deposit rate was lowered from -0.2% to -0.3%.

At its March meeting, the ECB is likely to keep pulling on more than one lever. The deposit rate looks set to fall again, to -0.4%. The central bank may also extend another programme that it introduced in 2014, in which it has offered ultra-cheap long-term funding (stretching until September 2018) to banks that improve their lending to the private sector. Most important, the ECB may step up the pace of QE for the next six months or so, from 60 billion a month to, say, 75 billion. It may also extend the programme again, until September 2017, a full year after it was first supposed to end.

The markets had expected more from Mario Draghi, the ECBs president, back in December. But even if he comes up with the goods on March 10th, they are likely to remain sceptical. The effects of negative interest rates on inflation are hard to discern, but banks and insurers are obviously suffering. The ECB could introduce tiered negative rates, protecting most of banks reserves from the lowest rate, but that did not spare Japanese banks from a stockmarket beating.

economist.com,2016-03-09 13:26:35,"High steaks: Trump strides through Michigan, where Clinton falters",[],"HEADING into the primary votes in Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho and Hawaii on March 8th, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton appeared to be headed in opposite directionsand so it turned out. Mr Trump pulled off his second super Tuesday in a fortnight; he won the two biggest states, Mississippi and Michigan by big margins, thereby completing a near sweep of the South and opening a new front for his populist campaign in the Midwest. Mrs Clinton had a more mixed experience; she won easily in Mississippi but lost narrowly to Bernie Sanders in Michigan, where polls had put her more than 20 percentage points ahead.

Yet this was the opposite of the divergence expected of the Republican and Democratic front-runners. Going into the primaries, Mr Trump had had maybe his worst week of the campaign. He had talked up the size of his penis in a television debate and whipped up a crowd in Orlando to pledge allegiance to him while making a gesture that looked far too close for decency like a Nazi salute. He had been castigated by Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee in 2012, as a phony, a fraud, who was playing members of the American public for suckers. On March 7th Mr Trump was trounced by Ted Cruz in Kansas and Maine, both of which he had been predicted to win; he won Louisiana and Kentucky by narrower-than-expected margins. It really seemed as if he might at last have been rumbledthat Peak Trump was past. Fat chance of that.

To keep on course to win the Republican ticket, by one calculation, Mr Trump needed to win 59 delegates on March 8th. He won precisely that number in Mississippi, Michigan and Idaho, where he came second to Mr Cruz, before votes had come in from Hawaii. He also saw two of his likeliest obstacles to his winning the nomination, Florida and Ohio, where a total of 165 delegates are up for grabs on March 15th, shrivel with the fortunes of Marco Rubio and John Kasich.

Mr Rubio, a senator from Florida, is trying to overhaul a big lead by Mr Trump in his home state; a dismal humiliation on March 9th has now made that harder. In the three mainland states, Mr Rubio failed to cross the 15% threshold required to win a single delegate. That leaves him, the main hope of the Republican establishment, with two poxy wins, in Puerto Rico and Minnesota, from a possible 24. Mr Trump has won 15; Mr Cruz seven. It is increasingly hard to think Mr Rubio can win Florida or stay in the race for long after it. Mr Kasich, the governor of Ohio, has already said that he will quit if he fails to win his state; his third-place finish in neighbouring Michigan, where he had campaigned hard, was yet another blow to that ambition.

If Mr Trumps latest strong showing has probably made it considerably likelier that he will indeed bag the Republican ticket, Mrs Clintons defeat makes it scarcely less likely that she will win the Democratic one. She has a lead over Mr Sanders of more than 200 delegates which, given the proportional way they are divvied up in the Democratic contest, he looks unable to rein in. Thanks to her crushing win in Mississippi, where she won 83% of the vote, she in fact increased her delegate lead, despite her stumble in Michigan. Yet Mr Sanderss slim victory there, where he won 50% of the vote, has made it likelier that the Democratic contest will be drawn out, into May and perhaps beyond, which could be damaging to Mrs Clintons general-election prospects. It will delay her expected pivot back towards the centre, from the left-wing arguments Mr Sandersa self-declared socialisthas forced her into making. It will also advertise the many weaknesses in her candidacy that Mr Sanders has highlighted.

Most of Mrs Clintons dozen wins have been based on huge support from African-Americansexit polls in Mississippi suggested she had won 89% of the black vote there. Elsewhere, she has found the going harder, with Mr Sanderss excoriations of Wall Street, free trade and elite politics winning him big majorities with younger and white voters in most states outside the South. He managed that in Michigan, a state that has lost many thousands of factory jobs in recent decades. Exit polls suggested he had won 81% of younger voters in the state; he also cut Mrs Clintons lead among blacks to around 65%. He won clear majorities of those who felt that international trade had cost American jobs and who worried about the current state of the economy. This suggested he has, at the least, a fighting chance of winning one or two more in a looming series of Midwestern rust-bucket states, including Ohio, Illinois and Wisconsin. Given that all those states voted Democrat in recent general elections, and that Mr Trump would campaign hard in them on a similarly protectionist platform to Mr Sanderss, it presents Mrs Clinton with a considerable problem. She must not only keep on fighting Mr Sanders, but also find a better answer to the economic discontentment he is drawing on. She must be tempted to sound a shriller, more populist note herself, which would certainly be off-putting to the centrists Mr Trump, a politician even more disliked than Mrs Clinton, is bound to alienate.

Indeed, perhaps nothing could reunite the splintered Republican coalitionin disdainso effectively as the sight of Mrs Clinton in left-wing campaigning mode. Mr Trump, however, gave little thought to such delicious things in the bizarre, or mad, victory speech he gave at one of his golf clubs in Florida to celebrate his primary wins.

Stung by recent criticisms of his business history, which includes several high-profile failures, he used the speech as an opportunity to showcase some of the many products he has hawked over the years: Trump wine, Trump vodka, Trump water and Trump steaks. Mr Trump has often been accused of throwing red meat to his angry supporters; as the assembled cameras fixed on piles of meat, that seemed to be literally the case. Trump steaks. Where are the steaks? Do we have steak? We have Trump steak, rambled Mr Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, sounding very much like a cable-television shopping-channel presenter.

His steak business, as it happens, seems to have been non-functioning since 2007. So if the meat he had brought to his rally was his own, it cannot be fit for consumption. The steaks, for Mr Trump and America, have perhaps never been higher.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,China sets itself a lofty growth target,[],"MARK the date on your calendar: on January 17th next year, China will report that economic growth in 2016 was no lower than 6.5% and no higher than 7%. What explains such clairvoyance? Because the government has now formally unveiled its growth target for the current year, putting it at 6.5-7%. Chinese GDP targets, once set, have a way of coming true. All the economys many uncertaintiesrising debt, rich-world doldrums, currency volatilitymelt away as if nothing in the face of its leaders conviction. But in their pursuit of their goal, Chinese leaders still have many options.

The GDP target was announced on March 5th by Li Keqiang, the prime minister (pictured), in his report at the start of the annual session of the countrys rubber-stamp parliament, the National Peoples Congress. Some credit is due to China in setting a target range as opposed to its past practice of shooting for a single specific number. There is no sense in managing an economy, especially one as big and complex as Chinas, so that it can hit a bullseye. Flexibility is far better. The problem, however, is that the target range is still too high. Before Mr Li revealed his plans, many economists had reckoned that Chinese growth would be less than 6.5% this year; the IMF had forecast an expansion of 6.3%.

By setting a high target, China creates two dangerous temptations for itself. The first is to massage data to make growth appear stronger than it actually is. There have long been concerns that China is wont to adopt such tactics; as headwinds to Chinas growth intensify, such doubts will be all the more widespread this year.

The second temptation will be for the government to gin up growth more than is warranted. It is in this respect that the other details of Mr Lis report make interesting reading. It suggests China will lean more heavily on both fiscal and monetary policy to hit its growth target. It has planned for a deficit of 3% of GDP, up from 2.3% last year. It is also aiming for 13% growth of M2 (a broad gauge of the money supply), up from 12% last year.

On the surface, neither sounds like much of an increase. But they signal that the government is ready to ratchet up pro-growth measures. Moreover, the deficit target in fact only refers to on-budget spending. Since the government has several off-budget levers, the real deficit is likely to exceed the 3% mark. As for monetary policy, it is already loose, as shown by credit growth in January, with 2.51 trillion yuan ($385 billion) in new lending by Chinese banks, the most ever in a single month.

China has an old habit of turning to stimulus when growth fades. But the nature of the stimulus is changing. In previous years, the government relied on heavy spending. This time it has actually called for a lower rate of growth in fixed-asset investment, from a targeted rate of 15% last year. Instead, much of the fiscal push appears set to come from lower taxes: China is aiming for just 3% growth in this years budget revenue, down from a target of 7.3% last year. That is consistent with the concept of supply-side economics that has gained favour in Beijing in recent months: the idea is to clear the path for private companies, not just pour more money into infrastructure projects dominated by state-owned firms.

There was also some welcome realism in Mr Lis view on global trade. After badly missing last years trade target (China had aimed for 6% growth, but both imports and exports contracted), the government opted against setting one this year. The external environment is beyond its control and it does not care to be embarrassed again.

Domestically, though, the government is still confident of its grip. As well as setting a GDP target for 2016, Mr Li confirmed a central objective of Chinas new five-year economic plan (to be approved during the parliamentary session, which lasts about ten days). It is that the economy will grow by an average of 6.5% between now and 2020. By that time, our economys size will have exceeded 90 trillion yuan, he said. Omniscience is a wonderful thing.",[]
economist.com,,Master in Management degrees vs MBAs: No experience required,[],"Feb 16th 2016, 12:26 by C.S-W.

OF ALL the questions prospective business-school candidates ask, the most common is the most basic: whether or not to take an MBA. That decision often rests on whether such a costly degree will boost their careers. In that regard, a year-end poll of big employers by GMAC, a business-school body, released earlier this month, was full of positive news. Fully 75% plan to hire MBAs this year, an increased proportion compared with 2015. But look deeper at the intentions of companies across different parts of the globe, and a more nuanced view appears. MBAs remain popular, but so too are other business degrees.

A third of global employers polled by GMAC said they plan to hire candidates holding a Master in Management (MiM)a pre-experience qualification that can cost less than half of an MBA, even at the same business school. Both MiMs and MBAs are generalised business degrees, and there is much overlap in what they teach. Master in Management students, though, generally spend more time on team projects, while MBAs tend to devote more time to case studies.

MiMs are especially popular with European firms, 57% of which said they would hire a graduate from such a programme this year. There are two possible reasons for this, reckons Gregg Schoenfeld of GMAC, who wrote the report. One is tradition: the Master in Management is often thought of as a European concept, and so firms there are more familiar with it (particularly compared with America, where just one in four employers plan to hire such graduates). However European businesses may be also affected by wider economic currents. In the same survey, European firms said they were also more likely to maintain, rather than increase, the number of employees they expected to hire. American companies were more bullish about their employment plans. MBAs don't just cost students more. As graduates are generally older and more experienced, they also command higher salaries. So squeezed European firms, looking for better returns on their euros, may be trying to capitalise by hiring less experienced candidates that they can develop in-house.

The degree also seems to be more popular among firms that dont traditionally recruit from business schools. Among companies that didnt hire a single business-school graduate last year, but may do this year, twice as many said they would likely plump for a Master in Management candidate rather than an MBA. Mr Schoenfeld has a theory about this too: employing MiMs provides a way for firms to dip their toe in the water. They havent hired these business degree-holders in the past, but have perhaps seen their competitors do so and now outperform them, he says. Theyre trying to get that talent to help their businesses grow.

There is an important caveat to these statistics. GMAC polled employers about their intentions in November, before markets took a significant downward turn. Bullish forecasts by employers may have turned bearish in the intervening months since they were asked about their hiring plans for 2016. And perspective is required: employers are still twice as likely to hire a person possessing an MBA than one holding a Masters in Management. But much more turmoil and more employers may see the virtue in cheaper, less experienced, candidates.",[]

economist.com,2015-07-16 14:48:24,A few dollars less,[],"IN NOVEMBER the McDonalds restaurant in Pushkin Square in Moscow reopened following a three-month closure ordered by local health inspectors. The penalty was widely seen as retaliation for Western sanctions against Russia. The restaurant was a predictable target. When it first opened in 1990, it symbolised the triumph of American capitalism over a crumbling Soviet Union. Now it holds up a mirror to another American economic victory: the resurgence of the dollar. All but four currencies in our Big Mac index look cheap compared to the greenback. The rouble is the cheapest of all.

The index is based on the idea of purchasing-power parity, which says exchange rates should move towards the level that would make the price of a basket of goods the same in different countries. Our basket contains just one item: a Big Mac hamburger. If the local cost of a Big Mac converted into dollars is above $4.79 (its price in America), a currency is dear; if it is below the benchmark, it is cheap. In Pushkin Square a Big Mac costs 107 roubles, or $1.88 at the current exchange rate, two-fifths of the average price in four American cities. That in turn implies that the rouble is undervalued by 61% (see chart 1).

Purchasing-power parity holds only in the long run. Over shorter periods, currencies are often pushed far away from such fair-value yardsticks by international capital flows, which in turn are driven by broader trends in the global economy. Exchange rates are currently being buffeted by the euro crisis, the growing likelihood of a rise in interest rates in America, Chinas slowing economy and the sharp drop in the oil price, one of the drivers of the roubles slump. By showing how much these forces have driven different currencies off course, the Big Mac gives a flavour of what may be to come.

Start with the dollars revival. It began in earnest in May 2013 when Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve at the time, dropped a hint that the Feds purchases of bonds using newly minted money (quantitative easing or QE) might soon tail off. The prospect, however distant, of higher interest rates in America prompted a sell-off in emerging-market currencies. As the Fed moved slowly towards a tighter monetary stance, policy became looser in other rich economies. The yen is 38% below its fair value in burger terms, in large part because of the Bank of Japans expanding QE scheme. When the European Central Bank eventually resorted to QE, the euro dropped like a stone from $1.30 to $1.05. It has since rebounded to $1.10, but that still leaves it 15% undervalued on the Big Mac gauge.

Yet the dollars broad-based rise appears to have run out of steam. It ticked up against the euro and yen on July 15th after Janet Yellen, the Feds new boss, told Congress that interest rates were likely to rise later this year, as expected. But she also said that the pace of interest-rate increases would be gradual. The Feds caution will probably prevent the dollar rising much further, at least against the main currencies of the rich world. Japans current-account surplus is growing thanks to burgeoning income from the countrys huge holdings of foreign assets, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. The euro areas large current-account surplus is a similar bulwark against further depreciation. It cant keep on going down every day on the back of bad news that everyone expected, says Kit Juckes of Societe Generale, a bank.

For emerging-market currencies, cheap Big Macs are not necessarily a sign of an impending appreciation. That is because the cost of a burger depends partly on untradeable inputs, such as rent and wages, which tend to be lower in poor countries (gauges based on purchasing-power parity work best when comparing countries with similar income). But not all emerging markets are equal: the countries whose currencies have fallen furthest recently are commodity producers. In fact, Chinas waning hunger for raw materials is afflicting rich and poor exporters alike (see chart 2).

The prices of oil and of some industrial commodities, such as iron ore, are falling again. That leads to cuts in investment and weaker GDP. The debts run up to pay for mines and wells also look more onerous. Brazil is a big commodity exporter, and the real looks overvalued relative to its peers, but Brazils high interest rates make it costly for speculators to sell it short and are a lure to yield-hungry investors. The Malaysian ringgit, in contrast, is second only to the rouble in terms of value on our gauge. Yet it is likely to get cheaper still, reckons George Papamarkakis of North Asset Management, a hedge fund, because of its exposure to raw materials and because lots of flighty foreign investors own Malaysian bonds. The Canadian dollar is close to fair value on the Big Mac index but it should perhaps be cheaper. A slump in the countrys oil-sands industry, among other ills, prompted the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates to 0.5% on July 15th.

Eventually currencies that have fallen hard will become cheap enough to attract buyers. There is a price for everythingeven currencies such as the South African rand and the Russian rouble, which investors currently see no merit in. Who can resist a 60% discount?",[]

economist.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"Obituary: Nancy Reagan, Americas First Lady through the 1980s",[],"IF ANYONE attacked her Ronnie, when he was governor of California in the 1970s, Nancy Reagan knew just what to do. She would run a big tub, pour in lots of bath salts, and as she soaked she would shout defiance at the wall. Didnt happen. Didnt happen. What are you doing to my husband? Whats wrong with that? By the time the tub was cool she was all sweetness, and the world was in kilter again.

Keeping lifes untidiness at bay was a full-time job. It started with herself. Only Julius could style her hair, and he had to be flown in from Los Angeles. As a teenager her nose was too big, so she had it done, of course. (She wanted to be a movie star; that never came to much, but she networked with Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable and met Ronnie, so it was worth it.) With daily exercise she could stay a size four, and look stunning in the Bill Blass gowns and red Adolfo suits that came in armfuls to the White House. But her ankles were so thick that she cried for days when the Washington Star noticed.

Related topics The White House

On every side lay disorder, even in the White House. Ashtrays that needed emptying (she would do it herself, if no one else would). Pictures hanging askew, which must be straightened. Coffee cups on desks. Aides coming in sweaty, wearing trainers and with mussed hair: just inappropriate. Appearances mattered, which was why she had refused to live in the governors house in Sacramento, that old firetrap, and instead moved to a 12-room Tudor mansion in a better part of town. Good taste, and a horror of mismatched plates, was the reason she spent $209,508 on new china for the White House, which everyone attacked her for. Otherwise she was frugality itself, recycling unwanted presents and getting her rich friends to donate their furniture. Because everything had to be just so, she continually fussed, phoned and deployed her two steeliest weapons, the silence and the stare. Before state dinners, she checked that the salad leaves were perfectly arranged and the sauce exactly seasoned. When the Queen of England visited, she drafted the guest list five times over. If anything went wrong, she was furious. Naturally.

Unhappy families

Her own history needed tidying, too. Two years were lost from her age somewhere. Her potty-mouthed mother was kept at arms length. Her father, a car-dealer, out of the picture since her parents divorce, was replaced as real by Loyal Davis, her stepfather, a respectable neurosurgeon who did not agree to adopt her for six years. As for her own children, they were frankly a nightmare: Patti a damn hippie and Ron, eventually, a ballet dancer. She ransacked his bedroom for drugs and worried herself sick that he was probably gay, but had to accept in the end that families couldnt be wrapped up prettily in white paper. The hardest thing was that Ronnie had brought two children of his own, with Jane Wyman, to the marriage. Her shadow came too. They couldnt be fitted in at all.

As for Ronnie himself, her wonder and her hero, the man without whom she couldnt livehe was her chief project. Dear, sweet, easy-going Ronnie had no straight-line ambition to be governor or president. She had it for him. (She wasnt political one scrap, beyond being, obviously, Republican, but could nudge him to do smart things like reach out to the Soviets.) Ronnie loved and trusted everyone; so it was just as well she didnt. If anyone was harming him, they had to go, and she would keep at it and at it.

She couldnt win every battle, of course. Don Regan, pushy awful man, was turfed out as White House chief of staff, but Ronnie refused to put all protesters in jail, as she requested, or sack Cap Weinberger from the Pentagon, because he was his friend. (And sure enough, she wouldnt drop her own best friends, like the Bloomingdales or Frank Sinatra, just because they got in a mess.) In front of the cameras she made certain Ronnie looked good, and tore up official snaps that showed him sleepy or old. If he got lost for words, she supplied them. Her unwavering, loving gaze when he spoke was, in fact, a firewall.

One thing she could not order was the future and his fate. She could try her damnedest, though. She insisted that on election day in 1970, when Ronnie was running again for governor of California, he should play golf and eat chicken curry for dinner, just as he had on the day when he was first elected. It worked. In the White House she brought in astrologers to fix, according to Ronnies star chart, the times of press conferences and foreign trips. That worked, too. It even helped when she felt she needed to change her own image as a clothes-horse and an icicle to something softer. Following her seers advice, she started a Just Say No campaign against drug use and began to appear more often with sick children. When Ronnie got Alzheimers, she rather bravelyfor a Republicanstarted pushing for stem-cell research.

People still misunderstood her. They kept sniping at her tight little laugh, her jewellery and her influence over her husband.

economist.com,2015-08-13 14:49:43,Third time lucky?,[],"JUST one month ago Greece was on the verge of leaving the euro. Germany had raised the prospect of a time out lasting at least five years, following a breakdown in trust between euro-zone countries and the Greek government. Even when an acrimonious weekend summit in Brussels ended on July 13th with a tentative plan for a third bail-out, providing up to 86 billion ($96 billion) over three years in return for further austerity and reforms, there was widespread pessimism about whether a more detailed agreement could really be reached. Yet on August 11th the Greek government settled the specific conditions of the rescue with the four institutions representing the interests of creditors: the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB), the IMF and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), a rescue fund for the euro zone.

The new proposals were due to be passed into law by the Greek parliament on August 13th, after The Economist had gone to press. The hope among Greek officials was that euro-zone finance ministers would endorse the deal the following day. That could in turn pave the way for a release of funds from the ESM in time for the Greek government to redeem bonds held by the ECB worth 3.2 billion when they mature on August 20th.

This timetable may yet prove too optimistic. The agreement will still have to be ratified by several euro-zone parliaments, including the German Bundestag. Despite the surprisingly swift progress in the negotiations, the German government has struck a cautious tone, arguing that thoroughness is more important than speed. If Germany drags its heels, Greece may need a second emergency loan from a rescue fund backed by the whole of the European Union in order to repay the ECB (it received a first one in mid-July to clear arrears with the IMF and repay another lot of bonds held by the ECB). The question of relieving some of Greeces huge public debt, to be addressed once the bail-out has been agreed, is another potential pitfall: the IMF has made clear it requires European concessions on this point if it is to join the bail-out later this year.

In order to get this far, Greece has already had to legislate two sets of reforms in the past month. These have raised VAT and made minimum pensions payable only at the age of 67. A European directive on dealing with failing banks has been adopted and the independence of the national statistics agency has been reinforced. Judicial delays are also to be tackled.

This weeks agreement includes steps to liberalise markets, especially energy. Tax administration is to be overhauled with tougher procedures to deal with taxpayers who are in arrears. A new privatisation fund is being set up, with the objective of eventually raising 50 billion, of which half will go to recapitalise Greek banks, a quarter to pay down debt and the remaining quarter to investment. Privatisation is expected to raise up to 6.4 billion between 2015 and 2017, an ambitious target given that Greece has managed to raise only 3 billion in the past five years.

Important though such structural reforms may be in improving Greeces long-term prospects, what matters in the short term is healing a traumatised economy that has slipped back into recession and is fettered by capital controls. One encouraging sign is that the creditors have not imposed overly harsh fiscal targets for this year and next. Greece is expected to run a primary deficit (ie, excluding interest payments) of 0.25% of GDP in 2015 and a surplus of 0.5% in 2016. Another helpful development is an acceptance on the part of euro-zone creditors that attempts to impose a bail-in to recapitalise the banks (by converting large deposits into equity) would be wholly counter-productive since this would destroy the working capital of Greeces small businesses.

Yet even if the hurdles to a full agreement can be surmounted, the outlook for Greece remains precarious. Despite the recent promising developments, the risk of more political upsets remains very real. The decision by Alexis Tsipras, Greeces prime minister, to accept the bail-out terms has split his party, forcing him to rely upon opposition parties to pass legislation. That may lead to an early election. Chronic political uncertainty was a crucial reason why Greeces first two bail-outs went wrong. It may also blight the third.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,"Americas most successful cities, states and firms are leaving the rest behind",[],"IN THE Nuvotronics factory in Durham, North Carolina, small is beautiful. The firm, founded in 2008, uses a process resembling 3D printing to make miniaturised radio chips for jets and satellites. Typically, such chips are the size of a chocolate bar; Nuvotronicss widgets are smaller than a breathmint. Such innovation is lucrative; every kilogram saved makes a satellite $15,000 cheaper to launch. Nuvotronics is part of a cluster of high-tech firms that has increased Durhams GDP per-person by 28% since 2001. By the same measure, North Carolina as a whole grew by just 3% over the same period. Durhams success reflects an emerging trend: high-flying cities, and the successful firms they contain, are detaching from the rest of the economy.

Cities have long been the most productive places to do business, because they bring firms, customers and workers closer together. A banker in New York is only a taxi ride away from her clients; a new restaurant there immediately has 8.4m potential customers on its doorstep. Where clever people congregate, innovation results.

For the most successful cities, these advantages seem to be getting bigger. In 2001 the richest 50 cities and their surroundings (dubbed metropolitan areas by statisticians) produced 27% more per head than America as a whole. Todays richest cities make 34% more. Measured by total GDP, the decoupling is greater still, because prosperous cities are sucking in disproportionate numbers of urbanising Americans. Between 2010 and 2014 Americas population grew by 3.1%; its cities, by 3.7%. But the 50 richest cities swelled by fully 9.2%.

Durham, whose population grew by about 7% in that period, provides some hints as to what makes a place flourish. The city thrives on its proximity to three top universitiesDuke, North Carolina State and the University of North Carolina. Far-sighted planning in 1959 led Durham and its close neighbours, Raleigh and Chapel Hill, to establish a research park between the three cities. The idea was to coax the universities boffins into business ventures. It worked; today 50,000 people work at site. Graduates flock there, often starting firms themselves.

Unlike much of America, the area has not shied away from infrastructure investment. The gleaming Raleigh-Durham airport was renovated over the last two decades, with a helping hand from local businesses. The roads are well-maintained, if a little crowded. Bill Bell, the citys mayor, hopes to develop a light-rail system for the city; in 2011 voters approved a sales-tax increase to help pay for it.

Investment has also revitalised a deprived downtown area. For most of its history Durham made tobacco and textiles. When those industries went into decline in the latter half of the twentieth century, they left a vacuum in the city. But over the past decade the gap has been plugged. The tower of the old American Tobacco factory, emblazoned with the Lucky Strike logo, still standsbut the factory is now a campus featuring bars, restaurants, and the kind of tech firms where staff ride around on scooters. The citys performing arts centre, located across the road, is one of the four best-attended theatres in the country. Mr Bell says public-private partnerships are to thank for much of the investment.

Durham is unusual for its failure to drag up North Carolinas per-person growth. For that, thank the states tanking labour force participation rate, which at 61% is grim even by American standards. Elsewhere, the presenceor absenceof rich cities determines states economic fortunes. States containing one of todays richest 50 cities grew 13% in per-person terms since 2001. The eighteen (mostly southern and south-western) states without one managed growth of just 7%. As a result, inequality between states has risen for most of the past decade-and-a-half (see chart).

Rich cities typically attract successful, growing firms. Nuvotronics is young, employing fewer than 100 staff, and only moved to Durham in 2013. But the city also hosts well-established firms like Cree, which makes LED lighting, and giants like Quintiles, a consultancy which works on pharmaceutical trials.

Attracting the right companies matters because Americas firms, too, are diverging. In the past two decades returns to investment at the most profitable 10% of firms have more than doubled by one measure, defying low interest rates in the economy as a whole. But returns for middling performers have increased only a little (see chart). A recent paper by Jason Furman, a White House economist, and Peter Orszag of Citi, a bank, says this could be because the best firms are gaining market power (think of Apples dominance of the smartphone market). A report by the McKinsey Global Institute attributes the divergence to the varying pace of digitisation across industries. Highly digitised industries such as technology, media and professional servicesthe type of work found in successful citieshave benefited from the juiciest increases in margins. Digital laggards, such as the health care and retail industries, are doing less well.

This bears directly on the inequality which matters most: wage inequality. Two recent studies suggest that the most of the increase in wage inequality over the last four decades is explained by wage gaps between firms rather than within them. A secretary will probably earn more working for Goldman Sachs than working for the local plumber; it is more lucrative to be a programmer at Facebook than in a corporate back-office. That means that bringing high-skilled workers to an area is not enough to guarantee high wages; the right firms must come to town too. Mr Bell says Durham is becoming more discerning about which firms it tries to lure.

The end of mediocrity

In 2013 Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, predicted in his book Average is Over that the fortunes of both people and places would become more polarised. Ambitious and talented workers, he argued, would want to work in a relatively small number of cities and regions. These vibrant clusters would then benefit from increasing returns to scale, cementing their advantages. Mr Cowens predictions are already coming true. While successful cities grow, almost 60% of rural counties are shrinking in population. With Americas shale and manufacturing industries suffering the pull of successful cities is getting greater still. And for cities, bigger probably does mean better.",[]
economist.com,,Creative MBAs: Managing a media firm takes special skills,[],"Feb 2nd 2016, 17:03 by C.S-W.

THE voice of Sir David Attenborough (pictured), if not necessarily his face, is known the world over for the natural-history documentaries he has produced during six decades of working in television. But had he taken a different path 44 years ago, Sir Davids acclaimed programmesstill being made, in spite of his advancing yearswould be non-existent. For a time, Britains national treasure was a pen pusherand a successful one at that. During the 1960s he was controller of BBC Two, the second channel of Britains national broadcaster; at the turn of the decade, he became responsible for everything broadcast on both BBC channels. Then in 1972, he was offered the chance to become BBC director-general, head of the entire corporationthen, and probably now, the most powerful television job in the country. Sir David turned it down. He was already unhappy with the executives life. I had to fire people and work on budgets, he told an interviewer. I wouldnt have enjoyed it.

Sir Davids dilemma was one many creative types face. With career success comes the chance to manage. But commerce and creativity can feel like opposites. So such executives have a hard time of it: artists can be wayward and unruly; controlling the budgets of filmmakers unwilling to compromise on their vision can be frustrating. And when they take on top jobs, they often lack the business nous to steer a creative business to success. Two-thirds of respondents to a survey by Creative Skillset, an industry body, said needed to develop their leadership skills.

So Lord David Puttnam, a film producer, and Channel 4, a British television station, decided to try to teach those skills. With Ashridge Executive Education, they developed an executive MBA (EMBA) tailored for the creative industries. The two-year course will start in October and primarily take place online, with a three-week block of classroom tuition, including relevant case studies. Channel 4 will sponsor two candidates taking the MBA for three years.

According to MT Rainey, chair of Th_nk, a digital marketing agency that helped drawing up the curriculum for the online EMBA, creative industries require a different type of leadership, one which is not currently catered for in traditional management education. Bosses must simultaneously be able to encourage and rein in wild minds. And growth is a problem. Such businesses in Britain often thrive until they reach a certain size, at which point they stall. Alleviating these roadblocks will help Britain maintain its reputation in the arts.

The programme is not the first MBA focused on the creative industries. Henley Business School, for example, offers a 30-month MBA programme for the music and creative industries. New York Universitys Stern business school, meanwhile, has taught an MBA in entertainment, media and technology for more than a decade. Like them, Ashridges programme, though specialised, will not scrimp on the core principles of an MBA. As Ms Rainey explains, creative firms already send employees on MBA programmes for good reason: We want them to learn the things an MBA will teach. Yet for many bright young minds, the idea of becoming a corporate suit is abhorrent. The hope is that by giving creative MBAs a dedicated programme, fewer will find the notion quite so ghastly.",[]

economist.com,2016-02-06 00:00:00,False comfort,[],"MANY a gloomy pundit, Buttonwood included, has been tut-tutting about equity valuations in America for the past year or two. After all, by historical standards, they are high. Yet there is no shortage of cheerleaders to explain why equities are not such a bad deal after all. A notable one now is Olivier Blanchard, until recently the chief economist of the IMF. He and Joseph Gagnon, a colleague at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think-tank, have published a blog post* arguing that American equities are not overvalued, in particular compared with the values seen ten years ago.

Alas, there is reason to quibble with the data underpinning the post. It refers to the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio compiled by Robert Shiller of Yale University, which averages profits over ten years. Mr Shiller has calculated the ratio back to 1881. The average since then is 16.7, so the current ratio, 24, suggests shares are 44% overvalued by historical standards. But the Peterson post compares current valuations with the 60-year average of 20, arguing that accounting and tax changes and the impact of the Depression make earlier numbers a poor guide. This makes equities look only 20% overvalued.

Then there is the way that the post estimates future returns. One approach is based on dividends; the authors assume future dividend growth of 2.2%, matching real GDP. But why assume that real dividends keep up with GDP? The London Business School keeps a database on the actual growth rate of dividends over time. Since 1900 American dividends have grown at 1.67%, well below real GDP growth (of around 3% a year). And America is an outlier: the dividend growth rate for all the countries covered is just 0.57%.

Why the shortfall? Economic growth does not arise entirely from quoted companies; many fast-growing firms have yet to list. And then there is new share issuance. Research shows that earnings have long been diluted by around 2% a year before existing shareholders get their hands on them. Despite the rise of buy-backs this is still happening, thanks to the use of share awards as incentives for managers. Assume the dilution effect is only three-quarters of what it was (ie, 1.5 points off the assumed GDP growth rate). That still brings future dividend growth down to 0.7%, making equities less alluring than Messrs Blanchard and Gagnon think.

The authors also use a valuation approach based on the relationship between the earnings yield (the inverse of the price-earnings ratio) and the real bond yield. Cliff Asness of AQR, a fund-management group, examined this issue in a paper about the Fed model, a similar method which bulls used during the internet bubble to argue that equities were cheap. Mr Asness found the model was a poor guide to the subsequent performance of equities. What really matters is the p/e ratio. Long-term expected real stock returns are low when starting p/es are high and vice versa, regardless of starting nominal interest rates, he wrote.

Worries about growth have prompted central banks to keep rates near zero since 2009. If future growth prospects are poor, then estimates of future profits and dividends need to be revised lower. Equity valuations, in other words, do not have to rise just because rates are low.

Japan provides a good illustration of all this. Its government-bond yields have been low for two decades. Has this made Japanese equities a great investment, as the reasoning of Messrs Blanchard and Gagnon would imply? Not a bit of it. By the mid-1990s, there had been a big shift in the relative valuation of equities and bonds (see left-hand chart). But over the past 20 years, the return on Japanese bonds has easily outstripped returns on equities (see right-hand chart). America is not Japan, but its foundering stocks and falling bond yields look eerily familiar.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,The Economist,[],"ON MARCH 2nd the UN agreed to the most sweeping sanctions it has yet imposed on North Korea in response to the countrys nuclear and missile tests of the past decade. The measures include inspections of all goods going to or coming from the country; a total embargo on all arms sales to it; and a ban on exports from it of coal, iron and other minerals. They were approved by all 15 members of its Security Council including Russia, after it delayed a vote to negotiate small changes to the text, and China, which opposes its allys nuclear programme but has been reluctant to punish it seriously.

Hopes have been raised before that consensus at the UN might force North Korea to abandon its efforts. Swift and tough was how America described a resolution passed by the UN after North Koreas inaugural atomic test in 2006. Yet despite further such resolutions, the Norths bomb-building programme chugs along. Few expect it to give it up soon. But a toughening of Chinas stanceassuming it implements the sanctions rigorouslymay give North Korea pause. China is by far the countrys biggest trading partner. Most of the trade covered by the sanctions goes through China.

The resolution was the product of nearly two months of delicate negotiation between America and China that began after North Koreas fourth nuclear test on January 6th. That was followed on February 7th by a long-range missile test (in the guise of a rocket sending a satellite into space), after which South Korea and America agreed to begin formal talks about the possibility of installing an American missile-defence system in the South. That prospect may have helped to stiffen Chinas resolve: it fears the kit might threaten its own nuclear arsenal. China may hope that America might now abandon its missile-defence ideas. But it has also made clear that UN sanctions are not an end in themselves. China recently called for peace talks between the Koreas. It will hope that the sanctions will encourage North Korea to resume discussions on dismantling its nuclear programme, and not simply choke the North Korean economy.

Chinese enforcement of previous sanctions applied by the UN on North Korea has been poor. Those now being imposed would involve considerably more disruption for China. It receives most of North Koreas exports of minerals, including coal, gold, titanium and iron ore; in 2014 they made up half of the Norths $2.8 billion worth of sales to the country, according to South Korean figures. Rudiger Frank of the University of Vienna thinks inspections of goods crossing the border will scare away trading partners and increase transaction costs for all North Korean trade, even the legal sort. But Chinese officials may balk at having to examine every truck. It is possible that they may simply put on a show of doing so. John Delury of Yonsei University in Seoul says that if China thought economic pressure was useful, it would already be applying it unilaterally.

The sanctions include a more explicit ban on the sale of luxury goods, with which the regime pampers its senior officials: no more snowmobiles or fancy watches. But perhaps the most potent provisions of the UN resolution are those that require, and no longer simply encourage, countries to sniff out suspicious North Korean activity. They must expel North Korean diplomats found to be engaging in criminality and shut down North Korean banks if there is evidence they are helping the nuclear programme.

Money trees

But the sanctions do not target Chinas vital oil supplies to the North. And North Korea may find ways of mitigating their effects. It has been tapping new sources of cash, such as by sending more workers abroad to earn hard currency at logging camps in Russia and on construction sites in the Middle Eastactivities that are also not covered by the latest resolution. If the new sanctions deter some traders, others may fill the gap, especially Chinese middlemen attracted by high commissions for riskier dealings on behalf of North Korean state trading companies. North Korea has a thriving black market in everything from computers to fine cognac, oiled by corrupt Chinese customs officials along its 1,400km (870-mile) border with China. The sanctions regime is likely to increase that illegal trade, not crush it.

North Korean coal shipments, by their size, should be easier to track. Yet a large loophole remains that allows exports for livelihood purposes. Kim Byung-yeon of Seoul National University says certifying end-use would be wholly impractical. Proceeds from coal exports and most other trading activities typically remain in China in the form of credit. These are pools of ready cash for North Korean elites to draw on for their trade. And North Korea has proven adept at skirting sanctions by setting up front companies and shuffling ownershipshifting control of a trading company from a blacklisted government agency to one that is not, for example.

Recent reports by a UN panel have found that North Korea routinely renames firms hit by sanctions and registers its cargo ships under foreign flags (among them, Cambodia, Kiribati and Sierra Leone). States that neglect to enforce sanctions are not penalised. Since the previous resolution in 2013, more than 150 of the UNs 193 member states have failed to submit required reports on their implementation of those sanctions; last year, four of them were members of the Security Council.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,Unity in disunity,[],"EYES hooded, features blade-sharp and shoulders square, Margaret Thatcher looked every bit her caricature as she addressed the House of Commons on October 30th 1990. Just returned from a European summit in Rome, she sounded it, too. The prime minister took aim at the Commissions federal ambitions and boomed her dissent: No. No. No. So stark was this objection to the continents integration that Geoffrey Howe, her former foreign secretary, resigned two days later, triggering her fall from office. Partly because of the drama of those days, Europe has since transfixed and sundered the Conservative Party.

That seems especially so now, as Britains in-out referendum campaign gets rolling. Having promised the vote three years ago in an (apparently vain) attempt to cure the Tories of their neurosis, David Cameron hoped to limit support for Brexit to his partys margins. But at the latest count a little under half of his 330 MPs are for Out, among them two big names: Michael Gove, the justice secretary, and Boris Johnson, Londons mayor. Merely disappointed in the former (a convinced eurosceptic), the prime minister is incandescent at the latter (a political opportunist). In a statement to the Commons on February 22nd he issued a string of barely veiled attacks on Mr Johnsons arguments and motives as his target looked on, rather sheepishly, from the back benches.

The family feud will only intensify in the months leading up to the referendum on June 23rd. Piqued by Mr Camerons barbs, the popular mayor is now throwing his full weight behind the Out campaign. On March 1st he dismissed dire government warnings about the risks of Brexit as baloney. Meanwhile otherwise loyal MPs mock the prime ministers renegotiation of Britains EU membership with Trump-esque scorn. Out in the country some six in ten Tory members plan to vote to leave the EU according to YouGov. Strategists worry about how to heal the wounds after the referendum.

So it is tempting to see the surprisingly sudden and vitriolic confrontation between parts of the party as the latest chapter in its long history of eruptions over Europe. That story encompasses first Thatcher and her Europhile assassins, then Johnnow Sir JohnMajor and the anti-Brussels bastards, as he called them, in his cabinet and later the partys irritable 13 years in opposition.

But what is happening now is different. Take the comparison with the Major years. In the 1990s the Conservative fringe was calling for Brexit, but a significant section of the party also remained wedded to the European ideal. In 1994, two years after Britains humiliating crash out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, the forerunner to the euro, almost a third of Tory members supported further integration and almost a quarter wanted a federal Europe. Although Sir John insisted that Britain must remain at the heart of Europe, in 1996 party bigwigs chided him for being insufficiently pro-European.

In the intervening years Europes economic woescombined with the drum beat of the anti-EU newspapers, Mr Camerons ill-advised Eurosceptic overtures to his base and the rise of the UK Independence Partyhave transformed the picture. Look past todays theatrics and it is clear that almost the whole party has rallied around what, two decades ago, would have counted as its anti-EU pole. On one extreme are hard nationalists who want a complete breach. On the other are a handful of convinced Europhiles. But the vast majority, spanning In and Out camps, agrees that Britain should be in the EUs outermost orbit: beyond the euro zone and the (notionally) borderless Schengen zone, exempt from as many rules and costs as is practical and under no circumstances subject to further integration.

In graphics: A guide to Brexit from the European Union

The referendum debate, however bad-tempered, merely concerns the most beneficial way to achieve this semi-detachment; it is about procedure more than principle. Most Conservative supporters of membership argue that Britains interests are best served by remaining a member and securing opt-outs reinforcing its special position on the edge of a multi-speed union. Some on this side (like Oliver Letwin, who runs the Cabinet Office) actually support Brexit but think now the wrong time. Their opponents generally want the country to quit, retain its access to the single marketperhaps at the price of some continued pooling of powerand assume an observer status in the European institutions. Were all Eurosceptics now, reckons Michael Fallon, the defence secretary (and a typically unsentimental In voter).

The best example of the muddy reality of what at first glance looks like a binary divide is Mr Johnson who, by his own admission, has been veering all over the place like a shopping trolley on the subject. Having initially endorsed Out on the grounds that it would enable Britain to demand and secure a bespoke form of half-membership, he switched to admitting out means out when Mr Cameron refuted his claim, but still hints at the possibility of some sort of intermediate option.

Bastards get the last laugh

The Tory partys convergence on this territory will continue beyond June. Whatever the result of the vote, Londons mayor stands a good chance of succeeding Mr Cameron (YouGov gives him a 21-point lead among party members) whenever the prime minister chooses, or is forced, to step down. The elevated salience of the EU question means it will dominate candidate selections, propelling the parliamentary party in a yet more Eurosceptic direction. Even if the country votes In there could be talk of a new referendum in the near future. And either way, any notion of Britain being at the heart of Europe will be dead. Thus although todays campaign will bruise egos and break friendships, the bigger story is of a creeping consensus: over years of squabbling a once keenly pro-European party has gradually embraced a peripheral status in the union. In 1990 Thatchers Euroscepticism shocked her party. Now it looks restrained.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Refugees may start to cross over Albania,[],"THE ITALIANS could scarcely believe their eyes. Twenty-five years ago thousands of Albanians, crammed onto leaky boats, began arriving in the southern port of Brindisi, on the south-east coast of Italy (pictured). Communism was collapsing in Albania and rumours had spread that the Italians were handing out visas. In August alone 20,000 packed onto a single ship. Then the Italians promised to pay the Albanian government $9m ($16m today) to keep their people at home and the flow of people came to an end.

Todays migrant crisis gives many Albanians mixed feelings. As a country of emigrants Albanians are sympathetic to others who flee war or who just want better lives. Just under 3m people live there; at least 1m Albanians, the largest part of the diaspora, live in Greece and Italy. Last year just under 55,000 tried their luck at escaping poverty by joining the flow from the Middle East and applying for political asylum in Germany (nearly all will fail).

The Albanian authorities have started to worry that Albania is going to have to deal with people arriving rather than leaving. Some now predict that refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraqmany of whom are blocked in Greece from entering Europe through Macedoniamay now try their luck through Albania. Small numbers have been detected on the routes across Kosovo, Montenegro and Bosnia. Rumours are circulating that Albanian mafiosi are looking in Italy for rubber dinghies known as gommoni to speed migrants to Italy as they did with thousands of Kurds and others in the 1990s. So far nothing, bar the odd drug-smuggling speedboat, appears to be crossing the Adriatic. Many migrants in Greece have heard that Albania is risky and that if you are not robbed and killed by the mafia you risk spending a year in jail. In the last few months only a few hundred have had a go.

Although the country has experienced a sudden influx of migration beforeduring the Kosovo war of 1998-99 around 500,000 Kosovo Albanians went there and stayed until the war was overin many respects it is ill-prepared. Albania is now deploying extra police to guard its borders. On March 4th Italy promised to send men and equipment to help on both land and sea. But Edi Rama, Albanias prime minister, says that his country is not open to migrants. So one more country along the Balkan migrant trail may yet become overwhelmed by, and then deeply hostile to, thousands of refugees fleeing war. The fact that so many Albanians have found welcome abroad may count for little.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-09 13:26:35,"High steaks: Trump strides through Michigan, where Clinton falters",[],"HEADING into the primary votes in Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho and Hawaii on March 8th, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton appeared to be headed in opposite directionsand so it turned out. Mr Trump pulled off his second super Tuesday in a fortnight; he won the two biggest states, Mississippi and Michigan by big margins, thereby completing a near sweep of the South and opening a new front for his populist campaign in the Midwest. Mrs Clinton had a more mixed experience; she won easily in Mississippi but lost narrowly to Bernie Sanders in Michigan, where polls had put her more than 20 percentage points ahead.

Yet this was the opposite of the divergence expected of the Republican and Democratic front-runners. Going into the primaries, Mr Trump had had maybe his worst week of the campaign. He had talked up the size of his penis in a television debate and whipped up a crowd in Orlando to pledge allegiance to him while making a gesture that looked far too close for decency like a Nazi salute. He had been castigated by Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee in 2012, as a phony, a fraud, who was playing members of the American public for suckers. On March 7th Mr Trump was trounced by Ted Cruz in Kansas and Maine, both of which he had been predicted to win; he won Louisiana and Kentucky by narrower-than-expected margins. It really seemed as if he might at last have been rumbledthat Peak Trump was past. Fat chance of that.

To keep on course to win the Republican ticket, by one calculation, Mr Trump needed to win 59 delegates on March 8th. He won precisely that number in Mississippi, Michigan and Idaho, where he came second to Mr Cruz, before votes had come in from Hawaii. He also saw two of his likeliest obstacles to his winning the nomination, Florida and Ohio, where a total of 165 delegates are up for grabs on March 15th, shrivel with the fortunes of Marco Rubio and John Kasich.

Mr Rubio, a senator from Florida, is trying to overhaul a big lead by Mr Trump in his home state; a dismal humiliation on March 9th has now made that harder. In the three mainland states, Mr Rubio failed to cross the 15% threshold required to win a single delegate. That leaves him, the main hope of the Republican establishment, with two poxy wins, in Puerto Rico and Minnesota, from a possible 24. Mr Trump has won 15; Mr Cruz seven. It is increasingly hard to think Mr Rubio can win Florida or stay in the race for long after it. Mr Kasich, the governor of Ohio, has already said that he will quit if he fails to win his state; his third-place finish in neighbouring Michigan, where he had campaigned hard, was yet another blow to that ambition.

If Mr Trumps latest strong showing has probably made it considerably likelier that he will indeed bag the Republican ticket, Mrs Clintons defeat makes it scarcely less likely that she will win the Democratic one. She has a lead over Mr Sanders of more than 200 delegates which, given the proportional way they are divvied up in the Democratic contest, he looks unable to rein in. Thanks to her crushing win in Mississippi, where she won 83% of the vote, she in fact increased her delegate lead, despite her stumble in Michigan. Yet Mr Sanderss slim victory there, where he won 50% of the vote, has made it likelier that the Democratic contest will be drawn out, into May and perhaps beyond, which could be damaging to Mrs Clintons general-election prospects. It will delay her expected pivot back towards the centre, from the left-wing arguments Mr Sandersa self-declared socialisthas forced her into making. It will also advertise the many weaknesses in her candidacy that Mr Sanders has highlighted.

Most of Mrs Clintons dozen wins have been based on huge support from African-Americansexit polls in Mississippi suggested she had won 89% of the black vote there. Elsewhere, she has found the going harder, with Mr Sanderss excoriations of Wall Street, free trade and elite politics winning him big majorities with younger and white voters in most states outside the South. He managed that in Michigan, a state that has lost many thousands of factory jobs in recent decades. Exit polls suggested he had won 81% of younger voters in the state; he also cut Mrs Clintons lead among blacks to around 65%. He won clear majorities of those who felt that international trade had cost American jobs and who worried about the current state of the economy. This suggested he has, at the least, a fighting chance of winning one or two more in a looming series of Midwestern rust-bucket states, including Ohio, Illinois and Wisconsin. Given that all those states voted Democrat in recent general elections, and that Mr Trump would campaign hard in them on a similarly protectionist platform to Mr Sanderss, it presents Mrs Clinton with a considerable problem. She must not only keep on fighting Mr Sanders, but also find a better answer to the economic discontentment he is drawing on. She must be tempted to sound a shriller, more populist note herself, which would certainly be off-putting to the centrists Mr Trump, a politician even more disliked than Mrs Clinton, is bound to alienate.

Indeed, perhaps nothing could reunite the splintered Republican coalitionin disdainso effectively as the sight of Mrs Clinton in left-wing campaigning mode. Mr Trump, however, gave little thought to such delicious things in the bizarre, or mad, victory speech he gave at one of his golf clubs in Florida to celebrate his primary wins.

Stung by recent criticisms of his business history, which includes several high-profile failures, he used the speech as an opportunity to showcase some of the many products he has hawked over the years: Trump wine, Trump vodka, Trump water and Trump steaks. Mr Trump has often been accused of throwing red meat to his angry supporters; as the assembled cameras fixed on piles of meat, that seemed to be literally the case. Trump steaks. Where are the steaks? Do we have steak? We have Trump steak, rambled Mr Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, sounding very much like a cable-television shopping-channel presenter.

His steak business, as it happens, seems to have been non-functioning since 2007. So if the meat he had brought to his rally was his own, it cannot be fit for consumption. The steaks, for Mr Trump and America, have perhaps never been higher.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,Red ink rising,[],"HOW worrying are Chinas debts? They are certainly enormous. At the end of 2015 the countrys total debt reached about 240% of GDP. Private debt, at 200% of GDP, is only slightly lower than it was in Japan at the onset of its lost decades, in 1991, and well above the level in America on the eve of the financial crisis of 2007-08 (see chart). Sooner or later China will have to reduce this pile of debt. History suggests that the process of deleveraging will be painful, and not just for the Chinese.

Explosive growth in Chinese debt is a relatively recent phenomenon. Most of it has accumulated since 2008, when the government began pumping credit through the economy to keep it growing as the rest of the world slumped. Chinese companies are responsible for most of the borrowing. The biggest debtors are large state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which responded eagerly to the governments nudge to spend.

State sponsors of error

The borrowing binge is still in full swing. In January banks extended $385 billion (3.5% of GDP) in new loans. On February 29th the Peoples Bank of China spurred them on, reducing the amount of cash banks must keep in reserve and so freeing another $100 billion for new lending. Signs of stress are multiplying. The value of non-performing loans in China rose from 1.2% of GDP in December 2014 to 1.9% a year later. Many SOEs do not seem to be earning enough to service their debts; instead, they are making up the difference by borrowing yet more. At some point they will have to tighten their belts and start paying down their debts, or banks will have to write them off at a losswith grim consequences for growth in either case.

An IMF working paper published last year identified credit growth as the single best predictor of financial instability. Yet China is not obviously vulnerable to the two most common types of financial crisis. The first is the external sort, like Asias in 1997-98. In such cases, foreign lending sparks a boom that eventually fizzles, prompting loans to dry up. Firms, unable to roll over their debts, must cut spending to save money. As consumption and investment slump, net exports rise, helping bring in the money needed to repay foreign creditors. China does not fit this mould, however. More than 95% of its debt is domestic. Capital controls, huge foreign-exchange reserves and a current-account surplus help defend it from capital flight.

The other common form of crisis is a domestic balance-sheet recession, like the ones that battered Japan in the early 1990s and America in 2008. In both cases, dud loans swamped the banking system. Central banks then struggled to keep demand growing while firms and households paid down their debts.

Chinas banks are certainly at risk from a rash of defaults. Markets now price the big lenders at a discount of about 30% on their book value. Yet whereas Americas Congress agreed to recapitalise banks only in the face of imminent collapse, the Chinese authorities will surely be more generous. The central governments relatively low level of debt, at just over 40% of GDP, means it has plenty of room to help the banks. Indeed, with the right policies, China could survive a deleveraging without too much pain.

By borrowing and spending, firms boost demand; when paying down debts they subtract from it. In the absence of new borrowing elsewhere in the economy, growth will atrophy. Chinas government could try to compensate by borrowing more itself to finance a fiscal stimulus. It might also use low interest rates to encourage households to borrow more. (This weeks cut in banks reserve requirements seems designed to buoy Chinas property market.) But orchestrating such a switch in growth engines is not easy. Firms and households might instead be forced to deleverage simultaneously, exacerbating the pain. Household debt in China is low but rising fast, raising the risk of a double crunch in future.

Moreover, China would have to ensure that existing bad debts are written down and bankrupt SOEs shuta tall order politically. Reports this week claimed it plans to lay off 5m workers, but big firms will resist a proper reckoning. The bumbling response to the stockmarket and currency wobbles of the past year calls into question the leaderships competence. The government may be able to prevent an outright banking crisis, but the slump that usually accompanies a deleveraging will be harder to avoid.

Foreign demand could perhaps help make up for the shortfall in domestic spending. Deleveraging commonly occurs alongside large depreciations; as spending in indebted economies falls the value of the currency declines, giving exports a boost. That, in turn, helps put idle capacity to work and bolsters the income of firms repaying loans. Big depreciations can also boost inflation, helping keep the deleveraging economy out of a debt-deflation trap, in which falling prices and incomes make debts with fixed values more expensive to service. Countries that see big depreciations while deleveraging, as many Asian ones did in 1997-98, typically suffer sharp but short downturns before reverting to growth. In contrast, in countries that resist depreciation, as Japan did in the 1990s and peripheral Europe has done recently, deleveraging is slower and more painful.

Chinas government seems determined to prop up the yuan. But it may struggle to do so while the economy deleverages. The grinding recovery that would imply has political costs. And cutting rates to boost borrowing elsewhere in the economy would place further downward pressure on the yuan, forcing the government either to tighten capital controls yet more, run down its foreign-exchange reserves or let the currency drop.

With a deft enough touch, Chinas debt bomb could fizzle. The rapid pace of credit growth makes a benign outcome ever less likely, however. Given Chinas size, a prolonged deleveraging would place a dangerous drag on global demand growth, which the worlds weakened economies would struggle to cope with. The sooner China turns off the credit taps, the better.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-09 16:02:08,Monetary policy and the markets: What if the helicopters took off?,[],"INTEREST rates are negative in much of Europe and Japan, and it may be a while before the Federal Reserve follows up December's quarter-point increase in rates. So that doesn't leave the authorities with a lot of room, in terms of altering the level of rates, to ease policy if another downturn hits.

One option would be ""helicopter money"" - the central bank could create the money to fund a fiscal stimulus, either by direct transfers to consumers* or by funding public projects such as infrastructure. The idea would be to stimulate demand and potentially increase inflation, which is below target in many countries. Martin Wolf of the FT recently praised the idea, and he hobnobs with the world's policymakers on a regular basis. The hedge fund manager Ray Dalio is another who thinks that helicopter money is the next option.

Why might this be helpful? The economist Simon Wren-Lewis has said there is

an understandable view that it would be better to print money and give it to consumers who would spend it (helicopter money), rather than using it to buy government debt (QE) which may reduce long term interest rates which may help stimulate the economy. The second route has been tried and has not been that successful, so why not try the first route?

It is hard to see any central bank doing this without very explicit approval from their government, and that creates the very practical problem that neither the German government nor the Republicans in the US Congress would ever agree to such a thing. Helicopter money has more appeal to leftwing politicians since it can be classed as a redistributive policy. Either all citizens would get the same payout or, if the money is spent on infrastructure, unemployment would fall. A version of the policy has been proposed by Britain's Labour party.

So how would the markets react? Steven Englander of Citigroup tries to look through the implications in a research note. He works on the assumption of a US helicopter drop (although Europe or Japan look more likely candidates). The yield curve would steepen (long-dated bond yields would rise), and equities would do well (particularly cyclical stocks on the grounds that the effect would be to stimulate the economy. Surprisingly, perhaps, he thinks the effect would be positive for the dollar; stronger growth and higher bond yields would suck in foreign capital.

A lot would surely depend on the size of the stimulus and how it would be framed. A modest stimulus might lift inflation and demand a bit, without leading to talk of Weimar-style hyperinflation. Would the expansion be permanent or would the government pre-announce a plan to ""claw it back"" in a few years' time? That might reassure the markets but some consumers might save the money to meet the tax bill, making the stimulus less effective. There is also a risk that a lot of money might be spent on imports - flat screen TVs and foreign holidays. That might cause the current account deficit to soar, potentially negative for the currency. The effect might be to stimulate overseas economies, allowing them to free ride on the helicopter. So one answer would be to get lots of countries to pursue helicopter money simultaneously, rather as they agreed to use fiscal stimulus after Lehman collapsed.

There are, of course, lots of potential snags. What would happen to those investors who bought bonds at ultra-low yields if bond prices plunged? No problem for pension funds (whose liabilities would fall too) but it might be a problem for banks. And it is possible that investors might take fright; that monetisation of government spending might be a broken taboo too far. After all, what government would ever want to raise taxes or cut spending, if lots of voter-friendly boondoggles could be financed by a tame central bank?

* This might be more difficult than proponents assume. Matthew Klein at the FT suggests

direct deposits into household accounts offered at the central bank. Its simple and doesnt require any political debate about how best to spend the newly created money.

But around 10m US households and 1.5m British adults lack a bank account, many of whom will be poor. Is it fair to exclude them? By the same token, these people may not be on the electoral roll. And would you deliberately exclude people? Prisoners? Immigrants? One can only imagine the political furore that could be created, or the headlines if some people spend the proceeds on cocaine or a drinking binge. Building lots of schools and hospitals might be the safer option.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,Rotten advice,[],"FINANCIAL markets can seem bewildering to those who dont have the time and energy to understand them: all that jargon, all those sudden switches in mood. So it is natural that people look for help when trying to find the right products. In America, more than half of all households have sought advice, according to a survey conducted in 2010. They have more than 650,000 registered financial advisers to choose from.

But how good is that advice? It can be hard to tell. There may be an information asymmetry between the advisers and the clients, simply because finance can be so complex. Furthermore, although a diner can instantly tell if wine is corked or steak is tough, it may be many years before the success or failure of a financial tip becomes apparent.

A new paper* examines the records of American financial advisers between 2005 and 2015, using a database that contains 1.2m individuals. It finds that 7% of the advisers were disciplined for misconduct over the period, resulting in a median payment to customers of $40,000 in compensation. Around one-third of the miscreants are repeat offenders; past transgressors are five times more likely to engage in misconduct than the average adviser.

What happens to the offenders? Just over half, astonishingly, keep their job. Although the remainder are let go, 44% of them are rehired by another firm within a year. On average, they take a 10% pay cut, but they continue to work as investment advisers. Unsurprisingly, the paper finds that these miscreants tend to move to firms that hire more people with a record of misconduct than is typical. The same firms are less likely to fire their staff if they do something wrong.

Why dont such firms lose all their clients? The authors suggest that advisers with a dark past tend to prey on elderly or unsophisticated customers. At any rate, they seem to congregate in relatively wealthy, elderly and less educated counties. In some places in Florida and California, one in five advisers has a record of misconduct.

It is a sorry tale. But information on advisers records is at least readily available at BrokerCheck, a website run by FINRA, an American regulator. Clearly, a lot more investors need to use it.",[]
economist.com,2015-07-31 17:27:02-04:00,How you know its time for an executive education course,[],"No matter how seasoned an executive is, the ever-changing business world requires even the most experienced leaders to adapt by learning both new skills and new ways of thinking. Here are five circumstances in which youll know its time to start looking at executive education programmes.

1. Youre getting promoted (or want to be)

Moving up in a company means youll be managing people whose jobs are outside your expertise. So, expand your knowledge base, whether that means learning the basics of finance and technology or building muscle in large-scale strategic thinking. No matter how impressive your track record as an executive has been over the course of your career, even the most seasoned business leaders learn at one point or another that additional development is necessary, especially when making a push for a promotion. Harvard Business Review recently outlined the experiences of Ralph Thomas, Vice President of Operations at Smith & Mullins. While Thomas was perfectly qualified for a promotion to General Manager, he was ultimately passed over by another internal candidate who displayed a stronger knack for strategic thinking and communicated more effectively with other upper-level executives than he did. Executive education courses in areas such as strategy and corporate development were built with these opportunities for growth in mind.

2. You're considering pursuing a full degree, but want to try a single course first

With the number of free, low-commitment educational resources available to executives online today, its no surprise that skepticism creeps in when considering the necessity of additional academic or professional degrees. Ultimately, only you can decide whether another degree is a worthwhile investment for you. For some, sampling the field with a single course can help in that decision.

The biggest benefit is also the most apparent: an executive education course is a far smaller personal investment than a full degree. Business schools offer executive education courses that are certificate-track, should you end up deciding to continue on that path.

3. You want to discover that which you do not yet know you don't know

It can feel like a blow to the ego, but acknowledging that you dont know something is an effective way to show that youre motivated to figure out how to do it. As Business Insider put it when referencing the popular book, Freakonomics, while saying that youre unsure is a good first step, you still have to work like a dog to learn.

While you cannot predict every challenge your business will face, you should always be preparing yourself to tackle the unknown. There are plenty of executive education courses that will keep you ahead of the curve and stay ready to rise to the occasion in new and unfamiliar waters. Such programmes cover topics including developing a vision, strategic leadership and thriving in complex scenarios.

4. You're considering switching careers and want to start gaining skills and knowledge in a new field while still at your current job

Surely, you possess a number of shared skills that are valuable and transferrable across a number of fields. However, its common to discover larger-than-anticipated knowledge or experience gaps when considering switching careers. Allen Blue, co-founder of LinkedIn, recently told Business Insider that in the end, nobody makes a career switch on his or her own. People will help you make that transition, he adds, and people you know right now will help you find those people. As important as it is to seek out courses that will prepare you for your career shift, its just as important to look for networking opportunities within those programmes.

Weve discussed the benefits of group-based learning for executives looking to build relationships and grow their networks. These networking opportunities are particularly valuable for executives considering a career change. When sorting through all of your options, ask yourself these questions to identify programmes that will give your existing networks - and your future career - an added boost.

5. Your employer wants you to go for it.

This is what corporate education budgets are for. If youre lucky enough to have a boss with the budget and initiative to encourage your continuing growth, take advantage. Even if your employer doesnt broach the topic, dont be afraid to bring it up yourself, especially if youll be returning with additional skills to help you perform your job duties at a higher level. If this is the case, many employers understand the value of investing in their employees growth, even if they initially need some convincing.

economist.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,A bill allowing shops in Britain to stay open longer on Sundays is defeated,[],"SINCE its return to power last May, Britains Conservative government has made clear its intention to loosen the laws on Sunday trading by devolving decisions over shops opening hours to local councils. Its attempt to do so on March 9th was defeated in the House of Commons by an unlikely alliance of churchgoing Tories, left-wing Labourites and opportunistic Scottish Nationalists.

Shops larger than 3,000 square feet (280 square metres) are allowed to open on Sundays for a maximum of six hours only, between 10am and 6pm. The government says loosening the regulations would help the high street, which is struggling to compete with online retailers that trade seven days a week. Labour opposed the plan on the ground that workers could be forced to work when they do not want to. Tory traditionalists said Sunday should remain a day of rest.

If that is dubious, the opposition of the Scottish National Party (SNP) is odder still. First, the bill would have affected only England and Wales, making it doubtful whether Scottish MPs should have had a say. Second, in Scotlandwhere the SNP is in powerthere are no such restrictions on Sunday trading.

The SNP says that if the law changed in England, retailers might reduce the weekend wages of Scots, some of whom by convention enjoy a Sunday premium worth roughly 150% of hourly pay. Scottish Labour claims that Scottish shopworkers could lose as much as 1,400 ($2,000) per year if the premium were cut.

By some estimates about 60,000 retail employees get this premium. In reality there is little reason to believe that slightly longer Sunday hours in England would prompt shops in Scotland to reduce wages. Even if they did, there would be winners as well as losers: shops would hire more workers if wages were lower, something the 1,400 figure does not account for.

The SNP had a clearer motive for killing the bill. Outvoting the government in Westminsterits second Commons defeat so far this Parliamentwas a coup, coming just before Scottish parliamentary elections in May. And it helped to distract from Scotlands woeful fiscal performance, data for which were also released on March 9th. With the collapse in the oil price, tax revenues have dwindled; Scotlands budget deficit is now almost 10% of GDP, twice Britains overall level. Whatever the merits of Sunday trading, it is being put on hold in England and Wales for the worst possible reasons.",[]

And a delivery boy named Anil is already racing along his route on a motor bike borrowed from his uncle, his delivery backpack as large as he is. He has been up for hours, planning his route and carefully filling his bag with the packages to be dropped off first stacked near the top.

Anil enters a block of flats, squeezes his backpack into a narrow lift and delivers a shirt to a 21-year-old taxi driver. In a neighbouring tower he hands a smartphone case to a 16-year-old who uses several apps to do the shopping for his family. A short ride away, a 78-year-old grandmother is a particularly pleased customerwith help from her grandson, she has bought some clay pickling jars that she couldnt find elsewhere and some high-quality saris at a knock-down price. For Anil, it is gruelling work. But he is betting that e-commerce in India has nowhere to go but up, and he wants to ride up with it.

In the next 15 years India will see more people come online than any other country. Last year e-commerce sales were about $16 billion; by 2020, according to Morgan Stanley, a bank, the online retail market could be more than seven times larger. Such sales are expected to grow faster in India than in any other market. This has attracted a flood of investment in e-commerce firms, the impact of which may go far beyond just displacing offline retail.

Indias small businesses have limited access to loans; most of its consumers do not have credit cards, or for that matter credit. The e-commerce companies are investing in logistics, helping merchants borrow and giving consumers new tools to pay for goods. Amit Agarwal, who runs Amazon.in, holds out the hope that We could actually be a catalyst to transform India: how India buys, how India sells, and even transform lives.

The jewel in the crown

Amazon wants to make India its second-biggest market, after America. For the time being, though, with just 12% of the market, it lags behind the home-grown successes, Flipkart (45%) and Snapdeal (26%). All three, as well as some smaller competitors, are spending at a blistering rate. As global markets dip and Silicon Valley unicorns stumble, the international funding that makes this possible may dry up. Doubts about the sustainability of the companies present plans were underlined when, on February 26th, one of Morgan Stanleys mutual funds marked down the value of its stake in Flipkart by 27%. If the prospect of changing India a billion deliveries at a time is a beguiling one, it is not for the faint-hearted.

Indias visionaries keep their spirits up by remembering the example of China. Chinese e-commerce grew by nearly 600% between 2010 and 2014, making the country the biggest e-commerce market in the world today. It managed this largely through the growth of indigenous companies: mighty Amazon merely nips at the heels of home-grown giants Alibaba and JD.com; eBay has all but left the stage. And in the process Chinas top e-commerce firms came to offer an astonishing range of services.

Alibaba, founded by Jack Ma in 1999 and now valued at $184 billion, provides the best illustration. To calm anxieties about buying online Alibaba created Alipay, which holds a shoppers payment in escrow until he receives his order. The tool has evolved into a financial-services company, Ant Financial, which last year serviced more than 400m Alipay accounts and made over 2m loans to small businesses and entrepreneurs. To provide Chinese consumers with access to foreign goods the firms services include not just online listings but marketing, shipping and help with customs.

Alibaba is now building service centres in remote areas where shoppers can order, pick up and sell goods, as well as pay their bills. It is a further step in its attempts not merely to benefit from the growth in Chinese consumption, but to shape and accelerate it. The degree to which it has succeeded suggests that the earlier an e-commerce company arrives in a countrys development, the wider its role might be.

India is in many ways a tougher market for e-commerce than China. Its population is poorer and its infrastructure worse. But its prospects look remarkable. Income per person, which in 2014 was $1,570, could be twice that by 2025. Two-thirds of Indians are younger than 35, and their phones give a huge number of them access to the internet. In December 2014 smartphones accounted for one in five Indian mobiles, according to Goldman Sachs. Just six months later, they accounted for one in four (see chart 1). Morgan Stanley expects internet penetration to rise from 32% in 2015 to 59% in 2020. By 2030, India is projected to be a one-billion-person digital market.

The prospect of a second market growing to a near-Chinese size attracts those who made a packet the first time round. Bob van Dijk, the chief executive of Naspers, a South African firm that backed JD.com and Tencent, Chinas largest social-media company, says he looks for countries with big populations, rising smartphone use and few retail chains. India, where malls, supermarkets and branded chains, or what analysts call organised retail, account for just 10% or so of the total market, fits the bill perfectly.

The middlemen

Naspers owns a 17% stake in Flipkart; other JD.com investors, including Tiger Global Management, in New York, and DST Global, a Russian fund, have also backed the company. Japans SoftBank, a big investor in Alibaba, has backed Snapdeal since 2013, and Alibaba itself followed suit last August. Meanwhile Alibabas Ant Financial owns a 20% stake in Indias Paytm, which began as a mobile-wallet company and now competes with Snapdeal and Flipkart as an online marketplace. The three firms have a combined valuation of almost $25 billion.

In contrast to those investors trying to recapitulate their Chinese success, Amazon is seeking to make up for its failure. Reduced last year to the ignominy of having to open a shop on Alibabas Tmall site, Jeff Bezos is determined that this time, with more experience and in a more open market, things will be different.

When Flipkart was founded, in 2007, Amazon was obviously its model. The company began as a bookseller; the two engineers who started it, Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal (not related), had worked for Amazon. Mr Bezos, though, is of the opinion that if anyone if going to be the Amazon of India, it should be Amazon. In 2014, shortly after Flipkart announced a $1 billion round of funding, Mr Bezos donned Indian clothes in Bangalore, hopped aboard a rainbow-coloured truck and handed Mr Agarwal a $2 billion cheque. A firm which earned over $100 billion in 2015 and has shareholders content to see more or less nothing by way of profits can afford such largesse.

Neither Flipkart, Amazon, nor any of the other big competitors are following the retail strategy that led to Amazons success in the West. Indian regulations bar foreign-backed e-commerce firms from owning inventory, and so acting as a straightforward retailer is not an option. As a result Indias top e-commerce companies look much more like Alibaba. Flipkart has become a marketplace where sellers offer everything from mobile phones to washing machines to handbags. Snapdeal, Amazon and Paytm run marketplaces too. The firms compete feverishly on price, offering discounts that chomp away their own margins. In the long term, they must differentiate themselves by honing services for sellers and shoppers alike, and offering a better, broader range of products to more Indians than would have them otherwise.

The first step to that goal is to boost the number of sellers on the companys platformit is the sellers, after all, who pay commissions and shipping fees. So companies offer a range of services to lure businesses to their sites. Flipkarts programmes range from teaching sellers how to manage peak sales during diwali to advising fashion brands on trends and production. In February Amazon announced a travelling studio-on-wheels, offering training, photography and other services to help shop-owners come online.

But the most important help they offer is in easing access to credit. Small businesses, given their scarce financial statements and limited credit history, have long had trouble obtaining loans from Indias banks. They often rely on expensive loans from neighbours or family. The e-commerce companies have strong incentives to make them better offersand because they have access to online-sales data they are in a privileged position from which to help lenders judge credit risk.

Take Sumit Agarwal (no relation to Amazons Mr Agarwal), a young entrepreneur who started an online shoe business in 2011. In his warehouse in New Delhi workers pack and scan shipments among towers of shoeboxes. The early days were uncertain; his familys reaction when the firm started, he says, was What the hell is this guy doing? Now it is easier for such entrepreneurs to find the capital with which to grow. When Mr Agarwal logs into his sellers account on Amazon.in his screen offers a column of short-term loans, their rates calculated using data from his transactions. Other e-commerce firms have similar schemes. In January Snapdeal announced that the State Bank of India would approve loans of up to $37,000 instantly if it liked the look of the data that Snapdeal provided on the borrower.

Once a site has sellers, the second challenge is to help consumers buy their wares. Anil carries a clunky credit-card reader with him on his rounds, but most people pay cash. The e-commerce sites want to change that. Paytm lets customers add money to a digital wallet that can then be used to shop online, top up a mobile phone, lend money to a friend, pay a bill or use a service such as an Uber taxi. It has 120m digital-wallet accounts, nearly six times Indias number of credit cards. Snapdeal bought its own mobile payments company in April. Amazon purchased an online-payments service in February.

A fine balance

If a consumer does buy a product, the next task is delivering it. Delivery itself is nothing new. Indians have long been able to have a delivery boy from the local kiranathe cornershops that dominate Indian retailbring them a stick of butter. But being able to deliver on a larger scale is a challenge. The countrys mail service, India Post, is ill-equipped to wait while a shopper tries on a kurta and ponders returning it. So newcomers are building networks. But Indias traffic is hellish and its addresses vague.

A startup named Delhivery has hired more than 15,000 staff, from developers to executives poached from Facebook and posh consultancies. Its headquarters in Gurgaon are so packed that engineers spill onto an outdoor porch, tapping their keyboards furiously. Delhivery, which works with a number of e-commerce firms, is using machine learning to subdivide Indias postcodes, the better to map idiosyncratic descriptions. Well know the house with the yellow door next to the temple, says Sandeep Barasia, the managing director. The company moves goods to 700 or so small distribution centres overnight to avoid congested main roads during business hours. Thousands of delivery boys then dash to and from the distribution centres throughout the day, bearing more than 20 kilos on their bikes.

E-commerce companies are devising their own solutions, too. Some investments, such as warehouses, are straightforward. Others are less so. Flipkart last year began using Mumbais famous network of dabbawallas, or lunch-delivery men, to drop off packages when they picked up customers lunch tins. Amazon has a pilot programme that lets customers order groceries online and have them delivered from the nearest kirana.

Together, e-commerce firms say, these experiments could create a new truly national marketplace. Neelkanth Mishra of Credit Suisse, a bank, points out that road construction, electrification and mobile phones have stoked big increases in rural wages, and thus demand for goods (see chart 2). Flipkart says that about half its sales come from outside Indias big cities. Snapdeal claims more than 60%. It recently launched seven regional-language versions of its website.

As they build out their markets the firms trumpet their assistance to small businesses. Some of the big sellers on Amazon only had a shop in a corner of Bangalore; they were happy selling to five kilometres around each shop, declares Amazons Mr Agarwal. Now they are shipping orders to Kashmir and eastern India. Amazon is helping more than 6,000 Indian businesses export, as well. Snapdeals Kunal Bahl is equally expansive: Our ambition is to be a great social, economic and geographic equaliser for the small businesses of India as they scale up.

All these bold plans are clouded by two obstinate facts. First, spending on discounts, marketing campaigns and new hires means none of the companies has yet made money. Visit any firms lobby and you will meet herds of job applicants. Delivery boys like Anil are in hot demanda top performer in his branch, he earns about 14,000 rupees ($200) each month.

Amazon is, predictably, outspending its competitors. Last year its sales were two-thirds the size of its losses. Mr Agarwal is not bothered by a lack of profit. The priority is growth, he explains. Ankit Nagori, Flipkarts chief business officer, says that the most important metrics for his company are not margins but the number of new customers, how often they shop, how much they buy and the speed of delivery. If you solve for these four things, he contends, then the top line and bottom line will fall in place.

A billion deliveries more

The second problem is regulatory. Forbidding foreign-backed firms from owning inventory has costs. Companies have limited control over the quality of products on their sites, points out Morgan Stanleys Parag Gupta, and they can do little to streamline the countrys fragmented supply chain. Flipkart has become a tangle of interlinked entities, including a holding company in Singapore, in an attempt to obey Indias rules while maximising profits.

Indias government may nonetheless come under protectionist pressure. Traditional retailers allege that the online marketplaces flout rules against foreign direct investment. Facebooks recently scuttled plan to offer Indians free internet services, including its own, sparked a furore over the risks of digital colonialism.

Offline retailers are watching all this intently. Kiranas are relatively protected, thanks to meagre tax bills and limited carrying costs (they store little). Big shops and malls are another story (see chart 3). What is remarkable for me is that in a very short time, e-commerce has become half of what the organised market is, says Abheek Singhi of the Boston Consulting Group. Two years down the line, three years down the line, the e-commerce market could be larger.

Big foreign retailerssuch as Ikea, a Swedish furniture company, which after years of kerfuffle may finally be opening an Indian storecannot sell directly online. Matters are simpler for Indian retailers, but their course remains cloudy. Reliance Industries, a conglomerate with over 1m square metres of shop floor, is planning its own e-commerce venture. Future Group, which pioneered hypermarkets in the country, is outfitting small shop-owners and entrepreneurs with digital catalogues so that consumers can order Future Group products in places where there will never be a store. However the firm has scaled back some of its more ambitious plans for e-commerce. The more sales you do, the more money you lose, muses Kishore Biyani, Future Groups founder. You need to have continuous funding and someone to back you.

For the time being, the big companies in the sector are having those needs met. You have at least three, potentially four large players with deep enough pockets, says Mr Singhi. Its going to play out at a very high cost. Companies like Alibaba and Amazon see that cost as worth paying in part because, just as they applied what they learned in China to India, so they will use their Indian experience in the next markets they move into. Alibaba, not content to back Paytm and Snapdeal, is also courting Indian businesses directly. In December it said it would help Indian firms with financing and logistics so they might use Alibabas platforms to export to China and beyond. Eventually, Mr Ma likes to say, any consumer should be able to buy from any seller, anywhere in the world. The more of those purchases go through one of his firms, the better.

And everywhere these giants go, home-grown entrepreneurs will be hoping that their local acumen will give them an edge and looking for overseas investors to back them. Many of them will fail: India does not yet offer an example of how to make a profit, and it may be a long time before it does. But as long as some of these efforts survive, they will serve to speed progress, and innovation, in developing markets. As Amazons Mr Agarwal says, If millions of small, medium enterprises out there, manufacturers and retailers, can...sell their product anywhere in the worldthats transformational.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,The Economist,[],"HILLARY CLINTON will be the Democratic nominee; the man most likely to face her in November on the Republican ticket is Donald Trump.

Those are the battle lines after the primaries on Super Tuesday. In many ways this is profoundly gloomy. Mr Trump has said ever more repellent things about immigrants, women and Muslims and declined to condemn white supremacists. But he changes his sales pitch as easily as his socks: in a speech after winning seven out of 11 states, he stopped snarling and tried to sound presidential. It would be unwise to underestimate his ability to feign gravitas and transform himself into an apparent centrist.

The only obstacle between Mr Trump and the Oval Office would be Mrs Clinton. She is a formidable and in some ways admirable candidate, but flawed. She is unloved by bits of her partys base and subject to an investigation into whether she mishandled classified information.

Small wonder that so many who contemplate American politics today sink into despair. But with a large dose of optimism and continued faith in the good sense of American voters, it is just possible to see Novembers election in a more positive light. The vote for the presidency could yet yield the reshaping of the two main parties and a political realignment that leads to a less stagnant and gridlocked government.

Be nice now

This optimistic scenario depends on converting todays antagonism into a force for change. The primaries have made clear that a large share of American voters are angry: angry with their own sides representatives, angry with their opponents and angry with the world.

So far, that anger has been channelled into divisiveness. On the right, Mr Trump has exploited the discontent by insulting his way to the front of the pack, stirring up racial resentment as he goes, delighting crowds with a list of proposals that run from the unethical to the unworkable. On parts of the left, the rage is more polite but, particularly where it is aimed at Wall Street, no less deeply felt.

In recent elections partisan fissures have been reinforced by the brutal maths of voter turnout. Polling shows that a majority of Republicans and Democrats believe that the other lot are so depraved as to pose a threat to the nation itself. Because it is hard to persuade people who think like this to switch sides, electoral strategists argue that chasing swing voters is pointless. The easiest extra votes come from the 40% of the electorate who typically stay at home in a presidential poll. Each side therefore concentrates on stirring up people who support it but might not vote. That raises the anger to a new pitch.

If this desperate logic is repeated in a Clinton v Trump race, the contest could have consequences both ugly and far-reaching, particularly for the Republicans. After winning a race fuelled by anger and led by Mr Trump, the party would almost certainly ditch its attachment to free trade and a muscular foreign policy and retreat into isolationism, xenophobia and economic populism. If it survived that shift (a big if), it would by the middle of the century be a white-nationalist party in a country that will be majority non-white. More likely, it would fracture, parts of the Republican coalition spinning off to find a new home elsewhere (see page 36).

For Mrs Clinton, going down the angry route might not split the party, but would almost certainly result in defeat. Democrats tend to fare poorly when their anguish overflows and begins to sound like contempt for America. It is hard to imagine Mrs Clinton credibly playing the political insurgent. She has decades of experience when the angriest voters want a novice. Nobody can out-hate Mr Trump. So it is encouraging that Mrs Clinton celebrated her victories on Super Tuesday by calling for more love and kindness in politics.

The opportunity for a better outcome lies in the asymmetry of the risks. Mrs Clinton has the opportunity to put together a coalition of anti-Trump voters broader than the one that carried Barack Obama to victory in 2008 and 2012. Despair over Mr Trump has reached such an intensity among some Republicans that the usual rules about there being no swing voters may no longer apply. If Mrs Clinton were to combine a high turnout on her own side with a sizeable number of Republican abstentions and spoilt ballots and some voters who are prepared to switch from red to blue, then Democrats could not just win the presidency with a landslide, but also wrest back control of the Senate.

To form this coalition for stopping the blond Berlusconi, Mrs Clinton would have to woo moderate, business-minded Republicans, and such folk would in turn have to put the national interest ahead of their tribes victory in November. Republicans like to talk about the importance of character (see Lexington); Mr Trump offers a chance to show that means something. Mr Trump often insults other Republicans; they owe him no loyalty. Some prominent Republicans have already begun to attack him, including Mitt Romney, the partys nominee in 2012. More will have to make that move.

Dont throw it away

After the election a broad coalition could melt away as fast as it had formed. Democrats could use their advantage to force through what they can without the support of their opponents while they have the chance. They would then be punished in subsequent elections and the federal government would return to its familiar divided self: unable to pass budgets, trim spending on entitlements or find money to repair roads.

Or a President Hillary Clinton might argue for the virtues of democratic compromise, and not claim that she can magically give her core voters everything they want all of the time. If she were able to pursue a different kind of politics, one that seeks to deal with some Republican concerns as well as Democratic ones, she might just hold the new consensus together for longer, reshaping the parties, making the country more governable and burying Mr Trumps offer of an America turned against itself. This is the distant promise that 2016 holds. As the battle lines are drawn, try to bear it in mind.",[]

Our interactive overview of European GDP, debt and jobs

THE recovery in the 19-strong euro area is continuing but it is nothing to write home about. Growth had picked up to 0.5% in the first quarter of 2015 (compared with the final quarter of 2014), the strongest performance since the upswing started in the spring of 2013. Since then, however, the pace of expansion has slackened, to 0.4% last spring and an average quarterly rate of 0.3% in the second half of last year. Indeed, euro-zone GDP in the final quarter of 2015 was still below its pre-crisis peak of early 2008 whereas Americas was almost 10% above its peak of late 2007.

The sluggish pace of the recovery has been especially disappointing given the fact that the euro area has benefited from a double fillip. First, the fall in energy prices caused by the collapse in the oil price acted in much the same way as a tax cut, boosting consumer spendingthe main engine of the recovery. Second, the European Central Bank has carried out quantitative easingcreating money to buy financial assetssince March 2015. Together with the introduction of negative interest rates in June 2014, this has brought the euro down and kept it weak, helping exporters and contributing to a big current-account surplus of 3.7% of GDP in 2015.

The outlook for growth in 2016 now looks feebler and more uncertain following the sharp falls in European equity markets, particularly of banking shares, since the start of the year. To the extent that this setback to stockmarkets undermines consumer and business confidence, it is likely to drag down growth. The slowdown in China and emerging economies, which account for a quarter of euro-zone exports, will also harm the recovery by hurting exporting companies. Germany will be particularly affected since the Chinese market has been a lucrative one for its exports of investment goods and luxury cars. Despite these brakes a recovery of sorts should remain intact, for three reasons. Renewed declines in oil prices will further boost household budgets. The European Central Bank is poised to loosen monetary policy still further when its governing council meets in March. And spending on refugees, especially in Germany, will provide a modest fiscal stimulus.

Mr Trump has said ever more repellent things about immigrants, women and Muslims and declined to condemn white supremacists. But he changes his sales pitch as easily as his socks: in a speech after winning seven out of 11 states, he stopped snarling and tried to sound presidential. It would be unwise to underestimate his ability to feign gravitas and transform himself into an apparent centrist.

The only obstacle between Mr Trump and the Oval Office would be Mrs Clinton. She is a formidable and in some ways admirable candidate, but flawed. She is unloved by bits of her partys base and subject to an investigation into whether she mishandled classified information.

Small wonder that so many who contemplate American politics today sink into despair. But with a large dose of optimism and continued faith in the good sense of American voters, it is just possible to see Novembers election in a more positive light. The vote for the presidency could yet yield the reshaping of the two main parties and a political realignment that leads to a less stagnant and gridlocked government.

Be nice now

This optimistic scenario depends on converting todays antagonism into a force for change. The primaries have made clear that a large share of American voters are angry: angry with their own sides representatives, angry with their opponents and angry with the world.

So far, that anger has been channelled into divisiveness. On the right, Mr Trump has exploited the discontent by insulting his way to the front of the pack, stirring up racial resentment as he goes, delighting crowds with a list of proposals that run from the unethical to the unworkable. On parts of the left, the rage is more polite but, particularly where it is aimed at Wall Street, no less deeply felt.

In recent elections partisan fissures have been reinforced by the brutal maths of voter turnout. Polling shows that a majority of Republicans and Democrats believe that the other lot are so depraved as to pose a threat to the nation itself. Because it is hard to persuade people who think like this to switch sides, electoral strategists argue that chasing swing voters is pointless. The easiest extra votes come from the 40% of the electorate who typically stay at home in a presidential poll. Each side therefore concentrates on stirring up people who support it but might not vote. That raises the anger to a new pitch.

If this desperate logic is repeated in a Clinton v Trump race, the contest could have consequences both ugly and far-reaching, particularly for the Republicans. After winning a race fuelled by anger and led by Mr Trump, the party would almost certainly ditch its attachment to free trade and a muscular foreign policy and retreat into isolationism, xenophobia and economic populism. If it survived that shift (a big if), it would by the middle of the century be a white-nationalist party in a country that will be majority non-white. More likely, it would fracture, parts of the Republican coalition spinning off to find a new home elsewhere (see page 36).

For Mrs Clinton, going down the angry route might not split the party, but would almost certainly result in defeat. Democrats tend to fare poorly when their anguish overflows and begins to sound like contempt for America. It is hard to imagine Mrs Clinton credibly playing the political insurgent. She has decades of experience when the angriest voters want a novice. Nobody can out-hate Mr Trump. So it is encouraging that Mrs Clinton celebrated her victories on Super Tuesday by calling for more love and kindness in politics.

The opportunity for a better outcome lies in the asymmetry of the risks. Mrs Clinton has the opportunity to put together a coalition of anti-Trump voters broader than the one that carried Barack Obama to victory in 2008 and 2012. Despair over Mr Trump has reached such an intensity among some Republicans that the usual rules about there being no swing voters may no longer apply. If Mrs Clinton were to combine a high turnout on her own side with a sizeable number of Republican abstentions and spoilt ballots and some voters who are prepared to switch from red to blue, then Democrats could not just win the presidency with a landslide, but also wrest back control of the Senate.

To form this coalition for stopping the blond Berlusconi, Mrs Clinton would have to woo moderate, business-minded Republicans, and such folk would in turn have to put the national interest ahead of their tribes victory in November. Republicans like to talk about the importance of character (see Lexington); Mr Trump offers a chance to show that means something. Mr Trump often insults other Republicans; they owe him no loyalty. Some prominent Republicans have already begun to attack him, including Mitt Romney, the partys nominee in 2012. More will have to make that move.

Dont throw it away

After the election a broad coalition could melt away as fast as it had formed. Democrats could use their advantage to force through what they can without the support of their opponents while they have the chance. They would then be punished in subsequent elections and the federal government would return to its familiar divided self: unable to pass budgets, trim spending on entitlements or find money to repair roads.

Or a President Hillary Clinton might argue for the virtues of democratic compromise, and not claim that she can magically give her core voters everything they want all of the time. If she were able to pursue a different kind of politics, one that seeks to deal with some Republican concerns as well as Democratic ones, she might just hold the new consensus together for longer, reshaping the parties, making the country more governable and burying Mr Trumps offer of an America turned against itself. This is the distant promise that 2016 holds. As the battle lines are drawn, try to bear it in mind.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,Schools and hard knocks,[],"IMAGINE being asked to take part in an activity that gives you somewhere between a 1-in-5 and 1-in-20 chance of a serious head injury over a four-month period. That could lead to weeks of impaired mental performance and headaches, and, especially if the blows are repeated, the danger of longer-term mental-health problems. Now imagine that your child is the one taking that risk.

Such are the dangers associated with playing American football. The risks of concussion are higher still in rugby, one of the worlds fastest-growing sports. These concerns have already prompted some changes. Rugby has introduced head-injury assessment rules, enabling players who have suspected concussions to be substituted temporarily so that they can be checked by medical staff. All 50 of Americas states have adopted return to play laws that require medical clearance before younger athletes who have sustained a concussion can take to the field again.

Such measures are welcome, but they sidestep the real issue: is it safe to play a game whose rules require people to slam into each other? As understanding grows of what happens in the brain when collisions take place (see article), the answer seems certain to be no.

Adults are able to consent to taking risks of this sort, even if they are not yet fully understood. That does not relieve sports authorities of their duty of care to playersone reason why American-football coaches at Ivy League universities have just agreed to get rid of full contact training sessions during the playing season. But liberal principles argue against the most drastic interventions. Boxing; barbarically dangerous though it is, should not be banned, nor should other sports.

Children are a different case, not simply because they cannot give informed consent but also because their brains are more susceptible to long-term damage. Researchers at the University of Illinois found that children who had sustained a single sports-related concussion still had impaired brain function two years later.

Some measures to protect children from harm are already in place. Some states in America have introduced rules for American football to restrict full-contact sessions in high schools: incidents of concussion have fallen as a result. Although the risks of brain injury in association football are lower, US Soccer, the governing body for the sport in America, has banned headers for children aged ten and under, and restricted them for 11- to 13-year-olds.

More should be done. No child should be obliged to play full-contact American football, rugby or ice hockey in schools. And for those who do take to the field or rink, schools should do more to reduce the risksfrom recording and monitoring injuries systematically and requiring that children train with players their own size rather than their age, to insisting on non-contact forms of play. Rugby has most to do, particularly given plans to raise the number of child players. This week doctors and academics rightly called for a ban on tackling in rugby games played in British and Irish schools.

Not tackling it head-on

None of this is popular. Critics contend that all sports are dangerous. They argue for the benefits of exercise and say that the nanny state is out of control. But other sports do not involve deliberate impact and are just as energetic. And ensuring the safety of children hardly counts as excessive intervention.

Critics raise another, cultural, objection: that the spirit of games like rugby and American football is in danger of being lost. There is something to that. But an activity that rests on exposing children to long-term neurological damage needs a better defence.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,The Economist,[],"OUT in the farthest reaches of Lagos, a bumpy boat ride across the citys dividing lagoon, Egbin power plant is trying to light up one of the worlds darkest nations. Six turbines growl in its huge belly, watched over by mechanics in a futuristic control room. They say the place is barely recognisable since privatisation in 2013. Output has rocketed since Sahara Group, a Nigerian energy conglomerate, took over. When running at full steam, Egbin generates almost a quarter of the whole countrys electricity.

That is not a particularly stretching target. Of Nigerias many daily headaches, power is perhaps the worst. After years in which state-owned power plants decayed, the government changed course by selling power stations and the distribution grids that carry power to homes and businesses. This bold stroke was meant to turn the lights on, and indeed it has encouraged investors to put millions of dollars into upgrading the battered system. Yet the supply of power has failed to respond as hoped in the two years since privatisation. At the moment the countrys big stations produce a pitiful 2,800MW, which is about as much as is used by Edinburgh. Only just over half of Nigerians have access to electricity, and it is still harder for businesses to hook up to the grid than almost anywhere else.

One reason why privatisation has failed to improve Nigerias power supply is that the process itself was flawed from the start. Even as companies were bidding to buy power stations or distribution companies, striking staff prevented them from looking at what they were buying. Once the deals were done they found they had bought rundown equipment and companies whose books had been systematically cooked. More important, though, was that many could not get the gas they needed to power their plants. Government meddling held down gas prices, which meant that many producers would simply flare it off (while extracting oil) instead of bothering to sell it at a deep loss. Moreover, the pipes meant to carry the flammable stuff are rusting and regularly vandalised by thugs demanding money to protect them.

The privatisation process was also incomplete and left the transmission grid (which carries electricity from power stations to the local distribution grids) in the hands of the state. It has not invested much, so huge amounts of power fizzle out on its dilapidated lines. Even if power plants could generate more electricity, the grid would not be able to handle it. At Egbin a handful of people employed by the state-owned transmission network sit watching YouTube clips as their private-sector colleagues beaver away.

Power plants are also owed colossal sums by the agencies that act as middlemen between generation companies and the distributors. Egbin alone is some $225m out of pocket. The intermediaries, in turn, blame distributors, saying they have not been collecting cash from their customers. As for the distributors, they say that the tariffs they are allowed to charge are too low to cover their costs and that, in any case, Nigerians do not pay their bills. Depressingly, the biggest offender is the government, whose various departments and agencies owe almost $300m. Its difficult for anyone to go to a military barracks and order them to payexcept if youve written your will, says one insider.

More than a year ago the Central Bank of Nigeria organised a $1 billion loan to plug the gap and avoid a wave of insolvencies among power generators, but only a fraction has been disbursed. Since then a falling currency and shortages of foreign exchange have made it harder for private power producers to service debts denominated in dollars, a currency many chose because it offered lower interest rates than borrowing in naira. Finding cash (and hard currency in particular) to buy gas, maintain machinery and pay technical partners is a growing strain. Dallas Peavey, Egbins chief executive, reckons that without repayment or preferential access to foreign currency he can keep the countrys biggest power station running for just another four weeks.

Still, there are glimmers of hope. In recent years the government has raised the price of gas, and supplies are growing more reliable. Distribution companies are installing new meters, which are harder to fiddle. Unpaid public electricity bills are being chased up. Most crucially, tariffs were increased in February by as much as 45%. It did not go down at all well with locals. But if Nigerians can be convinced to pay their bills, it ought to get some cash flowing through the system. That would be a start.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,"In, out, find a fib to shout",[],"WHAT I want is facts...facts alone are wanted in life. Thomas Gradgrinds grim message in Charles Dickenss Hard Times is echoed in the debate ahead of the referendum on June 23rd about whether Britain should leave the European Union. Voters confused by claims made by opposing sides and in the media are asking for plain facts on Britains EU membership so they can make up their minds. Sadly, hard facts are hard to find.

There is a good reason for this: nobody knows what would happen post-Brexit. That is especially true of the trade deal that Britain would have to negotiate with the EUand how long that might take (the government this week suggested up to ten years). But there is also a bad reason: that the uncertainty lets all sides distort, exaggerate or simply make up their own facts.

In graphics: A guide to Brexit from the European Union

Three examples illustrate this. The first is an old assertion that 3m jobs in Britain depend on trade with the EU. In fact, because of the close links among European economies, many economists reckon the true figure is higher. Yet the claim sometimes made by pro-EU voices that all these jobs would be at risk post-Brexit is a nonsense. Nobody can plausibly argue that all trade with the EU would cease. Anyway, job creation depends more on demand, wage levels and labour laws than on membership of a trade block.

The second example concerns the British contribution to the EU budget. Leavers claim that Britain pays an unfairly large amount of almost 20 billion ($28 billion) a year to Brussels, or 55m a day. In fact this is the gross amount before deducting both the rebate won by Margaret Thatcher in 1984 and the money the EU spends in Britain. Adjusting for these, and for the funnelling of some foreign-aid spending via Brussels, the net payment is less than one-third as big, at 17m a dayand Britain is only the eighth-largest contributor per head.

The third example is competing claims about trade patterns. Remain campaigners say the EU takes 45-50% of British exports, whereas Britain accounts for a tenth or less of the EUs. Yet Nigel Farage, leader of the anti-EU UK Independence Party, has said Britain takes 20% of EU exports, giving it a stronger hand in future trade talks.

One issue here is which source to use: Europes statistical office, the British government and the IMF all have different figures. Another is whether to cover just goods or to add services. But the biggest question is whether to count the EU as a block, discounting all intra-EU exports. Doing that puts the share of EU exports going to Britain at almost 16%. But John Springford of the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank, points out that, in trade negotiations, individual countries, not the EU as a whole, decide what to accept. Britains share of all other EU countries exports is only around 8%, he says (our chart, using IMF figures, puts it even lower), and in many individual cases a lot less, leaving it in a weaker bargaining position.

The arguments over facts in these areas are as nothing compared with the differences on migration and sovereigntynor compared with the bitter rows within the Tory party (see article). What should undecided or poorly informed voters do?

Fortunately, there are some good sources they can turn to. Two websites, the broadly neutral fullfact.org and the pro-EU infacts.org, both puncture myths in the debate. The House of Commons library produces excellent reports, which are available online. And a group of academics led by Anand Menon of Kings College, London, have set up The UK in a Changing Europe, financed by the Economic and Social Research Council, which has a lively website.

The Economist is not neutral in this debate: we believe Brexit would be bad for Britain, Europe and the world. But we also want to explain the issues and present the facts. So over the next four months, we will publish a series of Brexit briefs that seek to do this, as dispassionately as possiblein the hope of satisfying even the Gradgrinds among our readers.",[]

economist.com,,Lavish funding for superstar British business professors has not improved their work,[],"Mar 7th 2016, 16:48 by C.S-W.

STUDENTS may pay business-school professors salaries, but it is research that wins faculty its reputation. Unfortunately for Britain, the standard of research coming out of its business schools has been lacking. Though business school attendance grew there in the 1990s, its representation in academic journals, and its ability to win funding from research councils, lagged behind. So in 2002, the Advanced Institute of Management Research (AIM) was launched with the goal of redressing the substandard work academics were producing. The best part of 30m ($43m) was spent in an attempt to bolster the quality of research by directly funding superstar academics, rather than their research. That project ended in 2012, so what impact did that all that money have?

Not much, according to a paper soon to be published by Stuart Macdonald of the University of Leicester and two colleagues in the British Journal of Management. The passing of AIM has been little mourned, reckon the authors. The vast majority of management academics in the UK had little chance of joining AIM and gained little from it, they go on.

Their paper is not the only work that aimed to measure AIMs effectiveness. An evaluation report was carried out in 2013 by Technopolis, a policy advisory firm, for the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), the largest publicly-funded research council in Britain. But that evaluation (to which many people, Mr Macdonald included, contributed) has not been released publicly, save for a five-page executive summary. That described AIM as a qualified, though not outright, success.

However, The Economist obtained the full 116-page report from the ESRC under a Freedom of Information request. If the truncated report meant for public consumption managed to sound upbeat, the private one, for the ESRC's eyes only, was more candid. (The ESRC declined requests to comment.) It found AIMs focus too narrow. In a survey carried out by Technopolis, one-in-five AIM fellows funded by the scheme said they had not improved their research skills at all by the end of their fellowship. And while the scheme was meant to improve the lot of management researchers bidding for cash from the ESRC, the report found that either the quality of management and business research proposals has not improved or the perception of quality amongst the ESRC community has not changed as a result. In fact, the success rate for ESRC applications was lower when the post-mortem report was compiled than it was before AIM was launched.

Industry contacts were meant to benefit from AIM, too. In reality, though, as many respondents to Technopoliss survey (46%) said they had changed the practices of their management as said they had not.

The issue was a simple one, believes Mr Macdonald: AIM overreached. The AIM concept was exciting, he explains, but if youre doing something adventurous youve got to have a care for the implications of it. Rather than breaking down staid research practices AIM rewarded them. A scheme set up to tackle poor research was soon rebranded by the professors it funded as a programme to reward excellence.

That excellence did not exist. Management research in Britain was in a woeful state before AIM was founded in 2002that much everyone can agree on. Whether AIMflush with funding for flashy academicsmanaged to tackle its stagnancy, or ended up being captured by it, is another question altogether.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,Politics this week,[],"Super Tuesday in America saw a dozen state primary elections in the presidential nominating process. Hillary Clinton reinforced her position as the front-runner in the Democratic race, winning Texas, Georgia, Virginia and Massachusetts. Bernie Sanders took Colorado, Minnesota and two other states, but he remains far behind Mrs Clinton in the delegate count. Donald Trump lengthened his lead in the Republican contest by winning most states on offer. Ted Cruz won his home state of Texas and Marco Rubio chalked up his first win, in Minnesota. But it looks increasingly unlikely that the party establishment will be able to trip Mr Trump. See here, here and here.

David Duke, a former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, backed Mr Trump for president. Never normally lost for words, Mr Trump stopped short of denouncing Mr Duke in a TV interview, prompting another volley of criticisms from Republicans and Democrats. Mr Trump deflected these by saying he hadnt understood the question. See article.

Clarence Thomas, a Supreme Court justice, broke his decade-long silence on the bench (thought to be a record) and asked questions in a case on gun rights. The audience gasped. Many theories have been proffered for his failure to speak, but the death last month of the loquacious Antonin Scalia, a close ally, may have left Justice Thomas thinking that the time has come for him to stick up for strict constructionism.

More than a slap on the wrist

The UN Security Council adopted tougher-than-expected sanctions on North Korea following its nuclear test and rocket launch earlier this year. They include mandatory inspections of all shipments to the country, a ban on sales of aviation fuel and a halt to exports from the North of iron and coal. But China will need to be the chief enforcer of the sanctions if they are to work. See article.

Chinese internet companies shut down the microblogs of Ren Zhiqiang, a property tycoon. He had used an account with 38m followers to criticise President Xi Jinpings efforts to tighten Communist Party control over the media. Chinas internet regulator accused Mr Ren of publishing illegal messages.

A court in the coastal Chinese province of Zhejiang sentenced a Christian pastor, Bao Guohua, to 14 years in prison for corruption and inciting people to disturb social order. His wife was jailed for 12 years. Mr Baos refusal to remove a cross from his churchs roof had angered the authorities. A Christian lawyer who had supported churches that erect illegal crosses was shown on local TV apparently confessing to having colluded with foreigners to stir up trouble.

Help is on the way

The European Union announced that it will provide 700m ($760m) in aid to accommodate migrants in countries overwhelmed by the refugee crisis. Most of the money is expected to go to Greece. Angela Merkel, Germanys chancellor, scolded Austria and other countries for clamping down on refugee arrivals, and vowed not to abandon Greece.

The leader of Spains Socialist Party, Pedro Sanchez, failed in his first attempt to form a minority government with the upstart centrist Ciudadanos party. Both the centre-right Popular Party and the far-left Podemos party voted against the proposed coalition in parliament. If Mr Sanchez fails again in a second vote planned for March 4th, the caretaker government will probably call new elections.

Irelands governing coalition of the Fine Gael and Labour parties suffered a stinging electoral defeat, dropping from a combined 113 seats to 57. The opposition Fianna Fail party, which came second with 44 seats, vowed not to join a coalition with Fine Gael, leaving no clear direction for forming a new government. See article.

The EU and America revealed details of their proposed deal for companies to share digital information, which replaces the Safe Harbour agreement that was thrown out by Europes courts. Officials said the deal contains measures to protect stricter European privacy guarantees.

Better than nothing

Argentina reached an agreement in principle to pay four of the largest creditors whose refusal to accept earlier debt-restructuring offers precipitated a default by the country in 2014. Argentina is to pay Elliott Management, a hedge fund, and three other holdouts $4.7 billion, 25% less than they are claiming. If the deal goes through, Argentina will be able to resume borrowing on international credit markets. See article.

Police in Colombia arrested Santiago Uribe, the brother of Alvaro Uribe, a former president, for allegedly leading a paramilitary group suspected of murdering criminals and anti-government guerrillas in the 1990s. Santiago Uribe denies the charges; his supporters say his arrest is motivated by politics. Alvaro Uribe, who is now a senator, opposes the governments plan to end the conflict with the FARC rebels.

The Jamaica Labour Party won the countrys election, defeating the governing Peoples National Party. Andrew Holness, Jamaicas new prime minister, campaigned against the PNP governments austerity programme and promised to exempt from income tax 72% of the Jamaicans who pay it.

economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,Fresh from the Amazon,[],"BRITAINS big supermarkets have had a dismal few years. Aldi and Lidl, two upstart German-owned discounters, have taken huge bites out of their market share, margins have been squeezed and record losses have mounted.

One refuge, however, was in online shopping, which Aldi and Lidl have been reluctant to embrace, despite the fact that British consumers are Europes most enthusiastic e-shoppers. Online grocery sales have been growing strongly, and the likes of Tesco, the biggest supermarket, and Sainsburys, have taken full advantage. Tesco, which runs a Click+Collect service, has about 40% of the online market.

Now, however, that refuge is looking less safe. On February 29th Amazon, an American online retailer, announced that it will start selling fresh food and groceries as well, in a tie-up with the fourth-largest British supermarket, Morrisons. Thus Amazon, with deep pockets and a wealth of experience offering food online in American cities, will now go head-to-head with Tesco and others. The move had been expected, but that will be of no comfort to its new rivals. Shares in Tesco and Sainsburys were down on the news, while shares in Ocado, an online-only grocer, plummeted by about 10%.

Shares in Morrisons rose. It has suffered more than most at the hands of Lidl and Aldi, selling, as it does, to the same customers in the same areas of the country. Yet the deal with Amazon gives it a straightforward new sales channel into the online market. Morrisons also makes its own food products, and under the new agreement it will supply fresh and frozen foods to Amazon to sell on its Prime Now and Pantry services. Until now, the Pantry service had offered only household goods such as cleaning products, drinks and pet food.

Morrisons has an existing arrangement to sell its groceries to Ocado, and there are fears that the Amazon deal could undermine that. But Ocado hopes that the intervention of the American giant will just increase the market instead. For Amazon, this is probably just the beginning of its journey into Britains grocery market, which is worth about 180 billion ($254 billion) a year.

It is a real race now, says Ray Gaul, an analyst at Kantar Retail, of the online market. And to add to the competitive pressures, the Amazon move comes only a month after Aldi launched its first British online-shopping service. This is, for the moment, limited to wine, offering hefty discounts on boxes of six, but there will undoubtedly be more to come. The north of England used to be the bastion of Aldi and Lidl, but Aldi is now advertising this service heavily in London, Tescos and Sainsburys backyard. The two discounters also have ambitious plans to open many more shops in the capital.

The new competition should be good for online shoppers, but less so, perhaps, for the 3m or so people who work in retailing. The same day as the Amazon announcement, the British Retail Consortium, a trade body, published a report predicting that 900,000 jobs could be lost in the industry by 2025. The authors blame this partly on the cost of the new national living wage and apprenticeship levies, but also the rise in online shopping and the increasing costs of running shops on the high street. Avocados and cheese twists straight to the door wont be helping everyone.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,African horizons,[],"IN OCTOBER 2010 a wealthy South African, bidding at Bonhams in London, bought a portrait of a doe-eyed Indian girl from the island of Zanzibar that had been painted in 1945. The artist was Irma Stern, who was born in the Transvaal, the daughter of German-Jewish emigres. Sentimental in style, it was not a fashionable work of art. Nevertheless, the bidder paid a record 2.37m ($3.3m) for the picture, more than twice the top estimate. Much has changed since that moment, when homesick white South Africans, grown rich on rising commodity prices, would spend millions on the work of artists who reminded them of their parents and grandparents and the white world they grew up in. Half a decade on, the global art world has discovered a quite different Africaand in a big way.

In the course of the 20th century African tribal art was praised by many outsiders, including Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, who absorbed what they saw as its primitive imagery into their own work. But few collectors on the continent or beyond were interested in Africas contemporary art, still less in its artists. One exception was Jean Pigozzi, heir to the Simca motoring fortune, who, starting in the 1980s, amassed a huge collection of contemporary African art, though never by going to the continent himself; instead, he sent a curator with cash, canvasses and paint for encouragement.

Since then other collectors, both on the continent and beyond, have begun buying. First among them is Sindika Dokolo, a Congolese businessman who is married to Africas wealthiest woman, Isabel dos Santos, daughter of Angolas president. Mr Dokolo owns more than 5,000 pieces of mostly contemporary art, and his foundation plans to build an exhibition space and, later, a museum in Portugal.

In recent years galleries have been popping up all over the continent. Regional events like DakArt Biennale and LagosPhoto Festival are growing bigger. Last year the Venice Biennale appointed its first artistic director from Africa, Okwui Enwezor, a Nigerian curator who lives in New York and Munich. In the latest development, on March 3rd the historic Armory Show (on Piers 92 and 94) in New York unveiled its first show focusing on Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2017 Jochen Zeitz, a German art collector and conservationist, plans to open Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art in Cape Town to show his art from Africa and the African diaspora.

Four of the most prominent contemporary artists of African origin move with ease between Africa and the rest of the world. Julie Mehretu was born in Ethiopia and lives in New York, as does Kenyan-born Wangechi Mutu; El Anatsui (whose beer-bottle-top fabricspicturedare instantly recognisable) was born in Ghana, has worked for much of his career in Nigeria, and has been exhibited all over the world, as has William Kentridge, a white South African. Only the work of Ms Mutu and Mr Kentridge can be said to deal with the African experience directly, though both also address larger themes. Ms Mutu does so through an Afrofuturist exploration of gender and identity. Mr Kentridge is concerned with South African politics.

The art world zeros in on a new region for two reasons. The first is that young people in fast-growing economies often begin buying art, as well as luxury goods, when they start becoming rich. The second is that local collectors favour local artists, and these are often undervalued. Buying and representing these artists is attractive to international dealers and collectors because, if a home-grown collecting culture does emerge, then prices for art from that region can only go up.

Africas recent economic growth is a factor in its expanding art market. In the past decade the GDP of the 11 largest sub-Saharan countries has increased by roughly half, twice the rate in the rest of the world. We have ten times as many collectors from South Africa as we did ten years ago, says Joost Bosland, director of the Stevenson Gallery, which has showrooms in Cape Town and Johannesburg. The leader among the international auction houses, Bonhams, has seen average lot prices for African art increase fivefold, to $50,000, since it decided to hold stand-alone sales of African artists. Half its bidders now originate from within the continent. Bonhams has been so successful that both Sothebys and Phillips are thinking of copying their African sales.

Only eight of the 14 artists featured in the special exhibition at the Armory, African Perspectives, are from galleries in Africa. The rest are based in Paris, London, Berlin and Seattle. To Julia Grosse and Yvette Mutumba, the curators of African Perspectives, this was a more accurate way of reflecting the world that many contemporary African artists now inhabit. How to classify someone who is born in Lagos, splits their time between there and Brussels, and does residencies in Hong Kong and New York? Everyone lives more globally now; artists are no exception. Another element is that growing interest in colonialism, slavery and the diaspora has expanded the story of Africa into the story of the world.

Art with African or African-American origins is quickly gaining wider audiences across America. There are now museums of the African diaspora in both San Francisco and New York. In 2014 Harvard University opened the Ethelbert Cooper Gallery of African & African-American Art and the long delayed Africa Centre is being built just north of Museum Mile in New York, at Fifth Avenue and 110th Street. Barack Obama, Americas first president with an African father, will step down in 2017, but global interest in Africas artists is certainly not about to disappear.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,A gambler on shale,[],"IT WAS a tragic end to a life that epitomised the winner-takes-all spirit of American capitalism. On March 2nd, the day after he was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of rigging bids for oil-drilling rights, Aubrey McClendon, a founder of Chesapeake Energy and one of the pioneers of Americas natural-gas revolution, died after driving his car at high speed into a wall.

Mr McClendon, 56, was one of the high-rollers of the shale boomand of its bust. He turned a $50,000 investment in 1989 in Chesapeake, based in Oklahoma City, into what became one of the two biggest natural-gas producers in the United States, with an acreage of leaseholds almost the size of West Virginia. He was also one of the champions of natural gas as a relatively clean fuel compared with coal, and an advocate for freeing America from dependence on Middle Eastern oil. To hell with OPEC, he was fond of saying.

Yet his ride was a white-knuckled one even by the standards of Americas oil industry. He quickly seized on the potential of two emerging technologies, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (fracking), to unlock vast new sources of natural gas and change the face of American energy. But it was his zeal in amassing land by borrowing heavily that gave him his edgeand ultimately brought him down.

To be able to borrow money for ten years and ride out boom-and-bust cycles was almost as important an insight as horizontal drilling, he was quoted as saying in Rolling Stone magazine, in 2012. That was four years after he had lost most of his personal fortune on margin calls during the global financial crisis. A year later he was ousted from Chesapeake for mixing reckless personal bets with those of his publicly traded company.

Mr McClendon, the great-nephew of a former Oklahoma governor, was not a typical wildcatter. He had preppy, Richard Gere looks. His first career choice was to be an accountant. But with Chesapeakes other founder, Tom Ward, he was adept at leasing land quickly and quietly to secure the shale resources beneath before others realised their potential, and he was as keen to flip it for a higher price as he was to frack it.

Geologists and engineers were the important guysbut it dawned on me pretty early that all their fancy ideas arent worth very much if we dont have a lease. If youve got the lease and I dont, you win, he once said.

He became an Oklahoman hero, particularly after bringing a professional basketball team, the Oklahoma City Thunder, in from Seattle. He had a wife and three children, and regularly treated friends to his collection of fine wines. But his brash business tactics also brought him a number of lawsuits.

His leasing methods eventually attracted the attention of Americas Department of Justice. On March 1st it accused him and an unnamed co-conspirator of lowering the price of leases to drill for oil and gas on land in Oklahoma between December 2007 and March 2012, charges which carry stiff jail penalties if they lead to a conviction. It said various corporations and individuals were not charged but were also involved. Chesapeake said it did not expect to face prosecution.

Mr McClendon swiftly described the charge as wrong and unprecedented, saying he was the first person in the oil-and-gas industry in 110 years to face antitrust prosecution under the Sherman Act for joint bidding on leaseholds. His lawyers argued that the business practices in question were well-known in the Oklahoman and American energy industries. Starting today, Aubrey gets his day in court, they said. He died the next morning. As The Economist went to press, police in Oklahoma City were still unable to say whether the crash, in which he was the only victim, and which involved no other vehicle, was intentional or not.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,The great British sell-off,[],"I CANT imagine it not being there, says Kathy Daly, a resident of north London for 64 years, reflecting the feelings of many living around Holloway prison. This summer, the largest womens prison in western Europe, first built in 1852, will close, to make way for new homes.

The move is part of a bigger drive to sell off government assets. In its spending review in November, the government encouraged departments to find land and property to vacate and sell, with the aim of raising around 5 billion ($7 billion) up to 2020. Financial and corporate assets are also being flogged to the private sector: this financial year the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the governments independent forecaster, thinks the Treasury will raise 30 billion from selling assets like shares in Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotlandwhich were bought during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009and Royal Mail, with an extra 47 billion expected over the next five years. These asset sales will provide cash that George Osborne, the chancellor, can use to pay down public debt, which swelled from 37% of GDP in 2007 to 83% this year.

Selling off state assets can benefit society, if private owners can whip them into better shape. The decision also rests on the difference between the returns to the asset and the governments own borrowing costs; there is less urgency in paying down public debt while interest rates are so low. Any big improvement in the public finances will usually be largely illusory; debt might drop, but selling will swap a future flow of income for up-front cash. The government balance-sheet will be restructured, not necessarily improved.

In November the government boasted that the land released by departments could free up space for 161,000 new homes, spurring economic growth. The proceeds from selling older prisons will be ploughed back into building nine shiny new ones, which the government hopes will save 80m in running costs each year. The newer prisons will be in cheaper locations; some women in Holloway prison will be relocated to a prison in Sutton, a south-western suburb, where a two-bedroom flat costs 300,000, compared with 600,000 in Holloway. But rows are already brewing; sometimes public services add extra social value by being located in prime spots; some worry about moving prisoners far from their families. And there are questions over how many affordable homes will be built on the Holloway site. Ms Daly is not keen on the idea of luxury flats beyond the means of local residents.

Language used by senior members of the government indicates that there might be more to gain than just a leaner state. In a leaked letter to the county council in his local constituency, the prime minister, David Cameron, complained that local services were being cut without considering savings that could be made in the form of asset sales. In his leaked response, the council leader echoed the words of economists before and since, that capital income cannot be used to support revenue costsit is neither legal, nor sustainable, in the long term since they are one-off receipts.

Although some dispute whether the government is right to be selling its land, few would argue for holding on to the bank shares for ever. Buying the assets was meant to preserve financial stability, but now things are calmer the case for owning them has weakened. The government is keen to get the most from the sales. After market turmoil, on January 28th Mr Osborne announced that he would delay the sale of a tranche of Lloyds shares.

Cynics suspect that the chancellor is interested in more than maximising value. One of his fiscal targets is to have debt falling as a share of GDP in every year after 201516, but in December the OBR pointed out that this year he would only achieve this because of planned asset sales. And it also pointed out that offering some of the shares at a discount (not to mention giving away some shares in Royal Mail) actually worsens the public finances.

In some cases the struggle to achieve good value for money has prevented a quick sale. The government announced its plans to sell the student-loan book back in 2013. Currently the OBR predicts that investors would give the government around 12 billion in exchange for student-loan repayments, worth around 1.5 billion each year by 202021. It is unclear how much extra value could be squeezed from the asset by a private buyer, though a spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said unfavourable market conditions were the main reason for the delay.

One worry is that the government will get a poor deal as it unloads treasures onto the private sector. An internal government evaluation of its stake in Eurostar priced it at 305m, and then saw it sold for nearly double that. The Treasury has since set up bodies to manage such sales.

On February 26th Mr Osborne warned of looming storm clouds hurting economic growth and requiring bigger cuts to spending. The government owns 1.3 trillion of assetsthe Ministry of Defence alone owns roughly 1% of all land in Britainso speeding up the sell-off might look tempting. But a fire sale would burn a hole in the public finances, not fix them.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-03 15:39:18,Mother of consensus,[],"TODAY ICANN is almost synonymous with internet governance (see article). But spare a thought for the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Without this little-known outfit, which developed many of the internets technical standards, the network would not even exist. The IETF just celebrated its 30th anniversary. Will it be around in another 30 years?

The IETF, which was born at a meeting in San Diego, is known for its pragmatic way of making decisions. Rather than having governments or companies haggle over changes to networking protocols or routing services, rough consensus and running code is the rule. Not everyone has to agree. And no votes are counted, explains Scott Bradner, one the groups grey-bearded elders (pictured). If the difference between two options is merely cosmetic, the IETF generally goes ahead with the more popular one if dissenters do not number more than about 20-30% of the total, although there is no firm rule. That proportion shrinks to 5-10% when a more fundamental choice must be made.

In this section We the networks

Mother of consensus

At first IETF meetings were a festival for academics and engineers such as Mr Bradner. But as the internet has grown and become vital to companies fortunes, that has changed. First, representatives of big makers of networking gear such as Cisco and Ericsson began to turn up. They were followed by delegates from online giants like Facebook and Google. Now a large Asian contingent is present. When the IETF met in Yokohama last November, Cisco sent around 100 engineers, Google 50 and Huawei, a Chinese hardware maker, about 60.

Jari Arkko, the IETFs chairman (who also works for Ericsson) wants it to remain the place where exciting new technologies are discussed. But it seems to be turning into more of a conventional standards body. Commercial interests weigh heavily and issues take ever longer to sort out, says Kieren McCarthy, a longtime observer of internet-governance groups. Increasingly, internet standards are being set by more specialised groups covering the web, mobile technology and the internet of things.

The pioneers are retiring: Mr Bradner will say goodbye in the next few months. But even if the organisation becomes less relevant, its decision-making standard of rough consensus and running code is likely to endure. Most internet-related technical groups follow it. The IETFs dress code is influential, too. Many newcomers are often embarrassed when they show up Monday morning in suits, the official Tao of IETF warns, to discover that everybody else is wearing T-shirts, jeans and sandals.",[]

economist.com,2015-10-03 00:00:00,Upwardly mobile,[],"WHEN the bottom finally fell out of Americas housing market in 2006, it triggered the worst global recession since the 1930s. But rising house prices need not spell disaster. The Economists latest round-up of house prices across the globe shows that prices have risen over the past year in 21 of the 26 economies we track, at a median pace of 4.7% (see table). Not every rise is alike, however.

America is stilljustin the category of countries where the housing market remains in recovery. House prices there increased by 4.7% in the 12 months to July, according to the Case-Shiller national index. Prices have now risen by 25% from their 2011 trough, but still remain 7% from their 2007 peak. The Economist measures national affordability by comparing prices to the long-run average of their relationship with rents and income. On this basis, we reckon house prices in America are broadly at their fair value.

Not for long, perhaps. Activity is buoyant: sales of existing homes increased by 6.2% on the previous year. With 30-year fixed-rate mortgages at record lows, the effect of an interest-rate rise on the housing market is expected to be minimal.

What is more, construction is lagging. The National Association of Realtors, a trade body, has found that new house-building is failing to keep pace with job creation in many cities. For every 12 jobs created builders have historically gained construction permits for ten new homes. Between 2012 and 2014 that number fell to 4.8 permits. Some cities are sizzling again as a result: prices in San Francisco increased by 10% in the year to July, and are up by 75% since 2009.

Other countries housing markets are already well above fair value. Taking an average of our two measures, houses are more than 30% overvalued in six markets. Britain is perhaps the most supply-constrained of this group. Although prices have risen by 35% since their trough in January 2009, housebuilding is failing to respond. Just 140,000 homes were completed in the year to March 2014, some 25% below the long-term norm. That puts a firmer floor under prices than in other notably overvalued markets such as Canada and Australia.

Hong Kong is the most extreme example of soaring prices and limited supply. Property prices in the territory appreciated by 21% in the year to June, and have now doubled in five years. Since 2009 the regulator has introduced seven rounds of macroprudential measures designed to cork the rises. Its latest, in March this year, reduced the average loan-to-value ratio for new mortgages from 64% to just 52%. In practice, Chinas recent stockmarket crash is likely to be a bigger dampener on demand, as wounded mainland investors put off new purchases.

As for Chinas own housing market, it is one of only five in our index where prices are falling, joining Singapore and a trio of euro-zone countriesFrance, Greece and Italy. Prices are falling at a slower rate than before, however. The government has been trying to boost the market over the past ten months, cutting interest rates by 1.4 percentage points and relaxing rules on downpayments. Prices are now rising on a monthly basis in many cities. In Beijing and Shanghai, they look positively frothy again.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-09 11:58:01,Pilot light: America is running out of people to fly its planes,[],"REPUBLIC AIRWAYS recently filed for bankruptcy, and hardly anyone noticed. Thats because hardly anyone has heard of Republic Airways. But many people unwittingly fly on it all the time. Republic operates flights for Delta Connection, United Express, and American Eaglethe big airlines affiliates for shorter and less popular routes. As many as half of all Delta-, United- and American-branded flights are actually outsourced to so-called regional airlines like Republic. If youve spent any time flying around the United States, you have probably flown with Republic or one of its equally obscure rivals.

The underlying problem behind Republics demise could soon affect other, more famous names. The carriers boss cited several reasons for the bankruptcy filing, but chief among them was the grounding aircraft due to a lack of pilot resources. Republic isnt alone in struggling to find people to fly its planes. In October, another regional provider, Seaport Airlines, cut most of the routes it flies from its Memphis hub, due to a pilot shortage. SkyWest, which also operates flights for Delta, United and American, reduced its flight capacity last year as its president admitted the airline was not immune to pilot shortages.

Those outside the industry might be surprised by this. A common assumption is that piloting aircraftwith its high salaries, perks and glamourmust be one of the most competitive professions there is. So what is going on? Aerospace types point to regulations enacted by Congress in 2013 that upped the minimum number of hours of cockpit experience a pilot must have in order to fly for a commercial airline, from 250 to 1,500. (Most commercial pilots used to come from the military, but they now come largely from aviation schools, where enrolment has dropped significantly in the past decade and a half.) That much training takes not only time, but also money. And while salaries at the big commercial airlines are competitive, at the regionals new recruits can earn as little as $20,000. Consolidation among the big carriers has given them more negotiating power over their regional partners, making it harder for these smaller operators to raise wages.

A low-salary, high-barrier-to-entry job is hardly an attractive prospect for people thinking about starting a career in aviationand with regionals operating nearly half the countrys flights, some flyers working lives begin and end at these lowly carriers. For many young pilots, signing up for a foreign airline can mean a higher salary and lower requirements.

Forbes explains why this is not a short-term deficit, but a structural issue that will affect airlines for a long time to come:

Heres some hard reality thats now firmly in place. There is no pilot shortagethat term implies a situation where there is the possibility of correction. It isnt correctablethe new regulatory barriers to entry to the pilot profession are effectively permanent. And that means that the availability of this resource will be different than in the pastread: a lot less. Result: less flying of smaller airliners. Less service at smaller local airports.

For now, the effects are mostly being felt on routes involving smaller planes and airports. But with the pipeline to the top pilot jobs shrinking, it is likely the major carriers will start to feel the effects. According to one analysis, in the next 20 years the supply of people to fly America's planes will meet just two-thirds of the demand. That could force the big operators to slash routes.

Congress is unlikely to reverse its 1,500-hour requirement, for fear of being accused of prioritising airline profits over passenger safety. But the Regional Airline Association is trying to boost its recruitment efforts by pitching aviation careers to high school and college students. With luck, the wisdom of the markets should prevail: fewer candidates means salaries will eventually have to rise, and more people will enter the field. Until that happens, regional airlines will continue to feel the pinchand travellers who heretofore had never heard of the regionals will, too.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,Emission impossible,[],"VOLKSWAGENS new boss, Matthias Muller, was no doubt hoping that his firms launches of new models at the Geneva motor show this week would help it move on from the scandal over its cheating in emissions tests. A British prankster had other ideas. As VWs sales chief, Jurgen Stackmann, unveiled a new version of the Up city car, Simon Brodkin, a comic whose past targets include FIFAs former boss, Sepp Blatter, gatecrashed the presentation in overalls, with a spanner and a cheat box which he tried to fit to the car (see picture), before being led off by security men.

Mr Muller can afford to see the funny side of the stunt: he owes his job to the scandal. He was brought in to replace Martin Winterkorn, who was forced out when it emerged last September that 11m of the companys diesel cars had been fitted with software to cheat tests for nitrogen-oxide emissions. This week VW admitted that Mr Winterkorn had been sent a memo in May 2014 about irregularities in the cars emissions, but said he may not have read it. Speaking to The Economist in Geneva, Mr Muller promised monumental change. But whatever VW does to make amends, the more far-reaching overhaul that it needs seems unlikely to happen.

The emissions scandal was a symptom of a corporate culture focused on ramping up output to 10m vehicles a year and toppling Toyota as the worlds biggest carmaker. In the quest for scale, profitability suffered. Operating profits have hovered around 12 billion ($13 billion) for years despite a big expansion in output, with the groups huge returns from China disguising poor performance in Europe and losses in America and emerging markets.

Mr Muller says he is determined that VW not be paralysed by the emissions affair. Its sales fell in Europe and America in January even as their overall demand for new cars rose. But Mr Muller says 2016 has started well and that he expects little lingering impact from the scandal. He may be right. General Motors faulty ignition switches and Toyotas unintended accelerations forced both firms to make huge recalls and generated plenty of bad press. Yet sales recovered within a few months.

Uncertainty about financial penalties will hang over VW for some time. It has delayed its annual report for 2015 until April, when the picture should be clearer. Americas Department of Justice could in theory levy a fine of 60 billion but it is unlikely to go that far. Some analysts reckon that the cost of settling with the authorities and private litigants, worldwide, and fixing the affected cars or compensating their owners, might come to a grand total of as much as 30 billionroughly the amount by which VWs stockmarket value has fallen since the scandal broke. Others think it could be far less: both GM and Toyota escaped with fines of around 1 billion.

If paying for its perfidy proves painful but not life-threatening, the impetus to overhaul VW will lose some of its force. Change is needed. VW is a sprawl of brands of varying fortunes. Almost two-thirds of its profits come from its premium-car brand, Audi, and performance-car division, Porsche (see chart 1). The main VW brand is a drag on the group: Sanford C. Bernstein, a research firm, reckons that in 2014 the brands profits essentially came from parts sales and royalties (paid by its joint ventures) in China, and that it made no money in its core European market.

Mr Muller is making a start by attempting to revamp the culture of a company in which hitherto a strict hierarchy sent decisions, big and small, to the German engineers that ran VW from its headquarters in Wolfsburg. Mr Muller has replaced seven out of ten senior executives. Some are outsiders, though many of the new faces are, like Mr Muller, VW insiders ingrained in the firms ways. He is, however, trying to speed up sclerotic decision-making by giving the heads of the groups profusion of brands more responsibility.

A comprehensive restructuring plan is promised for later in the year, but the firm has said it will concentrate harder on profits. As a start, it will make 1 billion of cost cuts at the VW brand next year. But analysts reckon the company, which alone among big carmakers failed to reduce costs during the financial crisis, has plenty more fat to cut. For no good reason, its administrative expenses have trebled since 2007.

The firm will also cut the extravagant number of model variations it offersmore than 300 at last countand its absurdly long lists of options. The choice of steering wheels on the VW Golf is set to fall from 117 to a mere 43. VW will reconsider all costs, says Mr Muller, including even its hallowed research-and-development budget. In 2014 it was 13 billion, 5 billion more than Toyotas. But it is unclear what VWs huge outlays have yielded. It missed the craze for SUVs, it is lagging its main rivals in electric-car technology and it lacks a cheap platform for budget cars in emerging markets. A project to standardise the underpinnings of many VW group models with a platform called the MQB seems not to be producing the expected cost savings.

Mr Muller is resistant, however, to disposing of any part of the firm, even a unit that makes marine diesel engines. A gruff No is his response when asked if he would consider selling it, though it is unclear that this division, or another that builds lorries, or Ducati, a maker of exotic motorbikes, is a core part of VW.

The most intractable problem is low productivity, especially at the mass-market VW brand. The groups labour costs have risen from around 13% of sales in 2007 to almost 17%. Outside China (where it makes cars in joint ventures with local firms), the groups 520,000 workers made 6.7m vehicles in 2014, or about 13 each. That is about the same productivity as at Daimlers Mercedes division, which makes only high-margin premium models (see chart 2).

As other carmakers have shifted production to low-wage countries, VW has remained largely stuck in Germany. Some 45% of its employees are based there, many enjoying a four-day work week. The VW brands German factories are among the highest-cost plants in the industry, says Patrick Hummel of UBS, a bank.

But VWs commitment to Germany is absolute. We are a German company, says Mr Muller, and will preserve German jobs. Powerful unions would be sure to resist job cuts. Mr Muller says that they agree on the need for reform but admits to disagreement over how it might happen. Unions could also prevent a wider rethink that might shift investment from the VW brand to others that are more profitable. The supervisory board, made up largely of union representatives and nominees of the state of Lower Saxony, which holds a 20% stake in VW, has the power to resist most changes of strategy.

Maybe an outsider with a mandate for change, if backed by the Porsche-Piech family, which controls the voting shares, could have achieved more. But Mr Mullers hands seem tied. The good bits of the VW group will continue to prop up the underperforming bits. That burden may get heavier: premium and low-cost carmakers are thriving while the mass market, the core of VWs business, becomes more competitive. Odd as it sounds, VW could have done with a bigger crisis.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,Life in the slow lane,[],"IF YOU want to get rich, goes a Chinese saying, first build a road. George Osborne, Britains chancellor, seems to agree. He seldom misses a chance to put on a hard hat and proclaim the virtues of more roads and railways. His idea of a Northern Powerhouse would boost the north of England with a big new transport network that better connects the region. Certainly, if people are not stuck in traffic jams or can work in peace on a train they can get more done, leading to higher productivity and increased wages.

Yet for all the rhetoric, in recent years British infrastructure has been deteriorating. Roads are more clogged: the percentage of journeys on main routes that are classed as on time has fallen by six percentage points since 2010. Trains are getting more crowded, too: a quarter of trains arriving in London in rush hour are overcrowded, up from a fifth in 2010. Commuters are putting up with creaky carriages: in 2005-15 the average age of the rolling stock rose from 15 to 20 years. The number of local buses has fallen by 2.5% since 2010, even though the population has grown by 3%.

The World Economic Forum ranks the quality of Britains overall infrastructure 24th in the world, down from 19th in 2006, and behind Iceland and America (which is 13th). It is unlikely that things will improve soon. When the coalition government came to power in 2010, Britain was already one of the lowest spenders on infrastructure in Europe. But as Mr Osborne tries to balance the books, public-sector investment is projected to fall from 3.2% of GDP in 2010 to just 1.4% in 2020.

A small infrastructure budget is not necessarily a bad thing, if the money is used wisely. This often means spending on unsexy thingsimproving traffic lights and so forthrather than big, expensive undertakings. In 2006 Sir Rod Eddington, an Australian businessman, published a government-backed review of Britains infrastructure provision, warning against grands projets for having cost-benefit ratios that are often worse than other less-exciting transport projects. Politicians like to be photographed at big digs, but the returns from such projects are hard to predict.

Sometimes there is no option but to build big. On many London Underground lineswhich already run as many as 30 trains an hourit is hard to make incremental improvements; the only sensible way to create new capacity is to build a new line, as the government is doing now with Crossrail, an east-to-west London link. Still, it has mostly ignored the recommendations of the Eddington review, says John Van Reenen of the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, instead focusing its energy on larger, shinier projects.

The addition of a third runway at Heathrow airport, for example, would cost over 20 billion ($28 billion). Transport for the North, the infrastructure arm of the powerhouse idea, envisages building an 18-mile road tunnel, perhaps Europes longest, under the Pennine hills, and constructing other expensive new highways. The tunnel alone could cost up to 6 billion. Meanwhile, 1.5 billion is likely to be spent improving a few miles of road between Cambridge and Huntingdon. Government figures suggest that since 2011 the expected cost of the average public infrastructure project has roughly doubled.

As a result less money is available for smaller upgrades. Funding for local roads has been cut by 20% in real terms since 2010. Analysis by the RAC Foundation, an independent think-tank, found that the number of potholes being filled in per year has increased fourfold since 2005, suggesting that costly, long-term repair is being sacrificed in favour of patching up. Government support for local bus services is down by 20% in five years.

Not down the tubes

Another consequence of tighter budgets is that the state relies more heavily on the private sector to fund infrastructure projects. An extension to the Northern Line of the London Underground is a good example. The Greater London Authority is borrowing 1 billion. But that will ultimately be repaid, largely by the schemes direct beneficiaries, in the form of an uplift in business rates alongside developer contributions, says Alexander Jan of Arup, a consultancy. Ultimately, the government will pay little towards the project from general taxation.

Prosperous cities are most likely to be able to generate big contributions from the private sector and thus better infrastructure, says Mr Jan; poor places may miss out. In recent years, government figures suggest, London has taken up a bigger share of Britains overall infrastructure spend.

Business gripes that, although it may be expected to shoulder more of the cost, it is not always consulted enough. Kate Willard, an executive at Stobart Group, which runs airports and other big projects, argues that politicians do not take sufficient account of future shopping patterns and retail trends when making their infrastructure plans. Andy Clarke, the head of Asda, a supermarket chain, believes that productivity could be boosted as much by getting high-speed broadband as by building HS2, the 50 billion new railway being built between London and the Midlands.

Stand up for your rights

Fortunately, as well as building shiny new stuff there are also low-cost ways of improving infrastructure. Transport nerds favour ripping seats out of certain carriages in commuter trains, making them look more like Underground trains and thus increasing their capacity (though with little regard for passengers comfort). Those willing to stand could pay less. Smart motorways, which were first deployed in 2006, use the hard shoulder as an extra lane at busy times.

One plan popular with economists is to use dynamic pricingsimilar to that used by taxi appswhere prices rise at peak times to discourage people from travelling. Thanks to a series of subtle changes, this could soon be a reality across Britain. In 2015 the Highways Agency, which manages motorways, was converted into a free-standing company owned by the state (renamed Highways England), meaning it has secure funding for the foreseeable future. Road tax, which is now largely payable electronically and enforced with cameras that recognise number plates, will be earmarked for Highways England, says Mr Jan. In theory, the stage is set for the government to start charging for using certain roads. Many are hoping that Mr Osborne will make such a change in his budget on March 16th. Dynamic pricing for rail travel seems off the table, though: the government considered a plan for super-peak tickets, only to drop it in 2013.

If, as seems probable, a big boost of public money does not arrive, Britain will have to take such radical decisions. Creaky infrastructure is already weighing on productivity and wages. Without a change of direction, the load will get ever heavier.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,In difficult times Mexico and its firms retain their faith in globalisation,[],"THESE are dark days for globalisation. In America, presidential candidates are talking about building walls and unpicking trade deals. Brazil, another giant of the Americas, seems as protectionist as ever. Britain is preparing to hold a referendum on withdrawing from the European Union. The EU as a whole is bickering over what to do about a swelling tide of refugees.

Yet there is at least some light in the darkness. Mexico, for instance, continues to carry a torch for globalisation. President Enrique Pena Nietos administration boasts about the countrys 44 trade deals, more than any other country, and its 11 reform initiatives. The World Bank calculates that Mexico is one of the most open large economies in the world: exports plus imports are equivalent to 66% of GDP, compared with 26% for Brazil and 42% for China. The Boston Consulting Group finds in a survey that its people take a positive view of the future: 77% of Mexicans say they are optimistic, and only 6% that they are very pessimistic. Mexicans see the likes of Donald Trump as being cut from the same cloth as the old-fashioned Latin American strongmen who ruined the region through protectionism and gesture politics.

When the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) was created in 1994 it was as controversial in Mexico as it was in the United States: a Yanqui conspiracy, according to those on the left, designed to turn their country into a colony of El Norte. Today the Mexican elite speaks with one voice on the subject. Mexico is now one of the worlds top 15 manufacturing economies and one of its top five car producers. The output of the ten largest car plants rose from 1.1m vehicles in 1994 to 2.9m in 2012. Mexican consumers now have access to a huge range of multinational brands: marketers refer to young, middle-class Mexicans as the children of NAFTA, because their taste is so cosmopolitan.

Free trade has helped to produce a corps of elite Mexican companies that are capable of going head-to-head with the best in the world. Bimbo is the worlds largest baker, thanks in part to its ambitious expansion into America with the purchase of Sara Lees bakery business. Gruma is the worlds biggest maker of tortillas, with more than 100 plants in 20 countries. Free trade has been a double blessing for such companies. First, it has encouraged those that have reached the limit of the Mexican market to go global. They have the huge advantages of speaking one of the worlds most popular languages, and sharing a 1,900-mile (3,100km) border with America. Second, now that they are more vulnerable to competition and takeovers, they have been forced to shake off a long-standing tendency for successful Mexican companies to become flabby. When AB InBev, a global brewer, bought Grupo Modelo, a Mexican beer firm, in 2013, it quickly eliminated around $1 billion in annual costs.

Schumpeter noted in a previous column on Mexico that it is unusual in having both a global upper class (thanks to American education) and a global peasantry (thanks to emigration to America). Free trade is now rapidly globalising the middle class, which by some estimates makes up 30-40% of the population. Scot Rank, the boss of the Lala Group, a dairy firm, points out that better-off Mexicans are becoming more like Americans in their tastes. They want lite products that will help them fight the flab (obesity is a big problem in a country addicted to a vitamin T diet of tacos and tortillas) and drinkables, nutrition that can be consumed on the go (partly in response to the rise of two-income families).

Mexico is now freeing up two hitherto protected areas, telecoms and energy. Telmex has been forced to surrender its telecoms monopoly, and is now in a vigorous battle with the Yanqui AT&T, in which average tariffs have fallen by half in the past year. Pemex, the state oil monolith, is being forced to auction off some fields to foreign bidders, and to form joint ventures with foreign firms. A visit to Pemexs headquarters illustrates just how radical the latter policy is. A collection of giant slabs surrounded by thick iron railings, protected by a phalanx of armed guards, it looks more like an arm of government than a commercial organisation. Which is exactly what it is: Pemex provides a third of government revenues and thousands of coveted jobsand until recently its monopoly status was guaranteed in the constitution. Last month the government underlined its seriousness by sacking the companys boss, Emilio Lozoya, despite his close relationship with the president. The new boss, Jose Antonio Gonzalez, argues that the steep fall in the oil price is also a golden opportunity: Pemex now has no choice but to reform if it is to thrive in the face of greater competition.

The other Mexico that still needs fixing

Even if the government can successfully re-engineer Pemex, it still has an enormous amount to do. Mexico is one of the worlds most unequal societies. Perhaps half of Mexicans are still poor and parochial, beset by crime and corruption, and poorly served by schools and banks. The economy is hobbled by a long tail of inefficient firms: the McKinsey Global Institute, a think-tank, points out that, though the productivity of Mexicos globalised companies has risen by 5.8% a year since 1999, the productivity of small, traditional firms has fallen by 6.5% a year. Poorer regions, especially in the south, are mired in the past, too far from the American border to benefit from the manufacturing boom. These problems have held back the economys growth rate to a disappointing 2-3% over the past 30 years. They have also supplied the drugs cartels (which benefit from globalisation in their own, malign way) with an endless supply of young recruits.

Mr Pena Nietos administration has done something to extend the benefits of globalisation to this other Mexico by deregulating telecoms and taking on the teachers unions. However, this is just the start of what is needed. Successful Mexicans are right to mock Mr Trumps talk of building walls. But they need to focus their energies on some construction projects of their own: building ladders of opportunity for the poor, and bridges of commerce between the two Mexicos.",[]

That was more than a year before the German carmaker admitted to cheating on emissions tests in the United States, though VW says it is not known whether Mr Winterkorn read the memo, as it was included in a batch of extensive weekend mail. See article.

Aubrey McClendon, one of the pioneers of Americas shale-gas revolution, died after his car hit a concrete wall in Oklahoma City. A day earlier he had been charged by the Department of Justice with conspiring to fix the price of oil and gas leases between 2007 and 2012, when he was CEO of Chesapeake Energy. He had denied the allegations, insisting he was being singled out as the only person in the energy industry to face criminal charges for bidding jointly on leaseholds in the 110 years of the Sherman Act.

Every little step

The Peoples Bank of China cut its reserve requirement ratiothe amount, relative to deposits, that banks must keep with the central bankby half a percentage point. It is the fifth reduction in just over a year. By freeing money for lending, the PBoC hopes to stimulate the slowing economy. Manufacturing activity in China fell in February to its lowest level in years.

The euro zone slipped back into deflation for the first time since September. Consumer prices fell by an annual 0.2% in February; economists had expected the figure to be flat. The European Central Bank will meet on March 10th to weigh more stimulus in order to tackle persistently low inflation.

Swedens economy grew by a respectable 1.3% in the fourth quarter of last year compared with the previous three months, and by 4.1% for all of 2015. Consumer spending, investment and exports all rose faster than expected. Sweden has a negative interest rate of -0.5%; a robust economy makes it unlikely that the central bank will cut it further.

A potential bidding war for the London Stock Exchange loomed when ICE, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, said it was considering making an offer. The LSE is already in advanced talks with Deutsche Borse about a merger. One of the LSEs most attractive assets is its profitable clearing-house business in swaps, bonds and other financial instruments.

Out of Africa

After a century of doing business on the continent, Barclays said it would leave Africa and focus on its core banking activities in Britain and America. The bank is selling assets in part to boost its capital. It also cut its dividend by half to help shore up its balance-sheet. See article.

Apple and the FBI took their tussle over accessing the iPhone of a terrorist to Congress. The hearing produced more heat than light, with Apple defending its decision not to help the agency unlock the device on privacy grounds, and the FBI asking Are we comfortable with technical design decisions that result in barriers to obtaining evidence of a crime?

Facebook confronted two legal challenges. Police in Brazil arrested an executive at Facebook because it failed to comply with a court order to turn over messages sent by suspected drug-traffickers through WhatsApp, which is owned by the tech giant. Facebook says it cant comply as it cant retain or intercept user messages on the messaging service. In Germany antitrust regulators started an inquiry into whether it abuses its dominance in social networks to collect personal data.

Amazon made its first proper foray into Britains supermarket industry when it teamed up with Morrisons to deliver its produce. Britain, with its densely populated towns, has a vibrant online- shopping market; 27% of Britons buy groceries online at least once a month.

Another week, another woeful annual earnings release from a mining company, as Glencore reported a net loss for 2015 of $5 billion. Its debt pile remained high, at $26 billion at the end of the year. But Ivan Glasenberg, Glencores chief executive, said that the company had learnt lessons from the past and was on track to reduce its debt to $15 billion by 2017.

The parent trap

Disney introduced variable pricing for tickets to its American theme parks. The new system has three pricing bands, with the peak ticket costing about a fifth more than previously. New value days will be priced about 5% lower than the old flat rate. Parents with school-age children will feel the market is again working against them, but the changes are similar to those already implemented by other theme parks.",[]

economist.com,2016-05-01 00:00:00,Stanford Graduate School of Business,[],"Professor Gruenfelds work on the psychology of power not only gives credence to the old adage that power corrupts, but it explains why this occurs. Whereas the classic Machiavellian perspective suggests that powers effects are mostly premeditated and strategic, her research suggests that when power corrupts, it can be without conscious awareness. Her theory of power, published in Psychological Review with co-authors Dacher Keltner and Cameron Anderson, asserts that power is disinhibiting: by reducing concern for the social consequences of ones actions, power strengthens the link between personal desires and the acts that satisfy them. Recent papers document also that power leads to an action-orientation (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,) limits the ability to take anothers perspective (Psychological Science), and that it increases the tendency to view others as means to an end (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.)

Professor Gruenfelds early work examined power dynamics in work groups, including the U.S. Supreme Court (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology; Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.) Her analyses of published opinions by U.S. Supreme Court justices suggested that when decisions are made by groups in a democracy, participants styles of reasoning depend more on group dynamics (that is, whether justices are in the majority or the minority) than on individuals personalities, or their ideological preferences (liberal versus conservative.) This work received outstanding dissertation awards from the American Psychological Association and the Society for Experimental Social Psychology.

Her study ""Can an Angry Woman Get Ahead? Gender, Status Conferral, and Workplace Emotion Expression,"" published in Psychological Science, concluded that people reward men who get angry but view angry women as incompetent and unworthy of status and power in the workplace. The research was widely reported on in the popular press including the New York Times, Business Week, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, National Public Radio, and U.S. News & World Report.

Additionally, Professor Brescoll examines how having power may differentially affect men and women's behavior at work. In 2012, she published a paper in Administrative Science Quarterly, ""Who Takes the Floor and Why: Gender, Power, and Volubility in Organizations,"" showing that, for men, there is a strong relationship between having power and talking a lot in organizational settings (e.g., the United States Senate), but for women, there is no such relationship. Her other research interests include the cultural origins of stereotypes (e.g. the media), corporate social responsibility, and framing messages to improve health policy.

She received her MS, MPhil, and PhD in social psychology from Yale University where she was supported by a graduate research fellowship from the National Science Foundation. She completed her BA in psychology from the University of Michigan. In 2004, Professor Brescoll worked in the office of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton under a Congressional Fellowship.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 15:47:50,European fiction: Olga Tokarczuk's Polish narrative,[],"LAST week at Cambridge University, a bestselling novelist discussed a 900-page book that no one can yet read in English. Published in 2014, Ksiegi Jakubowe (The Books of Jacob) tells the story of a cultist Jewish figure, Jacob Frank, in 18th-century Poland. Its author, 53-year-old Olga Tokarczuk, is now under the angry glare of many of her countrymen.

Ms Tokarczuk has embellished the historical Jacobs life and times withas she so ably conveyed when she spoke before a packed audiencegreat mischievousness and irony. She has many avid fans in Poland. Ksiegi Jakubowe has sold around 150,000 hardback copies, and last October won a prestigious prize, the Nike. Two days after the award Ms Tokarczuk explained in a television interview the books historical context.

She alluded to horrendous acts committed by Poles as colonisers, of peoples in large territory to the east of present-day Poland, mainly Ukraine. She also spoke of slavery (many historians would prefer serfdom) during the time in which the book is set, and to the murder of Jews. This last issue especiallybrutal pogroms in the east of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which lasted from 1569 to 1795features prominently in the novel.

The author has described Ksiegi Jakubowe as picaresque. Parts of the story are told by a rabbi named Nachman, providing a more subjective perspective alongside the books omniscient realist narrator. The pagination is in reverse (as in a Hebrew book). So as well as evoking a multicultural, sometimes violent period many Poles might prefer to forget, Ksiegi Jakubowe is a genuine 21st-century fictional experiment.

Since the election on October 25th of the Law and Justice party (PiS), the temper in Poland has lurched dramatically to the nationalist right. It is a raw time to suggest that Poland has ever been anything other than either heroic or victimised. In public, and in polemical language that is absent from her novel, Ms Tokarczuk was reminding Poles that they, too, have been exploitative, feudal and lethally anti-Semitic.

This outrages many self-styled patriots. The morning after the television interview, her Facebook page was bombarded with abuse. Youll never be safe now in this country, youll always be treated as a liar, read one message. Get out of our country since you seem to have such a problem with it, read another. Hitlers conspirators were Ms Tokarczuks compatriots, i.e. the Ukrainians. (Her surname is of Ukrainian origin.)

A quickly-formed group of Tokarczuk-haters in Nowa Ruda, a town near where she bought a house over 20 years ago, then posted death threats: we know where you live. Initially, she was terrified. She had been invited to the Guadalajara book fair, in Mexico, and there, towards the end of last year, she escaped and remained, out of sight, for a month.

Ms Tokarczuk spoke to Prospero a day after the Cambridge event. My first attackers were actually from Reduta, a group of right-orientated historians and idealists who are against so-called defamation of Poland. It offers to protect Polands good name and thoroughly represents PiSs thinking. Did she really consider the death threats to be anything more than empty ones? My publishers [Wydawnictwo Literackie in Cracow] gave me security guards for a week. The whole thing was, in the end, stupid: none of these Reduta people nor, I think, any of the other attackers can possibly have read my book. But Ms Tokarczuk also had hundreds of positive messages, and was able to go to Guadalajara with an ocean of good news and support.

Since 1989, Ms Tokarczuk has published over a dozen books. From a mix of poetry, and short and longer fiction, as well as essays, nine novels have had special impact. In 1996, her breakthrough Prawiek i inne czasy (appearing in English six years ago as Primeval and Other Times) brought her fame. It is about a family's travails over three generations in an invented village near the Czech border. The book struck deep chords in readers, who responded to it as if a luminous new way of presenting 20th-century Poland had been found.

Primeval is the place at the centre of the universe it beginsand that universality, packed as the narrative is with offbeat characters and one strange episode after another, was the secret of its success. Her next novel, the first of hers to be published in English, in 2002, as House of Day, House of Night, had similarly mythic appeal. All her novels reflect Polands complex history, spicily re-imagined. Her realism is compellingly magical.

Ms Tokarczuk now lives in Wroclaw. Though shaken by the hate storm, she says ideas for a new novel have taken root and insisted, with nonchalant charm, that she will quickly forget the years of research and writing that went into Ksiegi Jakubowe. Should it ever make it into English meanwhile, it will be more than worth the wait: Ms Tokarczuk is one among a very few signal European novelists of the past quarter-century.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-09 23:29:53,The Economist explains: The point of Americas election debates,[],"THE ostensible purpose of an election campaign debate is to give candidates a chance to share their views and attract possible voters. Political debates have a long tradition: in 1858 a lawyer named Abraham Lincoln challenged Senator Stephen Douglas for his seat in a series of seven debates in Illinois. One candidate would open with a 60 minute speech, and the other would give a 90-minute response. The first candidate would then close the debate with yet another 30 minute speech. Although Mr Lincoln went on to lose the Senate race, the debates elevated his national stature and set him up for a successful presidential run against Mr Douglas two years later.

Most debates, however, have far less impact. Academic research suggests that although presidential debates can inform a persons view, they tend to do little to change it. In their book The Timeline of Presidential Elections, political scientists Robert Erikson and Christopher Wlezien looked at every American election featuring televised debates between 1960 and 2008 and found that the polling numbers of presidential candidates leading up to debates were almost perfectly correlated with their polling numbers shortly afterwards. But most research looks at the later stages of elections, when parties candidates have been chosen. Debates almost certainly matter more during the primaries for two reasons: first, voters will almost never know who all the candidates in a presidential primary are, which means there is more scope for shaping their perceptions. Second, many voters are staunch partisans; it is far easier to convince someone to choose another candidate from their own party than to defect altogether.

It does seem that debates have had a big impact in shaping the outcome of primaries. In 2011's Republican presidential primary race, Rick Perry declared that he would shut down three wasteful government agencies if elected, but failed to recall the names of all three he had in mind. Mr Perry never recovered from his gaffe, and ended his campaign two months later. Earlier this year, in a debate just three days before the New Hampshire primary, Chris Christie attacked his rival Marco Rubio for repeating the same lines over and over again. Mr Rubio was caught off-guard and responded by robotically repeating the same lineyet again. The fallout was immediate: not only was Mr Rubio confronted by hecklers in robot costumes, he tanked at the ballot box, placing fifth in New Hampshire after being expected to finish second.

More than 157 years after the Lincoln-Douglas debates, the level of political discourse seems to have slipped. Though the Democratic debates have remained relatively civil this cycle, the Republican debates have devolved into schoolyard shouting matches. In a debate on February 25th, the television subtitles described one particularly heated segment as unintelligible yelling. During the most recent Republican debate, front-runner Donald Trump christened his two chief rivals Little Marco and Lyin Ted and assured viewers that there was no problem with his manhood. Its not always clear exactly what informational value voters will be able to extract from some of these debates, but they do at least make entertaining television.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-12 00:00:00,The future of computing,[],"IN 1971 the fastest car in the world was the Ferrari Daytona, capable of 280kph (174mph). The worlds tallest buildings were New Yorks twin towers, at 415 metres (1,362 feet). In November that year Intel launched the first commercial microprocessor chip, the 4004, containing 2,300 tiny transistors, each the size of a red blood cell.

Since then chips have improved in line with the prediction of Gordon Moore, Intels co-founder. According to his rule of thumb, known as Moores law, processing power doubles roughly every two years as smaller transistors are packed ever more tightly onto silicon wafers, boosting performance and reducing costs. A modern Intel Skylake processor contains around 1.75 billion transistorshalf a million of them would fit on a single transistor from the 4004and collectively they deliver about 400,000 times as much computing muscle. This exponential progress is difficult to relate to the physical world. If cars and skyscrapers had improved at such rates since 1971, the fastest car would now be capable of a tenth of the speed of light; the tallest building would reach half way to the Moon.

The impact of Moores law is visible all around us. Today 3 billion people carry smartphones in their pockets: each one is more powerful than a room-sized supercomputer from the 1980s. Countless industries have been upended by digital disruption. Abundant computing power has even slowed nuclear tests, because atomic weapons are more easily tested using simulated explosions rather than real ones. Moores law has become a cultural trope: people inside and outside Silicon Valley expect technology to get better every year.

But now, after five decades, the end of Moores law is in sight (see Technology Quarterly). Making transistors smaller no longer guarantees that they will be cheaper or faster. This does not mean progress in computing will suddenly stall, but the nature of that progress is changing. Chips will still get better, but at a slower pace (number-crunching power is now doubling only every 2.5 years, says Intel). And the future of computing will be defined by improvements in three other areas, beyond raw hardware performance.

Faith no Moore

The first is software. This week AlphaGo, a program which plays the ancient game of Go, beat Lee Sedol, one of the best human players, in the first two of five games scheduled in Seoul. Go is of particular interest to computer scientists because of its complexity: there are more possible board positions than there are particles in the universe (see article). As a result, a Go-playing system cannot simply rely on computational brute force, provided by Moores law, to prevail. AlphaGo relies instead on deep learning technology, modelled partly on the way the human brain works. Its success this week shows that huge performance gains can be achieved through new algorithms. Indeed, slowing progress in hardware will provide stronger incentives to develop cleverer software.

The second area of progress is in the cloud, the networks of data centres that deliver services over the internet. When computers were stand-alone devices, whether mainframes or desktop PCs, their performance depended above all on the speed of their processor chips. Today computers become more powerful without changes to their hardware. They can draw upon the vast (and flexible) number-crunching resources of the cloud when doing things like searching through e-mails or calculating the best route for a road trip. And interconnectedness adds to their capabilities: smartphone features such as satellite positioning, motion sensors and wireless-payment support now matter as much as processor speed.

The third area of improvement lies in new computing architecturesspecialised chips optimised for particular jobs, say, and even exotic techniques that exploit quantum-mechanical weirdness to crunch multiple data sets simultaneously. There was less need to pursue these sorts of approaches when generic microprocessors were improving so rapidly, but chips are now being designed specifically for cloud computing, neural-network processing, computer vision and other tasks. Such specialised hardware will be embedded in the cloud, to be called upon when needed. Once again, that suggests the raw performance of end-user devices matters less than it did, because the heavy lifting is done elsewhere.

Speed isnt everything

What will this mean in practice? Moores law was never a physical law, but a self-fulfilling prophecya triumph of central planning by which the technology industry co-ordinated and synchronised its actions. Its demise will make the rate of technological progress less predictable; there are likely to be bumps in the road as new performance-enhancing technologies arrive in fits and starts. But given that most people judge their computing devices on the availability of capabilities and features, rather than processing speed, it may not feel like much of a slowdown to consumers.

For companies, the end of Moores law will be disguised by the shift to cloud computing. Already, firms are upgrading PCs less often, and have stopped operating their own e-mail servers. This model depends, however, on fast and reliable connectivity. That will strengthen demand for improvements to broadband infrastructure: those with poor connectivity will be less able to benefit as improvements in computing increasingly happen inside cloud providers data centres.

For the technology industry itself, the decline of Moores law strengthens the logic for centralised cloud computing, already dominated by a few big firms: Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent. They are working hard to improve the performance of their cloud infrastructure. And they are hunting for startups touting new tricks: Google bought Deepmind, the British firm that built AlphaGo, in 2014.

For more than 50 years, the seemingly inexorable shrinking of transistors made computers steadily cheaper and more capable. As Moores law fades, progress will be less metronomic. But computers and other devices will continue to become more powerfuljust in different and more varied ways.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 11:32:02,The Democrats last debate: Bernie Sanders and Univision force Hillary Clinton to the left,[],"IF ANY moderate Republicans appalled by Donald Trump tuned in to the Democratic presidential debate held in Miami on March 9th, what they heard cannot have made it easier for them to consider lending their votefor one election at leastto Hillary Clinton. From the start Mrs Clinton was under pressure to tack to the left and woo her partys core supporters in this, her last scheduled TV debate with her populist rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. On some big questions, and especially on immigration, she gave in to that pressure and staked out radical positions which she can expect to see played in Republican attack ads again and again, once the general election is under way.

Some of the pressure on Mrs Clinton was exerted by recent events. Just 24 hours earlier she had suffered a surprise defeat in Michigans presidential primary election, with Mr Sanders notably buoyed by support from voters who told exit polls that they think free trade costs America jobs. Though the former first lady, senator and secretary of state is still on course to be her partys nominee, her underwhelming performance in a big, Midwestern rustbelt state underlines her weakness among the trade-union members and working-class white voters who have been drifting away from the Democrats for years.

Some of the pressure came from the debates main host, Univision. A Spanish-language television network which regularly pulls in more viewers than some of the main American networks, Univision is unashamed to call itself a guide and an advocate for its Hispanic audience. Its star anchor, Jorge Ramos, takes pride in the idea that no politician can win the White House today without Latino votersand openly seeks to extract a price for that support. Mr Ramos has called President Barack Obama a deporter-in-chief because of his governments expulsion of millions of undocumented immigrants and illegal border-crossers.

On the debate stage at Miami-Dade College the Univision anchor repeatedly pressed Mrs Clinton to give her word that she would not deport two specific groups. First, children in America without legal papers (as with the waves of Central American children who crossed the border in large numbers in 2014). Second, the millions of migrants living in the country who do not have criminal records but lack a legal right to remain. Several times Mrs Clinton attempted to explain that she would seek to shield migrants from deportation, by ensuring that child arrivals have legal help to navigate the asylum system and by focusing law-enforcement efforts on removing those who pose a threat to public order or safety. Mr Ramos was not satisfied.

Their final exchange is worth quoting in full because it will be cited many times in the coming months, especially if Mr Trump is the Republican nominee and sticks to his current talk of sending government agents to round up and deport all 11m migrants who live in the country without papers.

Mr Ramos: But again, yes or no, can you promise tonight that you wont deport children, children who are already here? Mrs Clinton: I will not deport children. I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family members either, Jorge. I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. Thats a relatively small universe. Mr Ramos: OK. So I want to be very specific. So you are telling us tonight that if you become president you wont deport children who are already here? Mrs Clinton: I will not. Mr Ramos: And that you wont deport immigrants who dont have a criminal record? Mrs Clinton: Thats what Im telling you.

In the spin room afterwards Clinton aides sought to downplay the radicalism of the position their candidate had just taken (Mr Sanders matched it enthusiastically, for the record). They conceded that Mr Obama has struggled to put into action more modest executive programmes which shield migrants who arrived in the country as children or those who are the parents of American-born citizens. Mrs Clinton is not pretending that she can simply issue executive actions that protect all 11m undocumented migrants, aides said. Instead she is seeking to defend Mr Obamas programmes, which grant work permits and Social Security numbers to millions of migrants. Then she would use the well-established principle of prosecutorial discretion to tell federal agents that undocumented residents who break no other laws should not be targeted for removal.

Still, it is not hard to see how her promise will be called a blanket amnesty. The gulf between that position and the mass deportations backed by Mr Trump and his chief Republican rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, is both large and unfriendly terrain for centrist-minded voters.

The irony is that at other moments the debate, which was co-hosted by the Washington Post newspaper, did a fine job of asking Mrs Clinton questions that interest general-election voters, and not just die-hard Democratic activists. That is as it should be: in this reporters experience, Latino voters are painfully realistic about the politics of immigration, and correctly suspicious of politicians who make impossible promises to Hispanics (a sin sometimes referred to as Hispandering).

Karen Tumulty of the Washington Post, one of the moderators, asked Mrs Clinton why she thinks so many voters mistrust her, and whether any of her actions had fed that public distrust.

Mrs Clinton offered a nifty reply that Americans can expect to hear again before this election is over. It was nifty because it answered a different question from the one asked: namely, Mrs Clinton pretended that she had been asked why she is not better liked, and explained that perhaps she is a doughty slogger and policy wonk who lacks charisma. I am not a natural politician, in case you havent noticed, like my husband or President Obama, she sighed. So I have a view that I just have to do the best I can, get the results I can, make a difference in peoples lives.

Alas for the Democratic front-runner, she will not be able to pivot to the centre and woo general-election voters for a while yet. Mr Sanders has high hopes of winning many more states before this primary is done, fuelled by donations from millions of fervent supporters: a much-watched contest will take place in the Midwestern battleground state of Ohio on March 15th.

The Univision debate did give the Vermont senator a justly hard time for his grisly record of sucking up to and apologising for left-wing dictatorships in Latin America. In a gripping moment, Mr Sanders was forced to watch a 1985 film of his younger self earnestly scorning those Americans who had predicted a Cuban popular uprising against Fidel Castro. They forgot that he educated their kids, gave them health care, totally transformed their society, enthused the Bernie Sanders of 1985. The Senator Sanders of 2016 seemed unabashed, explaining that what he meant was that, though Cuba is undemocratic and authoritarian, the key issue here was whether the United States should go around overthrowing small Latin American countries.

Speaking in the heart of Floridas Cuban-American community, Mrs Clinton seized the chance to tack to the moderate middle, endorsing Mr Obamas policy of opening relations with Cuba while condemning Mr Sanders for his past praise for the Castro regime. She noted that he had once cheered what he called a revolution of values in Cuba and talked about how people were working for the common good, not for themselves. I just couldnt disagree more. You know, if the values are that you oppress people, you disappear people, you imprison people or even kill people for expressing their opinions, for expressing freedom of speech, that is not the kind of revolution of values that I ever want to see anywhere, she said crisply.

With luck more Democratic debates will be organised. Though this one grew testy, it never strayed from substantive discussions of policy. The contrast with the mosh-pit antics of Republican debates in the Trump era is painful.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-12 00:00:00,"One step forward, one step back",[],"WHEN Hind Al-Otaibi went to the Riyadh Personal Status Court to have her father struck out as her wali, or guardian, the judges seemed sympathetic. Her father had raped and bruised her, Ms Otaibi, who was a teenager at the time, told the court. He refused to let her travel abroad, even to her mothers funeral, and when she escaped from home had persuaded social services to send her back. After consideration, the judges determined last year that her father, an imam from the Saudi interior of Nejd, remained her legal guardian; but that a guardian only had powers to approve his wards marriage. If upheld on appeal, the ruling could topple the legal edifice of male control, depriving walis of their power over whether their women can study, work, travel or open bank accounts. Emancipation from slavery, says Ms Otaibi.

In recent years, the lot of Saudi women has improved. An increasing number of malls, gated communities and even private beaches, where women swap burqinis (the all-enveloping swimwear Saudi women must wear) for bikinis, were put off-limits to the prying eyes of the religious police. The government sent tens of thousands of women abroad to study in Western universities, where they could experience the freedom of moving, dressing and driving as they pleased. Those left behind could gawp at the gap between their own world and the virtual one to which many Saudis escape for hours every day.

Armed with doctorates, many have returned to prize open the job market. In 2012 the courts licensed their first female lawyer. Last December women for the first time stood for election to local councils. Bayan al-Zahran, a lawyer in Jeddah, has set up the first female-led law firm, and law faculties in womens colleges churn out fresh attorneys.

The numbers, though, remain paltry. Only 18% of working-age Saudi women work (against 65% of men), one of the worlds lowest rates. And for all the headlines, the kingdom has only 67 female lawyers (out of 3,400), and 21 female councillors (out of 3,150). Female lawyers say they have to contend with judges who tell them to sit down when they stand up to represent clients. But over time the taboos on women in public life seem to fraying. Women are better at representing other women because women natter more than men, and women understand them better, says Judge Faisal Orani, fresh from sentencing a whisky-drinker to 80 lashes. He opposes the introduction of female judges, he says, but over time, anything can change. Maybe Ill change too.

The kingdoms joyless gender segregation persists. Banks maintain separate entrances for men and women, Starbucks restricts women from its open-air balcony and McDonalds makes men and women queue separately for its burgers. In Riyadh and in Jeddah, though not in a few more liberal places such as Qatif, the clericswho always opposed female participation in the electionshave stopped the new female local councillors from sitting in the council chambers with men.

But to clerical consternation, (veiled) women now operate the tills in Ikea, a Swedish furniture outlet, in a poorer part of Riyadh, and men and women queue in mixed aisles. At the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology outside Jeddah, male and female students attend the same lectures and mingle freely. Architects of new office blocks locate male and female toilets on the same floor.

Most Saudi women have yet to take the liberties their Iranian counterparts do with the veil. Parents would object if I didnt cover my face, says a primary school headmistress who longs to remove it. But growing numbers of high-school girls are donning headscarves only, no matter that their elders consider that scandalous. In Jeddah, a more liberal port city, seamstresses design abayas with bright colours and women smoke water-pipes out of doors.

But worryingly, King Abdullahs incremental reforms seem to be stalling and even going to reverse under his successor, King Salman. His young son, Muhammad, who operates most of the levers of power, says he is anxious to increase Saudi productivity, and to lower birth-rates, by getting women out of the home and into the workplace. But even so he seems nervous of confronting the religious establishment, on whom the Al Saud rulers depend for legitimacy. Many of Abdullahs reformers have been shifted; and a host of hardliners are back. The only female minister, in the education ministry, was dismissed soon after Salman took the throne.

Four women who publicly defied the still unreformed ban on female driving were barred from contesting local elections. Shoppers in Jeddah report that the religious police are back, demanding that department stores black out any glimpse of unveiled women on their packaging. One executive at an international financial-services firm says that the snoops carried out three spot-checks on her office last year to check for signs of the sexes mingling. She is once again being forced to enter through side-entrances when visiting clients, while her male counterparts go through the front door; and they have to travel to meetings in separate cars.

In the new, more conservative environment, perhaps the best hope for women is that the country might rediscover its own traditions. A senior official admires footage of the Saudi states founder, Abdulaziz, holding court in 1930s Mecca, while women riding on horseback bring their wares to market. At Jeddahs annual festival, the organisers display the colourful costumes women used to wear before the puritans imposed the black abaya of the central desert on the whole country. Most striking of all is the Prophet Muhammads own requirement that women and men perform the pilgrimage to Mecca together; and that when women go round the Kaaba, Islams holiest place, they show their face. Saudi Arabias new rulers might take note.",[]

Brazil is not one of them: the percentage of employers planning on shedding workers exceeds those who think they will hire more, and employer confidence is at its lowest since the survey was launched in 2009.

economist.com,2016-03-12 00:00:00,A messy but necessary deal,[],"THROUGHOUT the cold war, Turkey was one of Europes bastions against Soviet armies. Now it is being turned into Europes barrier against the huddled masses of the Middle East. At a summit on March 7th, European leaders and the Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, agreed on the outline of a strikingly ambitious deal. Turkey will take back all the boat-people setting off from its shores to Greece. In return, Europe is promising lots of things: money; the resettlement of many refugees now in Turkey; visa-free travel for Turks; and a revival of negotiations for Turkey to join the European Union.

Every element of the arrangement is politically, legally or morally problematic. To make matters worse, the behaviour of the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is increasingly autocratic: the weekend before striking the accord with the EU, his government took over a prominent opposition newspaper. But Europe is doing the right thing. The deals principles are sound (and have, indeed, been advocated by this newspaper): it would control chaotic mass-migration while preserving a generous European asylum system, and enlist Turkey as a gatekeeper by binding it more closely to Europe. It offers the best prospect of ending the uncontrolled influx that has been feeding anti-immigrant populism and undermining EU integration. And it provides a way for Europe to seek Mr Erdogans co-operation without flinching from criticising him.

Deal with Erdogan

Most of the 1.2m migrants who arrived in the EU last year came via Turkey. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, had been negotiating a deal whereby asylum-seekers would be sifted on arrival in hotspots in Greece and Italy, and those rejected would be sent back to Turkey. The new scheme, championed by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is a more ambitious arrangementall boat-people would be sent back to Turkey and processed there. This would avoid turning Greece into a refugee camp, offer a stronger disincentive to illegal migration and ensure that Europe grants protection to the most deserving, not those most able to pay people-smugglers.

But lawyers and UN agencies are already questioning the legality of mass deportation, which would require Europe to declare Turkey a safe country for asylum-seekers. For all its generosity to Syrians, Turkey formally applies the 1951 convention on refugees only to those fleeing war or persecution in Europe. Unless Turkey can bring its asylum system up to international norms, the EU may have to fall back on Mr Tusks original plan. Either way, Europe will have to be generous to refugeesit has promised to take one Syrian from Turkey for every one that is sent back from Greecethough it still cannot agree how to share them out for resettlement.

Visa liberalisation will be contentious, too. Turkey is the only EU candidate country not to enjoy visa-free travel already. The biggest obstacle, a framework for Turkey to take back illegal migrants, would be addressed by the new deal. But Turkey has yet to meet many of the EUs 70-odd preconditions, including the introduction of biometric passports. And while a deal may limit the influx of Syrians, Afghans and others, freer travel would inevitably increase the migration of Turks into the EU.

INTERACTIVE: A guide to Europes migrant crisis, in numbers

Hardest of all will be any discussion of Turkeys accession to the EU. Not even Turkeys closest friends would claim that it meets the democratic standards required to begin EU negotiations, let alone gain membership. Mr Erdogan would dislike the constraints and scrutiny that membership would bring. So Europe should call his bluff by opening the two accession chapters that Mr Erdogan least wants to discusschapters 23 and 24, on justice and the rule of law. It should also press Turkey to do more to support talks on the reunification of Cyprus.

Ultimately, Europeans must come to terms with two realities. First, they cannot change geography: they need Turkey because it stands between Europe and much of the Eurasian landmass. Second, they cannot seal their borders entirely: the only alternative to chaos is a fair and orderly migration system, which would most benefit Europeand those fleeing war. This weeks proposed deal is messy, but it is Europes best option.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 15:23:31,Daily chart: Global nuclear power five years after Fukushima,[],"ON March 11th 2011 a tsunami engulfed Japans north-east coast, flooding towns, farmland and severely damaging the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant. Almost 19,000 people were killed by the tsunami, and a further 160,000 were evacuated after the power plants core leaked radiation into the sea and surrounding area in the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. Five years on, Fukushima is still an exclusion zone and tens of thousands are stuck in temporary shelter. Japan shut down all but two of its 43 reactors over safety concerns. And other countries have recently sped up efforts to replace nuclear power with greener renewables. Germany plans to close all 17 of its nuclear plants by 2022, a process that has already begun. France passed a bill last year mandating that the share of nuclear power in the countrys electricity mix be cut from 75% to 50% within ten years. Meanwhile commodity prices have slumped, resulting in a cut to wholesale electricity prices. That makes it harder for many nuclear plants to cover their running costs, also leading to closures. Where markets are freer, it is harder for nuclear-power operators to make money, and too risky for them to build costly plants from scratch.

Yet as countries try to cut carbon emissions, such closures often lead to the burning of more fossil fuels. Adding renewable-energy capacity does not solve the problem: when the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine, nuclear energy still provides the best low-carbon source of reliable baseload electricity. Thus in Germany the proportion of electricity produced by coal-fired plants has increased since reactors were closed down, so pushing up carbon emissions. Governments should shape energy policies to keep existing reactors running: they provide low-carbon energy, and decommissioning them is as likely to create safety problems as leaving them running. It is reckoned that decommissioning the Fukushima plant will $20 billion, while the clean-up could cost $100 billion.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-12 00:00:00,The Economist,[],"TWO : NIL to the computer. That was the score, as The Economist went to press, in the latest round of the battle between artificial intelligence (AI) and the naturally evolved sort. The field of honour is a Go board in Seoul, South Koreaa country that cedes to no one, least of all its neighbour Japan, the title of most Go-crazy place on the planet. To the chagrin of many Japanese, who think of Go as theirs in the same way that the English think of cricket, the games best player is generally reckoned to be Lee Sedol, a South Korean. But not, perhaps, for much longer. Mr Lee is in the middle of a five-game series with AlphaGo, a computer program written by researchers at DeepMind, an AI software house in London that was bought by Google in 2014. And, though this is not an official championship series, as the scoreline shows, Mr Lee is losing.

Go is an ancient gameinvented, legend has it, by the mythical First Emperor of China, for the instruction of his son. It is played all over East Asia, where it occupies roughly the same position as chess does in the West. It is popular with computer scientists, too. For AI researchers in particular, the idea of cracking Go has become an obsession. Other games have fallen over the yearsmost notably when, in 1997, one of the best chess players in history, Garry Kasparov, lost to a machine called Deep Blue. Modern chess programs are better than any human. But compared with Go, teaching chess to computers is a doddle.

At first sight, this is odd. The rules of Go are simple and minimal. The players are Black and White, each provided with a bowl of stones of the appropriate colour. Black starts. Players take turns to place a stone on any unoccupied intersection of a 19x19 grid of vertical and horizontal lines. The aim is to use the stones to claim territory. In the version being played by Mr Lee and AlphaGo each stone, and each surrounded intersection, is a point towards the final score. Stones surrounded by enemy stones are captured and removed. If an infinite loop of capture and recapture, known as Ko, becomes possible, a player is not allowed to recapture immediately, but must first play elsewhere. Play carries on until neither player wishes to continue.

Go forth and multiply

This simplicity, though, is deceptive. In a truly simple game, like noughts and crosses, every possible outcome, all the way to the end of a game, can be calculated. This brute-force approach means a computer can always work out which move is the best in a given situation. The most complex game to be solved this way is draughts, in which around 10{+2}{+0} (a hundred billion billion) different matches are possible. In 2007, after 18 years of effort, researchers announced that they had come up with a provably optimum strategy.

But a draughts board is only 8x8. A Go boards size means that stones can be placed on it in an enormous number of ways: a rough-and-ready guess gives around 10{+1}{+7}{+0}. Analogies fail when trying to describe such a number. It is nearly a hundred of orders of magnitude more than the number of atoms in the observable universe, which is somewhere in the region of 10{+8}{+0}. Any one of Gos hundreds of turns has about 250 possible legal moves, a number called the branching factor. Choosing any of those will throw up another 250 possible moves, and so on until the game ends. As Demis Hassabis, one of DeepMinds founders, observes, all this means that Go is impervious to attack by mathematical brute force.

But there is more to the games difficulty than that. Though the small board and comparatively restrictive rules of chess mean there are only around 10{+4}{+7} different possible games, and its branching factor is only 35, that does, in practice, mean chess is also unsolvable in the way that draughts has been solved. Instead, chess programs filter their options as they go along, selecting promising-looking moves and reserving their number-crunching prowess for the simulation of the thousands of outcomes that flow from those chosen few. This is possible because chess has some built-in structure that helps a program understand whether or not a given position is a good one. A knight is generally worth more than a pawn, for instance; a queen is worth more than either. (The standard values are three, one and nine respectively.)

Working out who is winning in Go is much harder, says Dr Hassabis. A stones value comes only from its location relative to the other stones on the board, which changes with every move. At the same time, small tactical decisions can have, as every Go player knows, huge strategic consequences later on. There is plenty of structureGo players talk of features such as ladders, walls and false eyesbut these emerge organically from the rules, rather than being prescribed by them.

Since good players routinely beat bad ones, there are plainly strategies for doing well. But even the best players struggle to describe exactly what they are doing, says Miles Brundage, an AI researcher at Arizona State University. Professional Go players talk a lot about general principles, or even intuition, he says, whereas if you talk to professional chess players they can often do a much better job of explaining exactly why they made a specific move. Intuition is all very well. But it is not much use when it comes to the hyper-literal job of programming a computer. Before AlphaGo came along, the best programs played at the level of a skilled amateur.

Go figure

AlphaGo uses some of the same technologies as those older programs. But its big idea is to combine them with new approaches that try to get the computer to develop its own intuition about how to playto discover for itself the rules that human players understand but cannot explain. It does that using a technique called deep learning, which lets computers work out, by repeatedly applying complicated statistics, how to extract general rules from masses of noisy data.

Deep learning requires two things: plenty of processing grunt and plenty of data to learn from. DeepMind trained its machine on a sample of 30m Go positions culled from online servers where amateurs and professionals gather to play. And by having AlphaGo play against another, slightly tweaked version of itself, more training data can be generated quickly.

Those data are fed into two deep-learning algorithms. One, called the policy network, is trained to imitate human play. After watching millions of games, it has learned to extract features, principles and rules of thumb. Its job during a game is to look at the boards state and generate a handful of promising-looking moves for the second algorithm to consider.

This algorithm, called the value network, evaluates how strong a move is. The machine plays out the suggestions of the policy network, making moves and countermoves for the thousands of possible daughter games those suggestions could give rise to. Because Go is so complex, playing all conceivable games through to the end is impossible. Instead, the value network looks at the likely state of the board several moves ahead and compares those states with examples it has seen before. The idea is to find the board state that looks, statistically speaking, most like the sorts of board states that have led to wins in the past. Together, the policy and value networks embody the Go-playing wisdom that human players accumulate over years of practice.

As Mr Brundage points out, brute force has not been banished entirely from DeepMinds approach. Like many deep-learning systems, AlphaGos performance improves, at least up to a point, as more processing power is thrown at it. The version playing against Mr Lee uses 1,920 standard processor chips and 280 special ones developed originally to produce graphics for video gamesa particularly demanding task. At least part of the reason AlphaGo is so far ahead of the competition, says Mr Brundage, is that it runs on this more potent hardware. He also points out that there are still one or two hand-crafted features lurking in the code. These give the machine direct hints about what to do, rather than letting it work things out for itself. Nevertheless, he says, AlphaGos self-taught approach is much closer to the way people play Go than Deep Blues is to the way they play chess.

One reason for the commercial and academic excitement around deep learning is that it has broad applications. The techniques employed in AlphaGo can be used to teach computers to recognise faces, translate between languages, show relevant advertisements to internet users or hunt for subatomic particles in data from atom-smashers. Deep learning is thus a booming business. It powers the increasingly effective image- and voice-recognition abilities of computers, and firms such as Google, Facebook and Baidu are throwing money at it.

Deep learning is also, in Dr Hassabiss view, essential to the quest to build a general artificial intelligencein other words, one that displays the same sort of broad, fluid intelligence as a human being. A previous DeepMind paper, published in 2015, described how a computer had taught itself to play 49 classic Atari videogamesfrom Space Invaders to Breakoutsimply by watching the screen, with no helpful hints (or even basic instructions) from its human overlords. It ended up doing much better than any human player can. (In a nice coincidence, atari is also the name in Go for a stone or group of stones that is in peril of being captured.)

Games offer a convenient way to measure progress towards this general intelligence. Board games such as Go can be ranked in order of mathematical complexity. Video games span a range of difficulties, too. Space Invaders is a simple game, played on a low-resolution screen; for a computer to learn to play a modern video game would require it to interpret a picture much more subtle and complicated than some ugly-looking monsters descending a screen, and in pursuit of much less obvious goals than merely zapping them. One of DeepMinds next objectives, Dr Hassabis says, is to build a machine that can learn to play any game of cards simply by watching videos of humans doing so.

Go tell the Spartans

For now, he reckons, general-purpose machine intelligence remains a long way off. The pattern-recognising abilities of deep-learning algorithms are impressive, but computers still lack many of the mental tools that humans take for granted. A big one is transfer learning, which is what AI researchers call reasoning by analogy. This is the ability to take lessons learned in one domain and apply them to another. And machines like AlphaGo have no goals, and no more awareness of their own existence than does a word processor or a piece of accounting software.

In the short term, though, Dr Hassabis is optimistic. At a kiwon, or Go parlour, in Seoul, the day before the match, the 30 or so players present were almost unanimous in believing that the machine would fall short. Lee is a genius who is constantly creating new moves; what machine can replicate that? asked one. At a pre-match press conference Mr Lee said he was confident he would win 5-0, or perhaps 4-1.

He was, plainly, wrong about that, although it is not over yet. Hes a very good player, said a diplomatic Dr Hassabis before the match. But our internal tests say something different. Even if Mr Lee does manage to pull off an improbable victory, though, humans are unlikely to stay on top for long. As AlphaGos algorithms are tweaked, and as it gathers more data from which to learn, it is only going to get better. Asked whether there was a ceiling to its abilities, Dr Hassabis said he did not know: If there is, we havent found it yet.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Next stop: Brexit?,[],"IT WAS not meant to be like this. The plan had been that David Cameron would return in triumph from Brussels, having won reforms of Britains status in the EU, and throw his full weight behind the campaign to remain in. Most Tory MPs and voters would swing, albeit reluctantly, behind the prime minister. With strong backing from Labour and the Liberal Democrats, and from business and trade unions, the result would be a large majority in the referendum on June 23rd.

It could still happen. Most polls, and even more strongly the bookmakers, put the Remain camp in the lead, though there was little of the hoped-for bounce after Mr Cameron came back from Brussels. Remainers believe that, when the debate is about jobs, they have the edge: this weeks claim by Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, that Brexit was the biggest domestic risk to the economy reinforces that view. Yet the early weeks of the campaign have not gone smoothly.

There have been cock-ups: a pro-EU round-robin from leaders of FTSE-100 companies was signed by only 36; a letter from military bigwigs saying the EU mattered for national security went awry when one signatory said he had not seen it; the ousting of the pro-Brexit boss of the British Chambers of Commerce was blamed on Downing Street. Lord Rose, chairman of Britain Stronger In Europe, the pro-EU campaign, has often seemed ineffectual.

More troubling was the response to Mr Camerons deal. The government had hoped only 80 or so Tory MPs would vote Leave, and it was confident that Michael Gove, the justice secretary, and Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, would not be among them. In fact 140 Tory MPs have now declared for Leave, including Mr Gove and Mr Johnson, more than even the most optimistic in the Leave campaign expected. Local Conservative associations are still heavily Eurosceptic. The partys squabbles over Brexit have also become inextricably linked to speculation about its next leader, since Mr Cameron has said he will not run again in 2020.

The newspapers have also been unexpectedly strident, with even pro-EU titles joining Eurosceptics in rubbishing Mr Camerons deal as not producing a fundamental change in Britains EU relationship. Most have presented the arguments of both sides as finely balanced. The Leave campaign has proved aggressive and well financed. It has skirted past a lack of clarity over alternatives to membership, instead playing up concerns over migration and sovereignty lost to Brussels. It has denounced critics as scaremongers engaged in Project Fear and portrayed those doubting if Britain would do better outside the EU as unpatriotic. The Sun newspaper has even claimed that the queen backs Brexit (untrue, says the palace).

Worse, Mr Cameron has received little help from other parties. The Scottish National Party is for Remain, but will not campaign with the Tories; it knows that a vote for Brexit could be an excuse for another independence referendum. Above all, Labour has been largely silent. Its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, claims to support Remain, but is a long-standing Eurosceptic. He has failed to raise Brexit, the most urgent issue of this parliament, in any recent session of questions to the prime minister.

Alan Johnson, a former cabinet minister who is chairman of Labour in Europe, insists that his group will turn out the voters on the day. But some in the party recall that Labour was badly burnt after it campaigned with the coalition government against Scottish independence in 2014. Like Mr Corbyn, Mr Johnson is unwilling to appear on platforms with Mr Cameron.

There is an underlying weakness in the prime ministers position. Unlike Labours Harold Wilson before the in/out referendum in 1975, he has spent years attacking the EU and suggesting that, without substantial reforms, he would favour Brexit. Yet it is hard even for the prime minister to pretend that the deal he secured in Brussels, however worthwhile, makes a huge difference. Recent government statements have focused almost entirely on the benefits of membership and the dangers of Brexit, not on the terms of the new deal. If the benefits are so clear, some may ask, how could Mr Cameron have ever thought of arguing for leaving?

In graphics: A guide to Brexit from the European Union

A final worry for the Remain campaign is the referendums timing. A date in June was favoured because it gave less time to the Leave campaign, was close to Mr Camerons unexpected election win last May and would come before the summer inrush of migrants to Europe. Yet June may now prove a bad choice. The global economy is stuttering. The euro zone is again weak, with growth slowing sharply in Italy and France, and a renewed dispute over Greeces debts. And far from diminishing in the winter, the EUs migrant and refugee crisis has only grown (see article).

The saving grace for Mr Cameron may lie within the Leave campaigns. Leavers are vulnerable not just to uncertainty over what alternative they would secure, but to their own disagreements. Grassroots Out and Vote Leave, the rivals to be designated as official campaigners, are bitterly divided. The first includes Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party, who has a little-Englander view and would make immigration the main issue. The second includes UKIPs only MP, Douglas Carswell, who prefers a more libertarian, pro-globalisation message. The way the two groupings now pour more vitriol on each other than on their opponents is comically reminiscent of the rival popular fronts to liberate Judaea in the film The Life of Brian.

The odds are still that the vote will be to Remain. The weight of business and union opinion in favour of staying in is likely to tell in the end. A preference among dont-knows for the status quo will help. In talking up Project Fear, the Leave camp may only draw more attention to the dangers of Brexit. But the risk of an opinion-shifting eventterrorist attack, euro crisis, migration meltdownis high. Mr Cameron must sometimes regret the promise of a referendum he made three long years ago.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,A modern martyr,[],"UKRAINIAN historians may yet be grateful to Russias president, Vladimir Putin. His war against the country has given it a rallying cause. He has also provided it with a national hero, a Ukrainian Joan of Arc. She is Nadia Savchenko, a 34-year-old military pilot who served in Iraq. In July 2014 Ms Savchenko was captured by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine, smuggled by Russian security services across the border and put on trial for allegedly directing artillery fire that resulted in the death of two Russian television journalists. Prosecutors are demanding that she be sentenced to 23 years in jail and fined 100,000 roubles ($1,400). The fact that she was captured at least an hour before the journalists were killed did not seem to interest the court.

Ms Savchenkos trial, which has been under way for nearly two years, has also turned into a prosecution of the Russian legal system. She has been made a member of Ukraines parliament and appointed to the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe. Western and Russian intellectuals have signed petitions in her support. John Kerry, Americas secretary of state, called for her immediate release, as did Federica Mogherini, the EUs high representative for foreign policy. She has several admirers among prominent Russian liberals. Not since Soviet times has a case of a political prisoner in Russia caused such furore.

On March 9th Ms Savchenko, who has been held in prison in the small town of Donetsk, in southern Russia, made a closing statement in her trial: I accept neither guilt, nor the verdict, nor the Russian court...I want the whole democratic civilised world to realise that Russia is a third-world country, with a totalitarian regime and a petty tyrant-dictator, where human rights and international law are spat upon. She then leapt onto a bench inside a cage and showed her middle finger to the courts three judges. She finished off by singing the Ukrainian national anthem.

Since her trial began Ms Savchenko has posed a direct challenge to the Kremlin: either it returns her to Ukraine or she dies in jail. Ms Savchenko is not bluffing: she has been on several hunger strikes, including one that lasted 82 days. On March 4th she refused to take water or food and said she would continue her fast until her verdict. But the court said this would not happen until March 21st. On March 10th she agreed to take water.

Ms Savchenko would not have become a martyr if she had not been abducted. She was one of the activists of the Kiev revolution in early 2014. After Russias annexation of Crimea she joined Aidar, one of the most controversial voluntary battalions fighting the separatists in the east of Ukraine. Amnesty International, an NGO, claims that Aidar was involved in several human-rights violations, including abductions and unlawful detentions.

But Ms Savchenko may turn out to pose as much of a threat to the Ukrainian government, which has been mired in corruption scandals and internal squabbling, as she does to the Kremlin. If and when she returns to Ukraine she will be given a heros welcome. She could well turn into a populist leader who could rally the people against the government.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Things are looking app,[],"SAVILE ROW in London is best known for producing some of the worlds finest bespoke suits. But tucked away in a quiet corner of the same street is a firm that gives tailored health advice through a smartphone app. Your.MD uses artificial intelligence to understand natural-language statements such as I have a headache and ask pertinent follow-up questions. The app typifies a new approach to mobile health (also known as m-health): it is intelligent, personalised and gets cleverer as it gleans data from its users.

There are now around 165,000 health-related apps which run on one or other of the two main smartphone operating systems, Apples iOS and Googles Android. PwC, a consulting firm, forecasts that by 2017 such apps will have been downloaded 1.7 billion times. However, the app economy is highly fragmented. Many providers are still small, and most apps are rarely, if ever, used.

That said, the successful ones are highly popular. As apps and wearables become increasingly capable and useful, and smartphones continue their march of dominance, m-health has a promising future. BCC Research, which studies technology-based markets, forecasts that global revenues for m-health will reach $21.5 billion in 2018 (see chart 1), with Europe the largest m-health market.

So far, most smartphone health apps fall squarely into the category of wellness. Along with portable sensors such as the Fitbit wristband, such apps help people to manage and monitor their exercise, diet and stress levels (see chart 2). Other types of app, such as WebMD and iTriage, repackage medical information already found online, and offer information about symptoms and treatments. Some, such as ZocDoc, let users book consultations with doctors.

However, m-health increasingly promises to do more of the heavy lifting in medicine. First, there is a growing range of apps through which users can talk directly to doctors and therapists. These include Teladoc, DoctorOnDemand, HealthTap and Pingmd. Since late 2014 Walgreens, an American pharmacy chain, has been offering an app called MDLive, which provides 24-hour access to a doctor for $49 a consultation. Patients will soon be able to chat with artificial-intelligence health advisers rather like Your.MD, but through messaging apps. Second, and with potentially more far-reaching effects on the quality of care, there is an emerging breed of apps that monitor and diagnose patients with a variety of ailments, in some cases predicting and thus helping to avert health crises.

Cerora, a firm from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, has created a headset, with an associated smartphone app, which monitors brain health. The headset measures brainwaves and tracks eye movement; the app uses the smartphones internal sensors to test patients balance and reaction times. Cerora plans to launch the product this year, subject to review by Americas Food and Drug Administration (FDA); it could help diagnose concussion and other neurodegenerative diseases. Cellscope, of San Francisco, offers a smartphone attachment that lets parents see inside a childs ear, take photos or video, and send them to a doctor.

A small number of patients, mostly the chronically sick, are disproportionately costly in any health-care system. M-health offers a continuous, long-term means of monitoring them, with the potential to improve the way conditions such as cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, asthma and diabetes are managed.

Patients with diabetes constantly have to make decisions on medication, food and activity, says Hooman Hakami of Medtronic Diabetes, a maker of medical devices; and most will go for months between doctors appointments. Medtronic, allied with IBMs Watson, an artificial-intelligence system, is creating an app to predict, three hours in advance, when a patient will experience high or low blood-sugar levels. It will gather data from Medtronics insulin pumps and glucose monitors, worn by the patient, and combine these with information on the users diet, and data from activity trackers. Among other providers of diabetes-related m-health services is Diabetes+Me, whose app is already showing that it can improve patient outcomes while reducing costs. Novartis, a Swiss drugs giant, is set to test a glucose-monitoring contact lens, developed by Google.

Apps on prescription

Constant, wireless-linked monitoring may spare patients much suffering, by spotting incipient signs of their condition deteriorating. It may also spare health providers and insurers many expensive hospital admissions. When Britains National Health Service tested the cost-effectiveness of remote support for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, it found that an electronic tablet paired with sensors measuring vital signs could result in better care and enormous savings, by enabling early intervention. Some m-health products may prove so effective that doctors begin to provide them on prescription.

So far, big drugmakers have been slow to join the m-health revolution, though there are some exceptions. HemMobile by Pfizer, and Beat Bleeds by Baxter, help patients to manage haemophilia. Bayer, the maker of Clarityn, an antihistamine drug, has a popular pollen-forecasting app. GSK, a drug firm with various asthma treatments, offers sufferers the MyAsthma app, to help them manage their condition.

GSK, along with Propeller Health, is developing custom sensors for GSKs Ellipta asthma inhaler, so that the pharma company can gather information on how patients use it. GSK wants to know how well patients comply with instructions on when to take it, and to see how compliance relates to the safety, efficacy and economic benefits of the drug.

All pharmaceutical companies are under pressure from regulators and health insurers to do more to demonstrate the value of their medications, and m-health may be a big help with this. Clinical trials of a proposed new drug will be able to use apps to measure disease progression more accurately, and thus demonstrate the efficacy of the treatment. After a drug is approved and perhaps many thousands of patients are taking it, the use of apps to monitor their condition will constitute a huge trial of the products long-term benefits. However, it could spell disaster for drug firms if such post-approval testing shows that their medicines do not in practice deliver the expected benefits, or shows up undesirable side-effects.

As m-health apps take on more serious work, they will require more serious regulation. Inaccuracy is fairly harmless in a pedometer but less so in a heart-rate monitor. In August a popular product, Instant Blood Pressure, was removed from the Apple app store after serious concerns were raised over its accuracy. In 2011 a developer who claimed his AcneApp could treat pimples with light from an iPhone screen was fined.

Last year the FDA finished drawing up its regulatory regime for m-health, indicating that it will calibrate its approach, paying little attention to low-risk apps, such as ones that just promote a healthy lifestyle; and scrutinising those in areas where any misinformation could be dangerous. This sensible approach may be followed by regulators in other countries.

But other regulatory questions are harder to answer. As health apps become more popular, concerns about how patients data are stored, used and shared will become more pointed. A new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association finds that many health apps may be sharing patients health data without their knowledge. Four-fifths of 211 diabetes apps it examined did not have privacy policies.

Americas rules on the storage and transmission of personal-health data have not been changed since the advent of the iPhone. So doctors and hospitals may be reluctant to embrace health apps until the rules are updated to make it clear they can do so without breaching the stringent standards on data security. And conscientious providers and prescribers of m-health apps risk being tarred by association with any data-misusing rogues that emerge.

The fragmented, nascent m-health market seems likely to consolidate in time, with its most promising startups perhaps being bought by, or entering alliances with, trusted health brands. That would help it to realise its substantial potential to help patients, doctors, health insurers and researchers alike.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Returning the hatchet,[],"THE basement of a petrol station is not an obvious place to display some 6,000 pre-Columbian ceramics. The shelves of the Cassinelli Museum are crammed with feline gods, copulating animals and vessels shaped like human faces. Many were made by the Moche and Chimu cultures, which peopled Perus northern coast for 1,400 years before the arrival of the Incas in the 15th century.

The artefacts are safer here, argued the museums late founder, Jose Luis Cassinelli, than in tombs that dot the desert or beneath the adobe city of Chan Chan. There, they were prey to huaqueros, poor relic-hunters who sold them on to smugglers. Many ended up in American and European private collections. But some were carted off to countries closer to home.

Lately, it has become fashionable to return antiquities to their countries of origin, as Yale University recently did with thousands of items taken from Machu Picchu in Peru. Latin American countries are starting to return artefacts, both ancient and modern, to their neighbours. The motives are often political.

In January, Argentina gave 4,500 artefacts back to Peru and Ecuador, many probably looted by huaqueros from northern Peru. Argentinas former president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who arranged the restitution before she left office, used the occasion to lambast European and American museums for having snatched chunks of Greece and Egypt. Last May, Chile returned 189 pre-Columbian items to Peru and Ecuador.

Some of the returned objects are less ancient but more politically symbolic. Throughout last year, Paraguay and Bolivia exchanged church bells and weapons carried off by one anothers soldiers during the Chaco war of 1932-35. Bolivia hailed one such swap as an indisputable sign of fraternity between historical enemies. Decades ago Brazil returned some of the archives it took from Paraguay in the war of the Triple Alliance of 1864-70. Such gestures are a low-cost way to improve relations, and can pave the way for political and economic deals, says Donna Yates, an expert in antiquities trafficking at the University of Glasgow. Bolivia and Paraguay followed up their swaps by signing agreements to increase economic co-operation.

Holding on to other countries relics can be a sign of continuing tensions. Chile, which has a lingering border dispute with Peru, still has the Huascar, a British-built ironclad captured from Peru during the war of the Pacific of 1879-83.

Although Brazil has returned some documents to Paraguay, Rios Historical Museum still houses the captured ten-tonne Christian cannon. Vicenta Miranda, whose father built a museum to house cannonballs, bullets and other treasures from swampy battlefields around the fortress of Humaita, thinks the unreturned Brazilian archives contain explosive accounts of atrocities committed by Brazilian troops.

Countries such as Peru and Bolivia have reduced the outflow of antique contraband. But few governments have protected the colonial-era art to be found in churches in all but the smallest Andean pueblos. The time of the huaqueros is not yet over, and conservationists like Cassinelli are rare.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Pompeys predicament,[],"ONLY one city in Britain has its own central-government minister. Not London, the capital and economic engine; nor Manchester, the go-ahead centre of the Northern Powerhouse. Instead it is Portsmouth, a south-coast port which is neither wildly successful nor especially poor.

Pompey jumped up the political agenda in November 2013 when BAE Systems, a defence giant, announced that 940 jobs would go at its shipyard in the city. By mid-2014 the last of its shipbuilding operations in Portsmouth had closed, some to be relocated to Glasgow. Since most of BAEs work in Britain is in public-procurement deals, the government took much of the flak for the job losses. It responded with a generous package for the shipyard and its workers, including 100m ($140m) of investment by the Ministry of Defence in the citys naval base. Michael Fallon, a Conservative MP who is now the defence secretary, was appointed the first minister for the city, to knock heads together and get the shipyard moving.

This week, Portsmouths empty shipyard returned to life when BAE began a new contract to maintain anti-mining ships there. Magma Structures, which makes high-tech hulls, is also due to start work there. But its move to the ship hall has been delayed. Theres been no re-emergence of shipbuilding, says Gary Cook of the GMB union. The PM raised expectations that were never going to be met.

Others doubt the worth of the Portsmouth minister, a post now held by Mark Francois. Why have MPs here if you need another minister to lobby on behalf of the city? asks John Ferrett, a Labour councillor. Some see the post as a gesture designed to win Tory votes: Portsmouth South was won by the Conservatives in last years general election after 18 years in the hands of Liberal Democrats; the Tories had taken Portsmouth North from Labour in 2010. The council is Conservative-run, a rarity among Britains Labour-leaning cities.

Yet the governments short-term response to the shipyard redundancies was fairly successful. Of the 940 BAE employees whose jobs disappeared, only 165 were made compulsorily redundant. A little less than one-third were re-employed in other parts of the company, nearly 80% staying in Portsmouth. A maritime task-force was swiftly set up to develop a recovery strategy for the industry.

Portsmouth Naval Base has remained busy. Ship maintenance and servicing, if not traditional shipbuilding, remains at the core of the local economy, since the docks are home to much of Britains surface fleet. From 2017 the city will be home to two aircraft carriers: HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, the largest ships ever built for the Royal Navy. Smaller investments include 4m for a centre for research into unmanned vessels and 2m to move the Royal Marines Museum to the citys dockyard.

A more nuanced criticism is that too little has been done to reduce Portsmouths dependence on the navy. The dockyard has been part of the problem in Portsmouth almost for ever, says Nicholas Phelps, an economic geographer at University College London. Port towns suffer from a sort of resource curse, agrees Andrew Carter of the Centre for Cities, a think-tank. The government has shored up the politically important maritime industries at the expense of diversification. Until that changes, Pompeys prosperity will rise and fall in line with defence spending.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,On the one hand,[],"IT IS a tough time to be a central banker. On March 8th the IMF called for more stimulus globally to see off a lack of demand in the world economy. On the same day economists at the Peterson Institute, a think-tank, issued a report that was labelled a reality check, arguing that fears for the world economy were overblown. (One of the reports authors, Olivier Blanchard, was until last year the IMFs chief economist.) The disagreement reflects conflicting signals that the Federal Reserve must untangle at its next meeting, which begins on March 15th.

When the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter-point in December, after seven years without a change, inflation was still in the doldrums. According to the central banks preferred measure, prices were rising by just 0.5% a year. The Fed raised rates anyway: Janet Yellen, its chair, argued that the fizzing labour market meant inflation must be on the way. Waiting for it to arrive before raising rates might force the Fed to yank them up abruptly later, potentially triggering a recession. Crucially, households inflation expectations had not fallen much, so the Fed could argue that its 2% inflation target remained credible even as it tightened policy.

Since lift-off in December, worries about the global economy have sent stockmarkets sliding. The S&P 500 has fallen by about 5% since then; in the gloomiest moment in February, it was 12% down. But Americas labour market has not been gyrating in the same way. In February the economy created 242,000 jobs, many more than the roughly 100,000 thought to be needed to stop unemployment rising.

What is more, Ms Yellens prediction is beginning to come true. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, was 1.7% in January, its highest level since 2013. The headline measure has risen too, to 1.3%still well below target, but a marked increase nonetheless. Rate-setters are likely to raise their forecasts for core inflation at their meeting this month, according to Zach Pandl of Goldman Sachs.

But not every measure is following Ms Yellens script. According to the University of Michigans survey of consumers, Americans inflation expectations have dipped to 2.5%. Although that is above the Feds target, consumers usually predict inflation that is higher still. Their expectations today are 0.5 percentage points below their long-term average, and as low as they have been since 2010.

Consumers may have only now adapted to a world of cheap fuel and a strong dollar. If so, rising inflation should gradually turn their forecasts around. But measures of inflation expectations in financial marketsusually thought of as more forward-looking than consumershave been depressed for some time. The difference between yields on inflation-protected government bonds and the normal kind points to inflation of just 1.4% over the next five years. (This measure also rallied in the second half of February, having previously dipped below 1%, its lowest level since the crisis.)

Ms Yellen is sceptical of these barometers. The market for inflation-protected bonds is less liquid than before the financial crisis. That means investors might demand a higher return to hold these bonds rather than regular ones, compressing the spread between the two. The inflation-risk premium, which investors demand to insure themselves against very high levels of inflation, may also have come down (this can happen without the mean forecast for inflation changing). It is unlikely, though, that such factors fully account for investors apparent nonchalance about inflation. The swaps market, which suffers less from such problems, points to medium-term inflation of around 1.7%. Markets, it seems, think the likely path of monetary policy is too tight.

Yet Americans continue to spend strongly, as Mr Blanchard and his colleagues point out. Incomes and spending both rose by a robust 0.5% in January. Retail sales are strong.

In December most rate-setters forecast another interest-rate rise at the coming meeting. That now looks very unlikely, thanks to the gloomy global picture. But the Fed may be in the curious position of marking up its inflation forecasts even as it postpones rate rises. The recent financial volatility, which could be a sign of problems to come, justifies the change of heart. But with the domestic economy purring, it would not take much of a climb in the oil price, or a fall in the dollar, to push inflation higher still. Markets expect only one interest-rate rise this year, and only three more rises by the end of 2018. They are probably underestimating.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,A hilly dilemma,[],"AT SIX in the evening, as the streets start to throng with motorcycle taxis taking people home, a senior civil servant in Rwandas ministry of infrastructure sits back at his desk with a large flask of tea. The security officers on the entrance may have already left, but on the second floor officials are settling in for several more hours of work. Glance at their targetsmore than doubling the amount of electricity generated in the country, providing infrastructure in cities to accommodate an urban population twice its current level, and all by 2018and you can see why they are still at their desks. This is a country in a hurry. Twenty-two years since the start of a genocidal civil war that killed about a fifth of the population (and 70% of the minority Tutsis) and saw a third of the survivors fleeing across its borders, Rwanda is still racing to rebuild itself. And the sternest taskmaster is its president, Paul Kagame, who led the rebel forces that ended the genocide and has since shaped the country.

The country he liberated had suffered not just an unimaginable human disaster; it was also left wrecked at the end of the civil war. Soldiers and militias loyal to the genocidal Hutu regime had systematically destroyed power plants and factories as they retreated. Hospitals and universities were devastated, their staff butchered or in exile. We lost a lot of scientists, Gerardine Mukeshimana, the minister of agriculture, says matter-of-factly, when explaining why the country has only limited capacity for agricultural research.

It was also still dangerous, as forces from the former government attacked across the border from bases in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), to the west, killing civilians and soldiers. The hills were alive with the sounds of bazookas, recalls Praveen Moman, a British businessman who runs a string of eco-lodges in the region, of his visits in the late 1990s, years after the war had officially ended. Now visitors get off the plane and think theyve arrived in the Switzerland of Africa.

By almost all social and economic measures Rwanda has proved to be the developing worlds shining star. Income per capita has doubled since 2000 and, unlike most other countries in the region, it has managed to grow quickly while also reducing inequality. One reason is that its Tutsi-dominated government (it would contest this designation, since talk of ethnicity is firmly suppressed) has bucked the trend of many of its neighbours. Instead of crafting policies aimed at benefiting the kin of those in power, many of its resources have gone to improving the lives of the rural poor, who are largely Hutu. The UN Human Development Index shows that Rwanda had improved by more than any other country over the past 25 years.

These achievements are the more impressive since Rwanda is small, hilly, overcrowded and landlocked. Yet with few natural resources other than its fertile soil and a few mines, it has cranked out average growth of 7.5% over the past 10 years.

Much of its success is due to effective government. It has clamped down on corruptionTransparency international, a Berlin-based organisation, ranks it as the fourth-least corrupt country in Africa, and well above places such as Greece and Italy. It is also because its government is both disciplined and technocratic. Officials and ministers are expected to work hard and are held accountable through performance contracts that extend right down to local mayors and other community leaders. Those who fail to meet targets (or who fiddle the numbers) are swiftly fired.

A third reason is that it has embraced economic policies that are friendly to investment, growth and trade with great vigour; it is rated by the World Bank as the easiest place in continental Africa to do business. Many of its policies read as if they could have been written by the IMF, or this newspaper. Take power, for instance. Instead of trying to boost supply by pouring money into a state-owned utility it has encouraged private investment. That has spurred a wave of projects including extracting gas from Lake Kivu (see article). Rwanda is an absolute pleasure to do business in compared with a lot of other countries in Africa, says Paul Hinks, the CEO of Symbion Power, an American firm that is building one of them.

Because of its relatively competent administrators and its commitment to the poor it has become the darling of Western governments and NGOs. More than a third of government revenues (and a tenth of GDP) come from aid. The fecund soils of its green capital, Kigali, sprout aid-agency offices like grass after the rains.

The downside

Yet those pouring money into Rwanda are confronted by a dilemma. As much as Rwanda has progressed on the economic front, its record is badly blotted when it comes to human rights. Domestic opponents of Mr Kagame have a nasty habit of getting locked up or being murdered, even once they have fled into exile.

Another stain was Rwandas destabilisation of the DRC in the late 1990s after Rwandan troops invaded to stop cross-border raids by forces of the former government. The subsequent violence led to more than 5m deaths and contributed to the disintegration of the DRC. Fear of Mr Kagame runs so deep that in Kigalis drinking holes people glance left and right, and drop their voices to a whisper, when venturing an opinion on him. With almost no opposition, and no obvious successor, Mr Kagame recently won an overwhelming mandate for changes to the constitution that will allow him to run for a third term in office in 2017 (and two more after that, potentially leaving him in power until 2034, when he will be only 76).

The dilemma facing the West is whether to keep giving money to an authoritarian government with such scant regard for human rights and little more than the trappings of democracy. A consensus among aid and development workers in Kigali seems to be that it should; for in few other countries does assistance go so effectively to helping the poor. A broader conundrum facing the countrys benefactors is whether they ought to press Mr Kagame not to run in 2017. Yet aside from limp statements of disapproval (America said it was disappointed by his decision) from a few countries, many diplomats privately question whether anyone else could hold the country together. They point to its neighbour, Burundi, which is falling towards a civil war that is already being marked by ethnic killings. Without Mr Kagames firm hand, they argue, the miracle wrought in Rwanda could quickly be reversed.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,The shredding of Tony Blair,[],"Broken Vows: Tony Blair: The Tragedy of Power. By Tom Bower. Faber & Faber; 653 pages; 20.

IT IS a measure of how far Tony Blairs stock has fallen that he has attracted the unwelcome attention of Tom Bower. Usually Mr Bower takes aim at controversial businessmen, such as Robert Maxwell, Mohamed al-Fayed, Conrad Black, Bernie Ecclestone, Simon Cowell and (twice) Richard Branson. A diligent cuttings job and interviews with anyone with dirt to dish or an axe to grind provide the material to shred a chaps reputation.

The charge sheet against the former prime minister is predictably devastating. He was a fraud whose communications skills obscured a paucity of accomplishment during a decade in office. He deceived voters: over Britains involvement in two wars and by presiding over an undeclared open-door immigration policy. Distrustful of the competence of cabinet colleagues, unwilling to resolve the dysfunctional relationship with Gordon Brown and sceptical of the modernising commitment of senior civil servants, his approach to the exercise of power became destructive of the very fabric of government. His second career as a highly remunerated globe-trotting political consultant, often to some pretty dodgy regimes, has done nothing for his reputation.

The attack is relentless. Much of the evidence supporting Mr Bowers narrative of a gifted but shallow politician who over-promised and under-delivered appears, at first sight, compelling. However, there is early on a warning about just how unbalanced this account is. Few would disagree that one of Mr Blairs signal achievements was the Good Friday Agreement that brought an end to 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland. Yet it merits only one rather barbed paragraph.

Mr Blairs first term certainly lacked any guiding idea about how underperforming public services should be improved other than by spending more money. His losing gamble on the outcome of the Iraq war also drained the prime minister of political capital. Without it, pushing through a reform agenda that was at odds with the ideological prejudices of most of his own party and which Mr Brown, as chancellor in control of the purse strings, was determined to undermine (for personal as much as political reasons) was uphill work.

Where Mr Bower gets it wrong, however, is in casting Mr Blair as a feckless flibbertigibbet incapable of the serious analysis required to think through and implement complex policies. In the second half of his term of office, Mr Blair had a very clear idea of what needed to be done. There was no doubting his intellectual conversion to the role that market discipline could play in improving public services, nor his command of intricate policy detail. But there were only a handful of people who could help him realise his goals. All too often, when faced with Mr Browns intransigence, he failed to stand by them.

On Iraq, Mr Bower does his best to suggest that Mr Blair was guilty of an act of deliberate deception in sending Britain to war. He fails to come up with anything fresh. Too much weight was indeed given to patchy intelligence about weapons of mass destruction. But there is no doubt that Mr Blair believed in it and thought it right to act on it. When the long-awaited Chilcot report is finally published, it will interest historians, but it will not satisfy those who say Mr Blair is a war criminal.

Mr Bower is on firmer ground when it comes to Mr Blairs life since leaving Number 10. Copying Bill Clinton, Mr Blair has combined lucrative political consulting and business networking with running philanthropic foundations: one aims to spread good governance in Africa, another advocates religious tolerance. In theory, the consulting is meant to provide funds for the philanthropy. But the latter often provides moneymaking openings for the former, Mr Bower alleges.

Mr Blairs acquisition of considerable wealth since leaving office has contributed as much to his subsequent vilification as the residual bitterness over Iraq. But his governments were far from being the unmitigated disaster Mr Bower describes. Had they been, voters would not twice have re-elected him. The author never tries to see things from his subjects point of view. Nor does he consider the often adverse political context in which Mr Blair was operating. The result is a shrill and misleading account. Readers deserve a fairer and more serious book about this important political figure.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,"Not gloating, but fretting",[],"FOR many in Asia, resentful of the constant lecturing about the superiority, nay, the historical inevitability, of Western forms of government, it must seem like vindication. The European Union, which once held itself up as a model of regional integration and shared sovereignty, faces stagnation, uncontrollable migration, the rise of xenophobic political movements and a British referendum on whether to leave the union. As for America, its government is often gridlocked thanks to partisan animosity, while the campaign for Novembers presidential election has plumbed depths of personal abuse, mendacity and barely disguised racism and sexism. Small wonder that a commentary published by Chinas official news agency to celebrate the current sessions of that countrys toothless parliament and its gumless consultative body should lament that many Western countries are split by elitism and populism, smirking that Chinas unique check and balance system could teach them a thing or two.

Other Chinese commentators have taken wry pleasure in the discomfort within Americas political establishment over the emergence of Donald Trump, a self-promoting tycoon with flexible but mostly obnoxious ideas, as the leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination. If this is what Western democracy produces, the logic runs, maybe Chinas illiberal form of self-proclaimed meritocracy is not so bad. Or conversely: what is wrong with Donald Trump? Curiously, he seems to have many fans in Chinas cordoned-off sector of cyberspace. Writing in the Diplomat, an online journal, Dingding Chen of the University of Macau reports that many Chinese netizens like his brash, outsider image and his questioning of Americas military alliances with Japan and South Korea. Some even think that, as a dealmaker, China might negotiate with him more easily than with Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, who has a habit of talking about human rights (as long ago as 1995 she riled her hosts with a fiery speech at a UN womens conference in Beijing). China also blames her for, as secretary of state, firmly asserting Americas interest in the disputed South China Sea in 2010.

As for the EUs travails, they might be expected to provoke some Schadenfreude among the ten members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Asias most far-reaching attempt at regional integration, ASEAN is nonetheless often criticised for its failure to go further. Sure enough, Munir Majid, a leading Malaysian intellectual and banker, has observed some self-satisfaction within the club that the ASEAN Way does not envisage ever-closer unionin other words the group is spared some of the stresses afflicting the EU. Yet he notes that ASEAN suffers its own strains over the pace and direction of integration. It cannot afford to be smug at the faltering of the European project.

Nor for that matter is ASEAN really in a position to criticise Europe for its difficulties in tackling unprecedented waves of distressed refugees and migrants. ASEAN members have struggled to cope with far smaller numbers of boat people from the Muslim Rohingya minority fleeing Myanmar. And its solution to the question of labour mobility between ASEAN states is basically not to allow it at all, except for a few skilled professionals.

As with the EUs predicament, Americas election campaign may provoke some Asian gloating, along with amusement, bafflement and disgust. A more pervasive emotion, however, is worry. In California last month at a summit Barack Obama held with ASEAN leaders, Singapores prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, noted that the election was being followed with concern. The most obvious worry is the possibility of a President Trump. Asians can only assume that most of his threats and promises would splinter when they collided with the reality of office. But it would still be alarming to see him win. He has said he wants to slap punitive tariffs on Chinese imports (risking a trade war); renegotiate defence treaties that have underpinned regional security for decades; and curb immigration, including banning Muslims from entering America. Most of the worlds Muslims live in Asia.

Whoever wins, however, Asia may miss Mr Obama. The California summit capped his hallmark foreign policy, Americas so-called pivot or rebalancing to Asia. None of those vying to succeed him has such a personal stake in American policy in Asianot even Mrs Clinton, who, at the state department, was present at the creation of the pivot. Indeed, she has turned against one of its most important aspectsthe negotiation, pending ratification, of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a free-trade area including America, Japan and ten other Pacific Rim countries. In fact not one of the leading presidential candidates likes the TPP. Free-trade agreements are electoral poison. Its proponents insist TPP will be ratified but they have trouble explaining how. By a lame-duck Republican-majority Congress right after the election? Under Mrs Clinton as president, after a cosmetic renegotiation?

Three no-trumps

The same forces roiling American and European politics are also present in most of Asia: internal ethnic and communal tensions; protectionist fears about globalisation and job losses; and angry, assertive nationalism. Indias prime minister, Narendra Modi, seems unwilling or unable to control the extreme Hindu-nationalist wing of his own party; Shinzo Abe in Japan is similarly loth to distance himself definitively from his partys right-wing historical revisionists; Chinas Xi Jinping is encouraging a resurgence of national pride which can take ugly, xenophobic forms. All three play variations of Mr Trumps rallying cry: Make our country great again! The rise of nationalism at a time of economic gloom and geostrategic uncertainty is alarming for the regions security. Europe, preoccupied with its own problems, has long forsaken any serious role in Asia. Now some Asians worry that America, needed more than ever to balance China and ensure the long peace, will start looking the other way.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,The Economist,[],"ASSANE GUEYE, a Senegalese-born postdoctoral researcher at Americas National Institute of Standards and Technology, is a student of systems. He studies the multiple networks of communications that hold cities together, and feels that a new scientific discipline is needed to describe these systems of systems. He hopes to create one.

Amanda Weltman, a physicist at the University of Cape Town, seeks nuance in the laws of gravity. She suspects there is an undiscovered particle that links gravitational attraction with natures other forces, and is planning an experiment that uses a special satellite to try to track it down.

Tolu Oni, an epidemiologist also at Cape Town, and Evelyn Gitau, an immunologist at the Kenya Medical Research Institute, both know that the seriousness of the illnesses they are trying to beatAIDS, malaria and tuberculosiscan be amplified or diminished by patients circumstances, but they do not understand the details. Both have the same problem, managing large data sets. But until this week, they had never met.

These four scientists are among 15 fellows who, together with 800 other academics, business folk and politicians (including the presidents of Senegal and Rwanda), are gathered at the Next Einstein Forum, being held this week in Dakar in Senegal. Next Einstein, the brainchild of Thierry Zomahoun, a Beninois administrator, is an attempt to scale up African science. At the moment, most African scientists work either in isolation or abroad. They do not know one another and are invisible to prospective colleagues. Visas for collaborative work are hard to come by and even flying from one part of Africa to another may require going via a non-African hub, such as Dubai. Next Einstein is an attempt to overcome this fragmentation, by providing a continental congress at which African scientists can meet.

The forum has grown out of the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), of which Mr Zomahoun is president. AIMS is a graduate school with branches in Cameroon, Ghana, Tanzania and South Africa, as well as in Senegal. It was founded in 2003 by Neil Turok, a South African who now directs the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. In a sense, Dr Turoks situation is an example of the problems Next Einstein is trying to overcome, for the Perimeter is based in Canada, and so he now lives in Ontario.

AIMS concentrates on maths for two reasons. First, being a subject that requires little equipment beyond students brains, it is cheap to teach. Second, when Dr Turok was asking fellow African researchers which subjects would be most pertinent to the continental scientific Renaissance he hoped to trigger, most agreed that maths, which is fundamental to the rest of science, was the one to go for.

The Senegalese campus, built on a beach-front an hours drive south of Dakar, is a place where up to 80 graduate students (who pay no fees for the privilege, the institute being funded by government grants and commercial sponsors) can sit for a year at the feet of visiting academics from Africa and elsewhere. These visitors come for three-week stints to lecture in subjects such as cryptography, finance and quantum mechanics. Students are thus exposed to a wide variety of ideas during their stay.

Whether Next Einstein, which plans to meet every two years, will be able to build on AIMS and create for African scientists the sorts of opportunities that those in the rich world take for granted remains to be seen. But, as Mr Zomahoun observes, 40% of the worlds children are African. Statistically, therefore, the chances that the next Einstein will come from Africa are good. This weeks meeting in Dakar is at least a step on the road to making those odds more than just theoretical.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Lets go together,[],"RIYADH, the Saudi capital, is no easy place to navigate. It sprawls over 1,500 square kilometres (580 square miles) and, but for a few exceptions, its drab, low-rise buildings all look much the same. For most of the year it is far too hot and dusty to walk anywhere. Little wonder the kingdom is touting a new 85-station metro, which is due to open in 2018, as a revolution for the city (it is expected that women will travel in separate carriages).

Public-transport systems are in vogue across the region. Doha, the capital of tiny Qatar, will open its metro a year after Saudi Arabia. Oman is building railways. And it is not just the Gulf: Algeria is also constructing railways. Morocco is interested in trams. Lebanon is looking into a rapid bus systema bus and metro hybrid with its own lanesfor the areas around Beirut.

This trend is relatively new. Many Middle Eastern countries started to invest in buses only around a decade ago, but public networks are still limited; private minibuses abound. Dubai was the first place to operate a mass transit system when it opened its metro in 2009. In the few countries with railways, they are often out of use. Instead, governments have tended to build new roads. Amman and Beirut have no transport other than buses. Metro systems in Cairo and Tehran have failed to keep pace with urban expansion. Mostly, public transport in the region remains really very bad, says Ziad Nakat of the World Bank.

Demand for ways to get around has grown rapidly since the 1970s. Populations have exploded. The region is one of the most urbanised in the world: some 60% of Middle Eastern people live in cities. Poor urban planning means towns often sprawl in every direction. Greater Cairo boasts a population of some 20m people.

The lack of good public transport, coupled with rising incomes in some places, has pushed up the use of cars. Pew, an American research outfit, reckons 81% of Lebanese households have a car, not far off Americas 88%. Between 2012 and 2022, car ownership in the region is set to grow more quickly than any other, according to Carmudi, a car classifieds site. Meanwhile in poorer countries, such as Egypt, where cars are beyond measly pay packets, people struggle to get from A to B. Donkeys and carts endure. Tuk-tuks ply the streets in shanty towns and rural areas. People hang out of minibuses or are forced to squash up, faces against windows.

The ensuing mess makes for nasty air and grumpy people, not to mention some of the worlds highest rates of road fatalities. A World Bank study estimated (conservatively) that 4% of Egypts GDP was lost each year because of time wasted in traffic in Cairo, its capital and the Arab worlds megacity. Part of the reason is that tailbacks encourage people to move into cities rather than commute. This adds to the stresses on cities already struggling to provide services to their people, such as Beirut, whose 2m inhabitants do not receive 24-hour power and water.

The old solution of simply building more roads is unsustainable. For one thing, land has become too expensive to tarmac over. But shiny buses and trainsone of Riyadhs stations is being designed by the architect Zaha Hadidwill not be enough on their own, either. People must be tempted to get out of the cool comfort of their car. Many governments, from Egypt to Iran, have started to remove fuel subsidies, causing the price of petrol to rise. But it is still only 20 cents per litre in Kuwait, compared with $1.40 in Britain. Road tolls, which exist in Dubai, and higher parking charges are needed across the region.

The biggest barrier to public transport, though, is the expense. Metros can cost millions of dollars per kilometre of track. At a time of low oil prices, even the oil-producing states are cutting back. The United Arab Emirates has stopped tenders for the second part of Etihad, a new 1,200km national railway that is costing 40 billion dirhams ($11 billion). But a day navigating Cairos roads is enough to show that inaction now will lead to higher costs in the future.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,A Nordic pyramid,[],"SWEDEN is a progressive place. Women participate fully in the workforce. Companies are transparent, generally uncorrupt and often globally minded. Enthusiasm for technology helps Stockholm flourish as a lively startup centre for gaming, music and fintech firms. Business leaders earnestly talk of the benefits of going green, caring for workers and being ethical. In politics, Sweden is egalitarian, redistributing wealth through high taxes. So it is a puzzle that Swedish capitalism appears so strikingly unequal, with a small number of individuals owning and running large chunks of the economy.

Credit Suisse, in its annual report on global wealth in October, pointed to findings that the richest 1% of Swedish households control 24% of the populations total wealth, making it only a bit less unequal than India (25.7%). In contrast, Spains 1% control 16.5% of the wealth, and Japans only 4.3%. As in many countries, family-controlled businesses are the norm in Sweden. But as Randall Morck of the University of Alberta in Canada has noted, Sweden is an extreme case among rich countries in that one particular family, the Wallenbergs, holds such sway in business.

The foundations were laid for the dynastys fortunes 160 years ago when Andre Oscar Wallenberg, the globe-trotting son of a Lutheran bishop, returned from America with a book on how to set up a bank, and founded Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB). The bank flourished, and began buying chunks of distressed industrial firms, leading the family to set up a holding company, Investor, 100 years ago.

At the height of the Wallenbergs pre-eminence, in the 1970s, their various firms together employed 40% of Swedens industrial workforce and represented 40% of the total worth of the Stockholm stockmarket. Like most modern manufacturers, the industrial firms in their portfolio, including ABB and Atlas Copco (engineering), AstraZeneca (drugs) and Electrolux (appliances), are no longer huge employers. But Investor, plus SEB and the other listed firms in Investors portfolio, still account for about a third of the stockmarkets value. And they generally do better than the rest: in the past decade, Investors shares have doubled, whereas the OMX Stockholm 30 Index rose by just 40%.

Swedes often talk about the collection of companies as Wallenbergsfaren, the Wallenberg sphere, and to its smaller local rivals as systems. One of the largest systems is Industrivarden, whose portfolio includes Handelsbanken and the maker of Volvo Trucks. It has passed through several hands down the years, including those of Ingvar Kamprad, the founder of the IKEA furniture stores; its leading investor nowadays is Fredrik Lundberg, the son of a construction magnate. The Wallenbergs and Industrivarden both have large stakes in Ericsson, a maker of telecoms equipment.

Many Wallenberg firms have roots in the 19th century, before Investor was founded. But they have generally flourished under the active ownership and close managerial oversight of the family. The sphere is now overseen by a genial triad of middle-aged men, two brothers and a cousin: Jacob, Peter and Marcus Wallenberg (pictured, next page). A transition to a sixth generation of the family is looming, with the next set of leaders to be drawn from a pool of around 30 relatives in their 30s or younger. A hitherto male-dominated empire is then likely to have some Wallenberg women right at the top. Already, Caroline Ankarcrona, younger sister to Marcus Wallenberg and in her late 40s, has been running the main family foundation, KAW, for four years.

Sphere is one way of describing the Wallenberg holdings. A more pointed term (literally as well as figuratively) is the one Mr Morck uses: a pyramid. The Wallenbergs are thought to have combined personal wealth of just $1 billion or so, but they control, or have strong influence over, businesses worth hundreds of times as much.

They do so through a number of foundations. KAW, the largest, is named after two ancestors who provided the largest endowment, 99 years ago. KAW has 50.1% of voting rights in Investor, chaired by Jacob Wallenberg. It in turn holds stakesand often outsized voting rightsin their main, listed firms, at which family members often take leadership roles. (Through a division called Patricia Industries, Investor holds majority stakes in financial, telecoms and other firms, and is also a founder-investor in a private-equity fund, EQT.)

Fear of tunnelling

These successive layers let the Wallenbergs multiply their clout. Investor has beaten the Stockholm market handsomely, but its listed businesses often trade at a discount to their global peers, points out Thomas Zellweger, who directs a centre studying business families in St Gallen, Switzerland. Outside investors may be discounting the shares out of fear of tunnelling, in which a controlling family uses one firm to prop up anotherthough Mr Morck notes that there is scant evidence of this.

Shareholders may also fear a controlling family pursuing its private obsessions, while neglecting the business: an early Wallenberg, for instance, campaigned assiduously for a single global currency, based on gold and the French franc. They may also worry that the next generation of Wallenberg bosses are chosen for internal family reasons rather than on merit. The Wallenbergs have managed their successions well over the years, but there is no guarantee this will always be so.

The Wallenberg empire might in theory be threatened if, as in other countries, there were moves towards curbing the use of the dual-class shares that let the family exercise such sway over its firms. In Ericsson, for example, Investor has just 5.3% of total stock, but controls 21.5% of votes. In Electrolux, Investor has 15.5% of the stock, but 30% of voting rights. Family firms often use such dual shares (The Economist Group, largely owned by European business families, uses them too), but prevalence does not mean popularity. However, the family has long enjoyed good political connections: for all its support for free trade and open markets abroad, until the 1990s it had decades of help from protectionist policies that kept foreign predators at bay.

That the KAW and other foundations get the Wallenbergs share of profits helps shield them from Swedens top income-tax rate, of 62%. The foundations beneficence also helps shield them from criticism: the KAW, for instance, makes $250m of grants a year, notably to fund basic research and education.

Nordic, not Anglo-Saxon

Discuss their set-up with the Wallenbergs and they say Anglo-Saxons, schooled in British and American ideas that companies are best owned by masses of small investors (or pension funds), are wilfully blind to the benefits of family-dominated firms. The family argues that ownership models need not be black and white, that theirs has proved it can deliver a nice track record for more than a century-and-a-half. Well-run family firms can ensure modern virtuestransparency, professional management, clear communication, agilityas easily as those Anglo-Saxons.

Tour the headquarters of Ericsson, and its CEO, Hans Vestberg, offers a similar argument: a stolid company, founded in 1876 (and part-owned by the Wallenbergs since 1950), can be nimble, even ruthless. Ericsson frittered away the strong position it once had as a maker of mobile handsets. But Mr Vestberg talks optimistically of how it will prosper from the coming launch of fifth-generation (5G) wireless telecoms and the internet of things. Ericsson, with a $5 billion annual research-and-development budget, files 4,000 patents a year, he says. In less than two years it has hired 30,000 staff, but also let go 28,000, to make possible a shift from a company that sells products to one more focused on services.

Gunnar Wetterberg, author of a book on the Wallenberg family, argues that having most of its wealth locked up in the foundations best explains its long-term success: family feuds are discouraged when no relative can dream of running off to Bahamas with all the loot. There are no family fights, says one Wallenberg. No one understands how it works, but it works well.

Other observers prefer explanations that focus on the personality and skills of a mostly self-effacing, hard-working and polyglot clan. Their spells working in the companies make them better owners. Carina Beckerman, who has just written a book on culture and leadership in Wallenberg companies, lauds two qualities that help encourage success. One is doggedness: the Wallenbergs found few firms, but they stick with existing ones, seek new markets and try ways to make them flourish. She notes that Atlas Copco had to be rescued from near-bankruptcy three times in its first 27 years, but now flourishes.

The second quality, says Ms Beckerman, is a near-obsession with getting the right managers in place: it is often the top item on the agenda whenever the Wallenberg leaders gather. They typically favour loyal insiders, not show-offs who promise dramatic change.

Not everything the family touches turns to gold. Efforts to go digital, just over a decade ago, by investing in a pair of online firms, Spray Networks and Bredbandsbolaget, had disappointing outcomes. Scania, a lorry-maker that has flourished since being bought by Volkswagen in 2000, was sold too cheaply, says Ms Beckerman.

But the spheres more recent efforts to expand its medical interests have been more successfulwitness its investments in Sobi, which specialises in treatments for haemophilia and other rare diseases, and in Molnlycke Health Care, which makes products for use in surgery and treating wounds. Even if its dominance of the Swedish business scene has diminished in recent decades, the Wallenberg sphere looks set to go on prospering in the hands of its sixth generation.

That makes them mere parvenus compared with the Lovenskiold family across the border in Norway: now led by its 13th generation, it claims a 360-year history and runs successful timber and furniture firms. But there may be a shared recipe for such longevity. The majority of the really successful, long-lasting families are, like the Wallenbergs, convivial, modest, see the hard work needed and do it quietly, says a close observer. If they were a bunch of work-shy show-offs, Swedes would surely have noticed the inequality by now.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Smartening up,[],"EVEN fans of the Five Star Movement, an Italian political group often described as populist, maverick and anti-establishment, would never have credited it with slickness. So when the campaign video for Virginia Raggi, a 37-year-old running for mayor of Rome as the Five Star candidate, appeared online in late February, it came as a shock. Mute the soundtrack on Ms Raggis video, in which she declares that we can again be a world city, and her sharp suit and on-message presentation might be those of an aspiring Democratic congresswoman in America or Tory politician in Britain. A talented debater, Ms Raggi illustrates how Italys second-biggest political group is increasingly coming to resemble a normal party.

Polls are continuing to give the Five Star Movement a quarter of the electorate: about eight percentage points behind the governing centre-left Democratic Party (PD), but ten percentage points ahead of the right-wing Northern League. In Rome, a city that has long suffered from neglect and corruption at the hands of mainstream parties, Ms Raggi stands a fair chance of success when the vote is held, most likely in June. That she should have a video ready before her rivals hints at both the importance the Five Star Movement attaches to her campaign, and to its growing professionalism.

The enduring popularity of the group is all the more remarkable in view of recent setbacks and upheavals. In different ways, it is the most and least democratic of Italian political movements. Disdainful of conventional democracy, its leaders believe the internet offers a chance to return to an Athenian-style, direct democracy in which every major political issue would be submitted to an online referendum. Within the movement, online ballots are used to set policy and select candidates (and also to expel elected representatives who fail to abide by its strict rules).

But the really big decisions, over whether or not Italy should stay in the eurozone and the like, have always been taken by its two unelected co-founders: Beppe Grillo, a satirical comedian, and Gianroberto Casaleggio, a political activist and entrepreneur.

Although since last year Mr Grillo has started to concentrate more on his stage career, his influence is still decisive. Last month, as the Senate debated a bill to legalise civil unions, including same-sex partnerships, Mr Grillo unexpectedly announced he would give Five Star Movement senators a free vote on a clause that would allow gay partners to adopt each others biological offspring. Many Catholics and conservatives feared the provision would encourage surrogate births. The Movement subsequently withdrew its support for a motion that would have allowed the clause to go through unchallenged. That wrong-footed the PD, which had assumed the movement would not antagonise gay people. The PD had to turn to the centre-right for support. The measure went through without its contentious clause.

Commentators accused Mr Grillo of cynically pitching for right-wing votes in preparation for the election in Rome. But Mr Casaleggio said the decision was partly due to different sensibilities in the Movement. It is far less radical than Greeces Syriza government or Spains Podemos. United by a loathing for Italys tainted mainstream parties, Five Star activists are a heterogeneous bunch, often disagreeing on issues such as privatisation or abortion. Most are progressive, some distinctly conservative. Mr Grillo is critical of the euro and happy to hobnob with Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party, which is trying to get Britain out of the EU. If it is to become a mainstream party of government, such differences will need to be settled.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Not so special,[],"WERE Angel Rosabal Valdivia not Cuban, he might now be languishing in an immigration cell. In early March the 31-year-old computer technician crossed a bridge over the Rio Grande between Mexico and Texas without a visa and presented himself to border guards. Because Mr Rosabal is Cuban, he was swiftly granted leave to remain. Under a series of laws dating back to the cold war, notably the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, most arrivals from his island are welcomed as if they are political refugees, then granted permanent residency after a year and a day.

Lexington met Mr Rosabal in Miami on March 7th in the offices of Church World Service (CWS), a refugee-assistance ministry. He was one of a throng of new arrivals being processed into the Cuban-Haitian Entrant Programme, under a 1980 law that makes Cubans instantly eligible for public assistance that most immigrants wait years to receive. Fresh-faced, and proudly sporting a watch that he had refused to give to people-smugglers during a ten-month trek to America via Ecuador, Colombia, Panama and Mexico, Mr Rosabal said the journey cost him $3,000. He was robbed twiceColombia is so bad, he shuddered. Drawing on government grants and private fundraising, CWS (run by a coalition of Protestant and Orthodox churches) was about to put him up in a hotel and help him apply for a work permit. Within a week the ministry would fly him to one of six cities where it works with churches and employers to resettle new arrivals, from Lancaster, Pennsylvania to Louisville, Kentucky. After six months, 90% of CWSs resettled Cuban clients are self-sufficient. Mr Rosabal was told that within a fortnight he can expect to be working, perhaps in a hotel or egg-packing plant. He looked cheerful but a little dazed, after arriving at dawn on a minibus from Texas. He had been in Florida seven hours.

During his trek, other Latin Americans often asked Mr Rosabal why America offers special privileges to Cubans. Mr Rosabal would reply that back home with two jobsworking with computers by day and as a security guard by nighthe earned $62 a month. Venezuelan or Colombian companions would gasp, asking: How can you survive? But Mr Rosabal misjudges his new American homeland. The special status of Cubans owes more to politics than to pity, and the politics is changing fast.

Cuban-Americans have long enjoyed outsize clout, thanks in part to their concentration in Florida, a presidential battleground state. But the Cuban-American vote is evolving. Once, conservative exiles could halt Miami traffic with vast anti-Castro protests. Now their grandchildren are more likely to support lifting the embargo imposed on the island 55 years ago.

When Republicans hold a presidential primary in Florida on March 15th, two of the four candidates will be Cuban-American senators, an astonishing feat for a community of about 2m people, or 0.6% of the national population. Both are supporters of the embargo. One of them, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, introduced a bill in January that would end welfare payments and public assistance for Cuban arrivals unless they can prove that they faced political persecution back homethough he stopped short of suggesting changes to the entry privileges in the Cuban Adjustment Act. Campaigning in snowy New Hampshire, Mr Rubio cited reports of outrageous abuse, such as Cubans who claim American pensions while living on the island. His bill matches one introduced in the House of Representatives by Carlos Curbelo, a Miami-area Republican, who scolds what he calls non-refugee Cubans for abusing American goodwill. The longest-serving Cuban-American in Congress, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Miami, said late last year that it wouldnt break my heart if the Cuban Adjustment Act itself were repealed.

Cubans sense the changes. Arrivals from the island have surged since December 2014, when President Barack Obama announced his plans to restore many diplomatic and economic ties. More than 43,000 Cubans applied for entry to America in 2015, a 78% increase on the previous year, some after perilous sea-crossings. Republicans blame Mr Obama. Ahead of his visit to Cuba on March 21st and 22nd, the first by a sitting president since 1928, Cuban-American members of Congress accused him of triggering desperation among Cubans with his policy of unconditional engagement with the Castro dictatorship.

Openness v isolation

Democrats blame Republicans for stoking fears on the island that the Cuba Adjustment Act will be scrapped. Annette Taddeo, a (Colombian-American) Democrat running for Mr Curbelos House district, accuses her Republican opponent of playing on resentments within their heavily Hispanic corner of south Florida. The electoral calculation is to divide Cubans from non-Cubans, and older exiles from newer arrivals, she charges. Ms Taddeo would preserve Cuban entry privileges until a broader immigration reform is achieved: a tough call in a year when voters are tingling at talk of border walls.

At root, todays fights about Cuban migration turn on old arguments about whether the island is best liberated by openness or isolation. Bruno Barreiro is the Miami-Dade county commissioner for Little Havana, a bastion of anti-Castro fervour. He says the Cuban Adjustment Act was a mistake: if Cubans had been bottled up on the island, they would have exploded long ago. The act saved lots of lives, Mr Barreiro concedes: Unfortunately, it also permitted the Castro regime to stay in place. Not every anti-Castro politician goes that far, though the logic of isolation underpins politicians growling about Cuban-Americans showing disloyalty by returning to the island to visit their families.

In the end, the only sustainable Cuban immigration policy involves a free and prosperous island, 90 miles off Florida. Cubans entry privileges may be a relic of the cold war. But so is the failed embargo. Scrap both at the same time, and bet on openness.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,A family affair,[],"FOR decades political instability, a boom-and-bust economy and endemic corruption earned the Philippines the moniker of the sick man of Asia. But during the six years that Benigno Aquino has been president the countrys prospects have markedly improved. The economy has zipped along at an average growth rate of 6% a year, while foreign investment has more than tripled, with manufacturing, agribusiness and call centres all showing particular strength. Mr Aquino, whose family, huge landowners, is not short of a bob, has made a stand against corruption, and his approval ratings are high. But presidents may serve only one term, and an election for his successor takes place on May 9th. The question is whether Mr Aquinos successor can keep the Philippines on the upswing. Five presidential candidates want to have a go.

In America, a vice-president might present himself as the candidate for continuity. But in the Philippines voters elect the vice-president separately, and Mr Aquino has long been at odds with his number two, Jejomar Binay, now a leading prospect to replace him. Until 2010 Mr Binay was mayor of Makati, the wealthy business and financial district of Manila. It is home to the countrys stock exchange and the biggest banks and corporations; it also has the capitals least-awful traffic.

Over the past year Mr Binay has faced a stream of corruption allegations from his time running Makati, including not declaring properties, city contracts awarded to family members, the existence of bogus charities and hundreds of ghost employees on the government payroll. But the allegations seem hardly to dent his standing. Ordinary Filipinos care more about their own poverty and about lower-level graft: sticky-fingered bureaucrats and policemen. In Mr Binay they see less a corrupt politician than one who gets things done: he makes much of having got Makati residents free health care and better schools. In a televised election debate last month Mr Binay slammed the government for underspending on development and poverty alleviation (you could for a moment pretend that he was not part of the government he was railing against).

One of the candidates jostling with Mr Binay for pole position is Grace Poe (pictured), a 47-year-old senator with a thin record but a compelling back story. She is said to have been abandoned at a cathedral as a baby, and was adopted by a popular film star, Fernando Poe, himself a presidential candidate in 2004. With bags of charm, in 2013 she won the highest ever number of votes for a Senate candidate. She shone when handling a congressional hearing into a botched raid against terrorists last year in which 44 policemen died.

For some months Ms Poes candidacy had been in doubt. In December the election commission disqualified her, claiming that, as a foundling, she could not prove that she was a natural-born Filipina and that, as a former American resident, she had not lived in the Philippines for ten yearsboth constitutional requirements. Ms Poe appealed, and on March 8th the Supreme Court ruled in her favour.

Though an independent, Ms Poe has backed Mr Aquino in the Senate. Now the president may be backing her behind the scenes, even though he has formally endorsed Manuel Mar Roxas, an old family ally. A former banker and interior minister, and the grandson of an earlier president, Mr Roxas has promised to carry on along Mr Aquinos straight path fighting corruption. But he struggles to connect with ordinary Filipinos. Ms Poe, all sparkle, stands a better chance of winning.

The other candidate with a chance is Rodrigo Duterte, or Dirty Harry, the crime-busting mayor of Davao, the largest city on the southern island of Mindanao. Though Muslims in western Mindanao have long waged a separatist battle, Davao is among the countrys safest cities, though the methods are dubious: vigilante execution squads that the mayor has endorsed. Mr Duterte speaks his mind. When a visit to Davao by Pope Francis last year caused traffic mayhem, Mr Duterte spluttered: Pope, you son of a bitch, go home. Asked about his womanising, he admitted to having two girlfriends, but complained that without Viagra, I have a difficult time. He appeals to people who want a strong leader. Others worry about how his rough edges will go down abroad.

In the end, the race may come down to Ms Poes star power versus Mr Binays support from his party and business, and his strong links with local governments. No candidate promises to upend Mr Aquinos programme, but then policy has never figured strongly in Philippine politics. For all of the countrys robust economy and its growing middle class, politics is driven by personalities and dominated by a few powerful families. Whoever wins in May, that will not change.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-12 00:00:00,The Economist,[],"INTHEBEGINNINGWASTHEWORD, and the word was run together. Ancient texts (like the Greek of the Gospel of John) had few of the devices that tell readers where words begin and end (spaces), which words are proper names (the upper-lower case distinction), where breaks in meaning come (commas, dashes, semicolons and full stops), who said what (inverted commas), and so on.

Most people take punctuation to be something obvious and settled. In fact, the system is in a bit of upheaval. The beginnings of that date back to 1971, when Ray Tomlinson sent an experimental message between two computers in the same room, connected only by ARPANET (the precursor to the internet).

Tomlinson, who died on March 5th, made a lasting contribution to the worlds orthography by choosing the @ symbol for e-mail addresses. His legacy will be a long one. E-mail and the @ sign have conquered the world: you cannot truly say you speak a foreign language until you can give your e-mail address complete with the local word for the glyph, like snabel-a (elephant-trunk A) in Danish or aapenstartje (little monkeys tail) in Dutch.

It seems that Tomlinson opened a Pandoras box. As communication using computers proliferated, so did peoples recourse to those lesser-used characters at the edges of their computer keyboard. In the 1990s, it was the rise of the emoticon, from the humble :-) to the more elaborate, like >:\ (a furrowed-brow look of scepticism). The use of # to signal a topic (#language), as on Twitter, has evolved as a way to send messages through a kind of second channel. Some find this #playful, and others find it #irritating, but it has its uses in condensed media like Twitter.

Other innovations may have seen their day come and go: nerds once preferred tags in the style of HTML (used to code web pages) like <sarcasm>. But this already seems to be on the wane, in favour of things like *sigh*. A *sigh* was Johnsons reaction to another story of non-traditional writing: last year Oxford Dictionaries chose an emojithose cartoonish faces descended from emoticonsas its Word of the Year. (It was the face intended to signal tears of joy.) Emoji arent really words or punctuation, but something akin to a graphical hashtag, performing a bit of the same role as tone of voice and body language in speech.

With all this flux, many people worry that skill with punctuation is disappearing: witness, after all, the way teens text and tweet not bothering to capitalise or punctuate at all. It is in fact more complicated (and interesting) than that. Not putting a full stop in a text is normal for teens in an internet message, and including it sends a separate note of annoyance or frustration on the part of the writer. Full stops can also be used for other effects, like You. Must. Be. Joking.

Such chaos is not all that historically unusual. The first English writers, when they punctuated at all, availed themselves of long-forgotten symbols like the diastole and trigon, the interpunct and the diple. Printing began the process of settling the punctuation system, but even that took four centuries. Samuel Johnsons commas, in the mid-18th century, were not only heavy; many would be ungrammatical today, and this style persisted into the first editions of The Economist in 1843.

As David Crystal, a linguist, points out in his history of punctuation (Making a Point) published in 2015, at the dawn of the 19th century, punctuation prescribers were still divided into those who insisted that punctuation follow grammar and those who wanted it to aid elocution. Even one of the grammarians, Lindley Murray, wrote in 1795, in a hugely influential grammar book, that a semicolon signalled a pause twice as long as a comma; that a colon was twice as long as a semicolon; and that a full stop was twice as long as a colon. (Try that next time you read a text aloud.)

Punctuation, in other words, has not always been the epitome of order that some of its fans think. It is unsurprising that the rise of computers would unsettle a system that had barely settled to begin with. Fortunately, most of the upheaval is confined to new channels: e-mail, texting, Twitter and whatever is to come next. Even most teens know to keep it out of formal writing. And those who prefer not to follow fads at all need only wait a while: much of todays playful punctuation will soon become unfashionable, dead as the diastole and the diple.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,The mice in their million hordes,[],"THE odds of becoming an American astronaut have always been slim. But this year the competition will be cosmically difficult: over 18,300 people have applied to join NASAs next astronaut class, over double the previous record in 1978 and almost three times the number that applied for the most recent class, in 2012. The would-be starmen and women will jockey for up to 14 spots. Stephanie Schierholz of NASA cites two main reasons for the spike. Collaborations with two commercial groups, SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, have boosted interest, as has the development of the Orion spacecraft, which will (in theory, at least) shuttle humans deeper into the solar system than ever beforeperhaps even to Mars.

To examine what kind of health problems astronauts might develop during a 30-month mission to the red planet, NASA sent American astronaut Scott Kelly to the International Space Station for almost a year; his physical data will now be compared with those of his twin brother Mark, a retired astronaut who stayed at home. Scott returned on March 1st after 340 days in orbit, exceeding the previous NASA record of 215 days but well short of Russian and Soviet records. Astronauts who previously went on long-term missions endured changes to their vision, muscle atrophy and bone loss. On the bright side, NASA reports that while in space Mr Kellys excretions burnt up when entering the atmosphere. Your faeces will not be shooting stars, NASAs website taunts readers who will never make it into space.

As if the promise of flaming poop were not enticement enough, NASA has also become cleverer at broadcasting new opportunities. To coax more women to apply, a group of female NASA astronauts answered questions for Glamour magazines website. A lot of people who are qualified to be astronauts dont realise it, Ms Schierholz says, explaining that the only requirements are a bachelors degree in science, technology, engineering or maths, three or more years of related work experience or study (or 1,000 hours as a jet pilot, which it is easy to imagine might come in handy) and the capacity to pass a gruelling physical.

On Reddit, an online discussion forum, Shannon Walker, another astronaut, fielded questions about such requirements, as well as from users wondering how children who aspire to be astronauts can work towards their dream. Do well in school, was the predictable response. When one person inquired how many parsecs it would take [for a NASA team] to make the Kessel Run, a hyperspace trading route mentioned in Star Wars, Ms Walker replied that NASA is not going to be using their technology to smuggle spice. It may not be a requirement but, for long flights in tight quarters, a sense of humour surely helps too.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,On the front line,[],"ON THE face of things, Greeces four big banks are in their best shape in years. In November they received their third bail-out in as many years. The extra 14.4 billion ($15.9 billion) they got then (some of it from private investors) raised their capital ratios to 18%, well above the European average of 13%. Recent legal changes make it easier for them to repossess collateral and to sell loans to third parties. Better yet, recent data suggest the economy shrank by only 0.2% last year, much less than initially feared. The Bank of Greece predicts that growth could return as early as this summer. After eight years of crisis and recession, normality at last seems within reach.

But beneath the cushion of fresh capital, cracks remain. Greek banks are still losing money. Piraeus Bank, the countrys second-largest lender, this week reported a net loss of 1.9 billion in 2015. Deposits have barely begun to grow again after last years run; the capital controls it prompted remain in place. Fully 40% of loans and 55% of mortgages are not being paid down, compared with a European average of 5%. Big losses on non-performing loans (NPLs) and debt securities could erode the banks capital once again. Greece is rowing with the other members of the euro zone about the conditions of its bail-out, raising the spectre of another crisis. A fourth recapitalisation is not out of the question, says Josu Fabo of Fitch, a rating agency. The markets remain nervous: bank shares are down by 36% since the start of the year.

The banks are largely innocent bystanders in the endless back and forth between the Greek government and its creditors, but they are guilty of procrastination when it comes to their NPLs. Instead of restructuring the loans worth saving, calling the bluff of defaulters that could probably pay, and reclaiming and selling the collateral of the hopeless cases, they are counting on a return to growth to rescue delinquent borrowers. That, in turn, is impeding the flow of capital to ventures that might help revive the economy. Yannis Stournaras, the head of the central bank, recently demanded bold and innovative initiatives to clean up bad loans. This cannot be ensured by the current business as usual approach, he added.

The banks could also cut costs, by closing branches and shedding assets, such as National Bank of Greeces Turkish subsidiary, Finansbank. Governance, too, is ripe for scrutiny. Many of those in charge of Greeces banks when things went horribly wrong remain at the helm. As a condition of their latest loans, Greeces creditors demanded a review of bank board members qualifications.

As ever, however, the banks fate is largely out of their hands. An escalation of the governments ongoing row with its creditors, a global economic downturn or a deepening of Europes migration crisis could all prolong and deepen Greeces recession. The most immediate risk is that euro-zone governments and the IMF will withhold the next instalment of Greeces bail-out, leaving the government unable to pay its bills this summer.

Even if a crisis is averted, Greek banks are in no shape to make lots of new loans. NPLs may be on the verge of peaking (If you havent defaulted after eight years of recession, notes one banker wryly, you probably never will), but they still tie up the banks capital. Liquidity is another problem, points out Miranda Xafa of the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a research institute. Greek banks have around 202 billion in outstanding loans yet only 122 billion in deposits (down from 237 billion in 2009). Deposit-holders pulled out over 40 billion in the first half of last year alone. Emergency loans from the European and Greek central banks make up the difference. Cash machines in Athens still greet customers with a reminder that they can withdraw no more than 420 a week. As long as they have to deliver such messages, Greek banks cannot be expected to prosper.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Multiculti roots,[],"CHINA claims Taiwan as its own and has long attempted to stop the hapless country from joining international organisations or maintaining official ties with all but a tiny handful of states. So Taiwan has to employ other means to raise its standing. With the recent opening in Chiayi county of a southern branch of the vast National Palace Museum, museum diplomacy is becoming a part of thata way not just to boost tourism but to assert Taiwans sense of its own history as distinct from Chinas.

The main National Palace Museum in Taipei, the capital, which over 5m people visit a year, is an astounding receptacle for artefacts from imperial China. They were originally from Beijings Forbidden City and were brought by Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan before his Kuomintang forces fled China from the all-conquering Communists in 1949. To Chiang and his followers, the collections of ancient works, imperial regalia and international treaties were a source of Chinese legitimacy. But a democratic Taiwan has developed a sense of identity rooted in something broader than a confining Sinosphere.

The Chiayi extension is billed as a museum of Asian art and culture. The focus is on historical interactions among Asian cultures. Taiwans identity comes from Asia and the sea, says Shieh Jyh-wey, a member of the government that commissioned the branch 15 years ago.

Some Chinese imperial artefacts from the Taipei collection are on display in Chiayi, but they are part of exhibitions with a pan-Asian theme. Exquisite silk wrappings used to cover Tibetan Buddhist texts, commissioned by the concubine of an early Qing emperor, are being shown for the first time; they illustrate the spread of Buddhist art across Asia. Another display of Islamic jade derives from a little-known collection of the Qing emperors.

A permanent exhibition on Asian tea culture shows how Taiwanese culture stands increasingly on its own terms. It elevates Taiwans tea-taking practices, introduced by Fujianese immigrants, to the level of the formal rituals of Japanese tea ceremonies or those from Chinas Song and Ming dynasties. For Hans-Martin Hinz, president of the International Council of Museums, the stress on international perspectives rather than narrow nationalism makes the new museum a trendsetter in Asia.",[]

The backdrop of all learning is discipline, Mr Agrawal says. Thats what the army taught me.

Every year 125,000 students come to Kota to study. Across the bustling city billboards portray stern professors promising test success. Most incomers are swotting for university-entrance exams.

Robin Singh Bamel, an 18-year-old who wants to follow his father and grandfather into the army, is one of Edge Academys hopefuls. He takes two coaching classes a day and reads three newspapers to brush up for general-knowledge questions. After failing the NDA exam last year, he has taken a year out from his normal school to prepare, and feels more confident. To be an officer, you have to act like one, he says.

Similar discipline is required to win a place in the Rajasthan Administrative Service. Amrita Soni, aged 29, dreams of the day she can drive in one of the services white cars with a blue light on top. She is not the only one: around 100,000 students apply each year for a handful of jobs. She has passed the preliminary stage but a harder second test looms.

To boost her chances she has signed up to Vidhi Classes, a self-proclaimed result-generating machine. Naveen Gehlot, its boss, spends up to 12 hours a day drilling students in history, politics, economics, sociology, maths and English. The questions can be detailedand of little relevance to the job being sought. For example: Explain the Rajput policy of Akbar, a Mughal emperor, during his reign from 1556 to 1605. After the exams comes a notoriously tough interview.

Unsurprisingly, given the high stakes, cheating is a problem. Papers are often leaked and on exam day students are forbidden from wearing shirts with long sleeves or pockets. Rings and necklaces must stay outside the exam room in case answers are hidden on the jewellery.

Last year demand was so strong that Mr Gehlot had to book a cinema hall for his classes. Mr Agrawal is also expanding: next month he will move to bigger premises. Unlike other tutors around Kota, though, he has not yet sought to lure new students by plastering his face around town. I dont want my face on billboards, but in their hearts.",[]

Accompanying footage shows goose-stepping soldiers and ballistic missiles at a parade last year celebrating the end of the second world war.

Since taking office in 2012 Mr Xi has been fostering a public image of himself as a staunch defender of the Communist Party and its Maoist traditions. Signs of a growing personality cult abound. Tibetan delegates to the NPC were spotted wearing badges with Mr Xis picture on them, a form of leader-worship that fell out of fashion in China in the 1970s. A new (big yellow) book called Xi Jinping: Wit and Vision will soon be in bookshops. When Mr Xi visited America last year, the partys main mouthpiece, the Peoples Daily, released a video in which foreign students in China called the solidly built leader super-charismatic and so cute; one hoped her future husband would resemble him.

Mao would have loved it. In parks across the country people still sing and dance to the hymns of his era; Mr Xi is reviving and remoulding a remarkably tenacious culture. The Xi ballads also echo Russian odes to President Vladimir Putin (I want a man like Putin, who wont be a drunk, goes one). One song, Uncle Xi loves Mama Peng, praises a manly Mr Xi for his fairy-tale love for his wife, Peng Liyuan. Xi Dada versus horrified corrupt officials is a catchy hit about graft. Another one in the style of Peking Opera recounts Mr Xis visit to a pork-bun restaurant in Beijing in 2013. There is also a song praising Mr Xi for: Always caring about what migrant workers need; Always thinking about how laid-off workers are doing.

Some are probably the spontaneous work of amateurs; others are made at the behest of government officials, either to propagate Mr Xis message or impress him. They reflect a growing politicisation of the arts and media (last year the party banned 17 songs by a rap trio called In3, whose lyrics rail against high medical costs, Beijings traffic and officials who dine out on state funds). Mr Xi would like to teach China to sing in perfect harmony with him.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-12 00:00:00,Bavarian rhapsody,[],"THE ride, handling and all-round appeal of BMWs 3 Series, a sporty saloon car, makes it a benchmark for other vehicles of its type. The German firm, which celebrated its centenary on March 7th, has also become a benchmark for success in the motor industry. The worlds biggest maker of premium-priced cars is well run, has grown steadily and made profits consistently for years. But as the beer flowed and the oompah bands parped at the huge party thrown at its headquarters in Munich, BMWs bosses may have been wondering how to stay ahead of the pack.

BMW began life in 1916 assembling aircraft engines. Restrictions on Germanys planemaking after the first world war encouraged it to diversify, first into motorbikes, and then in 1928 into making its first car. In 1933 it launched the 303, ancestor to todays 3 Series, and the first BMW to feature the distinctive double kidney-shaped front grille. Though stylish and technically advanced, BMWs pricey models at first sold in small quantities. At the end of the 1950s sales of motorbikes, on which the company still relied, faltered as cars from mass-market firms hit the roads. Only an investment by the Quandt family, which controls BMW to this day, saved it from a humiliating takeover by Daimler.

Related topics BMW

Rather than joining the mass market, BMW, along with its German counterparts, Daimlers Mercedes marque and VWs Audi, all but cornered the worldwide market in expensive, high-performance saloons. By 1990 global sales of the Ultimate Driving Machine, as the companys advertising slogan has it, hit half a million cars a year. However, in 1994 BMW took a wrong turn. Its purchase of Rover Group, an ailing British maker of both premium and mass-market cars, was a disaster. In 2000, having failed to turn Rover around, it decided to sell most of the group.

Since then it has been upwards pretty much all the way, with sales now at more than 2m cars a year. BMW has confounded its rivals by maintaining an image of luxury and exclusivity even as it has introduced an ever-broader range of entry-level cars at prices comparable with the top of the mass-market firms ranges.

For example, a clever reinvention of the Mini brand, retained from Rover, gives it a vehicle for drivers without the means to buy a BMW 1 Series, which in turn fits the budgets of those who cannot afford a 3 Series. BMW (unlike Volkswagen) was also early in spotting the craze for SUVs, and now makes them in all sorts of shapes and sizes. It even offers a people-carrier, the 2 Series Active Tourer.

Having filled every imaginable niche, however, its growth seems to be slowing as it struggles to imagine new ones. Mercedes may overtake BMW by unit sales this year, as a slick restyling of its models wins over buyers seeking an alternative to BMWs more staid designs. Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo and other premium carmakers are also competing harder than they used to. Mass-market brands such as Ford and Citroen are pouring resources into premiumising some of their models, in a drive for bigger margins. And the slowdown in China, hitherto a hugely profitable market, has hurt BMW disproportionately hard.

Even so, BMWs bosses were entitled to clunk their steins together and slap each other heartily on the back at this weeks celebrations. The firm has got where it is mainly through an unswerving commitment to producing excellent cars. Down the years a few of its model launchessuch as a recent GT version of its 5 Series executive saloonhave underwhelmed somewhat. But so far at least, there have been no stinkers. Not bad for a centenarian.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-12 00:00:00,Open for business,[],"THESE are dark days for globalisation. In America, presidential candidates are talking about building walls and unpicking trade deals. Brazil, another giant of the Americas, seems as protectionist as ever. Britain is preparing to hold a referendum on withdrawing from the European Union. The EU as a whole is bickering over what to do about a swelling tide of refugees.

Yet there is at least some light in the darkness. Mexico, for instance, continues to carry a torch for globalisation. President Enrique Pena Nietos administration boasts about the countrys 44 trade deals, more than any other country, and its 11 reform initiatives. The World Bank calculates that Mexico is one of the most open large economies in the world: exports plus imports are equivalent to 66% of GDP, compared with 26% for Brazil and 42% for China. The Boston Consulting Group finds in a survey that its people take a positive view of the future: 77% of Mexicans say they are optimistic, and only 6% that they are very pessimistic. Mexicans see the likes of Donald Trump as being cut from the same cloth as the old-fashioned Latin American strongmen who ruined the region through protectionism and gesture politics.

When the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) was created in 1994 it was as controversial in Mexico as it was in the United States: a Yanqui conspiracy, according to those on the left, designed to turn their country into a colony of El Norte. Today the Mexican elite speaks with one voice on the subject. Mexico is now one of the worlds top 15 manufacturing economies and one of its top five car producers. The output of the ten largest car plants rose from 1.1m vehicles in 1994 to 2.9m in 2012. Mexican consumers now have access to a huge range of multinational brands: marketers refer to young, middle-class Mexicans as the children of NAFTA, because their taste is so cosmopolitan.

Free trade has helped to produce a corps of elite Mexican companies that are capable of going head-to-head with the best in the world. Bimbo is the worlds largest baker, thanks in part to its ambitious expansion into America with the purchase of Sara Lees bakery business. Gruma is the worlds biggest maker of tortillas, with more than 100 plants in 20 countries. Free trade has been a double blessing for such companies. First, it has encouraged those that have reached the limit of the Mexican market to go global. They have the huge advantages of speaking one of the worlds most popular languages, and sharing a 1,900-mile (3,100km) border with America. Second, now that they are more vulnerable to competition and takeovers, they have been forced to shake off a long-standing tendency for successful Mexican companies to become flabby. When AB InBev, a global brewer, bought Grupo Modelo, a Mexican beer firm, in 2013, it quickly eliminated around $1 billion in annual costs.

Schumpeter noted in a previous column on Mexico that it is unusual in having both a global upper class (thanks to American education) and a global peasantry (thanks to emigration to America). Free trade is now rapidly globalising the middle class, which by some estimates makes up 30-40% of the population. Scot Rank, the boss of the Lala Group, a dairy firm, points out that better-off Mexicans are becoming more like Americans in their tastes. They want lite products that will help them fight the flab (obesity is a big problem in a country addicted to a vitamin T diet of tacos and tortillas) and drinkables, nutrition that can be consumed on the go (partly in response to the rise of two-income families).

Mexico is now freeing up two hitherto protected areas, telecoms and energy. Telmex has been forced to surrender its telecoms monopoly, and is now in a vigorous battle with the Yanqui AT&T, in which average tariffs have fallen by half in the past year. Pemex, the state oil monolith, is being forced to auction off some fields to foreign bidders, and to form joint ventures with foreign firms. A visit to Pemexs headquarters illustrates just how radical the latter policy is. A collection of giant slabs surrounded by thick iron railings, protected by a phalanx of armed guards, it looks more like an arm of government than a commercial organisation. Which is exactly what it is: Pemex provides a third of government revenues and thousands of coveted jobsand until recently its monopoly status was guaranteed in the constitution. Last month the government underlined its seriousness by sacking the companys boss, Emilio Lozoya, despite his close relationship with the president. The new boss, Jose Antonio Gonzalez, argues that the steep fall in the oil price is also a golden opportunity: Pemex now has no choice but to reform if it is to thrive in the face of greater competition.

The other Mexico that still needs fixing

Even if the government can successfully re-engineer Pemex, it still has an enormous amount to do. Mexico is one of the worlds most unequal societies. Perhaps half of Mexicans are still poor and parochial, beset by crime and corruption, and poorly served by schools and banks. The economy is hobbled by a long tail of inefficient firms: the McKinsey Global Institute, a think-tank, points out that, though the productivity of Mexicos globalised companies has risen by 5.8% a year since 1999, the productivity of small, traditional firms has fallen by 6.5% a year. Poorer regions, especially in the south, are mired in the past, too far from the American border to benefit from the manufacturing boom. These problems have held back the economys growth rate to a disappointing 2-3% over the past 30 years. They have also supplied the drugs cartels (which benefit from globalisation in their own, malign way) with an endless supply of young recruits.

Mr Pena Nietos administration has done something to extend the benefits of globalisation to this other Mexico by deregulating telecoms and taking on the teachers unions. However, this is just the start of what is needed. Successful Mexicans are right to mock Mr Trumps talk of building walls. But they need to focus their energies on some construction projects of their own: building ladders of opportunity for the poor, and bridges of commerce between the two Mexicos.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,The Economist,[],"ONCE an environmental sluggard, China now pursues green policies with gusto. Last September it announced plans to launch a national carbon-trading scheme in 2017 aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. It also played an important role in December in securing a global deal in Paris on combating climate change. On March 5th China announced that its new five-year economic plan would include a target to cap annual energy consumption at a tough-sounding 5 billion tonnes of coal equivalent by 2020, up from 4.3 billion now. It is beginning to make greenness sound all too easy.

A study by two researchers in BritainLord Nicholas Stern, a prominent environmental economist, and Fergus Green, an expert on climate policysuggests it may indeed be relatively easy for China, because of the modest targets that it is setting for itself. The country says its emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) will peak by 2030. But the academics paper, due to be published on the website of the journal Climate Policy later this month, shows that achieving this will pose little challenge.

The countrys coal consumption almost trebled between 2000 and 2013, the government says. But Lord Stern and Mr Green say it is possible that the highest peak of Chinas CO2 emissions may have been reached by 2014. Even if not, they are not going to rise anything like as fast as before, and are almost certain to begin falling by 2025. That assumes that GDP growth is in line with official targets of 6.5% a year on average for the rest of the decade, and 5.5% in the following five years. There are many who doubt such growth can be achieved. In any case, the decline of manufacturing as a source of growth will result in a diminishing need to burn fossil fuels to keep factories going. China may have been deliberately underestimating the rate at which this shift will happen.

Recent improvements in the way that China gathers coal-related statistics give the researchers greater confidence in their projections. Official figures show that coal production fell 2.5% in 2014 and that imports dropped by 10.9%; in the first three quarters of 2015 production sank 4.3%. This suggests that Chinas emissions intensitythe amount of CO2 it emits per unit of GDPhas already started falling. Lord Stern and Mr Green say the numbers showing falls in coal production and imports correspond with trends seen in the generation of thermal power (which are relatively easy to monitor, because related data come directly from meters) as well as in manufacturing output.

At the same time, the proportion of Chinas energy generated by renewable sources, such as wind and the sun, is rising. The country already invests more in exploiting these than America and Japan combined. China believes its security might be threatened if it becomes overly dependent on imported fossil fuels, and it wants to reduce the smog created by coal-burning because it is causing public anger and many premature deaths.

Between 2010 and 2014, non-fossil energy generation capacity increased by 73%. But using such infrastructure effectively is not so simple. Within the energy industry, disputes are rampant over which generators should have priority in dispatching electricity to grids. Wind and solar farms often lose out. And coal-fired plants are still being built apace as local officials find the short-term economic benefits of such projects hard to resist. But many analysts still think it is likely that China is underselling its emissions-reducing abilities. In 2020, when signatories to the Paris accord on climate change are due to set themselves new carbon-cutting goals, the worlds biggest emitter may come under pressure to be more ambitious.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,The Economist,[],"Rebooting India: Realising a Billion Aspirations. By Nandan Nilekani and Viral Shah. Allen Lane; 337 pages; 20.

IN A month or so, India will have registered a billion residentsthe latest stage in the creation of a complete identity database of what will soon be the worlds most populous country. Aadhaar, which means foundation in Hindi, matches names with fingerprints and iris scans on a scale that has never been seen before. Reimagining government with such technology at its core will be key to meeting the mounting aspirations of Indias citizens, according to two of the schemes architects, Nandan Nilekani and Viral Shah.

If the Domesday Book, an 11th-century survey of England, was commissioned to raise funds for government, Aadhaars most useful purpose is to help their disbursement. Making sure each farmer gets one dose of subsidised fertiliser and all poor families their share of rice is fiendish without knowing who they are. Many of those who are entitled to government handouts live in one of the 600,000 Indian villages with no banking facilities.

Serving the citizenry in a country where 59% of births are not registered, and many people cant read, is a task that has been a costly failure. Rajiv Gandhi, a former prime minister, once claimed that just 17% of subsidies reached the right people: not so much a leaky bucket as a sieve. A patchwork of rival ID schemes, from driving licences to ration cards, electoral rolls and tax-registration numbers, did not serve the purpose of making each and every citizen visible to the state.

Much debate about public policy is about the principles behind it: which citizens should pay how much tax, for example. Rebooting India is a welcome detour to the often-overlooked realities of how these principles translate into reality. A government benefit which requires days of trekking to receive, and then a bribe to unlock, may not feel like much of a benefit at all. Women who can access a subsidy without the involvement of their husbands or brothers are in quite a different position than those who cannot.

Aadhaar is transforming the way many citizens interact with the state. It allows the government to pay benefits directly to over 200m bank accounts linked to its database, so cutting out layers of corrupt and inept middlemen. That will feel much more tangible, to the average Indian, than a tax break here or a new subsidy there.

Rebooting India is at its best when it delves into the veritable sausage-making that is large-scale government IT projects. (Mr Nilekani, one of the authors, knows more than most about what it takes to deliver these, having co-founded and then run Infosys, an Indian IT giant.) How do you coax a reluctant bureaucracy to adopt a new technology that might erode its privileges? How do you resist those who want to turn it into something more comprehensive than just an ID schemeand therefore make it more likely to fail? Given Aadhaars relatively smooth implementation, civil servants across the world would do well to seek inspiration from it.

Its potential is vast but mostly unknown. It is described as a platform in which an ecosystem can thrive, much like the iPhone is a platform for apps. Beyond subsidy payments, a few such applications for Aadhaar already exist: one allows citizens to track in real time which bureaucrats are physically at their desk. If that is not helpful, other uses that have not yet been thought of undoubtedly will be.

There is the occasional whiff of naivety. The books title alone suggests that Indias governing apparatus could be improved if it could just be turned off and on again. And how can a government that is so inept as to need recasting be trusted to avoid the Orwellian possibilities of a billion-strong database? Police have already nagged to get access to its fingerprints and have been rebuffedfor now.

If Aadhaar is indeed as revolutionary as the personal computer, it is frustrating that the second half of the book veers into other ways IT can help deliver government services. The authors suggestions on how road tolls or Indias court system could be better run with added tech savvy are correct, but their solutions to other problems, such as managing health records, lack Aadhaars elegance.

It is a credit to Aadhaar that the book, while fascinating, feels like primary material for a weightier tome. The high politics of the scheme are glossed over, particularly the election of Narendra Modi halfway through its implementation (Mr Nilekani stood unsuccessfully as an MP for the rival Congress party). The chronicles of a revolution, if indeed this is one, are best not written by the perpetrators.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,The ruin of many a poor boy,[],"OF THE shackled, jumpsuited defendants making their first appearance in the New Orleans criminal court, the first to rise in the dock was relatively fortunate. Up for possession of drugs, he was deemed indigent, and the citys public defender was appointed to represent him. After a brisk back-and-forth of previous convictions and mitigating circumstances (a baby on the way, a job), bail was set at $5,000. The next mans predicament was grimmer. Barely speaking English, he too was deemed indigent; but because his alleged offencesexual batterywas more serious, the public defender reluctantly declined to represent him. Which means that, for the time being, no one will.

He is not alone. At the last count, 52 people were stuck in jail in New Orleans without representation; a further 27 lacked counsel but are out on bail. The problem is that, while these defendants cant afford lawyers, the lawyers say that, after drastic budget cuts, a hiring freeze and a spate of resignations, they cant afford to act for the defendants. In 2010 the public defenders office of Orleans Parish (coterminous with the city) employed 78 lawyers; since its budget fell by a third, it has 42, for an annual caseload of 22,000. In January the office began to refuse new clients accused of serious crimes, such as armed robbery and murder (capital cases are an exception). The rationale is that these graver accusations require resources the office cannot provide. In a city where 85% of felony defendants are considered indigent, the numbers are rising fast.

Its terrible, acknowledges Derwyn Bunton, the parishs chief public defender. Mr Bunton grew up in poverty; several of his relatives have been through the courts. Like most of the clients his team serves, he is black. Yet he decided he was not going to be complicit in the injustice of providing inadequate defence. The tipping-point was the story of a man arrested for a multiple shooting in a city park. The man hired a private lawyer, who hired an investigator, who unearthed videotape proving he was in Houston when the crime was committed. Mr Bunton was not sure we would have made it before the tape was erased. The issue at stake, he says, is Do poor people deserve equal justice? Do poor people deserve justice at all?

It isnt only New Orleans. Jay Dixon, the state public defender, says offices in 13 districts have imposed restrictions on their services; the one in Plaquemines Parish temporarily closed altogether. G. Paul Marx, a veteran defender whose office covers Acadia, Lafayette and Vermilion Parishes, says his payroll has declined from 62 lawyers in early December to 16 now. He estimates the number of defendants without representation at a whopping 2,300, rising by 300-400 a month (most are out on bail). Mr Marx calls the situation a man-made disaster. The cause of this widespread denial of basic rightsthe sort of derogation which, if it happened abroad, would be denounced by American diplomatsis the volatile and eccentric way those rights are subsidised.

Louisiana is broke. Its legislature and new governor, John Bel Edwards, are struggling to repair its ruined finances, a mess many attribute to the doomed presidential ambitions and concomitant tax-cutting of Mr Edwardss predecessor, Bobby Jindal. Like that for other essential services, state funding for public defenders is set to be severely squeezed. That will exacerbate the malaise, but is not its main cause, since roughly two-thirds of their income comes from a different source: punitive court fees and fines, including those for traffic offences. For various reasonsrevised police priorities, pre-trial diversion programmesin some parishes, such as Orleans, this revenue has crashed, though it has held up in places with lucrative stretches of highway. The states contribution was already too measly to compensate.

The trouble with these funding arrangements is not just that they are unreliable. They are also ridden with conflicts of interest, even or especially when the cash is flowing. Not just public defenders but Louisianas sheriffs and prosecutors, and the courts themselves, subsist partly on fees, fines and bonds imposed largely at judges discretion, mostly on defendants who plead or are found guilty. Thus, in a perverse reversal of the usual formula, public defenders routinely work on a No lose, no fee basis. Hurrying through cases benefits everyone. The risks were highlighted by a still-rumbling scandal over the judicial expense fund of the Orleans criminal court, meant to cover overheads using the courts share of the revenues. An auditors report in 2012 found judges had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars from the fund on medical bills and insurance. The district attorney who blew the whistle recused himself from investigating, since he had enjoyed similar perks when he was on the bench.

The system bears an unfortunate resemblance to an extortion racket. Payments are often made on a schedule; people who miss them are liable to be locked up, alternatives known as pay or stay. Ashton Brown, for example, owed $500 arising from a theft conviction in 2013; he was also liable for probation-service fees. Arrested last year for possessing drugs, he was detained for an extra two weeks because of the old debt. The constitutional requirement to assess his ability to pay was ignored. Eventually his friends and grandmother came up with $100 to get him out. Its crazy, says Mr Brown, who has yet to clear the debt (his record makes it hard to find work). He is among the plaintiffs in a suit filed by Equal Justice Under Law, a pressure group, alleging that Orleans Parish maintains an unjust modern debtors prison and that its officials fund themselves off the backs of New Orleanss poorest. A court, says EJULs Alec Karakatsanis, is supposed to be where justice is done, not where revenues are generated.

Habeas corpse

In its criminal-justice excesses, as in other things, Louisiana is an outlier. Its incarceration and murder rates are the highest in America. In New Orleans, where malpractice has discredited both the police and prisons, both the violent-crime and imprisonment rates are double the national average. Yet these problems, while extreme, are also typical. Although no other state relies predominantly on court revenue to fund public defenders, many are overburdened; in the past, lawyers in Florida and Missouri have turned away clients, too. Unethical punishments are not uncommon: a judge in Alabama was recently suspended for ordering defendants to donate blood in lieu of money. The milking of poor communities by police and the courts, and enforcement of debts with jail time, were a factor in the unrest in Ferguson.

The underlying causes are typical, too. Chief among them is an old imbalance between, on the one hand, a fearsome appetite for prosecuting and jailing people, and, on the other, a reluctance to foot the bill. At least, to foot it up-front: shortchanging public defence, like some other seeming economies, is actually expensive, leading as it does to miscarriages of justice (Louisianas exoneration rate is the countrys second highest), longer sentences and so a higher, pricier prison population. Underneath that, says Jim Craig of the Roderick & Solange MacArthur Justice Centre in New Orleans, lies an unAmerican belief that people who are charged with crime are a lower breed of human beings. In the South, that view has a racial tinge. Mr Bunton ascribes the states stinginess in part to a hunch that indigent defence is only a right that poor people of colour need.

For now, in Louisiana, some of the slack is being taken up by private lawyers, whom some judges are ordering to defend cases pro bono. This fix has two obvious drawbacks: many of the lawyers dont like it; and many are ill-qualified. Jack Bailey, who runs a personal-injury firm in Caddo Parish, says five felony cases were foisted on it last year, even though his three colleagues have no expertise in criminal law. He worries not only about the expropriation of his property in the form of their time, but alsoafter he exonerated two defendantsthat innocent people will be failed by less assiduous lawyers, who may be inclined to prioritise paying customers. Nobody cares about this, Mr Bailey laments, until its them. It is absurd, he thinks, that this constitutional duty should be inflicted on a small number of people who happen to have law licences.

If the right to counsel means anything, says Marjorie Esman of the ACLU, a lobby group, it means the right to a lawyer who knows what theyre doing. The ACLU is suing Mr Bunton and Mr Dixon in a federal court, with the aim of having the situation in Orleans Parish declared unconstitutional. That manoeuvre suggests one possible outcome to this crisis, since such a ruling could eventually lead to remedial action by the state or federal government. Another is that a court finds Mr Bunton in contempt (some judges have threatened as much); the unserved defendants get lawyers, albeit in name only; and Mr Bunton winds up in jail himself.

There is a third possibility. Without lawyers, the cases of those languishing in prison will not be able to proceed. Sooner or later someone will file motions for their release; judges may have little choice but to comply. Legions of alleged killers and rapists walking free might just be embarrassing enough to galvanise reform.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-12 00:00:00,The Economist,[],"HANDING a farmer a fistful of magic beans with the promise that they will improve his business might sound like something out of a fairy-tale. But, as Arthur C. Clarke put it, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. The sensor-filled beans developed by Andrew Holland, an electronics engineer from Swaffham Bulbeck, near Cambridge, England, are not only advanced technology. They could also, Mr Holland says, provide an answer to many a farmers prayers.

Mixed into the contents of a granary, his beans would report continuously on the temperature and humidity, both of which encourage rotting if they are too high, and on carbon-dioxide levels, which reflect the amount of insect breath exhaled, and thus the level of infestation. At the moment these things have to be measured (if they are measured at all) using hand-held instruments that are plunged into the grain pile at regular intervals by farmhands.

In this section Showdown

Without fire?

Crucible

Cool beans

The beans themselves are plastic shells 45mm long and 18mm wide, manufactured by 3D printing. This process is used to encapsulate within each bean a diminutive circuit board containing a low-power Bluetooth radio and sensors that can measure motion, temperature, humidity, air pressure and the concentrations of several gases, including carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. A bean also contains an electronic compass and a tiny gyroscope that, acting together, sense its orientation. All of these devices are powered by a wirelessly rechargeable battery.

Mr Holland sees potential for his device beyond the monitoring of stored crops. Placed discreetly in a living room or office, he suggests, it could register intruders via the trembles of its motion sensor. A change in air pressure brought about by blowing on it might let it work as a switch for a rooms lights. The gyroscope would permit it to act as the remote control for a television or hi-fi: swiping a bean through the air could turn the device on, while spinning it in a circle could step the volume up or down, depending on whether the spin were clockwise or anticlockwise. For the elderly, a bean carried in a pocket could register a fall and then call for help via its owners phone. For the suspicious, it could record whether a parcel had been mistreated in transit by being heated up or crushed.

That beans would be better than existing ways of doing these things is not always obvious. But they will be programmable via a phone app, so owners will be able to devise other uses as they see fit.

Grain-monitoring, though, is likely to be the first use. Once placed in and around a heap of grain, a collection of the beans will connect together wirelessly, becoming nodes in a network that gives a clear, three-dimensional picture of what is going on inside that heap. Mr Hollands company, RFMOD, has just started testing beans for this purpose, and he hopes they will be commercially deployed within two years.

One problem is recovering the beans when the granary is emptied. If they became a routine technology this could, no doubt, be done by pinging them when a shipment was sorted at the wholesaler, and pulling them out automatically as the grain left a hopper. In the meantime, RFMOD is experimenting with putting them in the plastic insect-trapping containers that farmers already deploy in grain-piles to keep infestations under control.

If the beans do well at monitoring grain, Mr Holland hopes their other applications will make them an important part of the much-discussed internet of things which some prophets believe will, in the future, link many objects not currently connected electronically. If his own wildest dreams are fulfilled, that would make RFMOD a large and successful company. It might also suggest that Swaffham Bulbeck, a tiny village, has its own brand of magic to confer, for it was also once home to another startup, Advanced RISC Machines Ltd. ARM Holdings, as that firm is now known, has grown into one of the worlds biggest designers of microprocessors. In Silicon Valley, they do it in garages. In the English fens, it seems, old barns are just as good.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Palace in the jungle,[],"TEODORO OBIANG, the president of Equatorial Guinea, and Teodorin, the most influential of his 42 recognised children, have expensive tastes. While most of his citizens live on less than $2 a day, the older Mr Obiang once shelled out $55 million for a Boeing 737 with gold-plated lavatory fittings. His son had at one point amassed $300m in assets, including 32 sports cars, a Malibu mansion and nearly $2m in Michael Jackson memorabilia.

The past few years have been less kind to the Obiang clan. In 2014 the United States Department of Justice forced Teodorin Obiang to sell off a Ferrari, his Los Angeles abode and six life-size Michael Jackson statues in a money-laundering settlement. (He was allowed to keep one of the King of Pops crystal-encrusted gloves.) His father, who enjoys the distinction of being the longest-serving president in the world (36 years), has seen his pockets increasingly pinched as oil prices have crashed.

While prices were favourable the country boomed. According to the IMF, its GDP expanded by an average of almost 40% per year between 1996 and 2006. But little wealth trickled down to the population. Though its GDP per head is the highest in Africa, over three-quarters of its population lives below the World Banks poverty line. Government spending on education and health lags far behind the sub-Saharan African average. Tutu Alicante, the executive director of EG Justice, an advocacy group, compares visiting a public hospital to signing your own death sentence. Patients must bring their own sheets and share their rooms with rats.

Mr Obiang has instead channelled Equatorial Guineas petrodollars into grand projects such as Oyala, a new city he is building deep in the jungle. He hopes to move his capital there to avoid seaborne coup attempts, such as the one he suffered in 2009. The area currently consists of a new 450-room luxury hotel and a warren of empty buildings intended to become an international university.

Such endeavours are becoming increasingly difficult to fund. Declining oil production, coupled with lower prices, have led Equatorial Guineas economy to shrivel since 2013. Last year was especially grim: GDP shrank by an estimated 10.2%. The great majority of citizens never reaped the benefits of their countrys upturn, so their experience of its downturn has been muted, but work is getting scarcer.

Mr Obiang, who overthrew his uncle to become president, has a deplorable human-rights record; dissidents who anger him sometimes end up in prison where guards have been known to shock, beat and carve up their wards with knives. Nobody would be surprised if the economic crunch results in even greater repression. In January, two members of an opposition party, Convergence for Social Democracy, were arrested for the crime of handing out leaflets announcing a future meeting.

As the 73-year-old Mr Obiang becomes frailer, his sons, including the prodigal Teodorin, have begun jockeying to succeed him. But in November, when Equatorial Guinea is scheduled to hold a presidential election, there is no doubt about who will prevailwhatever the price of oil.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Speed merchants,[],"FEW countries are as adept at making luxury cars as Britain. Plutocrats and footballers queue to buy Rolls-Royces and Bentleys. Speed freaks in want of a sports car are also well served. At the Geneva Motor Show, which opened on March 1st, two leading British supercar firms launched pricey new models to compete with the likes of Ferrari and Lamborghini: Aston Martin unveiled the DB11 (pictured) while McLaren showed off its 570GT. The two brands offer similarly expensive toys, yet under the bonnet are very different firms.

The pair are alike in some respects. Both make only a handful of vehicles. McLaren turned out just 1,650 last year; Aston around double that. An entry-level Aston costs nearly 100,000 ($140,000), whereas the cheapest McLaren costs another 30,000, but their flagship models cost around 150,000-200,000. Each firm has built hypercars that sold for around 1m. And both have recently announced expansion plans, to take advantage of a sales boom at the top end of the car market (IHS, a consulting firm, reckons that global sales of the priciest cars will triple between 2010 and 2020). Aston will open a new factory in Wales to make SUVs; McLaren plans to spend 1 billion over six years to widen its range to 15 models and 4,000 cars a year.

The two have taken different routes to this destination. Aston, 103 years old, is well known thanks to the James Bond films but has struggled of late. It was a basket case which limped from one car to the next, losing money, according to its boss, Andy Palmer. Since taking over in 2014 Mr Palmer has won backing from private-equity firms to launch four new models and struck a deal to use Mercedes engines.

By contrast, McLarens sports-car business took off only six years ago. Though it had made road cars in small numbers it was mostly known as a Formula 1 motor-racing team. McLaren diverted its British engineers, good at the speedy innovation and advanced manufacturing needed for racing, to making sports cars.

A glance at the cars gives a clue that they do things differently. McLarens are wild-looking mid-engined sports machines that harness the firms skills in engineering to adapt racetrack materials, such as carbon fibre, and high-tech gizmos to make a car as at home on the circuit as the open road. Astons DB11 is more conventional. An aluminium body and engine at the front are typical of a grand tourer, designed to whisk drivers in comfort over long distances on public roads.

Aston is first a design company, says Mr Palmer. Performance and handling are important but the aim is to make the most beautiful car on the road. To do so Aston has remodelled itself as a luxury-goods firm, emphasising design and craftsmanship that are a British speciality, while trying to extend the brand. The Welsh factory will make the DBX, an SUV that Aston hopes will broaden its appeal, especially among women, who buy few of its cars.

McLaren, meanwhile, strives to make its cars the most technically advanced. Last year the firm renamed itself the McLaren Technology Group to emphasise the importance of innovation. Although racing and supercars will remain important, Ron Dennis, the firms boss, is convinced that its tech business will be its biggest and most important part in years to come. It already serves oil-and-gas, health-care and financial-services firms. Using skills honed in analysing the vast quantities of data generated by motor racing, it is developing analytics software for the likes of GlaxoSmithKline and KPMG.

Both carmakers are in the business of hurtling drivers towards 200mph. Yet with their respective focus on luxury and advanced engineering, they are relying on contrasting British strengths.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,The Economist,[],"ITS time to charge yourself! So, ungrammatically, the shiny wrappers of Lov Charger cream wafers declare. It is not just the peppy slogan and a pretty price (two rupees, or around three American cents) that make the biscuits sell. Their maker is a firm called MSG, letters that stand not for a flavour enhancer buttake your pickeither for Messenger of God or for the initials of the three gurus who have led Dera Sacha Sauda, a north Indian sect, since its founding in 1948. MSG and MSG2 are also the names of two films that star the sects current leader as a brawny, sequin-studded superhero who swats down goons and gangsters like flies while bursting into such lyrics as I am so lucky because/You are my love charger.

The talented writer of that song is none other than Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Insan, the star himself (pictured, above). Mr Singh is far from the first religious leader in India to make money or a spectacle of himself. But his self-promotion via Bollywood-style films, music, gatherings like rock concerts and, since February, a line of some 150 consumer products, marks an important change. Mr Singh is one of a new, more sophisticated crop of godmen, as Indias press calls the countrys proliferation of spiritual entrepreneurs. They are seeking corporate-style synergies between religious messaging, personal celebrity, commercial success and political influence.

An early mover is Ramdev, a teacher of yoga whose television lessons are credited with popularising the discipline among Indias fast-growing middle class. Ten years ago he launched a range of ayurvedic drugs and beauty products. More recently Ramdevs brands have expanded aggressively into foods and detergents, competing directly with big multinationals. When India last year slapped a ban on instant noodles produced by Nestle, a global food giant, after a health inspection raised alarms, Ramdev quickly stepped in with a version of his own. His next venture is a line of yoga sportswear that he says will be made from khadi, the homespun cotton that became an emblem of Indias independence movement.

Advertising for the godmans brands is not subtle. A recent newspaper spot suggests that most competing hair oil is carcinogenic for every human being and may cause cancer. Fine print urges customers to buy Indian so as to realise Mahatma Gandhis dream of self-reliance. Another product, a medicinal herb said to promote fertility, has stirred controversy. Some say its ancient name, which means sons life seed, hints unethically at particular effectiveness in spawning male offspring.

Nor are Ramdevs promotion campaigns small affairs. During one week in January his Patanjali brand was the top spender in Indian television advertising, beating such consumer giants as Unilever and Cadbury with a blitz of 17,000 showings. Annual sales have reportedly doubled in the past year, to nearly $750m. Such success clearly buys clout, too. Patanjalis factory complex was recently granted protection by a crack anti-terrorist police unit. The only other private facilities in India with such a privilege are strategic installations such as oil refineries, steel mills and internet hubs.

Another of Indias god-magnates and a purveyor of traditional medicines is Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. He wields huge influence through his Art of Living foundation, a worldwide meditation franchise. When he decided to hold what is being billed as the worlds biggest arts fair on the banks of the Yamuna river, which flows through Delhi, a score of government agencies chose to overlook the fact that the rivers flood plain, a vital catchment area for drinking water, is meant to be protected from any encroachment. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, will even appear on a seven-acre stage along with the worlds biggest orchestra. Even the Indian army has chipped in, erecting a pair of pontoon bridges to carry what Art of Living says will be 3.5m visitors across the Yamuna.

Environmentalists have made a fuss, and Indias figurehead president has called off his planned visit. Delhis police, not known for their delicacy, declared it dangerous for big crowds to gather by a river that is inky black, infested with mosquitoes and reeks of sewage. But after much fluster and a hasty investigation, the authorities decided that the show, which runs from March 11th to 13th, must go on.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,DUC and cover,[],"NO ONE can deny that Americas shale-oil industry is having a hard time. In recent weeks it has suffered the indictment and subsequent death in a car crash of one of its pioneers, Aubrey McClendon; a shellacking from Hillary Clinton, who could become Americas next president; and a warning from Ali al-Naimi, Saudi Arabias oil minister, to cut costs, borrow money or face liquidation.

The data illustrate the extent of its woes. The American governments Energy Information Administration (EIA) says oil production in December, of 9.3m barrels a day (m b/d), was lower than a year earlier for the first time since early 2011 (see chart 1), weighed down by Texas and North Dakota, the heartlands of hydraulic fracturing (fracking). The EIA said on March 8th that it expects American crude production to fall to 8m b/d before it bottoms out in the latter part of next year.

Against that bleak backdrop, the mere hint this week that American oil prices were rebounding towards $40 a barrel, up from a low of less than $30 a barrel a month ago, must have felt like a get-out-of-jail-free card. With a chutzpah typical of the industry, some shale executives see $40 oil as the threshold above which they can resume drilling and make money againeven if America is still awash with record amounts of crude in storage. If they are right about that, it could change the entire dynamics of the oil market, quickly smoothing any upward or downward spike in prices. But it is not at all clear that they are.

In theory, it is not hard for the frackers to increase production rapidly, once it becomes economical. Rig and drilling costs have fallen so fast that some wells could make money with prices around $40-45 a barrel, according to Rystad Energy, a consulting firm (see chart 2). Firms have laid off many workers, but with well-paid jobs hard to find elsewhere, it could be relatively easy to attract them back.

In preparation for higher oil prices, producers from the Bakken field in North Dakota to the Permian and Eagle Ford in Texas have reported that they have hundreds of drilled but uncompleted ( DUC) wells. DUCs should be anathema to a self-respecting shaleman; they sink cash into the ground in the form of wells, but defer the all-important fracking that breaks open the shale rock and produces the oil. They could be a quick way to resume production, however. In late February Continental Resources and Whiting Petroleum, two big operators in the Bakken, said that above $40 a barrel they may begin fracking their rising inventory of DUCs.

For most of the industry, however, the problem is not finding oil but finding cash. No one is sitting on any excess capital, says Ron Hulme of Parallel Resource Partners, an energy-focused private-equity fund. For years the industry borrowed heavily to finance its expansion, because it was failing to generate enough cash to cover investment in new wells. The supply of credit, whether from banks or the high-yield debt markets, has either dried up or is much more expensive than it was.

Capital expenditure has fallen as a result, but not by enough to balance the books. In the fourth quarter of last year, American and Canadian oil firms spent $20 billion, while generating only $13 billion in cashflow, according to Bloomberg, an information provider.

Only the strongest firms can make up the shortfall by raising capital via the equity markets. (Even they may find this harder, as investors realise that shale companies are less profitable than they once seemed.) The weaker firms are unwilling to sell assets to raise cash because the proceeds would go directly to their creditors. Youd have to prise those assets from their dying hands, says Mr Hulme. He notes that even firms that are technically insolvent may have enough liquidity to keep them from such potential fire sales.

Not all of them, though. On March 8th Goodrich Petroleum, a shale oil-and-gas company, said it would postpone paying interest on its debt, as it puts pressure on creditors to exchange debt for equity in order to avoid a default. Three other oil firms, Chaparral Energy, Energy XXI and SandRidge Energy, have also recently missed debt payments. Brian Gibbons of CreditSights, a debt-research firm, says 26 oil-related bond issuers either filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy or had distressed-debt exchanges last year. He expects the number to rise to 73 by the end of 2017. Those firms still saddled with revolving bank loans are also bracing for the next twice-yearly reassessment of borrowing limits, due next month. These depend on valuations of shale firms reserves, and could lead to further strains on cashflow.

To provide a sufficient margin of comfort, prices may have to rally a lot higher than $40 a barrel to lure capital back in. Bobby Tudor of Tudor, Pickering, Holt, an energy-focused investment bank, believes that at $40 a barrel production will continue to decline, at $50 it would flatten out, and only at $60 would it increase. Drilling wells at todays commodity prices is still destructive of capital, he argues. One further wrinkle: as oil prices increase, so can costs. Those, then, who hope that nimble shale producers will be able to move the global oil price up and down just by turning the taps on and off may be disappointed. Their financial backers will be the ones really calling the shots.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,The return of an old enemy,[],"OLDER Latin Americans still have vivid memories of hyperinflation. Bello recalls changing money in dark doorways in the mid-1980s in Bolivia and being handed a truncheon of greasy banknotes secured by rubber bands. Peru went through a futile currency reform in which the sol lost three zeros and was briefly renamed the inti, which promptly racked up more zeroes.

Hyperinflation destroys businesses, undermines political systems and hits the poor especially hard. Latin America should have learned this painful lesson. So when in Caracas recently Bello was given a large shoebox packed tightly with banknotes in return for a few hundred dollars, he received it with an eerie sense of deja vu and dismay. Official statistics put the rise in the consumer-price index in Venezuela last year at 181%, the worlds highest; the IMF forecasts 720% this year. Venezuela is extreme in its economic mismanagement. But while the rest of the world worries about deflation, across Latin America prices are rising. In Argentina, inflation is forecast to spike from 27% to 33% at an annual rate; in Brazil it stands at around 10.5%; in Uruguay, it is only one point lower, and in Colombia it has climbed to 7.6%. In Chile, Peru and Mexico it has also ticked up.

The reasons vary somewhat. In Venezuela and Argentina, inflation is mainly the result of printing money to finance indiscriminate subsidies. Ironically, it is rising now in Argentina partly because the new government of Mauricio Macri is cutting those subsidies.

In Brazil, too, the government cut subsidies on electricity and petrol in 2015. But the main reason inflation is so high there, even though the economy is in deep recession, is price indexation, according to Edmar Bacha, an economist who helped tame chronic inflation in the 1990s. By law, the minimum wage was raised in January by 11.6%; it in turn has a big influence on other wages and the prices of services, as well as on pensions. And that, plus past fiscal laxity, has made a mockery of the Central Banks (unambitious) inflation target of 2.5-6.5%.

Elsewhere the rise in inflation is the result of currency depreciation, which is driving up the price of imports (see chart). This is also a factor in Brazil and Argentina. Though very large, these depreciations are healthy: they are the way that Latin Americas economies are adjusting to sharply lower prices for their commodity exports. But they pose a dilemma for central banks that are committed to inflation targeting. In Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru central bankers began raising interest rates last year even as their economies slowed or were stagnant. Argentina, too, put up its interest rate last month.

The good news is that the rate at which currency depreciation in Latin America is passed through into domestic price increases is much lower than in the past, according to Alejandro Werner of the IMF. The Funds research shows that before 1999, when several Latin American countries floated their previously fixed currencies and adopted inflation targeting, large depreciations were associated with very high rates of inflation. Now the average pass-through in these countries is below 10% (ie, if the currency depreciates by 10%, domestic prices will rise by less than 1%).

Mexicos central bank also raised its interest rate last month even though inflation is below its target. The peso has been clobbered by the fall in the oil price and by the weakness of manufacturing in the United States, to which Mexicos economy is closely linked. Because the peso is very liquid and trades round the clock offshore, betting against it seems to be the path of least resistance for currency traders, says Luis Arcentales of Morgan Stanley, a bank.

Mexicos central bank also announced that it would start intervening at its discretion in the currency market. So is it now targeting the exchange rate, rather than inflation? Not really: it was worried that the speed of peso depreciation would feed expectations of higher inflation down the road. By acting forcefully today it will probably need to tighten less later on, says Mr Arcentales.

The currency depreciations of the past two years are the first big test for inflation targeting in Latin America. One can argue whether individual central banks should have tightened monetary policy earlier or later. The big picture is that those countries that have been serious about inflation targeting are adapting to a tougher external environment at much less cost than those that have not been. They, at least, have learned the lessons of the 1980s.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Approved by mothers-in-law,[],"ITS motorbikes may not be the best that India produces, in terms of performance or reliability, and they are certainly not the cheapest, but no other brand comes close to matching Royal Enfields cult following. Gul Panag, a Bollywood star-turned-politician, is often seen, as pictured, riding her Enfield. When she got married in 2011, her groom swept her off to their honeymoon in a Royal Enfield with sidecar.

Indeed, it is said that owning one of the bikes can improve a young Indian mans marriage prospects. They tend to be driven by sensible types, in contrast with those who get their kicks by showing off on flashy sports bikes, such as the KTM Duke 390. Owners of Enfields lavish care and attention on them, diligently polishing each spoke on their wheels. Prospective mothers-in-law find this reassuring.

Royal Enfield claims to be the worlds oldest motorbike-maker in continuous production. Its history goes back to colonial times, when it was the Indian offshoot of a British firm. Indian-owned since the 1950s, it has long outlived its parent.

In its early days of independence it was kept going with orders from the Indian army and police, which used it to patrol rough border terrain. Now consumers drive sales: in February more than 49,000 Enfields were sold, up by 63% on a year earlier. That month there was a frisson of excitement in Indias business press when the market capitalisation of the manufacturers parent company, Eicher Motors, briefly overtook that of Harley-Davidson, an equally admired American bike brand, having already surpassed it by sales volume. In Delhi, enthusiasts from across the world flock to rent Enfields for rides through the Himalayas. Other bikes may be speedier on the highways and sip less fuel, but only an Enfield can survive such rugged terrain, not your Harley-Davidsons, sniffs one fan.

Yet as recently as 2000 the parent company was planning to close Royal Enfield down. Frequent breakdowns, oil leaks, engine seizures, electrical failures and poor service had dented the bikes reputation and burned much of the companys cash. Sales were down to just 2,000 a month. A third-generation member of the family that controls the group, Siddhartha Lalwho had ridden to his own wedding on an Enfield instead of the traditional horsepersuaded his father to give him a chance to revive the brand.

Over the years Mr Lal made a number of changes to the bike without compromising on what had made it so popular. The gold piping on their petrol tanks is still painted by hand. But mechanical carburettors have been replaced with electronic fuel-injection on most models, to improve mileage and prevent breakdowns, especially at high altitudes. The cast-iron engine was replaced by an aluminium one to reduce oil leaks. When this affected the sound of the bikes legendary thump, foreign consultants were called in to fix things. The thump is one of the bikes biggest selling-points: some buyers pay workshops to tinker with their new bikes to make it even louder.

Investment in increasing production capacity, in the firms southern home city of Chennai, has helped it meet surging demand, though there is a waiting-list of up to four months on some models. When their bike finally arrives, buyers sometimes hand out sweets in their workplace, as if celebrating the arrival of their first-born. K. Krishnamani, a forty-something manager at a logistics firm in Mumbai, now on his second Enfield, describes how riding his bike makes him feel as royal as the makers name. On the road, anybody will stop and give way to you. That is the liberty you have when you ride Enfield.",[]

After the results came in from Mississippi and Michigan, the biggest of four states to hold primary votes on March 8th, both scenarios looked likelier.

Mr Trump won handsomely, despite having had the worst week of his campaign. He had caused disgust by talking up the size of his penis and alarm by leading a crowd in Orlando in a pledge of allegiance to himself, accompanied by a fascist-style salute. He had been castigated by Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee in 2012, as a phony, a fraud. On March 5th he was trounced by Ted Cruz in Kansas and Maine, where he had been predicted to win. It seemed Peak Trump had passed; Michigan and Mississippi showed it has not.

Mr Trump bagged more than the 59 delegates he needed to stay on track for the nomination there and in Idaho, where he came second to Mr Cruzeven before the results came in from Hawaii, which he also won. And he saw two possible obstacles, Florida and Ohio, where a total of 165 delegates are up for grabs on March 15th, shrivel with the fortunes of their local champions, Marco Rubio and John Kasich. The senator from Florida failed to win any delegate, leaving him with two poxy wins, in Puerto Rico and Minnesota, from 24. Mr Trump has won 15 states; Mr Cruz seven; Mr Kasich, the governor of Ohio, has yet to win any. He says he will quit if he fails to win Ohio; his third-place finish in Michigan, where he campaigned hard, was another blow to that ambition. Winnowing the field to a two-man fight between Mr Trump and Mr Cruz should, in theory, help Mr Cruz. Yet, if Mr Trump wins Florida and Ohio, it may be too late to stop him.

Mr Trumps hope of sweeping the white vote in a general election was buoyed by a bigger upset, among the Democrats. Confounding the pollsterswho had given her a big lead in the stateHillary Clinton lost Michigan to Bernie Sanders. She will probably still win her partys ticket: she has a lead of more than 200 delegates. Yet the manner of her stumble suggests Mrs Clinton could be just the opponent Mr Trump needs.

Her dozen primary wins, including in Mississippi, were mainly founded on huge support from African-Americans. Elsewhere, Mrs Clinton has found the going harder, with Mr Sanderss excoriations of Wall Street and globalisation winning the love of younger and white voters in most states outside the South. Exit polls in Michigan suggested he won 81% of its youngsters. Yet he also cut deep into Mrs Clintons lead among blacks, apparently, in a state that has lost thousands of factory jobs in recent decades, with his anti-globalisation message. He had sought to make this the defining difference between himself and Mrs Clinton, whom he has castigated for supporting trade deals. Mr Sanders duly won majorities of voters worried about the economy and who think international trade has cost America jobs.

This suggests he could win again in a looming series of Midwestern states, including Illinois, Ohio and Wisconsin, prolonging the Democratic contest. More important, Mrs Clintons vulnerability in these states, and on this issue, signals Mr Trumps likeliest path to the presidency. All Democratic-leaning states, they contain the rump of the partys unionised, white working-class support; and Mr Trump, who is as protectionist as Mr Sanders, could conceivably storm that bastion. Mrs Clinton needs a better answer to the economic discontentment Mr Sanders and Mr Trump are drawing on. At this late stage in the contest, it will be hard to find without resorting to populism herself. Free traders could be in for a wretched few months.

Yet Mr Trump gave little thought to that encouragement in the bizarre victory speech he delivered in Florida, at one of his golf clubs. Stung by criticism of his business record, he took the opportunity to showcase some of the many products he has hawked: Trump wine, Trump vodka, Trump water and Trump steaks. Trump steaks. Where are the steaks? Do we have steak? We have Trump steak, rambled Mr Trump, sounding like a presenter on The Shopping Channel. Strangely, his meat business seems to have been non-functioning since 2007. So if the beef was his, it was unfit for consumption. For Mr Trump and America, it seems, the steaks have never been higher.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-12 00:00:00,"Desperate times, desperate measures",[],"A DEAL born of political desperation and fraught with practical, legal and ethical difficulties. That would seem to be a fair description of the agreement hammered out between Germany and Turkey to tackle the refugee crisis, which was endorsed by European Union leaders and Turkeys beaming prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, on March 7th. Last year 1.2m people entered Europe from Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Without concerted action at least as many are expected to try to follow them this year.

The idea behind the agreement is to smash the business model of the people-smugglers. Any migrants landing on a Greek island after making the short but perilous voyage across the Aegean Sea will automatically be sent back to Turkey, where they will be put at the back of the queue of those seeking asylum. To relieve the pressure on Turkey, which has taken in 2.7m refugees since Syrias civil war began five years ago, for each Syrian returned another whose asylum application has been properly processed will be allowed to enter the EU under an official resettlement scheme. If all goes to plan, migrants may be more reluctant to hand over their life savings to criminal networks and risk their lives making the crossing in capsize-prone inflatable boats.

Despite a recent slight drop, the number of people crossing the Aegean remains high (see chart). According to the International Organisation for Migration, more than 320 people have already drowned this year. Last week 25 died off the Turkish coast, including 13 children. For those who do make it across, conditions along the land part of the route have worsened. On the border of Macedonia, which has been closed to refugees since March 9th, thousands are waiting in squalid camps. Stemming the flow is of utmost urgency.

For Germanys chancellor, Angela Merkel, faced with important state elections, the political stakes have become much higher (see article). Mrs Merkels welcoming stance to refugees, which at first caught the national mood, has since strengthened opponents in her own party and dented her popularity.

Turkeys government has made the most of the EUs predicament. On March 4th a court placed the countrys largest-circulation newspaper, Zaman, under state control; its real crime, it seems, was to have links to Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim leader based in Americaonce an ally of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but now a rival. This latest authoritarian excess elicited only the mildest murmur of concern from the EUs diplomatic service.

The terms extracted by Mr Davutoglu in his negotiations with Mrs Merkel are generous. They include the speeding up of a $3.3 billion payment pledged in October, with the sum eventually being doubled, to help pay for better conditions in Turkeys refugee camps over the next three years; the opening of five new chapters in long-stalled discussions about Turkeys bid to become a member of the EU; and the relaxation of visa requirements for Turkish citizens entering the EU.

All this has attracted plenty of criticism, though the deal could still be amended by European leaders next week before it is finalised at another summit on March 17th. Many are shocked that the EU has made such a lavish offer when Mr Erdogan has nothing but contempt for Europes values and is undermining the independence of Turkeys courts and media. Some EU members, particularly those with strong right-wing parties, regard visa-free travel as very sensitive and problematic, says Camino Mortera-Martinez of the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank.

The legality of the proposal has also been questioned. Filippo Grandi, the head of the UN refugee agency, told the European Parliament he was deeply concerned about any arrangement that would involve the blanket return of anyone from one country to another without spelling out the refugee protection safeguards under international law. Lawyers are bound to challenge whether Turkey can be declared a safe third country. Under Turkish law, only those fleeing from Europe are granted refugee status, although temporary protection has been given to Syrians. Turkey has deportation agreements with some countries, including Afghanistan, that others consider to be war zones.

It is also far from clear whether the deal, if it is indeed agreed upon, can be implemented. The forcible deportation of many thousands of people from Greece will be a logistical nightmare. Much is made of the increasing NATO naval presence in the Aegean since February. The alliances mission, though, is not to turn back refugee-laden boats, but to provide real-time intelligence to Frontex, Europes struggling border agency, and to Turkish and Greek coastguards which, for long-standing historical reasons, find co-operation difficult. It is also unclear who will decide who gets into Europe. Will that be left to Turkey or will EU officials set up shop in the refugee camps? Finally, an equitable quota-based system for distributing refugees around Europe remains as far away as ever.

Yet for all the unease and scepticism, this rather tawdry agreement may be Europes last chance of regaining some control over the crisis. Somehow, it will have to be made to work.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Interrogating Lula,[],"YOU dont have to be Brazilian to have been astonished by the events of recent days. In the early hours of March 4th police showed up at an apartment block in Sao Bernardo do Campo, near Sao Paulo, and took away for questioning a former president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is beloved by many for his humble origins and his pro-poor policies. They were looking for evidence that Lula and his associates benefited from the gargantuan bribery scandal centred on Petrobras, the state-controlled oil company (see article). Five days later, in a separate case, prosecutors charged the former president with hiding his ownership of a beachfront flat.

Dozens of politicians suspected of taking bribes, and businessmen thought to have paid them, have been caught up in the Petrobras scandal. Lula, president from 2003 to 2013, is the most consequential figure among them. He denies wrongdoing. On March 8th Marcelo Odebrecht, former head of Brazils biggest construction company, was sentenced to more than 19 years in prison for corrupt dealings with Petrobras.

Brazilians take consolation from seeing the rich and powerful held to account. Sergio Moro, a judge who is leading lava jato (car wash), the main investigation into the scandal, is a hero to many. But the scandal is also the focus of a ferocious political battle between the left-wing Workers Party (PT), to which both Lula and his successor as president, Dilma Rousseff, belong, and an opposition composed of disparate political parties and popular movements.

Lulas detention and the filing of charges against him have escalated those hostilities. Anti-government groups are to hold demonstrations on March 13th to renew their demand that Ms Rousseff be impeached. Her allies intend to hold counter-protests on the same day. Both camps are in danger of forgetting that justice is, or ought to be, blind. PT politicians accuse prosecutors of plotting a coup. But the oppositions demands for impeachment have also raced ahead of evidence that would justify such a drastic step. The one charge that has stuck, that Ms Rousseff used accounting tricks to hide the true size of the deficit in 2014, does not provide legal grounds for evicting her from office.

Waxing and waning: Brazil's economic woes, in charts

Brazilians rarely settle their political differences through violence, but the ferocity on both sides risks damaging the consensus that underpins the countrys admirable democracy. The PT and its allies are the worst offenders. After Lulas detention the partys leader in the lower house of Congress declared a political war. In a tweet it later erased, the PT called Lula a political prisoner. At the same time, in forcibly detaining Lula, rather than asking him to volunteer to be questioned, Mr Moro may also have gone too far. A supreme-court justice accused him of breaking basic rules.

Keep calm, and carry on investigating

The Petrobras scandal could yet fell the government. The electoral court is looking into whether Ms Rousseffs re-election campaign in 2014 was financed with money siphoned off from the oil company. If so, the court could annul the election and call a new one, which any candidate from the PT would almost certainly lose.

A new government would stand a better chance of pulling Brazil out of its morass. Faced with a choice between sane economics and political survival, Ms Rousseff has chosen the latter. She has backpedalled on fiscal reforms, which alone can restore confidence in an economy suffering its worst recession since the 1930s. Her departure would, surely, be cause for celebrationbut only if it comes about through the courts or the ballot box, not cynical political machinations.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,High tech meets low finance,[],"TECHNOLOGY ought to have revolutionised finance more than any other industry. After all, modern money is mostly an entry on a computercapable of being transmitted instantly and virtually costlessly around the world. Stockmarket activity is now dominated by high-frequency traders, who make deals faster than they can blink.

The finance sector spends more on technology, as a proportion of its revenues, than any other industry. Nevertheless, compared with the world of e-commerce, banking still sometimes gives the impression of a Volkswagen Beetle instead of a Formula 1 racing car. It took many years of effort to get to a world of T+2, where securities are settled two days after the trade is made, rather than the T+3 system that preceded it.

The international payments system still looks like a spaghetti junction, in the words of Andrew Haldane, the Bank of Englands chief economist, with money passing through several hands on the way from payer to recipient. The annual revenues earned by the banking system for processing payments are huge, at $1.7 trillion, and rising (see chart).

One reason for this inefficiency is that technology has been tacked on to a centuries-old banking model. Much bank spending on technology is devoted to maintaining existing systems, a desperate effort to keep the show on the road.

Hence the hype around fintechthe hope that the whole system can be overhauled by disruptive innovators, much as Uber is revolutionising the taxi business and Airbnb is taking on hotels. Fintech firms operate in many areas, from digital payments to automated wealth management. But at a London Business School conference this week, the greatest excitement was reserved for blockchain technology. A blockchain is a distributed ledger under which transaction records are held by a wide number of participants in a network; it is the technology behind Bitcoin, a digital currency.

Technology experts seem to think a distributed ledger is more secure. A hacker would be required to break into a wide range of sites rather than a single, central register. But there are doubts over whether such a system could handle the sheer volume of payments in the financial systemhundreds of thousands of transactions every second.

Even if those technological hurdles could be overcome, a register could develop in two different ways. An open system would be good for customers, allowing them to exchange money quickly, cheaply and anonymously. But it would be a nightmare for regulators trying to crack down on tax evasion and money-laundering. No longer would the unscrupulous need to keep high-value notes under the mattress. A supervised system would get round this problem, but it would also give the authorities much more power to pry into peoples financial lives. Customers would understandably be far less keen.

A largely unregulated technology sector is bumping up against a heavily regulated finance industry. The result may be that advances in this area will be slow as regulators clamp down on anything that seems too anarchic. The big banks, conscious of the ability of regulators to fine them for aiding and abetting money-laundering, will proceed with caution.

Susan Athey, an economist with links to Silicon Valley, argues that blockchain technology might be most useful for other purposesto register asset ownership, for example. People in developing countries find it difficult to establish their ownership of land; a reliable digital register could reduce that problem. And a digital land registry in America would eliminate the need for homeowners to pay for expensive title insurance.

Forecasting how new technology will change an industry is never easy. As Bill Gates once said, and tech types constantly repeat: We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten.

But monetary policy may be giving new financial models a lift. Very low interest rates encourage investors to search for yield. One beneficiary is peer-to-peer lending, in which investors extend credit to people and businesses directly. And imagine what would happen if negative interest rates became semi-permanent and were passed on to retail depositorsa tax on bank accounts. The appeal of digital currencies that were out of the reach of central bankers would increase exponentially. Never mind disrupting commercial banks. What about doing the same thing to central banks?",[]
economist.com,2016-03-08 16:03:44,Britain's millennials: The real intergenerational inequity,[],"BRITAIN'S millennials (those roughly between the ages of 18-34) are not doing very well. They have been hit from many different angles. The inflation-adjusted price of a house has risen by over 200% in thirty years. Cue falling home-ownership rates. The young are more likely to be in precarious employment: according to official figures, about 8% of 16- to-24-year-olds are on a ""zero-hours"" contract (ie, with no guaranteed hours), far higher than the ratio in any other age group.

On the question of millennials' income, though, I think people have gone a little astray. Last January the Institute for Fiscal Studies released a report which found that:

For employees aged 60 and older, median real hourly pay in 2014 was back to its 2008 level, but for those aged 22-29 it was still 9% lower than in 2008.

Today, The Guardian has published an article showing that while the growth in disposable income for Britons aged 25-29 is two percentage points below the average growth rate, for those aged 70-74 it is 66 percentage points higher.

It is revealing that both sources compare young folk with those near or in retirement. By doing so they highlight a much more blatant form of generational inequality. Look at the chart, based on data from the Luxembourg Income Study (the same source as the one used by The Guardian), which shows household disposable income by age group.

It is not entirely clear that millennials have been doing that badly in recent decades. The 18-24 look terrible, but bear in mind that higher education was expanding rapidly during this period so more people would have been students, not working. In 1979-2010, British women aged 25-34 saw their disposable income rise faster than those aged 35-44 and 45-54. Of course, this chart does not consider the cost of housing, which takes a big chunk out of millennials' incomes; but still, it presents a more positive picture of millennials' economic fortunes than most people would predict.

An even bigger inequality, it seems to me, is between oldies and the rest. The average pensioner now has a higher income than the average working person. The welfare state has lavished them with goodies. And they are increasingly coveted as employees. Millennials are certainly struggling, though perhaps not as much as oldies are thriving.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,For whom the bubble blows,[],"SHANGHAI, Chinas financial centre, does not make it easy on outsiders wishing to buy homes. Non-residents who are single are banned from buying property. The married are welcome but only so long as they have paid local taxes for two years and make nearly a third of the purchase in cash. Shenyang, Chinas biggest northern city, is far more welcoming. Anyone can buy a home there. All to little effect: housing prices in Shanghai, five times more expensive than those in Shenyang, have risen by 20% over the past year; those in the northern city have edged down.

This bifurcation is a worry for the government, which wants to spur growth without inflating bubbles. A divergence in housing prices between wealthy cities and the hinterland is a familiar problem in other countriesjust look at London and Lincolnshire, say, or New York and Nebraska. But the divisions are starker in China. In its most prosperous cities, already giddy prices continue to shoot up, while unsold flats pile up in markets where valuations were low to begin with. Moreover, construction has long been one of the economys main engines, accounting for as much as a quarter of GDP growth until recently. This makes it especially important that the government get the balance right. Doing so is proving hard.

Over the past half-year, the government has unveiled a series of measures to support the housing market that specifically exclude Chinas five hottest markets (Beijing, Guangzhou, Sanya, Shanghai and Shenzhen). People buying homes need only make a 20% down-payment to obtain a mortgage, except in the five conurbations, where they must put down 30%. By the same token, in most of the country transaction taxes have been cut by as much as two-thirds for people buying second homes; in the five outliers they have been left unchanged. In Shenzhen, a southern tech hub that is the frothiest market, with prices up by 53% in the past year alone, local officials have vowed to crack down on speculators and expand the supply of affordable housing.

The results of this two-tier system have been meagre so far. The frenzy in the biggest cities stems from the central banks steady loosening of monetary policy over the past 18 months. Although warranted from an economic perspective, it was inevitable that low interest rates would drive asset prices higher. Initially, much of the credit pumped out by banks ended up in the stockmarket, but following its crash last summer, property beckoned as one of the few decent investment options in China (capital controls, which have been further tightened recently, make it hard for Chinese savers to invest their money abroad).

For speculators looking at property, the excess supply in smaller cities was all too evident, so they turned instead to the megalopolises. Du Jinsong of Credit Suisse describes it as a form of groupthink. Everybodyinvestors, developers, policymakers and bankersthinks that first-tier cities are safe, he says.

Even as the government tries to restrain the excesses, however, it does not want to snuff out the rally in the big cities altogether, for they tend to influence sentiment elsewhere. There are signs that this is beginning to happen. Housing prices started rising month on month in the biggest cities a year ago. In midsized cities (in China, those with populations of 5m-10m), prices have been rising for the past four months. In smaller cities (mere hamlets of 1m-5m), gains have been evident only for the past two months (see chart).

If this upturn lasts, some investors reckon it will spur construction. Commodities used to build apartment blocks, such as iron (girders) and copper (wires), have recovered slightly from their recent swoon, partly in the hope that Chinas property market is also stirring (see article). Indeed, a series of mini-cycles in the Chinese housing sector over the past decade followed this sort of pattern: rising housing sales led to new building starts, which in turn pushed commodity prices higher.

Figures from the China Index Academy, a data provider, show that the stock of unsold homes has decreased recently, from nearly 30 months worth of sales early last year to 15 now. A housing market with rising volume and prices clearly does not support the view that, on a macro level, Chinas housing market is oversupplied, notes Liang Hong of China International Capital Corp, an investment bank.

But there is a further vast increment of supply on the verge of coming to market, because developers slowed the pace of construction in recent years and in some cases halted it altogether. There were 4.7 trillion square metres of housing under construction but not yet available for sale at the end of last year, up by 25% from the end of 2011; 452 billion square metres of housing were on sale, nearly three times as much as at the end of 2011. Some provinces and cities are drafting plans to convert unsold homes into subsidised housing for poorer residents. Xi Jinping, Chinas president, has said that reducing property inventory is a battle of annihilation that must be won to revitalise the economy. Revived demand for new construction, in short, is a long way off.

The exception is sure to be Chinas biggest cities, where there clearly is an imbalance between supply and demand. Shenzhen and Shanghai, in particular, are popular with the young and the highly educated, just the kinds of people that push up housing prices. They are two of Chinas best-run cities, offering good transport links, good jobs and, by Chinese standards, good air. Unsold housing inventories cover just about five months of demand at the current pace of sales, indicating that more construction is needed.

Even with these strong fundamentals, it is hard to justify a 50% surge in housing prices over the past year. Regulators suspect that there has been some foul play. This week they said they would target online lenders that have made loans to homebuyers to cover their down-payments; these loans have, in theory, allowed speculators to buy homes entirely with borrowed cash, in contravention of the minimum down-payment requirements.

But reining in animal spirits is a hard task. At the Baoshan Property Trading Centre, where people buying homes in a district of northern Shanghai must go to register their purchases, crowds have swelled to such a size that the local government has deployed police to keep the peace. On one recent day a phalanx of security officers in white helmets stood guard alongside barricades as people lined up to submit their documentation. One of those queuing, Wang Jie, bought a new apartment for 2m yuan ($307,000) in October, and has watched its value soar by another 1m since then. No one seems to buy when prices are falling, he chuckled. But everyone does when they start rising.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,The necessity of culture,[],"THE Mausoleum of Augustus in Rome is a sad place: fenced off and closed to visitors. In most other countries this huge tomb in the city centre would be a treasured national monument. Yet for years the only use Romans made of it was to take their dogs to relieve themselves in the encircling weeds. The latest plans to restore it were approved in 2007. But it was only last month that some of the funding was set aside. With a new mayor due to be elected soon, the money might yet be diverted elsewhere.

The plight of the final resting place of Romes first emperor illustrates an irony. The European states with the greatest ancient cultural heritage, Italy and Greece, are those whose governments spend least on the preservation of that heritage and promotion of the arts. In 2013 spending on culture accounted for 0.2% of public expenditure in Greece, the lowest share of any EU country, and a measly 0.6% in Italy, the second-lowest, jointly with Portugal and Britain. Cultures most avid patrons were the Renaissance men and women of the government of Latvia, who gave it 3.2% of their budget.

The parsimony of Italy and Greece is partly connected with their economic difficulties. They are the member states with the heaviest public debts (133% and 179% of GDP respectively). Some of the severest cuts prompted by the euro-zone crisis were made in their culture budgets. But even before the upheaval, Italy and Greece had a propensity for low official spending on culture, which was all the more damaging since private funding has traditionally been scorned in both countries.

Culture has special relevance at a moment when Europeans are questioning their common identity more intensely than at any time since the second world war. There are two arguments for the claim that Europeans have more in common than base economic self-interest. One, promoted by the former pope, Benedict XVI, emphasises the continents Christian heritage. But many Europeans are understandably wary of defining themselves in terms of religion when Europe is secularising rapidly, and when many of its enemies use religion as a badge of identity.

An alternative argument reaches back to classical times and finds in the Roman empire and Greek philosophy the continents earliest unification and common beliefs, most notably in democracy. Like other founding myths, this one contains a fair measure of wishful thinking: Plato was no fan of democracy. Even so, the classical narrative that weaves through history from ancient Athens by way of the Renaissance to the Enlightenment and beyond offers an identity for Europe rooted in cultural and intellectual, as well as religious, values. Culture is frequently cited by Greek and Italian officials as an implied reproach to uncouth northerners obsessed with rules: kicking either state out of the euro zone would be tantamount to Europe ripping out its heart.

Recently, however, the two countries approaches have diverged markedly. The most dramatic evidence was provided by Matteo Renzi, Italys prime minister. Soon after jihadists from Islamic State attacked Paris last year he declared that Italy would counter terrorism with 1 billion ($1.1 billion) to be spent on culture, to match 1 billion on extra security. As with many of Mr Renzis announcements, there was small print: his finance minister later explained the extra spending was dependent on the European Commissions agreement to more budget flexibility.

Even so, it was still a touching act of defiance against the murderously irrational and faith in the role culture can play in resisting it. With or without the blessing of the commission, this year Mr Renzi has approved a 27% increase in the culture ministrys budget, to 2 billion (though it falls thereafter).

Its energetic minister, Dario Franceschini, is trying to boost the involvement of the private sector and increase the interest of youngsters in their heritage. A tax break for cultural sponsorship is to be extended indefinitely. The government plans to give a card worth 500 to every 18-year-old for spending only at theatres, museums, bookshops and archaeological sites.

In Greece the situation is radically different. Over 800,000 refugees arrived there in 2015. Trying to deal with this crisis, as well as pushing through pension reforms and bringing down national debt, has absorbed much of the governments time and energy.

But another reason why so little cash is available for culture is a view that Greeces heritage is solely a matter of national concern. Greece exists because of its heritage: other Europeans decided that, because of that heritage, it should be freed from Ottoman rule, says Evangelos Kyriakidis of the Initiative for Heritage Conservation, a research organisation. The state lays claim to total ownership of the past: take a metal detector to hunt for ancient coins, as you can in many countries, and in Greece you could wind up in jail. Private cultural initiatives, even those funded by Greeks, are often met with disdain.

Wine-dark seas

Yet the state can no longer afford to protect all of the nations treasures. The archaeological service is overwhelmed. Of more than 10,000 formally recognised sites, fewer than 200 are open.

Just as greater European involvement is needed to resolve the migration crisis, so there could be a case for closer European co-operation in cultural matters. The inauguration in June of an excavated site on Crete will make the point well. The EU provided more than 90% of the funds for one of the few on-site museums in Greece. Nikos Stampolidis, a professor of archaeology at the University of Crete who has made the excavation his lifes work, says the museum at Eleftherna will shine a light into what archaeologists have chosen to call the Greek Dark Ages, before the Classical period. That encompasses the time when Homer wrote. As Europe appears to fall into its own, darker period, what better way to celebrate shared, but increasingly questioned values than a museum that illuminates the times of its first great writer?",[]

We are powerless to foment a revolution while working two part-time jobs to make ends meet, so all we can do is register a protest against the Dickensian nightmare that the elites have created for us by voting. Apparently, nobody listened (Republican or Democrat) to what we were trying to say in 2012. Come November, youll be hearing from us again, louder and clearer.

I say we look to Plato, as quoted by Cicero in On Duties: keep the good of the people clearly in view and care for the welfare of the whole body politic and not the interests of one party. Mr Trump may not fit your image of what an American president should be, but the American people crave a leader who has the interests of the body politic at heart, not the interests of a party. But, you may wonder, are we another Weimar Republic looking to fill a vacuum of leadership and greatness?

PETER ROBERTS

Although it may have been true in the past to refer to the Republicans as one of the worlds great political parties, this is no longer the case. This is a party which has promoted some of Mr Trumps more noxious ideas, just in coded language. It has abandoned its responsibility to govern. The prospect of a President Trump is indeed worrying, but after years of nativism and cynically pandering to the baser instincts of the masses, Mr Trump is the candidate the Republican Party deserves.

The debates and the election have turned into a reality TV show, perfect for a media feeding-frenzy. No wonder Mr Trump is winning. He understands how to entice the media and their fascination with the Kardashians and their ilk. Im not worried.

When President Trump takes on Xi Jinping over the South China Sea, what chance will President Xi have? What does he know of celebrity TV? Well destroy them in the ratings.

From the Tower to the White House (February 20th) stated that Mr Trump was sensible enough to get out of casinos in Atlantic City. With each successive bankruptcy of his casino company (four in total), his ownership interest was diluted down to practically nothing. Im not sure that this qualifies as a sensible exit, although Mr Trump continues to portray his serial bankruptcies as a brilliant strategy.

An end in sight

* Thank you so much for your article highlighting the Global Trachoma Mapping Project (Now is the time to say goodbye, February 27th). The agony of the trachoma infection (dubbed blinking hell at Sightsavers) is profound and the blindness it causes impacts both individuals and their communities.



Never have I seen such an amazing example of collaboration and determination. Some 24 organisations (NGOs and academicsand notably the International Trachoma Initiative in Atlanta) worked together, along with the World Health Organisation, to make the mapping happen. The Ministries of Health in these 29 countries all provided resources and agreed to standard processes on data management and methodologies. Approximately 2,500 people were involved altogethera great featand it should be a model for disease mapping in the future. The British government provided most of the money but as the project expanded the American government stepped in to helpa brilliant example of coordination between donor nations.

Programmes are in place to fight the infection and we have at least some of the money needed.



Now we know exactly where the suffering from this disease is, lets seize the moment and confine trachoma to the history books where it belongs.

Know thyself

* You assert that American states such as South Dakota and Nevada carry strong secrecy laws and weak oversight but fail to provide the substance to back the claim (The Biggest Loophole of All, February 20th). Instead you validate the assertion with vague statements derived from Die Zeit, the German newspaper, noting that Everyone is doing or looking into it. This is both an intellectual and geographic stretch.



In Nevada, both financial institutions and trust companies exist in a strong, stable jurisdiction and are governed by many state and federal anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, and bank secrecy reporting requirements. Furthermore, annual on-site examinations are lengthy and thorough. Every Nevada institution must know their client before ever putting them on the books. This means that Nevadas trust companies offer both strong privacy protection for clients and they adhere to effective government oversighta combination that is clearly attractive to the legitimate global elite, not those of dubious legality.

The situation in the Maldives

You suggest that criminal charges against opposition politicians in the Maldives are overblown (Archipelago of ire, February 20th). In fact, the charge against the former president is very clear: ordering the arrest of a judge for releasing one of his political critics, a crime he has publicly admitted to. Charges against another Islamist politician stem from his call for violence against the police.

The current president, Abdulla Yameen, is confronted with political opponents with scant regard for the law, yet he personally wants multiparty talks, under foreign mediation, to reconcile the challenges the Maldives faces. This initiative did not feature in your piece, and neither did the views expressed by British members of Parliament who visited recently: that it is the claims of opposition politicians, from prison numbers to the threat from terrorism and more, that are overblown. Our government was voted into office in an election recognised by the international community as free and fair, another detail that is too often overlooked.

English commercial law

You repeated the canard that commercial law firms benefit from the courts (Law in a time of austerity, February 27th). A more nuanced point might be that English law firms have benefited from the long cultural tradition of English law which has allowed them to build immensely successful international practices, but again the point is too simplistic. The partners in the great English commercial law firms started investing their own money in foreign offices and banging the international drum for the use of English law 40 years ago. Without that personal investment, English law, and its courts, judges, barristers and English commercial law firms, would have remained domestic and parochial, irrespective of its long heritage. With that investment, the international practice of law is one of the few British business sectors where we can claim to be a world leader, with commercial firms generating 1% of Britains GDP and a trade surplus of over 3 billion ($4.3 billion).

* You said that Bodies such as the Law Society and the Bar Council often act as much to protect their members interests as to regulate them. The Bar Council delegated responsibility for regulating barristers to the independent Bar Standards Board in 2006. As the representative body for barristers in England and Wales the Bar Council acts in its members interests as well as in the public interest. For example: in relation to challenging proposals to restrict judicial review; supporting the removal of the criminal courts charge; and safeguarding access to justice especially for the poorest and most vulnerable in society.



The Bar thrives on competition. Through the lower overhead structure of chambers, compared with the traditional law firm model, barristers services are increasingly reaching consumers including through Direct Access and through the provision of unbundled services which offer value for money. These actions are not driven by self-interest but by our mission to ensure that justice is available for all.

The puck of the Irish

The photo you used of Xi Jinping kicking a football, in a story about Chinas spending on foreign players, was taken in Dublins Croke Park, the headquarters of the Gaelic Athletic Association (Patriotic goal, February 27th). The GAA is the governing body for Irelands popular indigenous sports of hurling, handball and Gaelic football. Founded in 1884, it has helped heal divisions and nurture community spirit. It would be difficult to overstate the role it continues to play in Irish life. Today, Gaelic games are played throughout the world and GAA clubs support the Irish diaspora. If Mr Xi needs a reminder of the benefits of this spirit he should visit his own local club, Beijing GAA.

RONAN MURPHY

Mr Xi may dream that China could one day lift the World Cup, but with only 33 teams (31 county teams, and teams from London and New York), it might be more realistic for China to try and win the coveted All-Ireland Gaelic football title. Indeed, one player with Chinese links, Jason Sherlock, who has an Irish mother and a father from Hong Kong, succeeded in winning the title with Dublin in 1995.

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,The Economist,[],"FOR Hillary Clinton, losing Michigans Democratic primary to Bernie Sanders was a nuisance. For pollsters, in contrast, the election was Armageddon. Eight different firms had surveyed the state in the previous month, and every one gave Mrs Clinton a double-digit lead. According FiveThirtyEight, a data-journalism website that had put Mrs Clintons chances of victory at greater than 99%, the 23-percentage-point gap between her average lead in the polls and the final result was the biggest error since Gary Harts victory in the 1984 New Hampshire Democratic primary.

What went wrong? To produce a misfire of this magnitude, just about everything. Pollsters both underestimated how favourable the electorate would be to Mr Sandersaccording to the exit poll, it was younger, more male and included more independents than expectedand how big a share of each group he would capture. He lost black voters by merely a 2.4-to-one margin, half as big as his shortfalls among African-Americans in the South. And he limited his deficit among voters who earn more than $100,000 to three percentage points (it was 36 in Virginia).

Projecting the composition of the Michigan electorate was always going to be tough, since it was the first state in the rustbelt to vote this year, and it has not had a competitive Democratic primary since 1992. No live-interview surveys were conducted after a TV debate, preventing any measurement of its impact. Unseasonably warm weather could have boosted turnout and increased the share of less-reliable, Sanders-loving young voters. And complacent supporters of Mrs Clinton, expecting an easy victory, may have switched sides to meddle with their general-election opponents instead: 7% of voters in the Republican primary were self-identified Democrats. Now that the pollsterswho had previously performed fairly well this year by volatile primary standards (see chart), and did get Michigans Republican vote spot-onhave some egg on their faces, they are likely to pay extra attention to these factors before the upcoming votes in nearby Illinois and Ohio.

On the other hand, some red flags could have been spotted in advance. One-third of the polling average published by RealClearPolitics, and one-quarter of FiveThirtyEights, came from automated, fixed-line-phone surveys conducted by Mitchell, a Michigan firm. The samples demographic sub-groups were re-weighted to match targets provided by Mark Grebner, a consultant whose main business is selling voter lists in local elections. Mr Grebner foresaw an electorate resembling a retirement community, with 88% of voters aged 40 or older and 76% at least 50. Since elderly Democrats adore Mrs Clinton, the two Mitchell polls taken shortly before the vote duly estimated her lead at 27 and 37 percentage points, boosting her average.

However, the assumptions underlying the Mitchell numbers were inconsistent with exit-polls from northern states. Around half of Democratic voters were under 50 in each of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont. (The final number in the Michigan exit poll was 53%.) Had Mitchell simply copied the New England ratios, its forecast lead for Mrs Clintons would have shrunk to the mid-teens, the same range calculated by its competitors like Marist, YouGov and Monmouth. Such figures still would have left Mr Sanders a big underdog, but not a hopeless one.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Abe agonistes,[],"WHEN Shinzo Abe last called a snap general election, just two years after coming to power in 2012, Japans prime minister saw an opposition in disarray and a chance to consolidate seats in the Diet. Yet he presented the election as a matter of high principle: in the face of a sluggish economy he had chosen to delay a long-agreed rise in Japans consumption (value-added) tax, and such a portentous decision required the peoples approval. Mr Abe won handily. Now, principle appears to demand yet another election soon.

That is because, with an economy refusing to show any bounce, Mr Abe may well announce that he is putting off the tax hike (from 8% to 10% and promised for April 2017) a second time. Perhaps he will do so after he hosts a summit for G7 leaders in May. Precedent would make it very hard for him not to dissolve the Diet and announce a general election over the matter. The betting is that he would fix the election for the same time as a scheduled poll in June or July for half of the seats in the upper house.

Some of his colleagues want Mr Abe to hurry up and call a general election sooner, before his luck runs out. There are challenges on various fronts. The economy is the biggest worry: it shrank by an annualised 1.1% in the final three months of 2015, as consumer spending slowed. To boost demand the central bank announced a policy of negative interest rates in January. But the market reactiona lower stockmarket and a higher yenhas been just the opposite of what was hoped for.

Sooner or later, voters will want to blame Mr Abe for an economy he promised to fix. And there are other policies that are unpopular but for which he has not yet been punished. They include attempts to get Japans nuclear power plants working again after all were shut down following the catastrophic meltdown at Fukushima Dai-ichi five years ago this week. And new security laws passed last year, allowing Japan to take a more robust stance overseas, appear, according to many experts, to be unconstitutional. They certainly make many Japanese uncomfortable.

Adding to the mood of discontent are the political scandals within the ruling party. In January the economy minister, Akira Amari, one of the prime ministers key allies, resigned over a dodgy political donation. And a lawmaker in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) who had made much of his being the first Diet member to take paternity leave turned out to have been having affairs during his wifes pregnancy. Since then the prime ministers approval rating has fallen to below 50%.

As for the consumption tax, a first increase, from 5% to 8% in April 2014, knocked consumer spending. A key economic adviser to the prime minister, Etsuro Honda, now says that postponing the next hike is essential if people are not to lose faith in Mr Abes broader efforts to boost the economy. As it is, after three years of radical monetary easing, core inflation remains around zero, a long way from the central banks target of 2%. Not even Japans trade-union leaders are calling for big wage increases. And banks lending margins remain under pressure. It all threatens Mr Abes promises of a virtuous circle of higher wages, consumption and investmentand raises questions about how the Japanese might vote in the summer.

Plenty of people think that Mr Abe should redouble his efforts to liberalise the economy, including by introducing sweeping reforms to the labour market. He could push much harder to ensure that part-time workers, whose low wages are a drag on consumption, are treated better. But no menu of deeper reforms is about to be revealed, a government official says.

Meanwhile, however, though the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) is working hard to ready candidates for a general election, it is unlikely to gain much ground. It still has miserable levels of popular support: only a tenth of voters back the centre-left party, according to opinion polls, compared with two-fifths for the LDP. The DPJ would highlight a second postponement in the consumption tax hike as a sign that Mr Abes economic plans have failed. But it is unlikely to oppose a postponement, especially if ordinary households are suffering.

In weighing whether or not to call a double election, Mr Abe will consider the chances of a victory large enough to carry through his dream, that of rewriting Japans constitution in ways that erode the pacifist promises, laid down by the American occupiers in the late 1940s, that lie at the heart of it. He says that such a revision is necessary because, seven decades after a disastrous war, Japan no longer deserves to have its hands tied by an outdated pacifism when it lives in an increasingly dangerous neighbourhood.

Abe likes a sound constitution

Changing the constitution would require a two-thirds majority in both houses of the Diet, and a plain majority in a national referendum. The LDP and its coalition partner, Komeito, have more than two-thirds of the lower house, with 325 out of 475 seats, but a narrower majority, of 136 out of 242 seats, in the upper chamber. Mr Abe might pick up seats in the upper house, and also be able to rely on the help of a small right-wing party called Osaka Ishin no Kai. Yet attempting to revise the constitution would still cause deep alarm among the many Japanese who remain enormously proud of their countrys pacifism. In short, the main risk to Mr Abes hopes of securing electoral victory is his inclination to speak lovingly of his plans for constitutional change.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Shops to showrooms,[],"THE Bonobos shop on lower Fifth Avenue, in Manhattan, sits in a row of familiar fashion brands, including J.Crew, Zara and Gap. As at those stores, shoppers at Bonobos can survey racks of clothes, try on this shirt and those trousers, then decide which items to purchase. Unlike in those stores, shoppers at Bonobos may not buy any clothes to take home. When Bonobos first tried this idea, in 2011, it seemed like a lark. The company now has 20 such shops, from Texas to California, and plans to open at least seven more this year.

Bricks-and-mortar stores are in the throes of an identity crisis. The growing threat from online shopping has spurred some physical retailers to do more than just sell goods. Lululemon lures shoppers with both yoga clothes and yoga classes; Louis Vuitton displays fine art beside its frocks. Among the most interesting models to emerge, however, are chains such as Bonobos, whose outlets have no stock to sell.

The idea is to divorce the purchase of a product from its distribution. Until recently, this business model was largely restricted to sellers of big, non-portable things like furniture: people like to examine sofas before they buy them, but they do not fit neatly into shopping bags. Now, clothing retailers are seeing the downsides of conventional shops, too.

If a retailer stores and sells goods in the same place, it must lease space, often in an expensive central location, for the store room as well as the shop floor. Staff may be needed to unpack deliveries overnight, which raises costs further. Employees spend much of the day restocking shelves, which means less attention paid to customers. Companies can never predict perfectly which items will sell in which shops. Inevitably some clothes linger unsold for too long, and must be marked down, which squeezes margins.

Online-only shops have less of a problem with this sort of thing, but there are still many consumers who like to check the fit and the feel of a garment before buying. So Paul Evans and Jack Erwin, two young shoe companies, have showrooms in New York where shoppers can inspect loafers and brogues, then order them online. Warby Parker does the same for glasses.

The most prominent American example is Bonobos, which began as an online-only mens retailer before realising customers wanted shops, too. Its outlets house many styles and many sizes, but not every style in every size. Salesmen have the sole job of helping each shopper find clothes he likes, identify the proper fit and order the clothes online. We do a better job of selling clothes because we dont stock the clothes, boasts Andy Dunn, the firms founder. Bonobos need not guess which trousers will sell at which store. All its stock is at one central warehouse.

In Asia, Zalora offers a variation on this theme. The four-year-old online retailer displays its clothes in pop-up showrooms in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Indonesia and the Philippines. Such temporary installations, explains Tito Costa, Zaloras marketing chief, are a way to build confidence either in a new way of shopping or in a young brand. Shoppers can try on Zaloras clothes, chat with its stylists and order items online, either from computer stations or by scanning a QR code with their phones, using Zaloras app.

It is no coincidence that the companies that are testing out such showrooms began online. Big, established retailers are unlikely to convert stores to showrooms, at least in the foreseeable future. They have trained millions of customers to expect immediate gratificationbuy a Zara dress in the afternoon, for example, and go dancing in it that same evening. Delivering to individuals rather than shipping in bulk to stores would also require established retailers to upend their distribution networks, says Neil Saunders of Conlumino, a consulting firm. But for many younger retailers, selling online and in showrooms may be the future, not least because showrooms are cheaper to run than conventional shops. That means they can open more of them, more quickly.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,What lies beneath,[],"THE breathtaking beauty of the Lake Kivu region, resting between the volcanoes and steep hills of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, is exceeded only by its mercurial temperament. A clear sunny day can turn to a tropical downpour in minutes, before the sun beats down again. The lakes still waters also hide another face: dissolved within are billions of cubic meters of flammable methane and more still of carbon dioxide, the result of volcanic gases seeping in.

Two other lakes, in Cameroon, are filled with deadly carbon dioxide. One of them, Lake Nyos, belched out a huge bubble of it in 1986, asphyxiating about 1,700 people. But Lake Kivu is the only lake anywhere also to contain methane. The mix of gases, held tight by pressure like bubbles in a bottle of fizzy drink, presents both a source of power and a danger to hundreds of thousands of people living around the lake. If it were to froth over, as scientists think it has in the distant past, it could generate huge explosions and smother towns and villages in dense clouds of carbon dioxide.

Now several firms are working to harness the energy and mitigate the dangers by gingerly extracting the methane from the lake. Among them is Contour Global, an American firm with power projects across Africa. In December it started producing power from its KivuWatt project. Below a huge barge is a pipe that sucks up water, from which it extracts and purifies the methane before pumping the less-fizzy water back down.

In time the project will be expanded to produce about 100 megawatts of energy. That is more than half of Rwandas current, inadequate, generating capacity. Other firms are racing to catch up. Symbion Power, another American company, recently signed an agreement with the Rwandan government to build a 50MW power plant that will also run off methane tapped from the lakes waters.

The technology being used to tap the lakes gas is cutting-edge; but this generation of wildcatters is not the first to see power beneath its placid waters. In 1963 an intrepid businessman sent down a small pipe that he used to power a brewery to produce Primus, a light lager with bubbles altogether more palatable than those used to make it.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Ore-inspiring,[],"IN DECEMBER an adviser to Chinas government predicted that GDP growth would soon rebound. Now was a good time, he said, to buy shares in companies that mined copper, nickel and coalthough even he drew the line at investing in iron ore, whose supply was simply too abundant. The adviser sounded insanely bullish back then; he might now rue his caution. On March 7th the price of iron ore jumped by 19%, a record one-day rise, in a sign of renewed optimism about Chinas growth.

The spike in the iron-ore price came hard on the heels of a speech by Li Keqiang, Chinas prime minister, to the annual National Peoples Congress in Beijing. In it, Mr Li announced a punchy GDP growth target of 6.5-7% for 2016, along with the means he hoped would secure it: a bigger budget deficit than had been planned for last year and faster credit growth.

With sufficient stimulus China will avoid a sharp economic slowdown. But Mr Li did not simply open the macroeconomic spigots. He hinted that the fiscal boost would be designed to help rebalance the economy: China is aiming for just 3% growth in government revenue this year, suggesting that more of the deficit will come from tax cuts to private firms. He made clear that reforms to reduce overcapacity in low-end and inefficient industries were a priority. And by switching from a single-figure growth target to a range, Mr Li gave himself more flexibility in trading off some GDP growth for more reform.

Look closer, though, and there is little sign of any real commitment to reform (see article). Promises to slim industries such as steel and coal sound toughthe government expects nearly 2m workers will be laid offbut the planned reduction would make only a small dent in oversupply. Instead the government seems to be doubling down on its well-worn recipe of debt- and investment-fuelled growth.

Reaching the goal of 6.5-7% GDP growth will require either a fudging of the figures or investment in projects of dubious worth. A second train line to remote and mountainous Tibet is planned. Banks are being leant on to juice up the economy. Credit is growing at twice the rate of nominal GDP, in a country already overburdened by private debt. A big increase in the money supply will put downward pressure on Chinas currency, which in turn will lead either to a rapid rundown in foreign-exchange reserves or a devaluation.

In theory, Chinas capital controls can ease the pressure, by making it harder for money to leave the country. And the latest figures suggest they are becoming more effective. Reserves dropped by just $29 billion in February, to $3.2 trillion, after three months of heavier falls. But even if China can successfully police its financial borders, rapid credit growth will fuel asset prices at home. Wary of the stockmarket, investors with cash to spare see property as the safest bet. Unregulated online lenders are helping them pile on leverage, skirting rules requiring minimum down-payments on homes. There are worrying signs of a bubble in several big cities: house prices in Shenzhen have risen by 53% in the past year (see article).

Supporting a sagging economy with cheap money and tax cuts is sensible. But China also needs to put in place the structural reforms that will make such stimulus both more effective and less destabilising.

The manana strategy

The default of a few of the most hopeless state-owned enterprises, something Mr Li again promised in his speech, would set a useful precedent. It might also nudge banks into lending to profitable businesses instead of firms they expect to be bailed out by government. New homes with few ready buyers in lower-tier cities should be turned into social housing; better that than trying to pump up a broader property bubble to clear unsold stocks. In places where house prices are soaring, the government should summon the courage to introduce a long-discussed property tax to cool speculation. And now would be a good time to recapitalise Chinas banks in readiness for a write-down of the latent bad debts on their balance-sheets.

Yet the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, apparently wishes to avoid even mild turbulence in the economy, at least until he has appointed his own nominees to the Standing Committee of the Politburo, a key decision-making body, in 2017. (Many suspect that reform will remain elusive even after that date.) Mr Xi is scarcely alone among world leaders in setting policy with an eye on the political calendar. But financial markets cannot be relied on to play along with this schedule. At some point, China must deal with its excess debts and industrial overcapacity. By taking bolder steps on reforms now, China would do more to entrench faith in its longer-term economic outlook than stimulus measures ever could.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Halfway there,[],"The End of Alchemy: Money, Banking and the Future of the Global Economy. By Mervyn King. W.W. Norton; 448 pages; $28.95. Little, Brown; 25.

INSIDER accounts of the financial crisis are two a penny. The recollections of Timothy Geithner, a former American treasury secretary, are packed with pulsating drama. A book from Ben Bernanke, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, lacks the pyrotechnics but offers a robust defence of the Feds response to market meltdown. Mervyn King, who was governor of the Bank of England in 2003-13, sees such instant memoirs as partial and self-serving. In The End of Alchemy there is no gossip and few revelations. Instead Lord King uses his experience of the crisis as a platform from which to present economic ideas to non-specialists.

He does a good job of putting complex concepts into plain English. The discussion of the evolution of moneyfrom Roman times to 19th-century America to todayis a useful introduction for those not quite sure what currency really is. He explains why economies need central banks: at best, they are independent managers of the money supply and rein in the banking system. Central bankers like giving the impression that they have played such roles since time immemorial, but as Lord King points out the reality is otherwise. The Fed was created only in 1913; believe it or not, until 1994 it would not reveal to the public its interest-rate decisions until weeks after the event. Even the Bank of England, founded in 1694, got the exclusive right to print banknotes (in England and Wales) only in 1844.

At times, Lord King can be refreshingly frank. He is no fan of austerity policies, saying that they have imposed enormous costs on citizens throughout Europe. He also reserves plenty of criticism for the economics profession. Since forecasting is so hit and miss, he thinks, the practice of giving prizes to the best forecasters makes as much sense as it would to award the Fields Medal in mathematics to the winner of the National Lottery.

This is all perfectly interesting, and Lord King opines on a wide range of issues (though with more emphasis on breadth than depth). But the real point of the book, it seems, is to propose a policy to reform global finance. The problem leading up to the crisis, as Lord King sees it, is that commercial banks had little incentive to hold large quantities of safe, liquid assets. They knew that in a panic, the central bank would provide liquidity, no matter the quality of their balance-sheets; in response they loaded up on risky investments.

Instead of this unhappy arrangement, Lord King wants banks to buy liquidity insurance. In normal times banks would pledge collateral to the central bank, which would agree to lend a certain amount against it, if necessary. Banks would thus know in advance precisely how much help they could get in the event of a meltdown, making them behave responsibly when times were good.

The argument is persuasive (indeed, some central banks have policies that bear resemblance to the one Lord King is suggesting). However, there is something unsatisfying about a plea for radical reform from a man who has recently spent a decade in a position of exceptional power: if your suggestions are so good, readers will find themselves asking, then why did you not push for them yourself? Lord King has produced a worthy book, but a shamelessly self-serving account of his role during the financial crisis would have been a lot more fun.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,The roots of Euroscepticism,[],"A COMMON (sometimes exasperated) question from abroad is: why is Britain having a referendum on its EU membership? The simple answer is that David Cameron promised one in the Conservative Party manifesto for last Mays election. But the deeper one is to be found in the rise and rise of British Euroscepticism.

The origins of todays EU lie in the ashes of post-war Europe. Reconciliation between France and Germany, urged by Winston Churchill in 1946, led to the creation of the six-member European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 and the European Economic Community in 1957. But a wary Britain, keen to preserve links with the Commonwealth and America, stood aside from both. Only in the 1960s did the British, impressed by the continents stronger economy, try to join, eventually doing so in 1973.

What this history shows is that Britain has an essentially transactional relationship with the club. Membership has been evaluated in terms of costs and benefits, not as an emotional commitment. Moreover, as a latecomer, Britain has often found the EUs organisation and policies uncongenial. This was reflected in Margaret Thatchers battles in the 1980s to cut the outsized British budget contribution.

Over the years the political base of British Euroscepticism has moved from left to right. In the early years Labour was the more suspicious party. In 1962 its leader, Hugh Gaitskell, warned that joining the common market would end 1,000 years of history. In 1975 Harold Wilson dealt with Labour splits over Europe by staging a renegotiation and putting the result to a referenduma tactic remarkably similar to Mr Camerons today. In the early 1980s, Labour was once again set on withdrawal.

The pivotal moment came in 1988, when the European Commissions president, Jacques Delors, promised the Trades Union Congress that Europes single market would be buttressed by tougher labour and social regulations. This reinforced Thatchers growing Euroscepticism, and led directly to her Bruges speech attacking excessive EU interference in the same year. Her political downfall two years later was triggered by her denunciation of Mr Delorss plans for closer EU integration and a single currency. This marked the point when the Tories replaced Labour as the party of Euroscepticism.

Mr Cameron not only inherited this as party leader in 2005 but also, as prime minister after 2010, had to deal with a growing threat from the even more Eurosceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP). His response, in his Bloomberg speech in January 2013, was, like Wilsons 40 years earlier, to promise a renegotiation and referendum.

Yet todays shrill debate over Brexit reflects mainly internal Tory party politics. Most voters are less excited. Opinion polls suggest that they see Europe as a relatively unimportant issue. Moreover, in most elections since Britain joined the club in 1973, voters have delivered majorities to the more pro-EU of the two main parties.

In graphics: A guide to Brexit from the European Union

Even so, the roots of British Euroscepticism are deep. Matthew Goodwin of the University of Kent, who has studied the phenomenon and written a history of UKIP, reckons they are cultural as much as political. Britain, he says, forged its identity against perceived threats from across the Channel. He adds that, although the young and better educated tend to be less Eurosceptic, the popular notion that it is only older working-class voters who favour Brexit is not correct.

Nor is it right to argue that British-style Euroscepticism is oozing all over the continent. Certainly there is growing disillusion with the EU, especially over migration and the euros woes. This has fostered a form of soft Euroscepticism (see chart). Unlike in Britain, it is young people who are most susceptible, because they suffer the most from high unemployment. Yet there is no serious debate anywhere but Britain about leaving the EU. Only if a post-Brexit Britain were a big success might that changewhich is one reason why the EU will not want to help bring that about.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,"Blue seas, black holes",[],"FREEDOM! We want freedom! cried inmates of the Camp Street prison in Guyanas capital, Georgetown. But in three days of unrest that began on March 2nd, 17 of them burnt to death. The rioting started after guards seized drugs and mobile phones from prisoners awaiting trial for violent crimes. The prisoners set fires; on March 3rd one flared out of control. Trouble continued the next day, with prisoners knocking down wooden cell-block walls and the authorities firing tear gas.

That highly public tragedy is the consequence of a hidden one. Of the 50 countries with the highest incarceration rates, 15 are, like Guyana, former British Caribbean colonies or current ones. High levels of violence are partly to blame. So are the criminalisation of cannabis use and harsh sentencing laws. Last November Guyanas former national football coach was sentenced to three years in prison, the minimum penalty for possessing more than 15 grams of cannabis.

In most of the English-speaking Caribbean, at least a third of prisoners are suspects awaiting trial. One inmate who died in Camp Street had been waiting eight years to be tried for murder. Suspects exploit pre-trial delays to have witnesses killed or silenced. Once trials begin, they drag on; Guyanese judges painstakingly record each word of evidence in longhand.

Conditions inside are often horrendous. Antiguas prison, known as 1735 from the construction date carved above its entrance, was built to hold 150 inmates. It now houses around 400. Some are jammed 15 at a time into cells that are furnished with two bunk beds and two slop buckets. The government plans to install modern sanitation and convert a former nurses hostel into a remand prison. It may release 100 prisoners on parole to ease overcrowding.

When such overcrowding is not dealt with, rebellions can get out of control. In 2005 Glendairy prison in Barbados, then 150 years old, was burnt down by prisoners. Its replacement took two years to build, at a cost of $144m.

Guyanas government, in office since May last year, reacted quickly to the Camp Street disaster. The public-security minister, Khemraj Ramjattan, met a group of prisoners during the protest and promised better meals and additional telephone calls. A public inquiry, chaired by a former judge, is to report within a month on what went wrong and what should be done to prevent a repeat of the violence.

Mr Ramjattan wants to build a new prison, but says the government cannot afford it now. He argues for judicial reforms to unclog the courts and prisons, including making it easier for young first offenders to be released on bail. Before the riot, backbench parliamentarians had proposed more lenient drug-sentencing laws.

Last September Britains prime minister, David Cameron, offered Jamaica $40m to help build a new prison to house both local inmates and some of the 600 Jamaicans serving time in British jails. The Jamaican government of the time, which lost an election last month, was cool to the idea, and many Jamaicans were outraged.

There is, to be sure, something tin-eared about a political leader offering to pay to lock people up in a former colony. But dirty, crowded prisons add to the misery of inmates, many of whom were impoverished before they turned to crime. If Jamaica does not want Mr Camerons money, perhaps he should offer it to Guyana and Antigua instead.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Lion City march,[],"The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye. By Sonny Liew. Pantheon; 320 pages; $30.

WHAT sort of country is Singapore? Westerners who live there get used to being asked two questions whenever they go home: Can you chew gum? and Have you been caned yet?

These foreigners may be familiar with Disneyland with the Death Penalty, a scathing essay that William Gibson wrote in 1993, depicting the Lion City as a soulless, consumerist, authoritarian wasteland. Yet to much of the developing world, Singapore is a model. It is politically stable and geopolitically independent; its citizens enjoy a high standard of living and all the trappingsbut not much more than the trappingsof democracy. To its politicians and defenders, Singapore is an achievement born of self-sacrifice, hard work and committed multiculturalism (for instance, public-housing blocks, where most Singaporeans live, must reflect the ethnic make-up of the country: There are no segregated ghettos in Singapore, its prime minister boasted in a speech last year).

Like any other country, Singapore means different things to different people. Its detractors admit that modern Singapore is safe, well-run and has achieved remarkable material progress since it became independent just over 50 years ago. And even its defenders admit that Singapore restricts civil liberties (for good reason, in their view), and that its progress has had costs as well as benefits.

Sonny Liews brilliantly inventive The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye weighs those costs and benefits. Graphic novelists have made a mark in politics: Marjane Satrapi with Iran and Joe Sacco with Palestine are two of the most admired. The latest experiment in political storytelling through graphic art explores Singapores history through the career of Charlie, a fictional cartoonist, which begins in the mid-1950s when Singapore was still a British colony.

The book is a series of interviews with Charlie, beginning in 2010, when he is 72 years old. Charlie is mild but steel-spined, observant and proud; with masterful economy of detailan arched eyebrow here, his head at a resigned angle thereMr Liew crafts him into a fully realised character.

Charlies first published comic is a fairly standard mid-century science-fiction tale in which a boy and his dog discover a giant robot hidden in a cave. But his work quickly turns political. The boy and his dog find themselves embroiled in an anti-colonial demonstration. British police attack unarmed students, but the robot, who responds only to commands in Chinese, steps in to save the day.

Lee Kuan Yew, who founded the Peoples Action Party (PAP) in 1954 and won his first parliamentary seat a year later, makes an early appearance in Chans work in Invasion. The series depicts humanity under the rule of an alien race, the Hegemons. Mr Lee is a lawyer who argues for human self-rule and speaks fluent Hegemonese (Invasion is, of course, an allegory, with humans representing Singaporeans and Hegemons the British). Charlie also uses allegory to tell the story of Singapores failed merger with the Federation of Malaya in the early 1960s, with Mr Lee as Sang Kancil, a mouse-deer figure from Malaysian folk tales who lives by his wits; the British as Sir Lion, the Malayan prime minister as a kindly orang-utan.

Charlies versions of Mr Lee grow steadily more Machiavellian. By 1983 he is Mr Hairily (Mr Lees name at birth was Harry Lee Kuan Yew), chairman of the so-called Sinkapor Inks corporation, who chucks his companys newsletter-writer in the janitors cupboard for reporting inconvenient truths, and forces his employees to confess to their part in a Richard Marxist conspiracya sly reference to Operation Spectrum, in which 16 people were arrested and detained without trial, having been accused of being part of a Marxist conspiracy to topple the government.

These events remain controversial: the countrys Media Development Authority in effect banned To Singapore with Love, a documentary about nine people exiled for their alleged involvement in a communist conspiracy during the 1960s and 1970s. The National Arts Council (NAC) revoked a grant awarded to The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye because, as a NAC director explained, the book potentially undermines the authority or legitimacy of the Singapore government. The book does not shy away from controversial periods in the nations history.

But Singapore did not stop publication. One wonders if Lee Kuan Yew would have been so lenient. But the Singapore of 2016 is not the Singapore of 1983 or the 1950s. It is a more mature, confident country.

Talk to an older Singaporean, however, and at some point you will hear her wax lyrical about the lost kampongsthe small, intimate villages of Singapore replaced by highways and high-rises. In perhaps the books most moving section, Charlie recalls the old uncle with his cinema-on-wheels: an old man on a bicycle toting a film projector. Eventually that gave way to theatres and television. The old uncles still came by, Charlie, recalls, but the kids just didnt seem to get as excited about his appearance anymore. As the years went by youd see him less and less often, until one day (out of the blue), youd look, but would not find him anywhere. Most people, of course, would rather watch films on their flat-screen TVs than on the side of a courtyard wall. But in the rush to give everyone the means to buy state-of-the-art TVs, its worth sparing a thought for the walls.",[]

KAL's cartoon

The opposition alliance that controls Venezuelas National Assembly said it will use all constitutional means to force the populist president, Nicolas Maduro, from office. These include launching a referendum to recall him, and peaceful street protests against the government.

Perus electoral court barred two candidates from a presidential election, to be held on April 10th. Julio Guzman, who is second in the polls, was disqualified because his party failed to obey its rules when it nominated him. Cesar Acuna was excluded for giving money to voters while campaigning.

The Brexit bandwagon

Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, was accused of promoting pro-European Union views for saying that a British exit from the EU would pose the biggest domestic risk to financial stability. Mr Carney tried to re-establish his neutrality by suggesting EU membership brought risks, too. The Sun, a populist newspaper, claimed the queen favours Brexit. An official denial and complaint to the press regulator swiftly followed. Boris Johnson, Londons mayor and a Brexiteer never far from controversy, described an e-mail that sought to gag pro-EU views within his office as a cock-up.

In Slovakia Robert Fico, the prime minister, won a general election but failed to secure a parliamentary majority. Despite Mr Ficos anti-immigrant rhetoric the far-right Peoples Party Our Slovakia won 8% of the vote and 14 seats in the 150-seat parliament.

Leaders from the EU and the prime minister of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoglu, agreed on the outline of a deal to deport boat people back to Turkey. The terms, which will be confirmed at another summit later this month, have been criticised by international aid organisations and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. But as more refugees are expected in the spring, it may be the only hope for Europe.

At least 200,000 union-led protesters and students took to the streets of France and railway workers held a national strike for 37 hours. Their main grievance was the French governments labour-reform bill, which would help companies bypass tricky unions when they want to alter working times and cut the cost of redundancies.

Junior doctors in England held their third, and longest, strike, walking out for 48 hours. Only emergency cover was provided; 5,000 surgical procedures were cancelled. Last month the health secretary said he would impose new contracts after negotiations with doctors failed. The doctors have the publics sympathy; two-thirds back their actions.

Hopes, and fears

Talks aimed at finding an end to the conflict in Syria were postponed again, but are now set to start next week. A ceasefire, which has been in place since February 27th, is continuing to hold generally, though numerous minor violations have been reported, and aid is getting through to more areas.

The UN warned that a humanitarian disaster is looming in the western Iraqi city of Fallujah, held by Islamic State but under siege for many months by Iraqi forces. Tens of thousands of people in the city are facing food shortages.

A survey found that almost half of Israeli Jews think that Israeli Arabs, who make up a fifth of the population, should be expelled or transferred from Israel.

America launched an air strike at a camp belonging to al-Shabab, a terrorist outfit in Somalia, killing 150 fighters.

A stinging Bern

In the biggest upset in Americas primary elections so far, Bernie Sanders proved the pollsters so very wrong by beating Hillary Clinton in Michigans Democratic primary by 50% to 48%. Mrs Clinton had been expected to win handily. Her defeat raised questions about the breadth of her appeal outside heavily black electorates in the South (she trounced Mr Sanders in Mississippi and Louisiana), but she remains on course to take the partys nomination.

On the Republican side Donald Trump chalked up big wins in Michigan and Mississippi, though he won Louisiana and Kentucky by smaller margins. Marco Rubios campaign seemed all but over after another dismal showing.

Michael Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York, said he would not enter the presidential race as an independent, after months of apparently planning to do so. He is concerned that a three-way race would benefit Mr Trump, whose campaign Mr Bloomberg described as the most divisive...I can remember.

You can clap now

As the annual session of Chinas toothless National Peoples Congress got under way, the one-party state forbade the countrys media from reporting on diverse topics including smog, the use of land for burials and delegates wealth. They were, however, ordered to thoroughly report on the participation of Xi Jinping, the countrys president.

The son of a liberal Pakistani politician, Salman Taseer, who was assassinated by his bodyguard for opposing harsh blasphemy laws, emerged near Quetta after five years of captivity. Shahbaz Ali Taseer had been kidnapped by Islamic extremists eight months after his fathers killing.

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,The Economist,[],"SOMETIMES it seems as though Adams curse, which promises mankind a harvest of thorns and thistles, applies only to African farmers. The southern part of the continent is in the teeth of a drought, which has been blamed on El Nino. The weather has been even worse in northern Ethiopia, where crops are shrivelling and cows are dying. But droughts, unlike biblical curses, end eventually. El Nino does not change the fundamental, remarkable fact about farming in sub-Saharan Africa: it is rapidly getting better.

The post-war green revolution that transformed Asia seemed to have bypassed Africa. But between 2000 and 2014 grain production tripled in countries as far-flung as Ethiopia, Mali and Zambia. Rwanda did even better (see article). Farming remains precarious in a continent with variable weather and little irrigated land. But when disaster hits, farmers nowadays have a bigger cushion.

African countries are on the whole more peaceful and better run than they were. Farmers are no longer forced into disastrous socialist collectives or banned from selling their crops in open markets. Border tariffs are lower and export bans rarer. As a result, innovation is accelerating. Africa has seen an explosion of seed companies producing clever hybrids, which can endure drought and resist disease. Perhaps the best proof of the importance of good government comes from Zimbabwe. It has an awful one, and productivity has crashed.

The progress that has been made elsewhere is wonderful, but not enough. African farms remain far less productive than Asian ones: Chinese farmers harvest more than three times as much grain per hectare. Climate change is expected to make conditions harder. Yet agriculture is essential for firing economic growth across the African continent. More people still live in the countryside than in cities and many of Africas cities are not all that dynamic. Asia has a tight grip on labour-intensive manufacturing, although there is certainly space for more food-processing factories in Africaso, for example, it could export cocoa powder instead of cocoa beans.

Turning an agricultural uptick into a lasting boom will demand more reforms. One priority for Africas governments is to dismantle the remaining barriers to innovation in farming. It still takes years to approve new hybrid seeds in some countries. With a few exceptions, such as South Africa, the continent is holding the line against genetically modified crops. This is mad. GM is particularly helpful in making plants resistant to pestsa terrible scourge. The regions governments should also take greater advantage of mobile technology. Many try to subsidise fertiliser for poor farmers, only for the stuff to be stolen before it reaches the intended recipient. They should be sending money or vouchers directly to mobile wallets.

Africas cities are swelling, and the people who live in them crave meat and processed food. That is a huge opportunity for local farmers, but it will be missed if transport does not become far cheaper and easier. At the moment, the rule of thumb is that it costs three times as much to move goods one mile along an African road as it does to move them along an Asian oneand that is before the police shake you down. As a result, fertiliser is expensive and much food is wasted on the way to market. More investment in upgrading shoddy rural roads would be good. Better still would be an assault on the trucking cartels that keep prices high.

Clearing out the weeds

It would help a lot if farmersparticularly womenhad clearer rights over land. Proper titles would encourage them to make long-term investments, like terracing and tree-planting, and allow them to use land as collateral for loans. Getting there is tricky. Many countries have long traditions of communal land management and a complicated web of customary farming rights. Charging in and handing out freeholds can actually strip people of rights. But a sensible first step, which a few countries are trying, is to register farmers entitlements so their land cannot be pinched.

The rest of the world can help, too. Although some egregious subsidies have been trimmed, the rich worlds taxpayers still spend vast sums propping up their own farmers. America heavily subsidises peanuts and cottontwo things that Africa can grow well. Why shell out to make Africans poorer?",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,What sanctions?,[],"ONLY a few hundred metres separate the small but lively Chinese city of Dandong from Sinuiju, its drab North Korean counterpart on the opposite bank of the Yalu River. There are two iron-truss bridges in the city centre, built by Japanese who were then occupying the area: one in 1911 and the other in 1943. Both were badly damaged by American bombers during the Korean war of the 1950s. A surviving stretch of the older one, renamed Broken Bridge, is now a tourist attraction (on the right of the picture). The newer one (on the left) still carries road and rail traffic across the river, a vital conduit for North Koreas trade with China.

In theory, that may now be disrupted by sweeping sanctions imposed by the UN, with Chinas backing, on March 2nd. They ban trade in luxury items and call for (potentially time-consuming and costly) inspections of cargo going into, and coming out of, North Korea. China is by far the biggest trading partner of the North; if these sanctions are being applied rigorously, it should be evident in Dandong, which handles an estimated 70% of the trade between the two countries.

It is not, yet. The first reported case of sanctions being enforced involved the impounding of a North Korean cargo ship at a commercial port in the Philippines a few hours after the UN voted to impose fresh sanctions in response to tests by North Korea earlier this year of a nuclear device and a long-range ballistic missile (dressed up as a rocket carrying a satellite into space). But there has been no report of trade between North Korea and China being affected.

On March 9th your correspondent saw a sporadic flow of lorries travelling in both directions across the bridge. Locals said the volume looked normal. A foreign observer familiar with the area says it may be that the details of the new enforcement regime have not yet trickled down to the person wearing the hat at the border. Traders in the city say they have yet to feel the impact of sanctions. At a riverfront shop selling North Korean alcohol, cigarettes and ginseng, the owner shows no concern. He says the goods he sells will not be affected (he is right that they are not banned, unlike watches, snowmobiles and jet-skis).

It would certainly be a bother for traders if Chinese customs officials were to inspect every shipment for items prohibited by the UN, including anything that could be used to help the countrys nuclear and missile programmes. But it is far from clear that that is what China intends. The latest UN sanctions allow for less rigorous inspections in the case of goods needed for humanitarian purposes. China could argue that much of its trade with North Korea falls in that category: it is the main supplier of food and oil. Since the latest sanctions were imposed, Chinese officials have continued to sound lukewarm about them. Chinas foreign minister, Wang Yi, said this week that blind faith in sanctions was not a responsible approach.

South Korean press reports have said, however, that China had already begun restricting some North Korean transactions at Chinese banks and barring North Korean vessels at Chinese ports by late February, before the latest sanctions. Chinas agreement to the tougher regime is certainly a sign of its frustration with its dangerously capricious neighbour, whose leader, Kim Jong Un, said this week that North Korea had developed miniaturised nuclear warheads that could be mounted on ballistic missiles. He even threatened a nuclear attack in response to large-scale South Korean and American military exercises now under way. Some observers are sceptical that the North has acquired such technology. Most discount its bellicose bombast.

If he wants to curry favour with China, Mr Kim could try holding up his end of a deal for building a new bridge in Dandong. Gleaming but still idle, it was built by China at a cost of more than $325m. China has publicly blamed North Korean foot-dragging: in North Korea, the bridge ends in an empty field, connected to nothing.",[]

Applicants faced posers on grammar and arithmeticas well as the Battle of the Bulge and why presidential aides deserve anonymity (answer: they relieve the president of many burdens and should not be subjected to a great deal of personal criticism). But little more than two decades later, such exams had come under fire. Some said they tested knowledge rather than talent, thereby discriminating against black and Latino applicants. More broadly, their usefulness for picking tax-collectors and the like was questioned. In 1981 they were ditched.

Last year the tests were resurrected, tweaked to be fairer and more useful. Growth in the number of university graduates, together with the popularity of a safe job in difficult economic times, had left many branches of government struggling to cope with a flood of applications. Federal agencies are now assessing candidates with USA Hire, an online quiz more relevant to the work to be done.

America is not the only country where more young people have been going to university in recent years. And as governments and aid donors seek to cut graft, the original, meritocratic aim of civil-service exams seems increasingly relevant. Sure enough, says Vivek Srivastava of the World Bank, during the past quarter-century more countries have started using assessments to dole out government jobs.

Of the 62 countries tracked in 2010-11 by Global Integrity, an NGO, 55 had rules against nepotism, cronyism and patronage. Last year Cyprus and Pakistan, among others, announced reforms intended to ensure that applicants are chosen on the basis of what they know, not whom. Countries such as Germany, Portugal and Spain pledge in their constitutions to recruit government staff based on skills. Prodded by aid donors, Afghanistan and Sudan recently promised to do likewise.

Applicants can face daunting odds. The Fast Stream programme, a graduate scheme for British officials, admits about one in 20 after a series of tests, role-play exercises and interviews. Of the roughly 500,000 applicants for elite civil-service jobs in India each year, only about 1,000 make the grade. Last year there were 27,817 roles for the 930,000 takers of the Chinese civil-service exam (the picture above shows candidates at a test centre).

Beancounters v boondoggles

Hiring civil servants according to calibre has been rare throughout history. Most jobs have been inherited, bought or bestowed as patronage. Although China tested for grasp of classical texts as long ago as 134BC, officials in the West only began to be properly vetted in the 19th century. In Britain, the Northcote-Trevelyan report of 1854 called for exams to weed out hereditary incompetence. In the years following, anger at Americas spoils system, which saw jobs given to party hacks, also led to reform: an 1868 report to Congress found a sculptor and a washerwoman among the political allies on the Treasurys staff.

The best-known proponent of a new-model, meritocratic civil service was Max Weber, a German sociologist who died in 1920. He envisioned a closed, rigid hierarchy staffed by bureaucrats who entered by examination and enjoyed protected careers. This, he argued, would foster esprit de corps and curb cronyism.

There is a fair bit of evidence in favour of the meritocracy Weber championed. Research published in 2011 by Victor Lapuente and Carl Dahlstrom of the University of Gothenburg, and Jan Teorell, of Lund University, looked at which features of a civil service cut jobbery. They found that corruption across 52 countries was correlated with neither civil-service pay levels nor whether jobs were for life. Merit-based hiring was the only aspect of bureaucracies that consistently reduced graft. The connection held in countries at different stages of development, and with different political systems.

Meritocracy, more broadly conceived, also saves money and seems to promote economic growth. A forthcoming paper co-authored by Mr Lapuente analyses 1.4m procurement contracts in 212 regions of the European Union, and finds that the regions whose own public employees rate them as meritocratic pay less for roads, bridges and the like. The researchers estimate that if every region were as meritocratic as Baden-Wurttemberg, in Germany, EU governments could save 13 billion-20 billion ($14 billion-22 billion) a year. Separate work by Peter Evans and James Rauch, of the universities of California Berkeley and San Diego respectively, finds that in poorer countries meritocratic hiring and promotion are associated with faster growth.

But some countries make the elementary mistake of setting a silly test. It is not obvious why applicants in Spain, for example, have to memorise swathes of the legal code; nor why Indian candidates must know which ancient kingdom was associated with the life of the Buddha. Others fail to maintain meritocratic principles through civil servants entire careers. Some of the most closed administrations, including those of Greece, Italy and Spain, are in reality highly politicised, since promotion often depends on being in favour with the government of the day.

There are even worrying hints that independent hiring and promotion systems that should shield civil servants from shifts in political fortunes are somehow being subverted. A gap between law and practice is opening in eastern European countries such as Hungary, says Gyorgy Gajduschek of the Institute for Legal Studies, in Budapest. Across the OECD club of mostly rich countries, the number of bureaucrats replaced after elections seems to have risen since the 1980s, notes Mr Dahlstrom.

Global Integrity, an NGO, says that though 43 of 54 African countries it follows have rules against cronyism, only Botswana tends to appoint bureaucrats based on professional criteria. Some development wonks naively promoted the Weberian model, without building up capacity to implement it. We went into countries and said you need to be more like Denmark, says Mr Srivastava. So countries changed their laws to look like Denmarksbut then nothing would happen.

Past papers

The century-old notion that a bureaucracy should be a cadre of lifers is now facing more fundamental criticisms. The first is of the idea that civil servants should be unsackable. The intention was to ensure their independence and protect them from being fired by meddling politicians; in some places, though, it means that once they have made it through the entrance exam they need never do a tap of work. Some of Brazils most coveted jobs, for example, are in well-paid corners of the public sector, often mocked as places where applicants who make it through a stiff exam can hang their jackets over their chairsand never show up again.

The second problem is that the tasks civil servants must perform are becoming ever more complicated. Closed-shop bureaucracies can be short of essential skills, such as the ability to analyse data, manage big projects or write contracts for outsourced public services. In poorly governed, graft-prone countries, this may be a price worth paying for keeping politicians grubby hands off government jobs. But better-governed ones may be able to open up hiring without returning to nepotism.

According to the Quality of Government Survey Report, an international assessment of bureaucracies by independent experts, some countries that frequently bring outsiders into their civil services without examination, such as New Zealand, are highly meritocratic. In a recent paper looking only at rich countries, where graft is less common, Anders Sundell of the University of Gothenburg finds no connection between entrance exams and levels of corruption.

In much of the rich world, says Agnes Audier of BCG, a consultancy, a civil-service recruitment crisis looms. A third of government workers in the OECD are aged over 50; in America about 60% of senior federal employees are eligible to retire. In normal times, it would therefore be an excellent moment to tweak hiring rules, since a flood of new talent would quickly stir up stagnant bureaucracies. But many governments are squeezing staffing budgets or imposing hiring freezes to get their budgets back in balance after the financial crisis. The smart ones will be rethinking the way they recruit in preparation for the thaw.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Jobs for the boys and girls,[],"A FEW years ago Britain was in a panic about youth unemployment. As the economy sank, companies stopped hiring and let go of workers with the least bargaining power. The unemployment rate among 16- to 24-year-olds therefore soared (see chart). In many rich countries, the rise in youth unemployment has proved to be long-lasting: across the EU it has fallen by a mere 1.3 percentage points since 2011 and in countries like the Netherlands and Norway it has risen, raising fears that swathes of youngsters are structurally excluded from the labour market. Yet in Britain it has nosedived. The employment rate of young people not in full-time education is now at its highest since 2004. Why?

The government credits its long-term economic plan. True, it helpfully raised the age at which people leave education to 18 last year, thus moving youngsters off the dole and into the classroom. Yet many programmes have fallen flat. A 300m ($425m) scheme whereby employers received a payment of up to 2,275 for hiring an unemployed young person closed in 2014 after low take-up. A 30m Innovation Fund, announced in 2011, rewarded investors who funded programmes to improve youngsters skills. It too closed to new entrants in November; the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has released no quantitative analysis of the schemes value for money.

The DWP has even gone in search of young people online, setting up a page on the BuzzFeed news site with articles such as 7 most obscure excuses given by benefit fraudsters. The target audience seems unimpressed (Why dont you give the ten worst reasons for stopping a persons benefit and leaving them destitute? asks one).

Still, other welfare reforms have inadvertently helped the young. Since 2011 private providers of support for unemployed people have been paid according to how many of their clients move into work. In 2011-15 one-third of 18- to 24-year-olds in the programme moved into a job for a sustained period (meaning at least three or six months, depending on the person), compared with one-quarter of 25- to 49-year-olds. The difference may be partly down to this payment-by-results model, says Laura Gardiner of the Resolution Foundation, a think-tank: targeting youngsters, who may pick up skills quicker, has proved more lucrative to the contractors than focusing on harder-to-help claimants, particularly the over-50s and those with disabilities.

Other policies will make young workers more attractive still to employers. In April a national living wage comes into force, under which the minimum wage will rise from its current level of 6.70 an hour to around 9 an hour (equal to 60% of median earnings) by 2020. But it does not cover those under 25, and Len Shackleton of Buckingham University says that this may have already created a bias among employers towards hiring youngsters. So has a policy introduced last April under which employers do not pay certain types of national-insurance contributions for workers under 21.

Tech-literate youngsters are also well suited to the gig economy, in which short-term employment is arranged online or through apps. Gigs are proliferating: the number of private hire vehicles in London, a category that includes Uber taxis, has risen by 26% in the past two years. Uber claims that, in America, its drivers are twice as likely as conventional cabbies to be under 30.

With such a decline in youth unemployment, it is no wonder that wages are buoyant. In 2015 those aged 18-21 saw a 2.8% rise in median hourly pay, compared with a national average increase of 1.6%. Nonetheless, such was the turmoil experienced during the crisis that the inflation-adjusted hourly pay of those aged 22-29 is still 12% below what is was in 2008, a worse performance than any age group above it. Young Britons may be back in work, but they are not yet back in the money.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Open universities,[],"THE University of Liverpool is growing fast. Since 2011 it has invested nearly 250m ($360m) in new student accommodation, across three different sites, to house 4,500 students. We have seen a dramatic increase in interest over the past couple of years, says Gavin Brown, a university official. That it has been able to respond to the increased demand is partly due to an unheralded reform of student admissions.

In 2012 restrictions on the number of students that universities were allowed to recruit (in place to control government spending) were relaxed in England to allow them to accept as many students with good grades at A-level, the exams taken at 18, as they wished. The following year George Osborne, the chancellor, surprised universities by going further, declaring that from 2015 the limit on the number of students they were allowed to recruit would be lifted entirely.

The government hoped the change would enable universities to expand, creating more skilled workers and widening access to higher education. Another effect would be to increase competition between universities for studentsa process encouraged by the trebling of tuition fees to a maximum of 9,000 in 2012, which means more funding now follows students. It was a much bigger shift than many people in higher education initially realised, says Nick Hillman, a former government adviser who now runs the Higher Education Policy Institute, a think-tank.

A demographic dip in the number of 18- to 24-year-olds, an improving job market and a sluggish response from some universities mean that student numbers are yet to grow much, and are unlikely to do so for the next few years. Nevertheless, many universities are changing their approach to admissions. Early signs suggest that growth is concentrated in older, research-focused universities. In 2015 the English members of the prestigious Russell Group of universities accepted 6.7% more students than in the previous year. Meanwhile, acceptances by the English members of the Million+ group of newer, less fancy universities fell by 0.6%.

This cannot be explained solely by the lifting of the cap. Some low-ranked universities have chosen to focus on increasing the academic ability rather than the number of students they take in. Many high-ranked universities have benefited from being able to expand under the earlier, partial lifting of the cap; others, including Oxford and Cambridge, have chosen not to take on more students. But it may also show that stronger institutionsnew as well as oldare growing at the expense of weaker ones, says Emran Mian, director of the Social Market Foundation, a think-tank. Indeed, many successful new universities, including Coventry and Manchester Metropolitan, are expanding faster than older establishments.

Although universities can compete on price, students have shown little sign of favouring institutions with lower fees (which partly explains why these days most charge the maximum). As a result, universities must now compete on quality, says Chris Husbands, vice-chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University. Some reckon that the higher-education market will diversify, with more institutions concentrating on niche or work-focused courses in order to attract students.

A few universities will suffer at first. The question is whether the pain will be worth it in the long term, says Andy Westwood of Manchester University. Critics of the uncapping policy argue that some low- and mid-ranked universities are being punished unfairly by students preference for institutions that look good on a CV, rather than those with the best lecturers. Others complain that uncertainty over student numbers makes long-term planning hard.

But much of the angst will be forgotten if student numbers begin to grow more quickly. When a similar cap was lifted in Australia in 2012, the proportion of youngsters going to university increased in every social group. Demographic trends mean the number of British 18- to 24-year-olds will pick up in the early 2020s. And all universities will benefit from more EU students: some 14% more were accepted this academic year than last.

But funding the extra places will not be cheap: the policy will require the support of future governments. Unfortunately for those universities that are hoping to expand, that is far from guaranteed.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Goggling at Britain,[],"AT FIRST Gogglebox did not look like a winner. TV executives responded to Tania Alexander, the programmes creator, with bafflement: who would want to watch other people watching television? They got their answer: 700,000 viewers, rising to 5m. Today the formatfeaturing couples, friends and families commenting on and discussing clips from popular dramas, game shows, documentaries and the newshas been exported to 16 countries and counts David Cameron among its fans.

The secret is in the casting. Unlike reality shows predicated on conflict and the grotesque (all shouting and slicks of fake tan) Gogglebox mobilises the wit and warmth of recognisable tribes: the grandparents in Liverpool, the minority middle-class family from Derby, the woman vicar in Nottingham, the bohemians in Cambridge. Most facets of modern British life are there. The gay friends? That would be Stephen and Chris, a pair of catty Brighton hairdressers. The city-dwellers? Sandy and Sandra, Brixton loudmouths who roar with laughter and outrage, slurping pots of instant noodles. The poshos? Steph and Dom, who run a hotel in Kent and issue cut-glass sardonics when not guzzling oceans of booze and falling off their sofa.

The result is a compelling barometer of the national mood. During last years election campaign, the Goggleboxers had their political leaders sussed: accurately identifying Nigel Farages anxiously frenetic attention-seeking (He thinks with his mouth), Ed Milibands lurking self-doubt (He doesnt quite know what he is doing) and Boris Johnsons faux-bumbling opportunism (Beware the fool, because in all Shakespeare plays, the fool is actually the clever one). Long before commentators had stopped sagely musing about the Liberal Democrats hidden local strengths, two of the shows best-loved familiesthe Michaels and the Siddiquispredicted the partys rout and its leaders resignation. Occasionally the chatter offers glimpses of the roiling, evolving country beyond the net curtains: Id say about a third of my mates are migrants, or second-generation, George, a 30-year-old from Essex, tells his surprised parents.

To be sure, the show is not meant as anthropology. Its subjects are selected for their spark and spontaneity (it only takes five seconds to tell whether a prospective family or pair is right, Ms Alexander says). Each 60-minute episode is a compilation of golden moments culled from 200 hours of footage. In a typical gem, one of the Siddiqui boys, watching a televised debate about immigration, wonders how he would evade border controls. Id swim the Channel, replies his brother and, chortling, turns to his father: How did we sneak in last time, Dad? Reality-television gigs, newspaper profiles and even a chat show have duly rolled in. The programme-makers thus watch out for, and cut, anything that looks fake: the families must be relatable.

Psychiatrists-couch potatoes

Still, the show owes some of its success to the atypical nature of what it captures. For when historians write the story of British society in the first decades of the 21st century, their organising theme will surely be that of fragmentation. The gap between the booming, worldly cities and the declining, post-industrial towns increasingly shows up in Britains politics (witness its current divide on the EU). Intersecting this widening spectrum is the generational split between the liberal young and their conservative elders. As the spread of daily experiences and outlooks becomes broader, occasions on which the country comes together get rarer. Where once a handful of newspapers and television channels commanded the nations attention, the medias fragmentation and the rise of more individualistic competitors (social media the prime example) mean ever fewer common reference points. The audience for the biggest programme shown on Christmas Day has fallen from 20.3m in 2001 to 6.6m in 2015.

As Britains nations, regions, classes and age groups drift apart, a similar pattern is evident within neighbourhoods. The country leads the rich world in indicators associated with solitary lifestyles: gym-going (as opposed to team sports), divorce, smartphone and tablet adoption (replacing the family television set), self-employment, online shopping, eating alone, meal-skipping and the declines of both the pub and the nuclear family. Clubs of all sorts, from churches and political parties to golf clubs and trade unions, are shrinking. The proportion of single-person households has doubled over the past four decades.

Nothing about this is inherently regrettableindeed, Britons must be one of the most unstifled, diverse and emotionally self-sufficient peoples in Europebut these trends have negative side-effects. The Office for National Statistics claims that Britain is the loneliest country in the EU (the sense of isolation especially acute among its young adults). Politicians seemingly discern in voters a yearning for connection, from Labours recent talk of one nation to Mr Camerons big society push for more volunteering and civic cohesion.

Gogglebox leans against these shifts in two ways. It conjures up a half-remembered Britain of universal experiences and references; of families of all stations sitting down together and watching the same shows. And every Friday night, it brings that nostalgic ideal to life by commanding an audience that spans the generations (about 10% of potential viewers in each age group from 16 to 64 tune in) and the classes (its viewership, like the population as a whole, splits into four roughly equal groups: upper-middle, lower-middle, skilled-working and unskilled-working). The programmes contradictionscamp and sincere, profound and silly, slapstick and mundaneenable it to transcend differences of geography, income and generation like few others. To a country whose citizens, voluntarily or otherwise, appear to be going their separate ways, Gogglebox offers the fleeting tonic of togetherness. In retrospect, it was always going to be a hit.",[]
economist.com,2016-03-10 16:02:35,Steel chrysanthemums,[],"THE spectacular leap of almost 20% in the price of iron ore on March 7th reveals a lot about the idiosyncrasies of commodities markets. Coming on the first trading day after the opening of Chinas National Peoples Congress, at which the government pledged to maintain GDP growth of at least 6.5% a year for the next five years, the jump may well have reflected renewed optimism about the appetite of the worlds biggest steel consumer. But the price of physical commodities tends to depend more on supply, demand and inventories than on the expectations of financial markets. So a giant flower show in Tangshan, Chinas biggest steel-producing city, may be an equally goodand more fragrantexplanation for the sudden rally.

Tangshans authorities want their flowers to bloom under clean air during the show, from April to October, so they are curbing output at the citys steel mills. Low inventories and the prospect of reduced supply over the summer have pushed up local prices, making mills even keener to operate at full tilt until the stoppage begins. That led to a scramble for ore, according to Tomas Gutierrez of Kallanish Commodities, a steel-industry watcher. People really panicked.

In China as a whole, it is typical to build stocks of metals before construction picks up in spring. That may explain why many of them have rallied this yearalbeit from very low bases. David Wilson of Citigroup notes that the depreciation of the yuan has also encouraged traders to import extra ore in case the currency falls further. And Capital Economics, a consultancy, says one of the main drivers of the recovery in iron-ore prices may have been speculative short-coveringor the unwinding of bets that prices would fall further.

The new target for growth may also have played a parteven if Chinas ability to meet it is hotly debated. Goldman Sachs, for example, says Chinas main avenue for stoking metals demand would be the property market, but it argues that though there are more home sales and higher prices, there is no sign of this yet spreading into new construction.

Others argue that the strength of physical demand is not mirrored in Chinas weak import data, or in low freight rates at sea. The downward pressure on metals prices is due as much to an avalanche of oversupply as a shortage of demand. In iron ore, in particular, there are no signs the glut in production in Australias Pilbara region is ebbing. By the time Tangshans peonies and chrysanthemums are in full bloom, the iron-ore rally may be long gone.",[]

economist.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,The European Central Bank fires another salvo,[],"A YEAR ago the European Central Bank (ECB) started its big programme of quantitative easing, or QE, buying 60 billion ($65 billion) of assets a month, in an attempt to stimulate the euro areas sagging economy and prevent deflation setting in. In December it extended the programme by six months, until March 2017. Now it has raised the tempo, to 80 billion a month, starting in April.

This was the most eye-catching of the ECBs latest set of measures to ease monetary policy, announced on March 10th. In December, it had also reduced its deposit rate, on most funds parked by banks at the ECB, further into negative territory, from -0.2% to -0.3%. Now it has lowered the rate again, to -0.4%, while also cutting its main lending rate from an already nugatory 0.05% to zero. Up till now, the asset purchases have been mainly government bonds, together with covered bonds issued by banks (typically backed by mortgages) and a small amount of asset-backed securities. Now corporate bonds are on the menu, too. The ECB will also conduct four new funding-for-lending operations between June and March 2017, each with a maturity of four years, aimed at boosting credit to the private sector by providing funding on extremely favourable terms.

The ECB is having to do more than it initially envisaged in early 2015 and then in December because growth has been flagging and prices are falling once again. When QE was launched, the recovery that had started in the spring of 2013 was picking up momentum, reaching 0.6% (an annualised rate of 2.3%) in the first quarter of 2015. But that proved to be a (not very) high point and quarterly growth has since ebbed to 0.3% in late 2015 (an annualised rate of 1.3%). The ECB is supposed to keep inflation close to 2%, but deflation has returned. The headline inflation rate sank from 0.3% in January to -0.2% in February. Although the renewed fall in energy prices was partially responsible, core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as energy, fell from 1.0% in January to 0.7% last month.

Underpinning the fresh stimulus was a set of new forecasts, which painted a gloomier outlook, especially for inflation, than the previous ones in December. ECB staff now expect the euro area to grow by 1.4% in 2016, lower than the 1.7% projected in December. Mario Draghi, the banks president, said that risks to the growth outlook were tilted to the downside because of heightened uncertainties about the world economy. The downgrade to the inflation outlook was substantial. Following a year of zero inflation, consumer prices will rise in 2016 by just 0.1% whereas in December they were expected to increase by 1.0%. In 2017 inflation is forecast at 1.3% compared with 1.6% at the end of last year.

Mr Draghi has clearly delivered considerably more than in December, in particular through increasing the scale of monthly asset purchases. The four new funding-for-lending operations may also help, although banks have hardly fallen over themselves to take advantage of an existing programme launched in 2014. But the cut in the deposit rate was overshadowed by Mr Draghi saying that we dont anticipate that it will be necessary to lower rates further. In fact this is not the first time that he has made such a statement, declaring in September 2014 for example (when the deposit rate was cut to -0.2%) that now we are at the lower bound, only for the ECB to lower the deposit rate still further in December 2015 and today. But as worries about the harm done by negative rates to bank profitability have mounted, it seems that Mr Draghi has now drawn a new line.

The ECBs new measures signal resolve, and that Mr Draghi is still intent on, as he promised back in 2012, doing whatever it takes to save the euro. But increasingly, markets are doubting the efficacy of overstretched monetary policy. Foreign-exchange traders responded to the measures by first marking the euro down against the dollar and then up as the impact of Mr Draghis words on not lowering interest rates further sank in. Since one of the main ways in which QE has helped the euro-zone economy is through a weak currency, that does not bode well for the success of the ECBs latest venture.",[]

2015 WAS a volatile year for living costs. Falling commodity prices, currency devaluations and geopolitical uncertainty all contributed to a relative decrease in the cost of living for a number of cities according to a bi-annual pricing index from the Economist Intelligence Unit. But a strong dollar saw all 16 of the surveys US cities move up the ranking by at least 15 places, and New York now features among the worlds ten most expensive cities for the first time in 14 years. Singapore retains the top spot but is 10% less expensive compared to New York than the previous year, while London has climbed six places to join four other European cities in the top ten.

At the other end of the rankingnotwithstanding the prevalence of South Asian cities (India and Pakistan account for five of the ten cheapest cities)it is Zambias capital Lusaka that now offers the best value for money in the world. Despite rampant inflation, a devaluation of the Kwacha caused by falling copper prices has pushed the citys cost of living down to just 41% of New Yorks.

Other low-cost cities could benefit traveling sports fans over the next couple of years. Falling commodity prices and exchange-rate revisions have caused Olympic Games host Rio de Janeiro to drop 52 places down the ranking, while visitors to Euro 2016 matches in Paris and Lyon will see a mild improvement in prices thanks to a weaker euro. But it is Russia, scheduled host of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, that has seen the biggest decrease over the last year, with St Petersburg and Moscow tumbling 51 and 63 places down the ranking respectively, reflecting a 40% decline in living costs over the previous year.",[]

economist.com,2016-05-09 00:00:00,Masterclass Strategic Positioning,[],"The new media and resources, 24/7 where everyone has the opportunity to communicate directly or her opinion about an organization, demands a new form of positioning. Old-fashioned, static positioning of the organization is no longer sufficient in today's communications landscape. A landscape in which most of the communication about an organization, including its products, services and brands no longer be done by the organization itself, but by the social media and online news pages. In addition, these new media offer users the ability to communicate subjective, unsubstantiated opinions that may have a direct impact on the perception - and correspondingly - the positioning of the organization. There therefore needs a new type of positioning to be developed to allow the organization to respond quickly to the constant stream of information without losing the position taken by her. This masterclass provides participants with insight into how organizations must deal with these changing market conditions, how to occupy the position which gives them the most benefit and how they can maintain long term this position in an ever changing market.

What position provides me the most benefit and how I maintain this position? What position will I take with my product, service, brand or organization? Why I have not taken this position? What strategy helps me to take this position and still maintain?

These are the central questions of this Masterclass.

We set clear goals with the participants, to jointly look for the present problem and develop the strategy that solves this problem and helps achieve the goal. This Masterclass is therefore intended for critical, ambitious participants who want to be challenged at the highest level and quick results to see.

GOALS ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN

Strategic positioning is about taking a preferential position in the target group. To understand the problem your target stops and the strategy will still move them. How we can create with communication preference for your offerings and how we can keep this preference in a continuously changing market.

DEALING WITH CHANGE

New media resources and create new opportunities, but also new problems. The perception of the organization is now largely formed on the basis of objective and subjective messages are communicated in different (social) media. New problems require new solutions. Therefore, we seek to position a new form of that to anticipate the new communications environment and a new, open way of communicating clarity is paramount.

DIRECTLY APPLICABLE

The Masterclass Strategic Positioning is characterized by the direct applicability of the material. No complicated theories, complex models or lengthy analysis, but an intensive, interactive program in which solid theoretical foundation coupled with relevant, timely examples. So participants can directly involve the insights to their own situation.

CHALLENGING DESIGN

We deliberately opted for a short, intensive program spread over three days, in which all relevant information is discussed and the participants have to perform under pressure. Besides the core teachers will be leading teachers and guest lecturers participants Inspiring and challenging to approach complex issues from different perspectives and to come immediately applicable solutions. By thinking analytically and conceptually. By looking at problems differently. By making the essential connections. And relevant on the basis of this understanding, develop distinctive solutions that unambiguous, consistent and communicated convincingly.

A CONCRETE RESULT

The Masterclass Strategic Positioning consists of two parts. In the first part, much attention is paid to strengthening the strategic thinking ability and theoretical knowledge of positioning, while the focus in the second part is mainly on strengthening the conceptual thinking and develop a concrete communication proposition. Between the two parts are given the participants the opportunity to process the acquired knowledge in their own practice and case to be marked by a buddy system.

WHY PARTICIPATE?

A masterclass on high academic level with leading teachers.

Opportunity for input and treat its own strategic issue.
