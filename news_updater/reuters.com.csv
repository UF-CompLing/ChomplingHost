Mandatory Credit: Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports

CHICAGO The National Hockey League said on Wednesday it has closed its investigation into sexual assault allegations against superstar Blackhawks player Patrick Kane, saying the accusations against him were unfounded.

Prosecutors in New York in November declined to bring charges in the case, saying the accusations made by a woman who had met him at a Buffalo, New York nightclub contained inconsistencies and were not backed up by credible evidence.

The NHL said that the final stage of its review included an in-person meeting between Kane and commissioner Gary Bettman in New York on Monday.

""The League considers the matter closed and will have no further comment,"" the statement said.

The woman had accused the 27-year-old player of raping her at his offseason lakeshore home in Hamburg, a Buffalo suburb, in August last year.

After an investigation, Erie County District Attorney Frank Sedita said in November that DNA evidence did not confirm the woman's allegation she had been raped and that there were inconsistencies between her accounts and those of other witnesses.

Kane is one of the National Hockey League's top stars and has led the Blackhawks to three Stanley Cup championships.

The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury on March 8 and unsealed on Wednesday as the anti-government protesters appeared in a federal court in Portland, supersedes an earlier indictment in the case.

It adds new charges against protest leader Ammon Bundy and other sympathizers who were indicted last month of conspiring to impede federal officers policing the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge during a long-simmering fight over land rights.

The takeover, which began on Jan. 2 with at least a dozen armed men, was sparked by the return to prison of two Oregon ranchers convicted of setting fires that spread to federal property in the vicinity of the refuge.

It also marked the latest flare-up in the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion, a decades-old conflict over federal control of millions of acres in the West.

On Tuesday, a county prosecutor said protest leader Robert ""LaVoy"" Finicum, who was fatally shot by Oregon State Police in late January during a traffic stop, was struck three times in the back during the incident. The prosecutor deemed the slaying ""justified and necessary.""

The superseding indictment lists 26 defendants. Each is charged with the initial charge of conspiring to impede federal agents. It newly accuses some of the protesters of: possession of firearms and dangerous weapons in federal facilities, use and carry of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, and depredation of government property.

That last charge was leveled against protester Sean Anderson and another sympathizer, whose name has been redacted from court documents. It alleges the pair damaged an archeological site considered sacred to the Burns Paiute Tribe through the use of excavation and heavy equipment.

The FBI has said it was working with the Tribe to identify damage to the tribe's artifacts and sacred burial grounds during the 41-day occupation.

Three armed occupiers were also indicted on charges of theft of government property, including a 2012 Ford F-350 Truck and cameras and related equipment.

A lawyer for Ammon Bundy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

NEW DELHI Afghanistan and Zimbabwe reaped the benefit of some tight death bowling to both register 14-run victories on Tuesday and boost their prospects of making the World Twenty20 main draw.

Vusi Sibanda's maiden fifty and Elton Chigumbura's late assault powered Zimbabwe to 158-8 against Hong Kong in the first match of the sixth World Twenty20 event at Nagpur's VCA Stadium.

The Africans then returned to restrict their opponents to 144-6 to kick off their campaign with a triumph.

Afghanistan later posted 170-5 at the same venue and dished out some impressive death bowling to restrict Scotland to 156-5 as they won their Group B clash.

The first wicket to fall in the tournament showed the gap between teams already in the Super 10 second round stage and those aspiring to join them from the first round.

Put in to bat, Zimbabwe skipper Hamilton Masakadza hit three boundaries and a six before a sloppy end to his innings.

Masakadza set out for a single that looked safe until he failed to plant his bat and drag it. His feet and the bat were in the air when the mid-off fielder threw down the stumps.

His opening partner Sibanda (59) showed more responsibility and brought up his fifty with a flat six off Nadeem Ahmed.

Zimbabwe subsequently lost three wickets, including Sibanda's, in eight balls but Chigumbura (30 not out) hit three sixes in his 13-ball cameo to take them past the 150 mark.

For Hong Kong, Jamie Atkinson (53) struck his maiden fifty but did not get much support from his top order colleagues.

Skipper Tanwir Afzal chipped in with a breezy unbeaten 31 but Zimbabwe's bowlers sent down a tidy last two overs.

Hong Kong's 44-year-old Ryan Campbell became the oldest player to make his Twenty20 international debut.

Afghanistan rode half-centuries from Mohammad Shahzad (61) and skipper Asghar Stanikzai (55 not out) to post a total that seemed to justify their decision to bat first.

Scotland offered a robust reply with George Munsey (41) and Kyle Coetzer (40) forging an 84-run opening stand before their chase was derailed.

Once the openers departed, Afghanistan's bowlers stemmed the run flow and then sent down some tight final overs to prevail.

The group winners will join South Africa, England, West Indies and Sri Lanka in the Super 10 stage.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 20:58:33+00:00,Clinton calls for sanctions on Iran after more missile tests,"['Bozorgmehr Sharafedin', 'Sam Wilkin']","DUBAI U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton on Wednesday called for sanctions against Iran after the Islamic Republic brushed off U.S. concerns and test-fired two ballistic missiles that it said were designed to be able to hit Israel.

Iranian state television showed footage of two Qadr missiles being launched from northern Iran, which the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said hit targets 1,400 km (870 miles) away.

Iranian agencies said the missiles were stamped with the Hebrew words, ""Israel should be wiped from the pages of history,"" though the inscription could not be seen on any photographs.

Clinton, a former secretary of state under President Barack Obama, said she was ""deeply concerned"" by the tests, the second round of Iranian missile launches in two days.

""Iran should face sanctions for these activities and the

international community must demonstrate that Iran's threats

toward Israel will not be tolerated,"" said Clinton, who is ahead in the race to be Democratic nominee at the Nov. 8 presidential elections.

Her call for sanctions reflected a tougher line against Iran's recent missile activity than that taken so far by the White House, which said it is aware of and reviewing reports of the Iranian tests, and would determine an appropriate response.

""We know that Iran is in a season of carrying out a number of military activities, and so it certainly would not be a surprise if there are additional launches over the next several days,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

The Iranian move on Wednesday came despite warning from the U.S. State Department after Tuesday's missile tests that Washington continues to ""aggressively apply our unilateral tools

to counter threats from Iran's missile program,"" a possible reference to additional U.S. sanctions.

Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Wednesday with Iran's foreign minister about the test-firing of two ballistic missiles, a State Department spokesman said.

The missile tests underline a rift in Iran between hard-line factions opposed to normalizing relations with the West, and

President Hassan Rouhani's relatively moderate government, which is trying to attract foreign investors to Iran.

ISRAEL IN MIND

Iran's IRGC said the missiles tested on Wednesday were designed with Israel in mind.

""The reason we designed our missiles with a range of 2,000 km is to be able to hit our enemy the Zionist regime from a safe distance,"" Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by the ISNA agency. The nearest point in Iran is around 1,000 km (600 miles) from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon told Israel Radio the tests showed Iran's hostility had not changed since implementing a nuclear deal with world powers in January, despite Rouhani's overtures to the West.

""To my regret there are some in the West who are misled by the honeyed words of part of the Iranian leadership while the other part continues to procure equipment and weaponry, to arm terrorist groups,"" Yaalon said.

Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee, said: Iran is making a mockery of President Obamas vow to confront Irans dangerous and illicit acts.

He urged Obama to ""aggressively enforce all sanctions against Irans missile programs, support for terrorism and human rights abuses. No more looking the other way.

Washington imposed sanctions against businesses and individuals in January over another missile test in October 2015. But the IRGC said it would not bow to pressure.

""The more sanctions and pressure our enemies apply ... the more we will develop our missile program,"" Hajizadeh said on state television.

The IRGC maintains dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles, the largest stock in the Middle East. It says they are solely for defensive use with conventional, non-nuclear warheads.

Tehran has denied U.S. accusations of acting ""provocatively,"" citing the long history of U.S. interventions in the Middle East and its own right to self-defense.

The San Antonio, Texas-based company has been battling with creditors, a group made up mostly of hedge funds, after it moved Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc shares to another subsidiary, Broader Media LLC.

iHeart this week received a default notice from the creditors, arguing the transfer is technically a default, and saying they could call their debt due in 60 days - a sum more than $6 billion - according to a lawsuit iHeart filed in State District Court in Bexar County, Texas.

The lawsuit also claims that the creditors' actions threaten to force the company into bankruptcy.

The restraining order iHeart won expires in 14 days, but the court may extend it, according to a public filing from the company. The order also stops the creditors from issuing additional notices of default.

iHeart said in a prepared statement that it was pleased with the outcome and looks forward to a favorable ruling.

The share move could be used to help the company, struggling with a $21 billion debt load, to find other financing opportunities, Moody's Investors Service said in a research note.

Choking and lifting are latest efforts to stem U.S. shale bust,"['Amrutha Gayathri', 'Swetha Gopinath']","Sunflowers stalks punctuate the snow in a field near dormant oil drilling rigs which have been stacked in Dickinson, North Dakota January 21, 2016.

Something is awry in the beleaguered U.S. shale patch: older wells, which normally gush oil or natural gas in their first few months before rapidly depleting, are not petering out as quickly as they should.

When oil prices began falling a year and a half ago in the deepest rout in a generation, many analysts expected U.S. crude production, especially from fracking in the new shale plays that contributed to a global supply glut, to follow quickly.

Producers, such as Continental Resources Inc (CLR.N) and Whiting Petroleum Corp (WLL.N), have slashed spending on almost everything, in some cases even leaving drilled wells unfinished to conserve cash and wait for a sustained turnaround in prices.

With oilfield activity suddenly contracting, production from a dwindling number of freshly fracked wells would be unable to compensate for the rapid depletion of older wells. Yet that long-anticipated turning point has only just begun to emerge - partly because producers had a couple more tricks in store.

Some drillers are spending a little bit more on measures that are subtly flattening the so-called ""production curve"" of shale wells, either by limiting the initial surge in output or by squeezing a few additional barrels out of older wells, according to industry executives and analysts.

The measures offer differing benefits.

Choking output at newly fracked wells curtails immediate supply and revenue in hopes that prices will be stronger later, whereas maximizing output at old wells with things like ""artificial lift"" is a relatively cheap way to increase volume and immediate revenues.

Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N), the third-largest services company in the U.S. shale patch, cited its artificial lift business as the ""one notable exception"" to a sector-wide slump in its latest quarter, growing by 4 percent even as other shale-related revenues fell 10 percent.

""Companies still want to grow production, they want to generate cash,"" said Wade Welborn, vice president of artificial lift at Baker Hughes. His business offers ""a means to increase that cash flow.""

For oil markets, they amount to the same thing: the long-anticipated fall-off in U.S. shale oil output is still proving slower and more tempered than anticipated, impeding the process of correcting the global glut that has walloped prices.

""Production optimization is going to be the next phase of the shale revolution,"" said Andrew Slaughter, director for the Deloitte Center for Energy Solutions. ""The low price environment will give companies and operators a chance to take stock of the techniques that work.""

LATE PHASE LIFT

The volume of daily production from a new shale well typically declines by 70 percent in the first nine months, according to estimates provided by SunTrust Robinson-Humphrey analyst Neal Dingmann.

Yet, that sharp decline rate has been shockingly slow to translate into lower production across the United States.

While the number of oil rigs collapsed by some 75 percent since the end of 2014, U.S. production has only barely begun to ebb, a disconnect generally attributed to the increasing productivity of the hydraulic fracturing process, with each new well yielding more barrels than the one before.

But other measures are also in play by companies keen to maximize immediate revenues to cover interest and other payments, and avoid the cost and hassle of shutting in wells.

For instance, rather than forking out $3 million to $6 million to drill and frack a new well, a producer can spend just $250,000-$500,000 to reinvigorate an older well with artificial lift - which may involve injecting chemicals or gas into perforations, or using an electrically driven pumping system.

With lift, a well can begin to flow again at 50-75 percent of its initial production rate in most instances, said Evercore ISI analyst James West. That may help extend the life of a well that would otherwise be slated for abandonment.

""Demand is strong because it is not directly correlated to new wells and drilling,"" said Kyle Chapman, president of Weatherford International Plc (WFT.N) production and completion line.

Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) says it is using workovers, refracking, artificial lift and other techniques to make its wells more productive, even as it cuts spending for the year by 75 percent. It expects 2016 output to fall about 10 percent.

Older wells, in production, help companies cover costs and it would cost more to shut them down, said Julius Walker, a senior consultant at JBC Energy in Vienna, noting this was contributing to ""production resilience"" and causing output to outperform the firm's forecasts based on historical models.

For example, in the Bakken - heart of the shale revolution - official data showed production in the fourth quarter was 60,000 bpd - or about 5 percent - higher than what JBC had estimated based on well data and historical decline rates.

CHOKING ON OIL

Other producers are taking a different, and cheaper, approach, by throttling back the initial production (IP) from newly fracked wells, pumping less now but more later and preserving pressure within the underground reservoir.

Most, if not all, recently drilled wells include a choke, a piece of steel placed in the flow path of oil coming out of a producing well, and more companies are now using them to curb early production in ways that can boost overall output from a well by as much as 10 percent, experts say.

""It's like if you take a coke bottle and shake it up and all the drink fizzles up. But if you don't shake it up, you end up getting more to drink - choking has the same effect,"" said Mike Breard, an analyst at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas.

Continental Resources - an industry pioneer that essentially stopped finishing new wells in North Dakota's Bakken shale field - is also applying chokes to manage production from three news wells in Oklahoma's STACK play.

For example, its Compton oil well, which has been producing for 51 days, pumped 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent in its first 41 days online, but has since been restricted to flow at 1,670 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,World News Video,['Thomson Reuters'],"ROUGH CUT - SUBTITLED (NO REPORTER NARRATION) China's renowned artist and activist Ai Weiwei visited the Greek border camp of Idomeni with his film crew on Wednesday (March 9). Some 14,000 people are stranded there after new border restrictions were imposed along the Balkan migration route. Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia said on Tuesday (March 8) they would place new restrictions on the entry of migrants and Macedonia responded on Wednesday by closing its border completely to illegal migrants, a police official said. Ai walked around the makeshift camp speaking with the migrants - seeing for himself the difficult conditions they have to brave as they wait to cross over to Macedonia and continue their trek northwards to wealthier European states. Ai, known for his criticism of China's human rights record, said he was witnessing a ""huge, big violation of human rights"" in the middle of Europe. ""What we have seen here is almost unbelievable, you know. If you say this is in the middle of Europe, all the people stuck here, and there's no hope for them even to be transferred to anywhere else, you know. It's just in the rain, in the cold, and women, children, all the people waiting for some bread, or some dry clothes, and this is a very sad situation and people have no hope because the door is closed, totally shut off. I think this is a huge, big violation of human rights, right in front of us. I don't know what is going to come out from this, but in Lesbos people still come in thousands every day, and here nobody tells them what to do, and they stay here, still having hope to go to Germany or some other location, but I think, as the sky is getting darker and I don't think there's much hope for them,"" he said. People fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and beyond have flooded into the EU since early 2015, most making the perilous sea crossing from Turkey to Greece, then heading north through the Balkans to Germany. But a cascade of border shutdowns in the Balkans has caused the blocking of the so-called 'Balkans corridor' used by more than a million people since the migratory wave started a year ago. More than 34,0000 people are now trapped on Greece's islands and mainland. At an emergency EU-Turkey summit on Monday (March 7), aimed to stem the migrant influx to Europe, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told leaders of the bloc Ankara was willing to take back all migrants who enter Europe from Turkey in future in return for financial aid, faster EU entry talks and quicker visa-free travel for its citizens. EU leaders aim to work out key details with Turkey by the next scheduled summit on March 17-18. European Council President Donald Tusk said the outcome would show migrants that there was no longer a path into Europe for people seeking a better life.",[]

Iranian state television showed footage of two Qadr missiles being launched from northern Iran, which the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said hit targets 1,400 km (870 miles) away.

Iranian agencies said the missiles were stamped with the Hebrew words, ""Israel should be wiped from the pages of history,"" though the inscription could not be seen on any photographs.

Clinton, a former secretary of state under President Barack Obama, said she was ""deeply concerned"" by the tests, the second round of Iranian missile launches in two days.

""Iran should face sanctions for these activities and the

international community must demonstrate that Iran's threats

toward Israel will not be tolerated,"" said Clinton, who is ahead in the race to be Democratic nominee at the Nov. 8 presidential elections.

Her call for sanctions reflected a tougher line against Iran's recent missile activity than that taken so far by the White House, which said it is aware of and reviewing reports of the Iranian tests, and would determine an appropriate response.

""We know that Iran is in a season of carrying out a number of military activities, and so it certainly would not be a surprise if there are additional launches over the next several days,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

The Iranian move on Wednesday came despite warning from the U.S. State Department after Tuesday's missile tests that Washington continues to ""aggressively apply our unilateral tools

to counter threats from Iran's missile program,"" a possible reference to additional U.S. sanctions.

Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Wednesday with Iran's foreign minister about the test-firing of two ballistic missiles, a State Department spokesman said.

The missile tests underline a rift in Iran between hard-line factions opposed to normalizing relations with the West, and

President Hassan Rouhani's relatively moderate government, which is trying to attract foreign investors to Iran.

ISRAEL IN MIND

Iran's IRGC said the missiles tested on Wednesday were designed with Israel in mind.

""The reason we designed our missiles with a range of 2,000 km is to be able to hit our enemy the Zionist regime from a safe distance,"" Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by the ISNA agency. The nearest point in Iran is around 1,000 km (600 miles) from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon told Israel Radio the tests showed Iran's hostility had not changed since implementing a nuclear deal with world powers in January, despite Rouhani's overtures to the West.

""To my regret there are some in the West who are misled by the honeyed words of part of the Iranian leadership while the other part continues to procure equipment and weaponry, to arm terrorist groups,"" Yaalon said.

Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee, said: Iran is making a mockery of President Obamas vow to confront Irans dangerous and illicit acts.

He urged Obama to ""aggressively enforce all sanctions against Irans missile programs, support for terrorism and human rights abuses. No more looking the other way.

Washington imposed sanctions against businesses and individuals in January over another missile test in October 2015. But the IRGC said it would not bow to pressure.

""The more sanctions and pressure our enemies apply ... the more we will develop our missile program,"" Hajizadeh said on state television.

The IRGC maintains dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles, the largest stock in the Middle East. It says they are solely for defensive use with conventional, non-nuclear warheads.

Tehran has denied U.S. accusations of acting ""provocatively,"" citing the long history of U.S. interventions in the Middle East and its own right to self-defense.

The 1.7-metre tall Nadine was created in the likeness of its maker, Nadia Thalmann, a visiting professor and director of Singapore's Nanyang Technological University's Institute of Media Innovation who has spent three decades researching into virtual humans.

Nadine's software allows the robot to express a range of emotions and recall a previous conversation. Nadine is not commercially available, but Thalmann predicted robots could one day be used as companions for people living with dementia.

""If you leave these people alone they will be going down very quickly. So these people need to always be in interaction,"" Thalmann said, adding Nadine could provide conversation, tell a story or play a simple game.

Thalmann and her team are also working on emotive robots that can play with children. The project is still in the early development stage and no prototype is available yet.

The child robot would be able to respond to questions, display emotions and recognize people. Aside from being a social companion, the child robot could supervise unattended children and inform a parent or nanny if something went wrong, Thalmann said.

There are plans to program the child robot to speak different languages so that it can serve as an educational tool for children, she said.

""A child has toys but they are usually passive. This robot will be an active toy which interacts with the child,"" said Thalmann. ""It will be able to remember what the child likes.""

Berlin/Moskau Die Bundesregierung hat die sofortige Freilassung der ukrainischen Kampfpilotin Nadja Sawtschenko aus russischer Haft gefordert.

Der Mordprozess gegen Sawtschenko verstoe gegen Geist und Buchstaben des Waffenstillstandsabkommens von Minsk, kritisierte Regierungssprecher Steffen Seibert am Mittwoch in Berlin. In der Vereinbarung sei zugesagt worden, alle Gefangenen und Geiseln des Konflikts in der Ostukraine auszutauschen.

NEW YORK Tairod Pugh, a U.S. Air Force veteran, was found guilty on Wednesday of attempting to join Islamic State, according to his lawyer.

The conviction marks the first case in more than 75 Islamic State-related prosecutions brought since 2014 by the U.S. Department of Justice to reach a jury verdict.

After a week-long trial in Brooklyn federal court, a jury found Pugh, 48, guilty of attempting to provide material support to a designated terrorist organization, and obstruction for destroying four portable electronic storage devices after his detention in Turkey.

""Of course, we are disappointed with the verdict as we put in great effort to defend the case, but the jury appeared to be fair and genuinely concerned about reaching the correct verdict as they saw it,"" Pugh's lawyer Eric Creizman said.

Pugh will be sentenced in September, Creizman said.

Prosecutors said Pugh immersed himself in violent Islamic State propaganda for months before buying a one-way flight from his home in Egypt to Turkey, where he hoped to cross the Syrian border into territory controlled by the extremist group.

He was detained by Turkish authorities at an Istanbul airport and eventually flown to the United States to face terrorism charges.

Pugh's defense lawyers argued that his only offense was to express ""repugnant"" views about Islamic State in Facebook posts and to watch dozens of the group's slickly produced recruitment videos. They said he traveled to Turkey to find work, not to become a jihadist.

But prosecutors pointed to a letter he drafted to his Egyptian wife, found on his laptop, in which he vowed to fight for Islam and declared he had two options: ""Victory or Martyr."" The letter was written days before he flew to Turkey, though it was unclear whether he ever sent it.

He also took with him to Istanbul a black facemask, a map depicting Islamic State's strongholds in Syria and a chart of the border crossings between Turkey and Syria.

Only one other Islamic State-related U.S. prosecution has reached trial. In Phoenix, Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem is on trial for plotting with others to attack a Prophet Mohammed cartoon contest in Texas. Two of his alleged associates were killed in a shootout with police at the event.

Pugh served as an avionics specialist in the Air Force from 1986 to 1990 and later worked as an Army contractor in Iraq from 2009 to 2010, prosecutors said.

OTTAWA The Bank of Canada held interest rates steady on Wednesday, citing stronger non-energy exports and an economy growing largely as expected, as it awaits this month's federal budget to gauge the impact of the Liberal government's stimulus plans.

The Canadian dollar firmed following the widely expected decision, as the central bank appeared to shrug off a recent rebound in the currency, saying that the rise in the exchange rate and oil prices are in line with what was assumed in January.

Traders had been looking to see what the bank would make of the Canadian dollar's appreciation since its last monetary policy meeting in January, with a weak currency seen essential to boosting the export sector. While the currency has firmed since hitting a 12-year low in January, it is still significantly weaker than a year ago.

""There was some fear that the bank might address some of the strength in the currency, but they ducked that pretty effectively,"" said David Tulk, chief Canada macro strategist at TD Securities.

As widely anticipated, the bank kept its overnight rate at 0.5 percent, where it has been since July 2015. The bank cut rates twice last year to combat the impact of cheaper oil, a major Canadian export.

Low oil prices are expected to continue to dampen growth in Canada, though the U.S. expansion remains on track and recent financial market volatility ""appears to be abating,"" the bank said.

Despite better-than-expected domestic growth in the fourth quarter, the bank said the near-term outlook remained broadly the same as its January assessment.

The economy grew at an annualized 0.8 percent clip in the fourth quarter, topping the bank's expectations for no growth. Economists anticipate this could set the first-quarter up to exceed the bank's 1 percent forecast.

Overall, employment has held up and household spending is supporting demand, while non-energy exports are gaining momentum, particularly in currency-sensitive sectors, the bank said.

An assessment of expected government measures will be included in April's economic projections. The new Liberal government will release its first budget on March 22 and a big deficit is expected.

The bank maintained that inflation is evolving as expected, with the factors that pushed total inflation up to its 2 percent target likely to be unwound in the coming months.

It also reiterated that financial vulnerabilities continue to edge higher due to regional shifts amidst a structural adjustment in the broader economy.

The economy was under siege from the worst drought since 1992, Patrick Chinamasa said on Wednesday, noting that the reforms had the full backing of Mugabe, who has previously attacked the IMF for imposing stringent credit conditions.

Mugabe's government started defaulting on debts to the IMF, World Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB) and several Western lenders in 1999, leading to a freeze in financial aid.

Chinamasa told reporters at the end of a economic review by an IMF team that the government's wage bill would be cut to 52 percent of government spending by 2019 from 82 percent but did not elaborate on how this would be achieved.

The government would also target ten state-owned firms to try to make them profitable and evaluate all land seized from white farmers in a bid to compensate displaced farmers.

Chinamasa said production by black farmers who took over the previously white-owned farms was ""scandalously low"".

He said Harare broke bilateral investment agreements when it seized farms owned by foreigners and that this would be fixed.

Compensation would be paid out of rent from black farmers who benefited from the seizures, a ministry circular said.

Zimbabwe made world headlines in 2000 when thousands of war veterans and Mugabe's supporters started violently evicting white farmers. More than a dozen farmers were killed.

Chinamasa said Zimbabwe had drafted a new financing programme to be presented to the IMF, whose executive board will vote on Harare's plan to repay $1.8 billion (1.2 billion) in arrears on May 2.

Zimbabwe is struggling to emerge from a deep recession in the decade to 2008, which slashed its GDP by nearly half, drove hundreds of thousands abroad in search of better paying jobs and pushed formal unemployment above 85 percent.

The IMF expects the economy to grow by 1.4 percent this year from 1.1 percent in 2015 and to rise 5.6 percent in 2017.

The IMF's head of mission to Zimbabwe, Domenico Fanizza, said Harare met all its targets under a fund monitoring programme, but improving fiscal discipline and re-engaging the international community should be a major priority.

""It will also send strong signals to the international community, reduce the perceived country risk premium and unlock affordable financing for the government and private sector,"" Fanizza said.

Crude oil and U.S. equity prices have been linked for much of 2016 to a degree that has surprised many investors. Wednesday's market action extended that trend, with WTI crude CLc1 rising nearly 5 percent and the S&P 500 energy sector .SPNY up 1.5 percent. Chevron (CVX.N) jumped 4.6 percent to $92.82 and gave the biggest boost to the energy sector.

""It's not about oil being a barometer of the global economy,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. ""A lot of it has to do with psychology.""

U.S. crude and the S&P 500 have been directionally correlated on all but six trading days this year, according to Wunderlich data.

""Stability in that asset class (oil) for a period of time will allow for the correlation to break down,"" said Hogan.

Since Feb. 11, the S&P 500 has gained 8.8 percent, but it is still down 2.7 percent for the year.

The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 36.26 points, or 0.21 percent, to 17,000.36, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 10 points, or 0.51 percent, to 1,989.26 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 25.55 points, or 0.55 percent, to 4,674.38.

In a week with a thin economic data calendar, markets will turn to the European Central Bank, which is expected to further ease monetary policy on Thursday.

Biotechnology stocks came under pressure a day after the U.S. government proposed a test program that would lower incentives to use higher-priced drugs when alternative treatments are available.

The Nasdaq Biotechnology sector .NBI fell 1.2 percent with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN.O) down 5.1 percent to $374.75 as the largest decliner on the Nasdaq 100.

Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) lost 3.4 percent to $506.63. Already reeling from several food-borne illnesses, the company temporarily shut a Massachusetts restaurant after four employees fell sick.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE on a 2.3-to-1 ratio while on the Nasdaq a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 48 new highs and 41 new lows.

About 7.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the average 8.67 billion in the previous 20 sessions.

The Canadian index has rebounded sharply since hitting an almost 3-1/2 year low in January, helped by a recovery in oil, but Zohny warned it may struggle to push on from here given energy companies have jumped and banks are richly valued.

""It wouldn't surprise us to see the Canadian market cool down in the coming months,"" he said.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 20:41:00+00:00,Cleanup of Massachusetts Chipotle complete after norovirus illnesses,"['Lisa Baertlein', 'Brian Snyder']","BILLERICA, Mass./LOS ANGELES A health official on Wednesday commended Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc for its handling of norovirus infections at a Boston-area restaurant, saying employees prevented more problems by calling in sick rather than report to work and that a cleanup of the restaurant was done.

Shares of Chipotle fell as much as 6.1 percent before easing, down 3.5 percent to $506.12 in afternoon trading.

The closure of the Chipotle in Billerica, Massachusetts, was seen as a test of a new food safety system rolled out after a series of illnesses hit the fresh burrito chain last year.

""They did the right thing,"" said Howard Penney, who covers the chain for Hedgeye Risk Management. However, he argued that Chipotle was still a ""broken company"" and that it would take years to return to its peak performance.

One employee was confirmed ill with norovirus and two more are suspected to have the virus, the top health official of the town of Billerica said.

The cleaned restaurant was scheduled to reopen on Thursday, Billerica Public Health Director Richard Berube told reporters, adding that the employees suspected of having the virus did not come to work on Wednesday.

""They called in sick so that was very fortunate,"" he said outside the closed restaurant.

Berube, the company and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health all said no customers were known to be sick.

Chipotle is trying to repair its reputation after a series of food-safety incidents. Those include two E.coli outbreaks linked to its restaurants that sickened more than 50 people in 10 states, as well as separate outbreaks of norovirus, a highly contagious virus known as the ""winter vomiting bug"", in Massachusetts and California that involved more than 350 diners.

Berube said Chipotle has been ""very proactive."" Remaining staff at the burrito restaurant would be screened for norovirus, he added.

Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold said the company closed the restaurant after four employees called in sick. Berube said three employees were sick or suspected of being sick.

The restaurant closure comes as Chipotle has tried to lure back diners with coupons for a free burrito and other food.

Chipotle sales have fallen sharply since the E.coli outbreaks came to light late last year. The stock traded above $750 last summer.

Sales at established Chipotle restaurants tumbled 14.6 percent in the fourth quarter, including a drop of 30 percent in the month of December.

""The publicity around this news announcement will be another negative data-point that may affect consumer demand,"" CRT Capital analyst Lynne Collier said in a client note.

Chipotle temporarily closed all of its U.S. restaurants on Feb. 8 during prime lunch hours to hold staff meetings on food safety.

Up to Tuesday's close of $524.69, the company's stock had fallen about 18 percent since the first E.coli outbreak was reported on Oct. 31.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 17:26:38+00:00,U.S. CDC director calls Puerto Rico his No. 1 Zika priority,['Julie Steenhuysen'],"Thomas Frieden, director of U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attends a news conference in San Juan March 8, 2016.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico In the fight against the Zika virus, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls Puerto Rico his top priority and is expressing worry about how to respond.

Unlike the Ebola virus, which has killed more 10,000 people in West Africa since 2014, ""there's no playbook for Zika,"" Dr. Thomas Frieden said in an interview on Tuesday during a tour of the Caribbean island U.S. territory to assess how to proceed.

Most Zika infections cause only minor illness, but the mosquito-borne virus has been linked to a spike in cases of the birth defect microcephaly in Brazil, the country hardest-hit by Zika as it spreads through Latin America and the Caribbean.

Frieden recalled a similar trip to West Africa in 2014 during the Ebola outbreak in which he toured response operations in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

""I met with each of the presidents, and I could tell them, 'If you do this, you can stop Ebola,'"" Frieden said.

With the Zika virus, he said, ""I don't have that kind of playbook. We're just now figuring out what are the things that could happen.""

Among U.S. states and territories, Puerto Rico is particularly vulnerable because of its Caribbean location and the presence of the main mosquito species that transmits Zika through bites. The World Health Organization last month declared a global public health emergency over Zika.

Although Zika is not a new virus, the evidence that it may cause microcephaly is recent.

""Until a few months ago, no one had any idea that Zika could cause birth defects,"" Frieden told a news conference earlier on Tuesday.

Scientists are urgently trying to confirm whether or not the virus causes microcephaly, a condition in which babies have abnormally small heads, underdeveloped brains and often lifelong developmental problems, amid mounting evidence that it does.

Frieden said it has been 50 years since a new pathogen was discovered that could cause a birth defect and ""we've never before known a mosquito-borne disease that could cause a birth defect.""

ZIKA EMERGENCY FUNDS

The CDC director spent part of last week testifying before the U.S. Congress to make the case for President Barack Obama's request for more than $1.8 billion in emergency funds for responding to the threat posed by Zika. Several top lawmakers have balked, saying he should first draw from funding previously set aside for fighting Ebola.

""I'm worried because what I'm seeing here are really big requirements, really big needs, and the funding request is real,"" Frieden said in the interview, referring to Puerto Rico, home to 3.5 million people.

""Look at what happened with dengue,"" a similar virus carried by the same mosquito as Zika, he said. ""More than 80 percent of adults were infected,"" he added.

Based on that, Frieden said he expects hundreds of thousands of people to be infected in Puerto Rico in the coming months, including thousands of pregnant women.

""We need to do everything possible to reduce the number,"" Frieden said.

Frieden expressed concern over the number of Puerto Rican women who do not want to get pregnant but are not using birth control.

""Clearly, if a woman doesn't want to become pregnant and it's consistent with her religion and beliefs to use contraceptives, she should be on contraception,"" he said.

He said it appears that Puerto Ricans are becoming more familiar with the risks associated with Zika.

""Two weeks ago, we heard that people in Puerto Rico are not worried about this, they are not taking it seriously,"" Frieden said.

But Frieden said that ""every pregnant women we talk with is taking this very seriously. They are all very worried about Zika. They want help and support to protect themselves.""

Palestinian man Tamer Al-Burai shows how he sleeps while using an Oxygen-generating device powered by Solar energy, at his house in Gaza City March 2, 2016.

A Palestinian worker installs solar panels atop the roof of a house in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip March 5, 2016.

A Palestinian woman works inside her kitchen lit by candles during a power cut at her dwelling in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip March 6, 2016.

GAZA Faced with power blackouts lasting anything from eight to 12 hours a day, residents and businesses in Gaza are increasingly turning to the sun to supply their energy needs.

Not only are solar panels more reliable and cheaper in the long run, but in some cases, including that of Tamer al-Burai, they have become essential to staying alive.

""To me, power is not just about lights or entertainment, it's a matter of life and death,"" said Burai, 40, who suffers from a severe sleep disorder that affects his breathing and has to be hooked up to an oxygen ventilator at night.

Burai used to spend around 18,000 shekels ($4,600) a year on fuel to run a generator that helped make sure he could weather the daily blackouts. Now he has invested in solar panels, making the long-run costs much cheaper.

""I paid $5,000 to get solar energy for the entire house and that will provide relief for years to come,"" the father of four told Reuters proudly.

Whereas three or four years ago only a handful of Gaza's 1.95 million people could afford to think about solar panels, in the past couple of years, as prices have come down, it has become a much more accessible option.

Schools, hospitals, shops, banks and even mosques have started to install panels on their roofs across the Gaza Strip, a self-governing Palestinian enclave which suffered considerable damage in 2014 during a seven-week war between Israel and Palestinian armed groups based in the territory.

Nabeel Marouf, the general manager of the Gaza-based Renewable Power Engineering and Contracting Company, said he had been overwhelmed with orders. Two years ago, he might have had a dozen clients, he said, but now it's in the thousands.

""People have lost hope for a solution to the power crisis, and on top of that there's the fuel crisis,"" he said, explaining that the regular power supply, interrupted for years, was a mess and fuel for generators was costly and problematic.

SUNSHINE GALORE

Looking across the rooftops of downtown Gaza City, it is clear solar is catching on, with glinting panels on almost every building. New technology even allows people to hang panels over the edge of their balconies.

Most of the equipment, including batteries and controllers, is imported from China, where they are made by U.S., Canadian or German companies, said Marouf. They are imported via Israel, which allows them into Gaza via one of its crossings.

Costs for a system range from $1,500 to $30,000, depending on the amount of energy people need.

Gaza has three usual sources of power: around 60 MegaWatts generated by the enclave's only power plant, 30MW imported from Egypt and 120MW that is supplied from Israel.

Solar power - abundant the year-round in Gaza, perched as it is on the edge of the southeastern Mediterranean between Israel and Egypt - may provide the territory with a degree of energy independence.

In Khan Younis, a town in the southern Gaza Strip, Mohammad Abu Jayyab watched workers as they installed panels on his home.

""It has become clear that there are no solutions (to the energy crisis) in the near future,"" said Abu Jayyab, a local economist. ""The situation became tragic, so we resorted to an alternative - solar power.""

Michael Horn, speaks at their media reception during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, January 10, 2016.

Michael Horn, President and CEO of Volkswagen America, reacts to being mobbed by the media after he apologized for the Volkswagen diesel scandal at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, United States in a November 18, 2015 file photo.

Michael Horn, President and CEO of Volkswagen America, introduces the new Beetle Dune at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, United States in a November 18, 2015 file photo.

WASHINGTON Volkswagen AG's top U.S. executive is stepping down nearly six months after the German automaker admitted to installing software to allow 580,000 diesel U.S. vehicles to emit excess emissions, the company said on Wednesday.

Michael Horn, who has been president and chief executive officer of Volkswagen Group of America since 2014, is leaving by mutual agreement ""to pursue other opportunities effective immediately,"" VW said.

Horn, 54, could not immediately be reached. A lawyer for Horn did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

The German automaker said on an interim basis, Hinrich J. Woebcken, a former BMW executive who ran global purchasing among other jobs, is filling Horn's job. In January, VW named Woebcken as head of VW's North American region, effective April 1.

Horn sent an email to employees thanking them for supporting him and for pulling together during the crisis.

Horn's departure comes as VW continues to negotiate with California, the Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency on possible fixes or buybacks for the diesel vehicles that emit up to 40 times legally allowable pollution. It faces a March 24 deadline to tell a federal judge whether it has an acceptable fix.

A top California official told state lawmakers Tuesday that VW may only be able to mount a partial fix and may have to pay to mitigate the harm caused by allowing vehicles to remain on the road.

Volkswagen faces an ongoing Justice Department criminal investigation. The Justice Department sued VW in January seeking up to $46 billion for violating environmental regulations and sent VW a civil subpoena under a bank fraud law.

Alan Brown, general manager of Hendrick Volkswagen in Frisco, Texas who is president of the National Volkswagen Dealer Advisory Council, praised Horn's tenure at VW and said he had talked to Horn over the last three days about his departure. Brown told Reuters Horn had been offered other jobs at Volkswagen outside the United States, but declined to take them.

Brown said it was critical VW maintain the strategy of growing U.S. volume and noted dealers have strongly supported the automaker through the crisis.

""We are not working out of gas stations any more,"" Brown said, noting VW's about U.S. 650 dealers have invested $1 billion over the last decade in facilities.

Brown is flying to Germany on Sunday and staying through Wednesday for meetings with VW executives in the aftermath of Horn's departure.

VW brand U.S. sales are down 14 percent this year after falling 5 percent last year. VW still faces a stop sale on all new diesel vehicles.

Brown said it was important VW stick with the business plan it approved to expand U.S. sales by quickly refreshing and redesigning vehicles.

U.S. VW dealers ""don't want a handout. They want a chance to win,"" Brown said. He said VW should scrap the idea of positioning itself as a ""near premium brand"" and return to its roots in the 1960s of selling mass market vehicles like the iconic Beetle.

Dennis Gaudet, a New Hampshire VW dealer, said Brown was ""probably the most popular (head) we've had as long as I've been a dealer"" and added he knew the American market ""better than most.""

During the initial response to the crisis, Horn was VW's public face in the United States, apologizing days after the scandal became public and testifying before Congress.

""Lets be clear about this: our company was dishonest  with the EPA and the California Air Resources Board  and with all of you. And in my German words: We totally screwed up. We must fix those cars,"" Horn said on Sept. 21.

In October, Horn told a U.S. House of Representatives panel that VWs supervisory board and top leadership did not intentionally order the cheating, but said it was the work of a few individuals.

Horn told Congress he had no knowledge of the cheating.

Horn joined VW in 1990 and held a series of jobs, including VW sales for Europe, before he became CEO based at VW's U.S. headquarters in Herndon, Virginia following the resignation of his predecessor, Jonathan Browning who abruptly resigned after VW brand sales fell in 2013. Sales fell despite an aggressive plan announced in 2008 by VW to triple sales in 10 years.

WASHINGTON A U.S. general nominated to lead U.S. forces in the Middle East told lawmakers on Wednesday that he was concerned about the lack of a reliable partner in Syria in the fight against Islamic State and would look carefully at Washington's strategy if confirmed to the post.

Army General Joseph Votel told the Senate Armed Services Committee he would seek to ensure a coherent and well-resourced strategy to go after Islamic State strongholds.

""In Iraq we do have a partner, we do have a government, (but) in Syria we don't and so I am concerned about how we approach this moving forward in Syria without a political element to support that,"" Votel told the committee, which is considering his nomination to head the U.S. Central Command that oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East.

""I do have concerns about our broader strategy against ISIL,"" Votel said, using an acronym for Islamic State, ""about how we are applying resources, about how we are focusing our authorities.""

Votel said operations to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul and the Syrian city of Raqqa would take additional resources.

The committee also is considering the nomination of Army Lieutenant General Raymond Thomas to lead U.S. Special Operations Command. Thomas told the members that U.S.-backed rebels in northeastern Syria had suffered more than 75 casualties fighting Islamic State in the past month.

""They're losing a lot of people to carry the fight against ISIL, so I'm impressed with their tenacity,"" Thomas said.

In response to a comment from Republican Senator John McCain, Thomas said he would support the presence of U.S. special forces in Libya to combat a growing threat from Islamic State there.

The United States launched an air strike on an Islamic State training camp last month and France has conducted surveillance flights and sent military advisers. U.S., French and British special forces also are present in the country, officials and media have said.

""That particular part of ungoverned space requires potentially unique special operations solutions and we're attempting to provide those options to the chain of command,"" Thomas said. ""We've already identified some formative organizations that we hope to be able to work with in the future.""

LONDON - British economic growth slowed in the three months to February, but is likely to be stronger for the first quarter of 2016 as a whole, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said on Wednesday.

NIESR estimated that Britain's economy grew at a quarterly rate of 0.3 percent in the three months to February, down from 0.4 percent in the three months to January.

Britain's economy grew 0.5 percent in the final quarter of 2015, and if growth fell to 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2016, it would be the weakest calendar quarter since late 2012.

NIESR researcher Jack Meaning said this looked unlikely.

""Output growth at the start of 2016 has been subdued,"" he said. ""However, it appears that December 2015 may have been a low point for GDP and ... output growth for the first quarter may strengthen slightly.""

Manufacturing output in January showed a bigger-than-expected rebound after falling in December, official figures showed earlier on Wednesday.

NIESR forecast last month that Britain's economy would grow by 2.3 percent in 2016 as a whole, similar to 2015.

Creative director Karl Lagerfeld's frequently spectacular sets at Paris Fashion Week are well known but the 82-year old designer opted for a paired-down dressing room feel this season, all plush cream carpets and walls of mirrors. The twist was that all the guests were seated on the front row of the lengthy catwalk; gone were the banks of benches to be replaced by rows of gold chairs which brought the people closer to the clothes. Lagerfeld said that people would not complain as they would be able to see every detail. On international women's day, Lagerfeld's women were ready to take on the world -- impractical footwear was banished in favour of flat riding boots, their two sections held together with laces. And with a half-mile march from one end of the runway to the other, the flat shoes came in handy. The designer has also decided that hats are back. His padded boaters were everywhere in colours ranging from fuschia to black, in leather and tweed but Lagerfeld said they were meant to be functional, not fussy. The collection opened with a parade in pink -- hot, fuschia and lavender -- with Chanel's classic tweed suits renewed with deconstructed fringes and denim details. Away from the suits, the collection was not classic Autumn/Winter, with silky floral prints and layered peasant dresses topped with pearls.

reuters.com,2015-09-15 21:57:16+00:00,From ivory tower to incubator: Transforming students and researchers into entrepreneurs,['Reuters Editorial'],"Sample6 is a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based startup with a new way to detect food-borne pathogens such as Listeria and Salmonella. Its technology was conceived in a Boston University lab, and the company was cofounded by Boston University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology PhD students Michael Koeris, Timothy Lu and Tanguy Chau. But they didn't do it on their own - Sample6 had lots of help, advice and $150,000 in convertible notes from Boston University's Office of Technology Development.

Koeris tapped into what Boston University calls a gap fund, created to help university entrepreneurs develop proof-of-concept prototypes. The fund expands on the traditional role of the university technology transfer office, which is to work with its researchers to file patents and license their ideas to the private sector.

""What tech transfer offices historically don't do well is facilitate company formation,"" says Koeris, Sample6's vice president of operations. ""Tech transfer at BU is different.""

Koeris said Boston University's gap fund, plus a staff that has some entrepreneurial experience, helped him and Lu prove that their idea could be commercialized. That enabled their nascent company to attract conventional venture backing.

So far Sample6 has received a total of $25 million in grants and funding from Boston University and about a half-dozen venture-capital firms, such as Canaan Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures and Flybridge Capital Partners. Sample6 now sells two products, a Listeria detector called Sample6 Detect/L and a management tool called Sample6 Control. Next year it is on track to release a Salmonella detector.

Other universities have also begun expanding the role of their technology transfer offices to include investing in homegrown startups. The goal is to give the new companies a better shot at success, with the university standing to gain license revenue if the startup begins making money and shares that would yield a payback if the company goes public or is acquired.

There's also the hope that company founders will make a hefty donation to the university if they hit it big. But few patents and licenses actually create revenue. Most comes from a few big hits, such as the hepatitis B vaccine from the University of California at San Francisco, which has earned close to half a billion dollars.

Technology transfer officials say that in the past couple of years, they've had to develop more expertise in starting companies. ""Part of our role is increasingly supporting the creation of new businesses,"" says William Tucker, executive director for innovations, alliances and services for the University of California system. He says large companies ""don't have much basic research anymore,"" and rely on startups to do commercial proof of concepts.

The California system is one of the leaders in direct investment in startups. It has various incubators and accelerators on its campuses, and has established a $250 million venture capital fund, as well as campus-based seed funds for prototypes.

It has a lot to work with: The California system produced the most patents in 2014 of any university system. That same year it earned $118.3 million in revenue from technology licenses and patents, according to its transfer office's annual report.

Many universities make less than $1 million a year in licensing revenue, according to data from the Association of University Technology Managers, a trade group for technology transfer officials.

""What's happening is that universities have developed whole ecosystems for entrepreneurial research,"" says Donald Siegel, dean of the school of business at the University at Albany, who specializes in the study of university technology transfer.

Siegel says universities offer business development help, make small loans to or investments in companies founded by faculty and students, start incubators and accelerators to help spur companies, and count starting a company toward tenure consideration for faculty.

Technology transfer offices are changing, in part, in order to fill a gap in research funding created by the recession of 2008-2009, after which tech transfer officials say many large companies, especially pharmaceutical companies, became less willing to license basic research. Technology transfer offices will still license basic research, but it typically takes five to 15 years to commercialize, a timeframe too long for most venture capital funds. Universities started setting up investment funds like Boston University's gap fund to help faculty and students commercialize the technology. (The Boston fund is technically not a venture fund because it is not judged by its internal rate of return.)

""It's gotten harder and harder every year to license technology right out of university to an ongoing concern,"" says Carl Gulbrandsen, managing director of the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF). Founded in 1925, it's one of the nation's oldest and most successful technology transfer organizations. Gulbrandsen says the prime industries for licensing are agricultural companies and pharmaceuticals, and the Great Recession made pharmaceuticals in particular more risk averse and less willing to spend on research and development.

Now, Gulbrandsen says, ""they expect universities and small companies to take the risk."" Wisconsin is unusual in that WARF operates separately from the university, does not receive funds from the university, and instead gives university researchers funding from its endowment. In 2014, its endowment reached $2.8 billion last year and WARF provided $60 million in research grants to university researchers.

WARF, which handles technology transfer for all the UW campuses except Milwaukee, has taken a variety of steps to help its academics become entrepreneurs. It brings in 30 paid mentors twice a year to advise faculty and staff on ideas they're trying to commercialize. It provides money to the university's business and law schools to help with legal and accounting needs. It partnered with the State of Wisconsin's pension fund to establish a $30 million seed fund to invest in the university's startups. And in 2014, WARF and the University of Wisconsin-Madison invested $3.2 million to open an accelerator, a shared workspace aimed to help startups, called Discovery to Product.

Technology transfer officials say that they're engaging in startup companies not primarily for the money, but because they see startups as a way to publicize knowledge from their labs. ""I always say we don't even warrant a note in the annual report for our income,"" says Katharine Ku, executive director of Stanford's Office of Technology and Licensing. ""But Stanford has never felt that it was a focus of the office.""

Stanford's technology transfer operation earned $108 million in revenue in 2014 according to its annual report, with its biggest earner pulling in $60 million, and its smallest just $1.18.

Ku, who started at Stanford in 1982, says tech transfer has matured greatly since then, and the push for startups is part of this maturing.

""We all have this mission of transferring technology. The focus around the country and by the university is that startups may be the only way technology will get out there, because it's so early stage,"" she says. ""There's a huge gap between a university lab's results and commercialization of that invention.""

Initial jobless claims  considered by many as the most solid indicator measuring the health of the job market because its a count of real people not a representative survey  are forecast at 275,000 in the week ended March 5, according to a Reuters poll.

That median forecast has sat on the lower end of the spectrum of reported new unemployment benefit claims in each week since the start of 2016, when close to 300,000 people queued up for state assistance.

Jobless claims undercut even the lowest forecast at the start of the year, although for the most part it has stayed within the forecast range.

The top 20 most accurate forecasters on the indicator in Reuters polls are all within a few thousand of 275,000. The most pessimistic is 295,000 from Morgan Stanley.

So long as the needle stays around current levels, past correlations with other data show the economy faces no real danger of a recession.

With the unemployment rate at 4.9 percent and still falling, there are few reasons to worry. The economy added 242,000 jobs in February  50,000 more than forecast. Average earnings fell on the month, but economists say that has more to do with the timing of measuring pay that month than a fundamental downturn.

BofAML economists wrote in a note to clients:

Bears write off the continued labor market strength as a lagging indicator. Yes, over-200,000 payroll growth is unsustainable and will decelerate over time. But a variety of leading indicators do not suggest a recessionary slowdown in employment is looming. The good news is that claims have been quite well-behaved of late. After creeping up to just shy of 300,000 in mid-January  raising red flags among some of the doomsayers  we are back below 280,000.

Jim OSullivan, the most accurate U.S. economic data forecaster in Reuters Polls last year, relies heavily on jobless claims for a reading of how well the economy is doing. He remains optimistic, telling clients in a note this week not to worry too much unless jobless claims trend higher.

That said, claims are well above a four-decade low of 255,000 struck in July of last year, which coincided with annualized economic growth of a relatively modest 2 percent in that quarter. It slowed half that rate in the following quarter.

A surging dollar and weak global trade  weak enough to warrant another warning from the International Monetary Fund this week  has clearly taken a heavy toll, particularly on manufacturing and exports.

Even the non-manufacturing ISM employment index has already dipped below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, a first since February 2014. But most are treating that sudden dip as a blip.

Judging just by the length of past expansions, and how low claims generally go before rising again, the risk of a more substantial increase sometime before long appears likely.

As the chart below shows, once jobless claims start to rise substantially, a recession nearly always follows.

The main difference this time is the U.S. Federal Reserve has only just begun raising interest rates.

Mandatory Credit: Justin Sellers/The Clarion-Ledger via USA TODAY NETWORK

Detroit Allen Angriffen aus den eigenen Reihen zum Trotz lasst sich Donald Trump im Rennen um die Prasidentschaftskandidatur nicht aus der Spur bringen.

Nach erneut prestigetrachtigen Vorwahlsiegen hat der Milliardar die republikanische Konkurrenz weiter abgehangt und zieht gestarkt in die richtungsweisende Abstimmungsrunde am kommenden Dienstag. Anders Hillary Clinton. Sie punkte zwar in Mississippi und liegt bei den Demokraten nach wie vor in Fuhrung. Aber ausgerechnet bei der wichtigsten Vorwahl des Abends in Michigan erlitt die Ex-Auenministerin eine empfindliche Niederlage. Sie muss furchten, dass mit dem Erfolg ihres Widersachers Bernie Sanders der Signalschuss fur eine Aufholjagd des selbst ernannten Sozialisten gefallen ist, wenn es in einer Woche in den bevolkerungsreichen Bundesstaaten Florida, Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina und Missouri besonders viele Stimmen im Kampf um die Kandidatur zu holen gibt.

Groer Gewinner der jungsten Etappe im Vorwahlkampf war einmal mehr Trump. In seiner Siegesserie rief er das Parteiestablishment auf, endlich den Widerstand gegen ihn aufzugeben, sich hinter ihm zu scharen und auf die Ruckeroberung des Weien Hauses bei der Prasidentenwahl im November zu konzentrieren. Schlielich ziehe er schon jetzt neue Wahler auf die Seite der Republikaner. ""Wir haben hier etwas am laufen, das so gut ist, dass wir einander packen und die Partei einen sollten.""

Wie kein anderer Bewerber hat Trump die Republikaner mit populistischen Tiraden gegen Muslime, Einwanderer und Frauen polarisiert. Nach seiner Vorwahl-Siegesserie beim Super Tuesday Anfang Marz riefen etablierte Parteivertreter in mehreren Aktionen offentlich dazu auf, Trump nicht zu wahlen. Lobbygruppen schalteten fur Millionen Dollar Anti-Trump-TV-Spots. Doch bei der Basis fruchtete das offenbar nicht. Sowohl in Michigan als auch in Mississippi erntete der politische Auenseiter am meisten Zuspruch. Umfragen zufolge punktete er bei strengglaubigen Christen genauso wie bei den Wahlern, die vor allem uber die Politiker in Washington wutend sind. Gerade in dem vom wirtschaftlichen Niedergang gezeichneten einstigen Industriezentrum Michigan kam Trumps Versprechen gut an, ins Ausland verloren gegangene Jobs wieder zuruckzuholen.

LETZTE CHANCE FUR RUBIO IN FLORIDA

Dagegen hatte der Liebling des Establishments, Marco Rubio, keine Chance. Der vergleichsweise moderate Senator muss nun dringender denn je in seinem Heimatstaat Florida siegen, sonst durfte er vor dem Aus stehen. Einige Beobachter sind sich jedoch jetzt schon sicher, dass die Nominierung nur noch zwei Bewerber unter sich ausmachen: Trump und der erzkonservative Senator Ted Cruz. Der Texaner siegte am Dienstag in Idaho und zementierte damit seine Position als aussichtsreichster Rivale des New Yorker Unternehmers. Doch Trump gab sich gelassen: ""Ted wird es schwer haben. Er gewinnt nur selten gegen mich.""

Bei den Demokraten sah sich Sanders im Aufwind: Das Ergebnis in Michigan zeige, wie falsch die Demoskopen doch liegen konnten. In Umfragen war Clinton auf einen zweistelligen Vorsprung gekommen, doch am Ende unterlag sie knapp. Sanders werte dies als Beleg, dass seine politische Bewegung gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeit in jedem Teil der USA stark sei. ""Offen gesagt, wir glauben, dass unsere starksten Gebiete erst noch kommen"", sagte der Senator aus Vermont. Im Clinton-Lager durfte die Warnung angekommen sein.",[]

The opinions expressed are his own.

The United States may find technology groups are a riskier tool of foreign policy than banks. America has long used its dominance of international finance to compel foreign lenders to enforce U.S. sanctions. New restrictions on Chinas ZTE are an extension of the principle. But targeting technology has larger ramifications at home.

Until now, overseas banks were the main targets of Americas extraterritorial reach. U.S. officials demanded that foreign lenders help enforce sanctions against unfriendly countries such as Iran and North Korea. When banks disobeyed they faced increasingly large fines, culminating in the $8.9 billion penalty paid by BNP Paribas in 2014. Governments complained that the United States was enlisting foreign firms to fight its diplomatic battles. The banks had little choice, however: no large financial institution can credibly function without a U.S. licence.

Now ZTE is learning the cost of sanctions-busting. The U.S. Commerce Department has slapped an effective export ban on all stateside suppliers to the Chinese telecom equipment firm, massively disrupting its supply chain. The Shenzhen-based firms alleged offense was channeling U.S.-made technology to Iran, in a direct breach of sanctions.

On the face of it, ZTE has been caught red-handed. Alongside its ruling, the Commerce Department released company documents from 2011 which set out how it planned to avoid the restrictions. One states explicitly that ZTE is using U.S. technology in Iran, Sudan, North Korea, Syria and Cuba  in breach of sanctions. Another document, labeled Top Secret, has the revealing title Proposal for Import and Export Control Risk Avoidance. It even includes a flow chart setting out how ZTE can dodge controls.

The Chinese company says it is talking to the U.S. government about a solution. Even if it finds one, however, the latest show of American force could have broader consequences. U.S. suppliers will suffer if ZTE is forced to cancel orders, while Chinese manufacturers are bound to rethink their dependence on U.S.-made hardware and software. China could respond by taking an even tougher approach to foreign tech firms operating in the Peoples Republic.

As long as the U.S dollar is the worlds reserve currency, financial sanctions have few costs for America. Extending the same approach to technology, however, is much more risky.",[]

SEOUL North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast city of Wonsan early on Thursday, flying approximately 500 km (300 miles), South Korea's military said.

North Korea has a large stockpile of short-range missiles and is developing long-range and intercontinental missiles.

Reports of the missiles being fired coincide with already heightened tension on the Korean peninsula after the North conducted its fourth nuclear test in January and launched a long-range rocket last month, leading to new U.N. Security Council and bilateral U.S. sanctions.

The North fired six rockets into the sea last week using a multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) from Wonsan, supervised by leader Kim Jong Un who ordered his military to be prepared to launch pre-emptive attacks against enemies.

Kim said on Wednesday his country has miniaturized nuclear warheads to mount on ballistic missiles and ordered improvements in the power and precision of its arsenal in his first direct comment about nuclear warhead miniaturization.

State Department spokesman John Kirby declined to comment on Kim's claim to have miniaturized nuclear warheads and accused him of ""provocative rhetoric.""

""I'd say the young man needs to pay more attention to the North Korean people and taking care of them than in pursuing these sorts of reckless capabilities,"" Kirby said.

The Pentagon said this week it had not seen North Korea demonstrate a capability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead. But Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the department was working on U.S. ballistic missile defenses to be prepared.

North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 but its claim to have set off a miniaturized hydrogen bomb has been disputed by the U.S. and South Korean governments and many experts.

U.S. and South Korean troops began large-scale military drills this week, which the North called ""nuclear war moves"" and threatened to respond with an all-out offensive.

That would be Tuesday, Mar. 15, when four crucial states  Florida, Ohio, Illinois and Missouri  will hold primaries. Its also the first day when Republican rules allow states, if they choose, to hold winner-take-all contests. Florida, with 99 delegates, and Ohio, with 66, are doing just that. Whoever comes in first wins the whole pot.

Both states have a favorite son in the presidential race  Senator Marco Rubio in Florida and Governor John Kasich in Ohio. But the Republican frontrunner Donald Trump leads the polls in Florida and is closely competitive in Ohio. If Rubio and Kasich lose their home states, they would be finished.

Anti-Trump Republicans are investing heavily to stop Trump. Three different political action committees are expected to spend more than $10 million on anti-Trump ads in Florida.

Trumps response: Go ahead, punks. Make my day. Trumps spokesman called it another desperate attempt by the out-of-touch establishment elites and dark money that control the weak politicians to maintain control of our broken and corrupt system.

For decades, two armies have been at war over the Republican Party. The struggle goes all the way back to 1976, when Ronald Reagan challenged President Gerald Ford and nearly beat the incumbent for his own partys nomination. It has always been the mainstream Republican establishment (Washington and Wall Street) versus the conservative counter-establishment.

The mainstream establishment is pinning its hopes on Rubio. But he seems to be sinking fast. Conservatives are rallying behind Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). Cruz, the Tea Party favorite, won the straw poll at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference. Trump, meanwhile, is leading both of them.

Cruz may be able to hold on for a while. Hes winning low-turnout Republican caucuses, as he did on Saturday in Kansas and Maine. A choice that comes down to Cruz and Trump would leave mainstream Republicans in despair: The old enemy (Cruz and the Tea Party) versus the new enemy (Trump).

We are witnessing history, former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan wrote in her the Wall Street Journal column. Something important is ending.

An army of outsiders is trying to take over the Republican Party. Its cause is anti-establishment populism. The Republican army is supposed to be fueled by hatred of President Barack Obama. But Trumps army is driven by another hatred that appears to be just as intense: hatred of the Republican Party establishment that has failed to stop Obama.

Trumps signature attitude is defiance. His supporters see voting for him as a way to defy the Republican Party establishment. I want to see Trump go up there and do damage to the Republican Party, one Mississippi voter told the New York Times. An Arizona voter said, Were going to use Donald Trump to either take over the GOP or blow it up.

Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, embodies everything Trump voters hate about the Republican establishment. Romney doesnt have a populist bone in his body. Worse, he let Obama beat him in 2012. There was Romney last week, warning Republicans that Trump is a fraud and a phony.

Romney went so far as to insinuate that Trump is an extremist. This is the very brand of anger, he said, that has led other nations into the abyss. Germany for example?

Trump is not an ideologue. And hes not a professional politician. Hes a businessman. His supporters believe government should be run like a business.

Its a deeply held American belief that politics is the enemy of problem-solving. Why cant we deal with the national debt? Too much politics. Why cant we deal with climate change? Politics. Trump, like businessman Ross Perot before him, promises to keep politics out of government and just get things done. Everybody knows theres no politics in business, right?

But theres a reason government cant be run like a business. Business is not a democracy. If business were a democracy, it would look like government: less efficient, more political. Thats why Trump has a taint of undemocratic extremism. He wants to run government like a business. With himself as boss.

The last hope of the anti-Trump forces is to prevent Trump from going to the Republican National Convention in July with the number of delegates needed to nominate him. If Trump doesnt win a on the first ballot, we could see a brokered convention. Then maybe the anti-Trump forces could rally behind another candidate.

Theyre deluding themselves. Suppose Trump goes to the convention with the largest primary vote and the largest number of delegates, even if its not a majority. Does anyone believe Trump would stand by and watch the party nominate a candidate who did worse than he did? Or a candidate who didnt even run in the primaries?

The Trump army would protest that the party establishment is rigging the game and rejecting the peoples choice. That way lies pandemonium. Trump supporters would disrupt the convention and possibly walk out. It would be Chicago 1968 all over again.

Some anti-Trump Republicans are talking about splitting the party and running another GOP candidate in November if Trump becomes the party nominee. Wouldnt that be suicidal? Wouldnt it ensure the election of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, now the likely nominee?

Of course it would. But anti-Trump Republicans may be making a longer-run calculation. If Trump became president, he would destroy the Republican Party. If Clinton became president, she would unite the Republican Party  against her.

And the party would live to fight another day.",[]

reuters.com,2016-03-09 20:14:05+00:00,Exclusive: Teva set to win EU okay for $40.5 billion Allergan deal - sources,['Foo Yun Chee'],"BRUSSELS Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA) is expected to win EU antitrust approval for its $40.5 billion bid for Allergan's (AGN.N) generics unit after agreeing to sell off some of its products to appease regulators, three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

Teva, the world's biggest generic drugsmaker, will divest some drugs already on the market and others in the pipeline to address competition concerns by the European Commission, the people said. The package includes products from both Teva and Allergan.

Other sources had previously told Reuters that assets worth about $1 billion in the United States, Europe and the Middle East would be sold in order to secure the green light from regulators.

Teva will gain bigger economies of scale, a crucial element in the low-margin generic drugs business, with the deal, the largest in Israel's corporate history.

The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the case on Thursday, and Teva declined to comment.

The deal, which requires U.S. approval, has triggered a warning from the American Antitrust Institute that a more concentrated generic market usually comes with higher prices. The think-tank also said divestments may not be enough to ensure competition in the market in a letter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in January.

Dublin-based Botox-maker Allergan in turn is to be acquired by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) in a $160 billion deal creating the world's largest drugmaker.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 20:58:33+00:00,Clinton calls for sanctions on Iran after more missile tests,"['Bozorgmehr Sharafedin', 'Sam Wilkin']","DUBAI U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton on Wednesday called for sanctions against Iran after the Islamic Republic brushed off U.S. concerns and test-fired two ballistic missiles that it said were designed to be able to hit Israel.

Iranian state television showed footage of two Qadr missiles being launched from northern Iran, which the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said hit targets 1,400 km (870 miles) away.

Iranian agencies said the missiles were stamped with the Hebrew words, ""Israel should be wiped from the pages of history,"" though the inscription could not be seen on any photographs.

Clinton, a former secretary of state under President Barack Obama, said she was ""deeply concerned"" by the tests, the second round of Iranian missile launches in two days.

""Iran should face sanctions for these activities and the

international community must demonstrate that Iran's threats

toward Israel will not be tolerated,"" said Clinton, who is ahead in the race to be Democratic nominee at the Nov. 8 presidential elections.

Her call for sanctions reflected a tougher line against Iran's recent missile activity than that taken so far by the White House, which said it is aware of and reviewing reports of the Iranian tests, and would determine an appropriate response.

""We know that Iran is in a season of carrying out a number of military activities, and so it certainly would not be a surprise if there are additional launches over the next several days,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

The Iranian move on Wednesday came despite warning from the U.S. State Department after Tuesday's missile tests that Washington continues to ""aggressively apply our unilateral tools

to counter threats from Iran's missile program,"" a possible reference to additional U.S. sanctions.

Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Wednesday with Iran's foreign minister about the test-firing of two ballistic missiles, a State Department spokesman said.

The missile tests underline a rift in Iran between hard-line factions opposed to normalizing relations with the West, and

President Hassan Rouhani's relatively moderate government, which is trying to attract foreign investors to Iran.

ISRAEL IN MIND

Iran's IRGC said the missiles tested on Wednesday were designed with Israel in mind.

""The reason we designed our missiles with a range of 2,000 km is to be able to hit our enemy the Zionist regime from a safe distance,"" Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by the ISNA agency. The nearest point in Iran is around 1,000 km (600 miles) from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon told Israel Radio the tests showed Iran's hostility had not changed since implementing a nuclear deal with world powers in January, despite Rouhani's overtures to the West.

""To my regret there are some in the West who are misled by the honeyed words of part of the Iranian leadership while the other part continues to procure equipment and weaponry, to arm terrorist groups,"" Yaalon said.

Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee, said: Iran is making a mockery of President Obamas vow to confront Irans dangerous and illicit acts.

He urged Obama to ""aggressively enforce all sanctions against Irans missile programs, support for terrorism and human rights abuses. No more looking the other way.

Washington imposed sanctions against businesses and individuals in January over another missile test in October 2015. But the IRGC said it would not bow to pressure.

""The more sanctions and pressure our enemies apply ... the more we will develop our missile program,"" Hajizadeh said on state television.

The IRGC maintains dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles, the largest stock in the Middle East. It says they are solely for defensive use with conventional, non-nuclear warheads.

Tehran has denied U.S. accusations of acting ""provocatively,"" citing the long history of U.S. interventions in the Middle East and its own right to self-defense.

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said on Wednesday it had signed a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA.N) 767 widebody freighter aircraft to handle more of its own deliveries in the United States.

The deal comes at a time when the world's biggest online retailer is offering ever-faster, and increasingly free, deliveries for millions of online orders.

Amazon, which relies on carriers like United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) to deliver most of its packages, spent $11.5 billion on shipping last year.

In a bid to assume more control over its supply chain and reduce costs, Amazon has rolled out thousands of trailers and launched a program that uses contract drivers to deliver fast orders.

But analysts said the long-rumored plan to build its own air fleet posed little threat to the leading delivery companies.

""This is an incremental negative for FDX and UPS as it will likely remove some higher yielding express freight and parcel volume from each of the respective networks,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst John Barnes wrote in a client note.

UPS, the world's No. 1 package delivery company, operates about 240 large planes while FedEx has a fleet of about 370, Barnes noted. FedEx and UPS shares were down about 1.5 percent.

FedEx said on Wednesday the announcement was not a surprise and called Amazon a valuable customer.

""We work closely with Amazon and have been aware for some time about their need for supplemental air capacity related to inventory management,"" said Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications at FedEx.

The leased planes will start to go into operation on April 1, Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email.

Amazon has been testing deliveries by drones but has not said when they would be in service.

The duration of the leases will be five to seven years, lessor Air Transport Services Group Inc (ATSG.O) said.

As part of the agreement, Amazon has the right to buy up to 19.9 percent of ATSG's stock over five years at $9.73 per share.

ATSG's stock soared almost 27 percent to a record high of $14.90, before paring gains to about 16 percent.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 11:04:57+00:00,Morgan hopes England stay brash and aggressive in India,['Sudipto Ganguly'],"MUMBAI The current England squad has been the most expressive in a long time and players are encouraged to be as brash and aggressive as they can on the field, limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan said on Wednesday as he prepares his side for the World Twenty20.

England have looked a completely different proposition in one-day internationals and Twenty20 cricket in the 12 months since their humiliating group stage exit at last year's 50-over World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.

The team were then roundly criticised for being too old fashioned in their approach to short-format contests but Morgan's youthful side have since displayed the freedom and exuberance England fans had craved for years.

""I would say, it's the most expressive we've been in a long time. The evidence is the significant totals we have put with our bat,"" the 29-year-old Ireland-born cricketer told reporters.

""I think we've scored 350 twice or three times and we've definitely chased it down once. I think we had six consecutive times scoring 300, which is a huge step for us. We've scored 400 once.

""And it's no coincidence. We have a lot of talent within the side, we encourage our players to go out and be as brash and aggressive as they can and take the game to the opposition.""

England defeated Pakistan in a one-day series and three Twenty20 contests on the slow pitches in United Arab Emirates in November and were also impressive in defeat against South Africa in both formats last month.

FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

All-rounder Ben Stokes, a chief exponent of England's fearless cricket, assured the team will continue to play the same brand of cricket during the World Twenty20 in India.

""I mean it's worked. (coach) Trevor (Bayliss) and Morgan gave us that freedom and even (test captain Alistair) Cook in tests,"" Stokes said.

""We are playing this attacking, positive brand we have probably been talking about the last two-three years but we have only started doing that in the last 12-18 months.

""It's obviously worked for us, so why stop doing it? We got a bit a criticism in South Africa for the two (Twenty20) games we lost but we won six before that.""

Morgan said his players would probably be at a slight disadvantage for not playing in the Indian Premier League but hoped they could make up for it with the recent experience of touring the Middle East and Sri Lanka.

""I think it (not playing IPL) just becomes a different challenge,"" Morgan said, while picking hosts India as his favourites for the World Twenty20. ""Not only have our guys not played the IPL a lot of our guys have never been to India.

""But we have guys who have toured Sri Lanka quite a lot, been on a recent tour to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, where we had a little bit of success.""

England open their campaign against 2012 champions West Indies in Mumbai on March 16 before facing South Africa, Sri Lanka and a qualifier in Group 1 of the Super 10 stage. The top two sides will advance to the semi-finals.

Berlin Die groen Gewerkschaften IG Metall, Verdi und IG BCE werben in den Betrieben fur eine Teilnahme an den Landtagswahlen am Sonntag - ausdrucklich auch mit dem Ziel, den Stimmenanteil der rechtspopulistischen AfD klein zu halten.

""Wer nicht zu Wahlen geht, wird anschlieend trotzdem regiert und starkt mit seiner Nicht-Teilnahme in aller Regel rechtspopulistische und rechtsextreme Parteien"", teilte der rheinland-pfalzische IG-Metall-Bezirksleiter Jorg Kohlinger am Mittwoch mit. Damit ziehe man die Konsequenzen aus den jungsten Kommunalwahlen in Hessen mit Blick auf die Landtagswahlen in Rheinland-Pfalz, hie es in der IG Metall. In Hessen hatte die AfD am Sonntag auch wegen der sehr niedrigen Wahlbeteiligung von unter 50 Prozent nach einer ersten Trendmeldung 13,2 Prozent der abgegebenen Stimmen erreicht. Nach weiteren Auszahlungen deutet sich allerdings an, dass das Ergebnis noch nach unten revidiert werden durfte.

Laut Umfragen hat die AfD gute Chancen, am Sonntag in die Landtage von Baden-Wurttemberg, Rheinland-Pfalz und Sachsen-Anhalt einzuziehen. Eine hohe Zahl von Befragten hat bei Umfragen angegeben, nicht zu wissen, ob und was sie wahlen wollen. ""Wir geben keine Wahlempfehlung fur eine bestimmte Partei ab, empfehlen aber klar, demokratisch zu wahlen  was aus unserer Sicht nicht auf die AfD zutrifft"", sagte der IG Metall-Bezirksleiter fur Baden-Wurttemberg, Roman Zitzelsberger, der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters. ""Ziel des Wahlaufrufs ist es naturlich auch zu verhindern, dass durch Nicht-Wahlen rechtspopulistische Parteien gestarkt werden.""

Die Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft Verdi in Baden-Wurttemberg hatte bereits in der vergangenen Woche zur Wahlteilnahme aufgerufen und vor einer Stimmabgabe fur AfD gewarnt. ""Rechtspopulisten bieten unsolidarische Antworten, raus aus dem Euro, weg mit Gefluchteten, Ausgrenzung statt Integration. Diese Antworten sind falsch"", sagte Leni Breymaier, Verdi-Chefin in Baden-Wurttemberg. ""Diese Positionen haben im Landtag von Baden-Wurttemberg nichts verloren."" Die Beschaftigten sollten am 13. Marz wahlen. ""Milliarden Menschen auf dieser Erde beneiden uns um diese Chance.""

In der Chemie- und Pharmaindustrie in Baden-Wurttemberg haben Gewerkschaften und die Arbeitgeber sogar gemeinsam zur Wahlteilnahme aufgerufen. Das Land brauche effiziente und verlassliche Rahmenbedingungen und nach auen freie und partnerschaftliche Handelsbeziehungen.

NEW DELHI Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government on Tuesday dropped a controversial proposal to tax pension withdrawals, caving in after an outcry by salaried workers threatened to undermine his party's prospects in upcoming state elections.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had proposed in his Feb. 29 budget taxing lump-sum withdrawals exceeding 40 percent of an individual's retirement pot in the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), unless the sum is reinvested in an annuity.

At present, withdrawals from the EPF are tax-free.

The tax proposal sparked a backlash from small but vocal professional class, with some calling it a raid on the retirement savings of honest taxpayers. Only around 36 million of the country's 1.3 billion people contribute to the EPF.

The move also drew flak from opposition parties, forcing the government to change tack ahead of elections in five states in April and May in which Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) eyes gains.

""The policy objective is not to get more revenue but to encourage the people to join the pension scheme,"" Jaitley said in a statement to lawmakers.

The climbdown underscores the challenges for vital but politically-sensitive economic reforms in Asia's third-largest economy. Protests by farmers last year forced Modi to abandon a bill to simplify rules for industrial land sales in India.

Critics of the surprise budget announcement say Modi should instead be looking to widen its revenue base and charge lower income tax rates to put the public finances on a steadier footing, rather than milk existing taxpayers for more revenue.

One aide said that Modi had intervened directly in the matter. ""He felt that this will discourage people from using traditional means of saving,"" the official said.

Country's urban middle class, which mostly supported Modi in the 2014 general election, has shown resentment over a rise in its tax burden.

Apart from imposing a levy to fund Modi's clean India initiative, the government has taxed away half the windfall of a slump in oil prices. This year's budget hiked taxes on cars and aviation fuel, and introduced a new tax surcharge to pay for measures to aid the rural poor.

Segundo a entidade, e a primeira vez em mais de 10 anos que o governo devera determinar reajuste anual de precos do setor acima da inflacao oficial. O reajuste devera ser aplicado a partir de 31 de marco.

""O calculo do governo mostra com clareza que ate a industria farmaceutica, normalmente menos prejudicada por crises economicas, esta sendo atingida pelo momento dificil que o Brasil enfrenta"", disse em comunicado a imprensa o presidente-executivo da Interfarma, Antonio Britto.

""We have an absolutely rock-solid opt-out from these things. There's no prospect of Britain joining a common asylum process in Europe. We'll have our own asylum approach, our own way of doing things, keeping our borders,"" Cameron said on arriving for an EU-Turkey summit aimed at stemming the flow of migrants into Europe.

""Even outside the EU, we would be affected by a migration crisis like this. But at the end of the day we maintain our borders and our own way of doing things because we have the best of both worlds,"" he continued.

Under the EU's current asylum system, known as the Dublin rules and which apply to Britain, individual EU countries must register and process asylum claims on a national basis and that responsibility falls to the first EU state a refugee enters.

A future system could see the European Union centrally overseeing asylum applications -- one of several ways proposed to prevent a repeat of countries like Greece and Italy handling hugely disproportionate numbers.

There are concerns in Britain that a revision to the Dublin rules could deprive Britain of the right to deport asylum-seekers to the state where they entered the EU. The EU executive is due to present proposals for reforms of the system next week.

Teva, the world's biggest generic drugsmaker, will divest some drugs already on the market and others in the pipeline to address competition concerns by the European Commission, the people said. The package includes products from both Teva and Allergan.

Other sources had previously told Reuters that assets worth about $1 billion in the United States, Europe and the Middle East would be sold in order to secure the green light from regulators.

Teva will gain bigger economies of scale, a crucial element in the low-margin generic drugs business, with the deal, the largest in Israel's corporate history.

The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the case on Thursday, and Teva declined to comment.

The deal, which requires U.S. approval, has triggered a warning from the American Antitrust Institute that a more concentrated generic market usually comes with higher prices. The think-tank also said divestments may not be enough to ensure competition in the market in a letter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in January.

Dublin-based Botox-maker Allergan in turn is to be acquired by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) in a $160 billion deal creating the world's largest drugmaker.

Por Alexandre Caverni

SAO PAULO A noticia de que Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pode assumir um ministerio da presidente Dilma Rousseff para garantir foro privilegiado e se ver livre das garras do juiz Sergio Moro e um movimento que pode trazer muito mais prejuizo do que ganhos para o ex-presidente e ainda mais para o atual governo.

Se a entrada de Lula no primeiro escalao pode livra-lo efetivamente de uma suposta pretensao de Moro ve-lo atras das grades, sua consumacao tiraria do ex-presidente o discurso de vitima e indignacao que usou tao bem na semana passada, apos ser levado pela Policia Federal para prestar depoimento sob conducao coercitiva.

Alvo da fase da operacao Lava Jato lancada na ultima sexta-feira, Lula disse ter se sentido ""ofendido"", ""magoado"", ""ultrajado"" e ""prisioneiro"". Disse que teria prestado depoimento voluntariamente caso fosse chamado por Moro, como ja tinha feito antes.

Ao mesmo tempo que se colocou como vitima, tambem estimulou a militancia petista e seus apoiadores, dizendo que a partir daquele momento estava disposto a ""andar este pais"".

""Se tentaram matar a jararaca, nao bateram na cabeca, bateram no rabo, a jararaca ta viva como sempre esteve"", disse Lula, deixando clara a intencao de concorrer novamente a Presidencia.

Depois disso, o ex-presidente teria dito a interlocutores: ""A partir de agora, se me prenderem, eu viro heroi. Se me matarem, viro martir. E, se me deixarem solto, viro presidente de novo.

Virar ministro a essa altura dos acontecimentos jogaria por terra praticamente todo esse discurso. Com o cargo, qualquer investigacao ou acao judicial contra Lula teria que passar pelo Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), tirando de Moro a competencia para o caso.

Ainda que Lula pudesse falar em arbitrariedades e perseguicao da Lava Jato, o movimento seria visto como um sinal claro de desespero e, para seus adversarios e nao so eles, como uma forma de assuncao de culpa.

Se fosse para assumir um ministerio, Lula deveria ter feito isso em agosto do ano passado, quando essa possibilidade veio a tona. Na ocasiao, a justificativa oficial era de que sua entrada formal na administracao Dilma, provavelmente no Ministerio das Relacoes Exteriores, seria uma forma de fortalecer a coordenacao politica do governo.

Nao se escondia mesmo naquele momento que o obvio ganho do foro privilegiado seria de certa forma um embaraco, mas pelo menos a Lava Jato ainda se encontrava relativamente distante de Lula, embora muitos de seus aliados ja dissessem que o alvo real da operacao era o petista.

Agora nao se trata mais de simples discurso petista. A Lava Jato esta efetivamente investigando Lula e ha quem diga que sua conducao coercitiva na ultima semana nao passou de um teste para a forca-tarefa de Curitiba no caso de uma futura prisao do ex-presidente.

Para o Palacio do Planalto, o estrago nao seria menor com Lula ministro. Combalido por uma baixissima popularidade em um cenario de desemprego em alta, inflacao elevada e enfrentando um processo de impeachment contra Dilma, o governo passaria mais uma imagem de desrespeito com a coisa publica ao usar a nomeacao para o ministerio como uma forma de fuga da Justica.

No caso de Lula, o movimento nao seria uma garantia definitiva. Primeiro porque se Dilma sofrer o impeachment, Lula perderia o ministerio.

Mais do que isso, se afinal houver provas mesmo contra o ex-presidente, nao ha por que imaginar que o Supremo deixaria de condena-lo, ainda que num ritmo processual muito mais lento do que o de Moro.",[]

reuters.com,2016-03-08 17:36:53+00:00,The World's Most Innovative Research Institutions,['David Ewalt'],"REUTERS TOP 25

Silicon Valleys hoodie-wearing tech entrepreneurs are the poster kids of innovation. But the innovators who are really changing the world are more likely to wear labcoats and hold government-related jobs in Grenoble, Munich or Tokyo. That's the conclusion of Reuters Top 25 Global Innovators  Government, a list that identifies and ranks the publicly funded institutions doing the most to advance science and technology.

Topping the list is France's Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), for its research into areas including renewable power, public health, and information security. Rounding out the top three: Germanys Fraunhofer Society and Japans Science and Technology Agency.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 25 Compare Institutions | Methodology

On a country-by-country basis, the United States leads the list, with six organizations ranked (France and Japan each have four, and Germany has three). The Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) is the top U.S. finisher, placing fourth.

The rankings were compiled by the Intellectual Property & Science division of Thomson Reuters, which used proprietary data and analysis tools to examine patents and research papers from the past eight years to find the governmental organizations most likely to change the world. A separate ranking of similar data from universities was published last year.

It took a government agency to put a man on the moon, and even in the age of the Internet, governments are still moving science and technology forward. They do pure research that private companies often find it hard to justify and afford, and make discoveries that launch entire industries: publicly funded organizations split the atom, invented the Internet, and mapped the human genome.

There are 16,000 technicians, engineers and researchers in 10 government-run centers throughout France working on the next great innovation. Theyre all a part of CEA, a public research institution specializing in nuclear and renewable energies, defense and security, as well as information and health technologies. Established by General Charles de Gaulle at the end of World War II, the organization represents France in the nuclear sector, promoting safe and responsible use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.

CEA ranks first among government research institutes in part because its researchers apply for and receive significantly more patents than most government organizations - an indication that their research has strong potential for commercial value. Those patents are also frequently cited by outside researchers, showing that CEA has a big impact on R&D efforts at other organizations. CEA receives the majority of its funding from the French government, and works closely with national agencies on projects ranging from building nuclear-powered naval vessels to improving the nation's cybersecurity. But it also has more than 500 industrial partners, and its research has led to the creation of 115 spinoff companies since 2000, including Paris-based biopharmaceutical company Theranexus, which is working on advanced treatments for psychiatric disorders.

The second most innovative institution on the Top 25 Global Innovators  Government list also focuses on developing technology that can help fuel private industry. Germanys Fraunhofer Society is Europe's largest applied research institution, with 24,000 staff members in 67 institutes and research units. Public sector funds account for only about a third of its annual budget; most of the Society's research is funded by contracts with industry.

European institutions account for nine out of 25 ranked institutions, more than any other continent. Asia comes in second with eight institutions, including third-place finisher the Japan Science & Technology Agency, or JST. An independent administrative institution under the government's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, it works primarily with academia, industry and other international research institutions. Three JST scientists won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2014 for inventing efficient blue-light-emitting diodes, which have enabled bright, energy-saving white-light sources.

HHS, the top-ranked government innovator in the U.S., is a cabinet-level department of the federal government tasked with protecting the health of American citizens. Although primarily known as a regulatory and service agency, the department's 11 operating divisions include some of the nation's most active centers of scientific research, including the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration. (Patents filed by these institutions list the name of their parent agency, so for the purposes of this list, Thomson Reuters ranked HHS instead of its subsidiaries.)

Also on the list: The United States Navy and the United States Army. Like HHS, these military service organizations arent best known for science, but they perform a wide range of basic and applied research in pursuit of their mission. More than 60 researchers have won a Nobel Prize for work funded by the Office of Naval Research since it was established in 1946. The United States Army Laboratory, established in 1992, has developed products such as advanced coatings to shield vehicles from chemical warfare, which are now used to protect monuments, sculptures and artworks.

To compile the ranking, the IP & Science division of Thomson Reuters began by identifying more than 500 global organizations - including universities, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions - that published the most articles in academic journals. Then they identified the total number of patents filed by each organization and evaluated each candidate on factors including how many patents it filed, how often those applications were granted, how many patents were filed to global patent offices in addition to local authorities and how often the patents were cited by other patents. Candidates were also evaluated in terms of the number of articles published by researchers in academic journals, how often those papers were cited by patents and how many articles featured a co-author from industry. Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included government-run or funded organizations, and then ranked them based on their performance. Click here for the methodology.

reuters.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,A small hand challenge to Trump,"[""Any Opinions Expressed Here Are The Author's Own"", 'Megan Cassella Is A Journalist At Reuters', 'Megan Cassella']","Donald Trump has taken his defense of his hands out onto the campaign trail. Now a 28-year-old Oregon man has formed a new political action committee solely to get the Republican front-runner to prove it.

Henry Kraemer, who works for a nonprofit in Portland, filed the Trump Has Tiny Hands political action committee with the Federal Elections Commission on Monday, a move he said hopes spurs the front-runner Republican candidate to release his official hand measurements from an official doctor.

We felt it was really important for voters to know everything they can about the dangerous smallness of Mr. Trumps hands before they go into the voting booth, Kraemer said in a phone interview.

Trump was first publicly teased for the size of his hands in the late 1980s, when the now-defunct satirical Spy magazine branded Trump a short-fingered vulgarian. Rival candidate Marco Rubio revived the criticism on the campaign trail last week, implying that Trumps hands were small for his more than six-foot frame.

You know what they say about guys with small hands? Rubio said at a rally last week, and then he paused. You cant trust em, he said.

Trump has since defended himself, saying hes been told he has beautiful hands, but Kraemer and what he says is a core team of about 75 volunteers are working to make sure the issue stays on voters minds.

What good is it to give (Trump) the nuclear launch code if his stubby fingers cant even push the button down all the way?, Kraemer said. Say the White House phone rings at 3 a.m.  will his tiny hands even be able to lift the receiver? These are the important questions.

The group has taken to Facebook and Twitter, where it had a combined nearly 1,500 followers by Tuesday morning, to begin spreading its message and reaching out to Trump and some of his advisers, in the hopes that theyll get a response.

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But at a rally in Michigan last week, in response to Rubios initial jabs, Trump dismissed the criticism as crap.

reuters.com,2015-09-15 21:44:53+00:00,The World's Most Innovative Universities,['Reuters Editorial'],"""Innovation"" is one of the most oft-cited buzzwords in both academia and the business world, but its usage isn't consistent. It can mean that an organization regularly produces new ideas or unique products; that its internal policies and practices are significantly different from the competition; or simply that members are encouraged to think creatively and pursue disruptive ideas.

This might sound like a semantic problem. But the confusion means that innovation is hard to measure - and that can be a huge roadblock to economic and technological development. Since World War II, universities around the world have been relied on to convert public funding into knowledge and products that help drive the global economy. So how can potential partners, investors, faculty and students know if an institution is really transforming science and technology and impacting the global economy?

To answer that question, Reuters set out to find and rank the world's top 100 innovative universities empirically, building a methodology that employs 10 different metrics. The criteria focused on academic papers, which indicate basic research performed at a university, and patent filings, which point to an institution's interest in protecting and commercializing its discoveries. Compiled by the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters, the list uses proprietary data and analysis tools. (For a detailed methodology, click here.)

Leading the Reuters Top 100 is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has earned a reputation as a hotbed for innovation in computer hardware and software: its faculty and alumni have founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Hewlett-Packard, Yahoo and Google. A 2012 study by the university estimated that all the companies formed by Stanford entrepreneurs generate total global revenue of $2.7 trillion annually.

Stanford edged out other tech giants (like second-place finisher Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Ivy League stalwarts (like third-place Harvard University), by scoring consistently well across each of our criteria with especially high marks when it came to impactful research: its articles and patents are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in the academic and corporate worlds.

Related Coverage  Compare Universities: How does Stanford stack up against MIT, Cambridge or KAIST?

Other key findings of the Reuters Top 100 include the strong performance of institutions outside the United States. Half of Reuters Top 100 Innovative Universities are located in Canada, Europe or Asia; Japan is home to nine of the Reuters Top 100 innovative universities - more than any other country except the U.S. South Korea also performs well on the list: the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology, or KAIST, is the only non-U.S. school to place in the top 10.

The most innovative university in Europe, Imperial College London, ranked at No. 11 overall. Founded in 1907, it is relatively young compared with the continent's second and third-place universities, Belgium's KU Leuven (No. 16, founded in 1425) and England's University of Cambridge (No. 25, established in 1209). Elsewhere in Europe, the nation of Switzerland stands out: With three schools on the list and a population of just over 8 million people, it has more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in the world.

Whether they're in the top five or near the end of the list, all 100 universities in this ranking are among the best in the world. Thomson Reuters reviewed hundreds of universities to produce this ranking, and the ones that appear here are the most elite. Absence from this list does not indicate an institution is failing to innovate, however. Since the rankings measure innovation on a universitywide (or in some cases, systemwide) basis, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: A small liberal arts school might rank low for overall innovation, but still operate one of the most innovative computer science departments in the world, for instance.

The Reuters Top 100 World's Most Innovative Universities gets to the essence of what it means to be truly innovative; the institutions recognized here most reliably produce original research, create useful technology, and have the greatest economic impact. They are the surest bets for anyone seeking to invest in and create real innovation.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:54:19+00:00,Nasdaq to buy ISE options exchange from Deutsche Boerse,['John Mccrank'],"The Nasdaq logo is displayed at the Nasdaq Market site in New York September 2, 2015.

Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) said on Wednesday it would buy U.S. options exchange operator International Securities Exchange for $1.1 billion from Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1Gn.DE), the latest deal to emerge from a spate of exchange merger talks.

ISE operates three electronic options exchanges which together account for more than 15 percent of U.S. volume, while Nasdaq operates another three. Combined, Nasdaq would command more than 40 percent of the market, extending its lead as the No. 1 U.S. options exchange operator.

""The ability to further that lead gives us advantages as to how we could serve our customers because you have a different volume versus scale arrangement,"" Nasdaq Chief Executive Bob Greifeld said in an interview.

The deal would also free up capital for Deutsche Boerse, which has said it plans to merge with the London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE.L) to create a European trading powerhouse that could better compete against U.S. rivals.

Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) said it may make a rival bid for the LSE, raising the prospects of a takeover battle.

Nasdaq, which plans to move ISE's trading platforms onto Nasdaq technology, said it could strip out $40 million from the two businesses through the transaction.

The deal would also give Nasdaq an additional 20 percent stake in the Options Clearing Corporation, for a total of 40 percent ownership in the world's largest equity derivatives clearing corporation.

Greifeld said he had been looking to buy ISE for years, and talks with Deutsche Boerse CEO Carsten Kengeter picked up over the past three months.

The deal does not include ISE's stake in No. 2 U.S. stock exchange operator BATS Global Markets, or blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings, which will continue to be owned by Deutsche Boerse, the German company said.

Nasdaq said the transaction was expected to be finalized in the second half of the year, pending regulatory approval, and it would likely increase earnings within 12 months of closing.

Nasdaq has made several acquisitions in recent years that have helped boost its profits and share price. These include Chi-X Canada, that country's largest alternative trading system, in a deal that closed last month; and index provider Dorsey, Wright & Associates last year.

The resolution to amend the state's constitution passed 23-9 after the majority Republican caucus used a parliamentary maneuver to end the filibuster, which began at 4:00 p.m. CST on Monday, said Lauren Hieger, communications director for the Missouri Senate Majority Caucus.

READ MORE: Lead in the water: The corrosive dangers lurking in private wells

The amendment must be voted on again in the Senate next week before passing to the lower house, where Republicans have a majority, and then to the state's voters, Hieger said.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, applauded the effort by the Senate minority to block the resolution. ""Rewriting our state's constitution to condone discrimination would be contrary to our values and harmful to our economy,"" Nixon said in a statement on Wednesday.

The legislation is among a series of measures introduced around the country by conservatives in response to last year's U.S. Supreme Court legalization of same-sex marriage. The measures seek to protect religious groups and companies from being fined or punished if they decline to provide services such as wedding cakes or flowers to same-sex couples.



RECOMMENDED: Republicans sue State Department for Clinton emails

Republicans who backed the amendment said it was about religious freedom, but Democrats said it would enshrine discrimination in the state's constitution.

Given their minority position in both chambers of Missouri's General Assembly, Democrats chose to filibuster, debating overnight on Monday and Tuesday to block the initiative.

""Inspired by senators' heroic stand against discrimination in #MO. The nation is watching & cheering you on!"" Nixon tweeted on Tuesday night.

""In our pluralistic society, we should have room to respect the religious freedom of Missourians,"" Republican Senator Bob Onder, who sponsored the bill, told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday morning. He said the language of the bill was modified in a compromise on Tuesday to narrowly define wedding vendors.

The American Civil Liberties Union civil rights group said it would work to fight the bill in Missouri's House of Representatives.

""This amendment raises serious constitutional concerns because it singles out same-sex couples for discrimination,"" Jeffrey Mittman, executive director of ACLU of Missouri, said in a statement.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:46:41+00:00,Signs of life for Apple's stock as Wall St. eyes new iPhone,['Noel Randewich'],"SAN FRANCISCO After months of declines in Apple's (AAPL.O) stock, sentiment appears to be mending as investors focus on steady earnings expectations and bet that the expected launch of a new iPhone will add badly-needed fuel to sputtering sales.

Battered by nearly a year of off-and-on declines from record highs because of fears of a slowdown in iPhone sales, Apple's stock now is valued closer to IBM, which has disappointed Wall Street for the past four years with declining revenue, than to Silicon Valley technology pioneers Alphabet and Tesla Motors.

Apple shares have increased 5 percent in the past two weeks as Wall Street bets the company this month will launch a less expensive iPhone to boost sales in developing countries like China. With U.S. consumers upgrading their smartphones less often, manufacturers have been relying on China for growth.

Shareholders this week pointed to Apple's reliable cash generation, beaten down valuation and its wild card potential for future game-changing products as key reasons for owning it.

""This company has a history of doing better than expectations and surprising people,"" said Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust Company, which holds over 1 million shares of Apple. ""Where else can I go and find a company trading at 10 or 11 times earnings that has had such a great history?""

At $100.97 a share on Wednesday, Apple is selling at 10.7 times its expected earnings per share over the next 12 months. Its average forward price-earnings-ratio has been 13 over the past two years.

By comparison, Internet behemoth Alphabet (GOOGL.O), whose Android mobile platform competes against Apple's iOS, trades at 20 times expected earnings and 13-year old Tesla Motors (TSLA.O) trades at 132 times earnings. International Business Machines (IBM.N), which is struggling to expand into a high-growth business like cloud computing, has a P/E of 10.2, according to Thomson Reuters data.

""Unless something big happens, (Apple) doesn't deserve to trade at 20 to 25 times earnings anymore. It's just too big,"" said David Meier, a portfolio manager at Motley Fool Funds. ""But as a high-quality company, could it trade at 15 times earnings? Certainly.""

A target of 15 times its next 12 months' expected earnings would put Apple at around $138.

In another hint of improving sentiment, Apple's stock has recently moved above its 50-day moving average for the first time since December.

The stock's selloff in recent months has boosted Apple's dividend yield to 2.2 percent from 1.5 percent a year ago.

Analysts' covering Apple have been little help to investors. Ahead of the stock's 20-percent drop that started in December, 41 analysts recommended buying Apple shares while just one recommended selling, according to Thomson Reuters data. Currently, no analysts recommend selling, while 38 recommend buying.

A new iPhone with a smaller 4-inch screen will likely boost volumes by about 5 percent this year, an increase not yet incorporated into Wall Street's expectations, Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski wrote in a report on Monday.

Apple chip supplier Dialog Semiconductor (DLGS.DE) on Tuesday forecast March-quarter revenue below analysts' expectations, but said it still expects single-digit growth for the year. That suggests the March quarter could mark the low-point in iPhone shipments, with demand for new models building later in the year, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a research note.

Jeffrey Carbone, Senior Partner at Cornerstone Financial Partners, said Apple remains a staple holding at his firm but that he has recently turned his attention to Apple suppliers including Skyworks Solutions (SWKS.O), which he believes is undervalued.

""We have a normal weighting on Apple, we like the company, but we think the supply chain could have greater potential,"" Carbone said.

(The Sports Xchange) - D'Angelo Russell scored 27 points and Jordan Clarkson added 24 points, guiding the Los Angeles Lakers to a 107-98 victory over the Orlando Magic on Tuesday night at Staples Center.

Julius Randle collected 23 points and 11 rebounds for the Lakers (14-51), who won a second consecutive game for only the third time this season. Tuesday's win comes on the heels of a rout Sunday of the Golden State Warriors.

The Magic (27-36), who were coming off a 119-113 loss to the Warriors on Monday night, were led by Victor Oladipo's 26 points. Evan Fournier chipped 23 points for Orlando, which lost its third straight.

Lakers forward Kobe Bryant sat out with a sore right shoulder. It marked the fourth time in the past six games Bryant was out of the lineup and the 14th game he missed this season.

A strained right groin kept Magic center Nikola Vucevic out of for the second game in a row.

Los Angeles turned a seven-point lead entering the fourth quarter into a double-digit advantage and dictated for much of the period. Orlando closed within 97-86 with 5:13 remaining in the contest on a jumper by Oladipo but got no closer until the final moments.

The Magic led 51-45 at halftime before the Lakers took control in the third quarter. Los Angeles grabbed a 79-69 lead after a 3-pointer by Marcelo Huertas with 3:20 left, but the Magic cut the deficit to four on two free throws by C.J. Watson with 2:12 remaining.

However, Los Angeles pushed the margin to 84-77 heading into the fourth quarter. Los Angeles outscored Orlando 39-26 in the third, which tied the highest output in a quarter this season for the Lakers.

The Lakers shot 49.4 percent overall to 48.7 percent for the Magic. Los Angeles made nine of 26 (34.6 percent) from 3-point range, while Orlando made five of 18 (27.8 percent).

Los Angeles had a 56-44 edge on points in the paint and also had a 19-8 advantage in second-chance points. The Lakers outrebounded the Magic 45-35.",[]
reuters.com,2016-03-09 15:08:01+00:00,Many athletes used Sharapova drug meldonium during 2015 European Games: study,['Kate Kelland'],"LONDON The use of meldonium - the banned drug taken by Russian tennis champion Maria Sharapova - was widespread among elite athletes competing at the European Games in Baku last year, according to research in the British Journal of Sports Medicine (BJSM).

The study, based on information volunteered by athletes and individual medical teams, and on laboratory data from doping tests from the Games in Azerbaijan, suggested up to 490 athletes may have been taking the drug during the competition.

The findings showed that during the Baku Games, 13 medallists or competition winners were taking meldonium, 66 athletes tested positive for it, and they said meldonium was detected in athletes competing in 15 of the 21 sports in the competition.

""This study highlights the widespread and inappropriate use and prescribing of this prescription drug in a generally healthy athlete population,"" said the researchers, led by Klaus Steinbach and Christian Schneider of the European Olympic Committees Medical and Anti-Doping Commission.

Some 6,000 athletes took part in the Games, the first major multi-sports event for the continent, with qualification spots on offer for August's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

The BJSM said the research, published online on Wednesday, had been shared with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and had contributed to its decision to ban use of meldonium in competitive sport as of Jan. 1 this year.



RECOMMENDED: Fate of lawsuit brought by Trump model to be decided this month

Sharapova tested positive for meldonium, also known by the brand name Mildronate, in a sample taken on Jan. 26, the day of her Australian Open quarter-final defeat to Serena Williams.

She told a news conference her family doctor had first given her the drug 10 years ago after she frequently became sick, had irregular electrocardiogram results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.

The 28-year-old Russian, a five-time grand slam champion, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation said.

Meldonium is marketed as Mildronate by the Latvian pharmaceutical firm Grindeks (GRD1R.RI), which told Reuters the drug could protect athletes from cell damage, but would be unlikely to improve their competitive performance.

The BJSM study said, however, that ""the drug is evidently being used with the intention to either improve recovery or enhance performance - (and) use of a substance with the intention to improve performance is, by WADA's definition, a violation of the spirit of sport"".

Mildronate is registered for sale in Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union, but does not have a license from either the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the EU's European Medicines Agency.

Steinbach and Schneider said since the samples and data from laboratories were ""blinded"" of all personal and demographic details, they could not say which specific countries the athletes who tested positive for meldonium came from.

Athletes' self-reported declarations of meldonium use suggested there is higher use in countries where the drug is registered and prescribed then in countries where meldonium is not registered for medical use, they said.

They added, however, that ""athletes and healthcare providers from any country where the drug is not officially registered for medical use could easily obtain the drug through medicines importation and exportation routes, and even more easily through online purchases"".

reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:48:09+00:00,Trump rebounds in White House race; Sanders surprises Clinton,['Ginger Gibson'],"MONROE, N.C. Republican leaders opposed to Donald Trump becoming the party's U.S. presidential candidate warned on Wednesday that the billionaire businessman could become unstoppable if he wins two crucial nominating contests next week.

One of Trump's fiercest critics in the Republican Party, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, said that if the billionaire businessman extends his winning streak into crucial contests next week, the New Yorker's path to the nomination was all but inevitable.

""I'm worried that if we lose Florida and Ohio he may be unstoppable,"" said Graham, a former Republican candidate who was among the party's large field of early White House hopefuls.

With victories in nominating contests on Tuesday in three out of four states, Trump maintained his lead over the three remaining challengers in the race to be the Republican candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election.

On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton's surprise loss to Bernie Sanders in the important Michigan primary laid bare growing voter anger over trade, raising warning flags for her ahead of a possible election showdown against Trump.

On Wednesday, the often-combative Trump struck a more conciliatory tone toward the Republican establishment that has fiercely resisted his advance - first by backing favourite candidates who failed to win votes, then by pouring money into campaigns against him.

""If we embrace what is happening and everyone came together, instead of spending all this money on these ads ...,"" Trump told Fox News. ""If everyone came together, no one could beat the Republican Party. We would walk into Washington.""

He also praised U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan after speaking with him by phone this week, calling the Republican leader a ""good man.""

Trump, 69, fended off a week of attacks from the party's establishment and defied predictions his campaign might be losing steam with his primary wins on Tuesday in Michigan, the biggest prize of the night, as well as Mississippi and Hawaii. His closest challenger, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, won Idaho.

Trump's convincing win in Michigan narrowed prospects for the party's anti-Trump forces to stop him before next Tuesday's contests, which also include Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri.

Trump now has 458 of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination, with Cruz second with 359 delegates, according to the Associated Press. Rival Marco Rubio trails with 151 delegates, while John Kasich is far behind with 54.

ENDORSEMENTS: ANY ONE BUT TRUMP

Cruz, with enough primary victories to present himself as a viable Trump alternative, won the endorsement of former Republican rival Carly Fiorina on Wednesday and appealed to anti-Trump Republicans to back him.

""If you don't want to see Donald Trump as the nominee, if you don't want to hand the election on a silver platter to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, then I ask you to join us,"" Cruz said.

Trump, a former reality TV show host, has peppered his campaign with put-downs of rivals and critics. Many mainstream Republicans have been offended by his statements on Muslims, immigrants and women and alarmed by his threats to international trade deals.

But Cruz, 45, is a hard alternative for some of the mainstream Republican leadership to get behind. A fiscal and social conservative, he is unpopular with fellow senators who were targets of his personal attacks and who blame him for orchestrating a government shutdown in 2013 in a failed attempt to derail President Barack Obama's healthcare reforms.

In January, Graham called a choice between Trump and Cruz like ""being shot or poisoned."" But the senator softened his tone on Wednesday, saying it had become increasingly clear that ""Ted Cruz is the most viable alternative to Donald Trump.""

An aide to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who dropped out of the race last month, said Bush would meet with Cruz, fellow Floridian Rubio, and Kasich, governor of Ohio, in Miami before the March 15 contests. It was not clear if he planned to make an endorsement.

Clinton, 68, won in Mississippi, but the victory in Michigan by her opponent from Vermont was expected to prolong the fight to pick a candidate.

Clinton holds a sizable delegate lead, with 1,221 compared with Sanders' 571. She has been helped by winning Southern states by big margins and keeping most of her losses narrow.

Clinton's campaign has been dogged by questions over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and - in a sign the issue will not go away - the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit on Wednesday seeking emails between Clinton and her aides.

Trump could open a sizable delegate lead if he is able to win next Tuesday in Florida, Ohio, or Illinois, states that allot all their delegates to the winner.

Kasich, 63, of Ohio, and Rubio, 44, of Florida, could throw a wrench into Trump's delegate stash if they win in their home states next week.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 13:19:51+00:00,Mumbai women fighting for Right to Pee want men to join campaign,['Rina Chandran'],"A cubicle is seen at the Oxford Circus lavatories as they re-open to the public in London, May 20, 2005.

MUMBAI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Activists and charities campaigning for better access to public toilets for women in Mumbai are asking men to join the movement, saying greater gender sensitivity can solve the problem faster.

The Right to Pee campaign, a collaborative effort of 33 non-profits, is calling attention to the lack of free, clean and safe public toilets for women in Mumbai.

In the city of more than 22 million, only about one-third of the 11,000 or so pay-to-use toilets are for women.

""There is a huge disparity between facilities for men and women, largely due to the gender insensitivity of the authorities,"" said Supriya Sonar, an activist with the Right to Pee campaign. ""Which is why we are telling men who pee in the open: you too don't have adequate facilities, so why don't you join our campaign.""

The lack of adequate sanitation costs India the equivalent of more than 6 percent of its gross domestic product every year, according to non-profit Dasra, an Indian foundation promoting social change.

The issue is particularly important to slum dwellers - more than half Mumbai's population - and to those who work on construction sites and on the streets.

Public toilets for women are often dirty, with broken doors and no running water or lights. Where there are no public toilets, the search for a suitable place comes with the constant threat of sexual harassment or rape.

Women who lack access to clean, safe sanitation tend to drink less water and control their bladders for as many as 13 hours a day. This has significant, long-term effects on their reproductive, sexual and overall health, Dasra said in a report released last week.

In Mumbai, where men can often be seen urinating at street corners and near dumpsters, almost 100 sites have been identified for the construction of toilets for women.

""But nothing has been built, and the funds have lapsed,"" said activist Sonar, who on Monday returned an award the Mayor's office gave to the campaign last year, saying there had been no progress.

""This is about a woman's dignity,"" she said. ""We urge the Mumbai corporation to think about that. And we urge men who pee in the open to also join this campaign to bring more pressure on the authorities.""

The shortage of toilets is a nationwide issue: more than half India's adolescent girls, about 63 million, have no access to a private toilet, according to Dasra.

Girls tend to miss school for an average of six days a month because of the lack of safe toilets there, leading to almost a quarter of them dropping out of education on reaching puberty. This ""sharply degrades their potential as individuals and future workers,"" Dasra said.

The United Nations said in a 2014 report that it was a ""tragic irony"" that there were more mobile phones per 100 people in India than toilets.

In economic terms, the importance of tackling the problem is that there is a return of between $3 and $34 for every dollar spent on sanitation, through reduced poverty and health costs, and higher productivity, the United Nations said.

The ""Clean India Mission"" launched in 2014 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi aimed to improve sanitation and increase funding for public toilets to end open defecation.

A separate $7.5 billion renovation of 20 Indian cities is under way with the aim of making them ""Smart Cities"" by upgrading roads, utilities and sanitation .

reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:28:37+00:00,Pennsylvania gun control advocates challenge law on city gun rules,['Daniel Kelley'],"PHILADELPHIA Pennsylvania gun control advocates on Wednesday asked the state's top court to knock down a 2014 law allowing gun-rights lobbying groups to sue cities that adopt gun restrictions and recoup legal costs if they prevail.

Firearms advocates, including the National Rifle Association, contend the law is necessary to prevent gun owners from becoming ensnared by a patchwork of municipal ordinances that violate their right to bear arms.

Gun control advocates challenged the law on a technicality - that it passed as part of what they called an unrelated piece of legislation.

""These two bills were cobbled together for political expediency at the end of the legislative session,"" Martin Black, representing five Democratic lawmakers who sued to overturn the law, told the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.More than 80 towns across Pennsylvania repealed gun laws - ranging from requirements that owners report lost or stolen firearms to bans on guns in public parks - rather than face hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal bills to defend ordinances that were seldom enforced. Five municipalities, including Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, have faced lawsuits under the law.

The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the right to bear arms, and efforts to regulate gun ownership are often fiercely contested.

Wednesday's arguments focused on the tortured legislative history of the bill and whether its passage violated a provision of the state's Constitution that specifies that laws must focus on a single issue.

A lower court found last June that the passage was unconstitutional because Republican lawmakers tucked the firearms legislation into a bill dealing with scrap metal.

That bill passed on the final day of the 2014 legislative session and was so rushed that Republican Governor Tom Corbett signed the wrong bill.

Republican legislators said at the time that the language was necessary because towns were ignoring laws that made it a criminal offense for towns to pass gun restrictions.

""What does suing the city over a firearms matter have to do with the theft of copper wire?"" asked a skeptical Justice David Wecht.

Attorney Nick Orloff, arguing on behalf of Republican legislators, said both bills dealt with crime prevention.

""It's meant to deter crime,"" Orloff said.

But Shira Goodman, executive director of CeaseFire PA, scoffed at that idea.

""Say the city of Philadelphia passes a soda tax,"" Goodman said. ""If I don't drink soda, I don't get to sue because I didn't pay the tax.""

reuters.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,1.3 million euros a minute,"['Economics Editor For Reuters Based In London', ""Any Opinions Expressed Here Are The Author's Own"", 'Mark John', 'European Politics']","A year ago today, the European Central Bank began its programme of quantitative easing  money printing to buy assets  with a view to lifting sub-zero inflation back up towards the target of just under 2 percent. One year on, it has spent over 700 billion euros buying assets  mainly sovereign bonds, but also debt issued by some European institutions, as well as asset-backed securities (ABS) and covered bonds  at a pace of 1.3 million euros a minute.

As shown in this graphic, it has failed to bring euro zone inflation (now at -0.2 percent) anywhere near the target rate as a host of external factors from the slump in the price of oil to the Chinese slowdown exert bigger influence. Similar experiments around the world have also fallen short of the mark, prompting much hand-wringing about whether central bankers are still the safekeepers of the global economy that some had once thought they were. Its against this backdrop that ECB President Mario Draghi will step up for the Banks latest rate-setting meeting tomorrow. Expectations are firmly for more stimulus; less sure is whether it will make much of a difference.

The bill is intended to make it easier for employers to shed workers and negotiate everything from maximum working hours to holidays and pay on rest breaks. It has already sown dissent in his ruling Socialist party and sparked talk that Hollande will throw in the towel for re-election next year. Today is a key day with youth groups and unions planning a demo and a rail strike.

Today marks the official start of what could be a very brief Portuguese co-habitation, with the centre-rightist Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa being inaugurated as president alongside a shaky Socialist-led coalition propped up by far-left allies. The new government has set about reversing the austerity-based reforms of the previous conservative incumbent, but is also seeing investment start to fall and past declines in joblessness peter out. The point is that Rebelo de Sousa will from April have powers to sack the government and call new elections: his inaugural speech today will be watched closely for clues as to how keen he is to do that.",[]

NEW DELHI Liquor baron Vijay Mallya, under pressure from banks to repay more than $1 billion of debt owed by his collapsed airline, left the country last week, a lawyer for the lenders told the Supreme Court.

More than a dozen state-run banks - led by the country's largest, State Bank of India, - had appealed to the Supreme Court asking that Mallya be stopped from leaving as they step up pressure on the one-time billionaire.

On Wednesday, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, representing the banks, told the Supreme Court he had been told by police that Mallya left India on March 2, and asked the court to demand his return. Mallya's exact whereabouts are not known.

The court has asked Mallya to reply to a notice issued to him within two weeks, after which it will hear the case again. Details of the notice were not made public.

Mallya, an extravagant, larger-than-life personality who billed himself as the ""King of Good Times"", has become one of India's most famous errant borrowers, with newspapers closely following the fortunes of his yacht, jet and properties.

The debt at the heart of his troubles is owed by his Kingfisher Airlines, but was personally guaranteed by Mallya.

A spokesman for Mallya's UB Group did not respond to calls and email seeking comment.

In a statement on Sunday, Mallya said he had no intention of running away from creditors and was in talks with them for a one-time settlement of the Kingfisher debt.

Mallya was last month ousted as the chairman of top Indian spirits maker United Spirits, a unit of British spirits giant Diageo Plc.

A separate tribunal on Monday temporarily blocked a $75 million settlement Mallya is due to receive from Diageo.

Kingfisher, once India's second-biggest airline, collapsed in 2013, leaving creditors, suppliers and employees unpaid. The airline owed banks 69.63 billion rupees ($1.03 billion) as of the end of January 2014.

Including interest and other expenses, its liability is about 90 billion rupees ($1.34 billion), Rohatgi told the Supreme Court.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 14:11:38+00:00,Markets betting on near-zero interest rates for another decade,['Jamie Mcgeever'],"Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) March 4, 2016.

LONDON World markets may have recovered their poise from a torrid start to the year, but their outlook for global growth and inflation is now so bleak they are betting on developed world interest rates remaining near zero for up to another decade.

Even though the U.S. Federal Reserve has already started what it expects will be a series of interest rate rises, markets appear to have bought into a ""secular stagnation"" thesis floated by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.

The idea posits that the world is entering a peculiarly prolonged period in which structurally low inflation and wage growth - hampered by ageing populations and slowing productivity growth - means the inflation-adjusted interest rate needed to stimulate economic demand may be far below zero.

As there's likely a lower limit to nominal interest rates just below zero - because it's cheaper to hold physical cash and bank profitability starts to ebb - then even these zero rates do not gain traction on demand.

For all the debate about the accuracy of that view, it's already playing out in world markets, with long-term projections from the interest rate swaps market showing developed world interest rates stuck near zero for several years.

Take overnight interest rate swaps. They imply European Central Bank policy rates won't get back above 0.5 percent for around 13 years and aren't even expected to be much above 1 percent for at least 60 years.

Japan's main interest rate won't reach 0.5 percent for at least 30 years, they suggest, and even U.S. and UK rates are set to remain low for years. It will be six years before U.S. rates return to 1 percent, and a decade until UK rates reach that level.

""Although interest rates are low, they're not accommodative,"" said Harvinder Sian, global rates strategist at Citi in London. ""The era of zero rates will be with us for years and years, it wouldn't surprise me if we're looking at another five to 10 years.""

The five countries or economic blocs currently with negative deposit rates have yields below zero on all their bonds from a minimum of five years' maturity (Denmark) to a maximum of 20 years (Switzerland). ( tmsnrt.rs/1YvXLBq)

FAR FETCHED?

While some claim market pricing is far-fetched, similar doubts were expressed about zero interest rate policy and quantitative easing as the 2007/2008 crisis broke. Yet both are still being used and 46 central banks have eased policy since the start of last year, nine of whom have rates below 1 percent.

The ECB and Bank of Japan have already adopted negative interest rates on bank deposits, and are expected to loosen policy further via a mix of deeper negative rates and more asset-buying QE.

If the central banks guarding two of the four main world reserve currencies are easing, the exchange rate impact will tend to strengthen the other two, dragging on exports limit any interest rate rises there.

Japan's prolonged fight to escape deflation is instructive. As the economy reeled from the collapse of the stock and housing markets, the Bank of Japan entered zero-interest rate territory in 1995 when it cut rates to a then record low of 0.5 percent.

More than two decades on, they've never been higher than that, despite near full employment and the largest debt burden in the world.

""Today's risks of embedded low inflation tilting towards deflation ... are at least as serious as the inflation problem of the 1970s. They too will require shifts in policy paradigms if they are to be resolved,"" Summers wrote last week.

For many, Japan shows that huge monetary stimulus from the central bank doesn't always lift inflation or inflation expectations, consumer or business demand, and ultimately overall growth - what's known as the ""liquidity trap"".

Joseph Gagnon, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington and former Federal Reserve Board economist, warns against comparing every country to Japan.

Core inflation and employment in the United States are close to the Fed's targets, and even in Japan the latest round of QE looks finally be bearing fruit in consumer prices, Gagnon said.

Still, he says there was little for policy complacency.

""Unless Japan and the euro area ease policy much more aggressively, they will likely be stuck with zero or negative interest rates for years,"" Gagnon said.

That would be Tuesday, Mar. 15, when four crucial states  Florida, Ohio, Illinois and Missouri  will hold primaries. Its also the first day when Republican rules allow states, if they choose, to hold winner-take-all contests. Florida, with 99 delegates, and Ohio, with 66, are doing just that. Whoever comes in first wins the whole pot.

Both states have a favorite son in the presidential race  Senator Marco Rubio in Florida and Governor John Kasich in Ohio. But the Republican frontrunner Donald Trump leads the polls in Florida and is closely competitive in Ohio. If Rubio and Kasich lose their home states, they would be finished.

Anti-Trump Republicans are investing heavily to stop Trump. Three different political action committees are expected to spend more than $10 million on anti-Trump ads in Florida.

Trumps response: Go ahead, punks. Make my day. Trumps spokesman called it another desperate attempt by the out-of-touch establishment elites and dark money that control the weak politicians to maintain control of our broken and corrupt system.

For decades, two armies have been at war over the Republican Party. The struggle goes all the way back to 1976, when Ronald Reagan challenged President Gerald Ford and nearly beat the incumbent for his own partys nomination. It has always been the mainstream Republican establishment (Washington and Wall Street) versus the conservative counter-establishment.

The mainstream establishment is pinning its hopes on Rubio. But he seems to be sinking fast. Conservatives are rallying behind Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). Cruz, the Tea Party favorite, won the straw poll at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference. Trump, meanwhile, is leading both of them.

Cruz may be able to hold on for a while. Hes winning low-turnout Republican caucuses, as he did on Saturday in Kansas and Maine. A choice that comes down to Cruz and Trump would leave mainstream Republicans in despair: The old enemy (Cruz and the Tea Party) versus the new enemy (Trump).

We are witnessing history, former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan wrote in her the Wall Street Journal column. Something important is ending.

An army of outsiders is trying to take over the Republican Party. Its cause is anti-establishment populism. The Republican army is supposed to be fueled by hatred of President Barack Obama. But Trumps army is driven by another hatred that appears to be just as intense: hatred of the Republican Party establishment that has failed to stop Obama.

Trumps signature attitude is defiance. His supporters see voting for him as a way to defy the Republican Party establishment. I want to see Trump go up there and do damage to the Republican Party, one Mississippi voter told the New York Times. An Arizona voter said, Were going to use Donald Trump to either take over the GOP or blow it up.

Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, embodies everything Trump voters hate about the Republican establishment. Romney doesnt have a populist bone in his body. Worse, he let Obama beat him in 2012. There was Romney last week, warning Republicans that Trump is a fraud and a phony.

Romney went so far as to insinuate that Trump is an extremist. This is the very brand of anger, he said, that has led other nations into the abyss. Germany for example?

Trump is not an ideologue. And hes not a professional politician. Hes a businessman. His supporters believe government should be run like a business.

Its a deeply held American belief that politics is the enemy of problem-solving. Why cant we deal with the national debt? Too much politics. Why cant we deal with climate change? Politics. Trump, like businessman Ross Perot before him, promises to keep politics out of government and just get things done. Everybody knows theres no politics in business, right?

But theres a reason government cant be run like a business. Business is not a democracy. If business were a democracy, it would look like government: less efficient, more political. Thats why Trump has a taint of undemocratic extremism. He wants to run government like a business. With himself as boss.

The last hope of the anti-Trump forces is to prevent Trump from going to the Republican National Convention in July with the number of delegates needed to nominate him. If Trump doesnt win a on the first ballot, we could see a brokered convention. Then maybe the anti-Trump forces could rally behind another candidate.

Theyre deluding themselves. Suppose Trump goes to the convention with the largest primary vote and the largest number of delegates, even if its not a majority. Does anyone believe Trump would stand by and watch the party nominate a candidate who did worse than he did? Or a candidate who didnt even run in the primaries?

The Trump army would protest that the party establishment is rigging the game and rejecting the peoples choice. That way lies pandemonium. Trump supporters would disrupt the convention and possibly walk out. It would be Chicago 1968 all over again.

Some anti-Trump Republicans are talking about splitting the party and running another GOP candidate in November if Trump becomes the party nominee. Wouldnt that be suicidal? Wouldnt it ensure the election of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, now the likely nominee?

Of course it would. But anti-Trump Republicans may be making a longer-run calculation. If Trump became president, he would destroy the Republican Party. If Clinton became president, she would unite the Republican Party  against her.

And the party would live to fight another day.",[]

Republican leaders opposed to Donald Trump becoming the party's U.S. presidential candidate warned on Wednesday that the billionaire businessman could become unstoppable if he wins two crucial nominating contests next week.

One of Trump's fiercest critics in the Republican Party, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, said that if the billionaire businessman extends his winning streak into crucial contests next week, the New Yorker's path to the nomination was all but inevitable.

""I'm worried that if we lose Florida and Ohio he may be unstoppable,"" said Graham, a former Republican candidate who was among the party's large field of early White House hopefuls.

With victories in nominating contests on Tuesday in three out of four states, Trump maintained his lead over the three remaining challengers in the race to be the Republican candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election.

On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton's surprise loss to Bernie Sanders in the important Michigan primary laid bare growing voter anger over trade, raising warning flags for her ahead of a possible election showdown against Trump.

On Wednesday, the often-combative Trump struck a more conciliatory tone toward the Republican establishment that has fiercely resisted his advance - first by backing favourite candidates who failed to win votes, then by pouring money into campaigns against him.

""If we embrace what is happening and everyone came together, instead of spending all this money on these ads ...,"" Trump told Fox News. ""If everyone came together, no one could beat the Republican Party. We would walk into Washington.""

He also praised U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan after speaking with him by phone this week, calling the Republican leader a ""good man.""

Trump, 69, fended off a week of attacks from the party's establishment and defied predictions his campaign might be losing steam with his primary wins on Tuesday in Michigan, the biggest prize of the night, as well as Mississippi and Hawaii. His closest challenger, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, won Idaho.

Trump's convincing win in Michigan narrowed prospects for the party's anti-Trump forces to stop him before next Tuesday's contests, which also include Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri.

Trump now has 458 of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination, with Cruz second with 359 delegates, according to the Associated Press. Rival Marco Rubio trails with 151 delegates, while John Kasich is far behind with 54.

ENDORSEMENTS: ANY ONE BUT TRUMP

Cruz, with enough primary victories to present himself as a viable Trump alternative, won the endorsement of former Republican rival Carly Fiorina on Wednesday and appealed to anti-Trump Republicans to back him.

""If you don't want to see Donald Trump as the nominee, if you don't want to hand the election on a silver platter to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, then I ask you to join us,"" Cruz said.

Trump, a former reality TV show host, has peppered his campaign with put-downs of rivals and critics. Many mainstream Republicans have been offended by his statements on Muslims, immigrants and women and alarmed by his threats to international trade deals.

But Cruz, 45, is a hard alternative for some of the mainstream Republican leadership to get behind. A fiscal and social conservative, he is unpopular with fellow senators who were targets of his personal attacks and who blame him for orchestrating a government shutdown in 2013 in a failed attempt to derail President Barack Obama's healthcare reforms.

In January, Graham called a choice between Trump and Cruz like ""being shot or poisoned."" But the senator softened his tone on Wednesday, saying it had become increasingly clear that ""Ted Cruz is the most viable alternative to Donald Trump.""

An aide to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who dropped out of the race last month, said Bush would meet with Cruz, fellow Floridian Rubio, and Kasich, governor of Ohio, in Miami before the March 15 contests. It was not clear if he planned to make an endorsement.

Clinton, 68, won in Mississippi, but the victory in Michigan by her opponent from Vermont was expected to prolong the fight to pick a candidate.

Clinton holds a sizable delegate lead, with 1,221 compared with Sanders' 571. She has been helped by winning Southern states by big margins and keeping most of her losses narrow.

Clinton's campaign has been dogged by questions over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and - in a sign the issue will not go away - the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit on Wednesday seeking emails between Clinton and her aides.

Trump could open a sizable delegate lead if he is able to win next Tuesday in Florida, Ohio, or Illinois, states that allot all their delegates to the winner.

Kasich, 63, of Ohio, and Rubio, 44, of Florida, could throw a wrench into Trump's delegate stash if they win in their home states next week.

His brother, Charlie (Rod Steiger), lieutenant to a powerful mobster, has ruined Terrys promising boxing career  instructing him to throw a crucial bout so the mob could bet on his opponent. It proved to be the end of Terrys hopes. Near tears, Terry confronts his brother: I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am.

Its a speech Donald Trump will not have to utter. Those who are nominally his mob  that apparently powerless entity called the Republican establishment  tried to get him to throw the bout. He hasnt. And it now seems too late to get him out of the ring. Super Tuesdays results, in which Trump won seven of 11 states, mean he is a contender. Certainly no bum. Class, though, is more debatable.

Trump achieved this through bile, prejudice, insults and money. That was Act I. Act II has followed hard on its heels: No interval. It opened with his news conference in Palm Beach, Florida, as the Super Tuesday results rolled in. Like Benedick in Shakespeares Much Ado about Nothing, who has railed to all who would listen against the entanglements of desire for women, hes suddenly ready for love of Beatrice.

Trump is ready now for love of all. Hes a reacher-out, a generous foe, a unifier. Hes not a bum at all: How could we have thought so?

If a substantial number of Americans view this with trepidation, it cannot match the horror of Europeans. I can think of no major news organization that expresses anything but fear of a Trump presidency. If Democrat Hillary Clinton falters, or the blitz against her that Trump has promised works (shes the one great heretic in his unification church), Europeans and others, who still depend on the United States for stability, protection and a basic shared morality in world affairs, will likely be even more fearful than they are already.

The view has been much rehearsed in the primary season that Trumps mastery of reality TV, his showmanship, his Youre fired! ease of dealing with any and all problems have endeared him to millions determined to see politicians as a lost, even a malign cause. The entertainment-ization of politics has proved overwhelming and pulled the most serious of politicians onto the vaudeville stage.

Look, for an illustration, at a roast of Trump, broadcast by Comedy Central in 2011. It was a dinner devoted to comic insults  harsh, libelous and hilarious  of Trump. The comedian and actor Seth McFarlane issued a stream of putdowns of Trumps monstrous ego  the funniest claimed that, even when having sex with a beautiful woman, Trump was fantasizing about himself. Trump had volunteered for the roasting and, sitting a few feet from MacFarlane, maintained a look of amusement.

In his 1987 autobiography The Art of the Deal  now a necessary read  Trump wrote, Good publicity is preferable to bad, but from a bottom-line perspective, bad publicity is sometimes better than no publicity at all. Controversy, in short, sells.

One reason Trump accepted to be roasted was that he was considering running for president in 2012. He didnt. But that was just a postponement.

In March 2014, President Barack Obama, perhaps following the same thinking, appeared on the popular web program Between Two Ferns. Host Zach Galifianakis conducted a mocking interview. He asked Obama, for example, how he would feel when he left the presidency and people wouldnt let him win at basketball any more. Galifianakis made an elaborate display of boredom when the president spoke about the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. (Is this what they mean by drones?) Both Fox News on the right and Stephen Colbert on the left accused Obama of demeaning the presidency. Meanwhile, the program has gotten (to date) 13.5 million views on YouTube. This is what matters to the White House communications people.

Trump knew  and the White House learned  that ritual, high-profile disrespect can work to the advantage of the disrespected. It shows they can take a joke, and so are rounded people. In a way, its a tribute to their status. It makes them look cool, especially to the young.

Norman Mailer, in his 1963 book The Presidential Papers, wrote, Politics is arithmetic, but politics is also rhetoric, passion and an occasional idea to fire the imagination of millions. He expressed despair that then-President John F. Kennedy (not the least charismatic of the occupiers of the Oval Office, one would think), was too wedded to arithmetic. Mailer was probably not thinking about someone like Trump. (He would be thinking, as ever, more about himself.) But Trump is the one who fits his bill.

Trump has expressed passion  or at least convincingly acted passionately  about a number of ideas: deporting what he calls criminal, rape-inclined Mexicans; temporarily barring Muslims from entering the United States; repealing Obamacare and bringing in something much better.

In The Art of the Deal, he writes, I play to peoples fantasies ... a very effective form of promotion.

This is why he appeals to people. He is where he is because people vote for him  sometimes tongue in cheek, but often because it seems that his aggression, desire to be the best and wealth will be at their service. Trump isnt a politician, has no experience in elected office and enjoys the support of President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Yay! Hes not one of them.

As one Trump supporter, Ken Magno of Everett, Massachusetts, said: This isnt about whether hes going to do a better job or not. More or less, its the statement: Listen, were sick and tired of what you people do. And were going to put somebody in there  now that its our choice, were going to put somebody in there that basically you dont like.

A sizable part of America, many millions strong, is putting the finger up to the political class  right and left. They are responding to what Mailer thought he was calling for  passion, rhetoric, new ideas, firing the imagination of millions.

Having done all that, the nomination is Trumps to lose. Its more and more likely that hell be in a face-off with a woman who can do the arithmetic but finds showmanship far harder.",[]

MOGADISHU Islamist group al Shabaab said it fought off an attack on one of its bases in southern Somalia early on Wednesday that was launched by foreign commandos who flew in on two helicopters, leaving one al Shabaab fighter dead in the gun battle.

Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaabs military operations spokesman, did not identify the nationality of the troops who launched the assault at about 1 a.m. in the Awdigle district of Lower Shabelle area, about 50 km (30 miles) south of Mogadishu.

Several foreign nations have been supporting the Somali government's efforts to combat al Shabaab's insurgency.

The AMISOM peacekeeping force is made up of troops from several African nations which has been fighting alongside the Somali army. An AMISOM spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.

U.S. officials said in 2014 that U.S. military advisers had secretly operated in Somalia since around 2007. They also said at that time that Washington planned to deepen its security assistance to help Somalia fend off the Islamist threat.

Washington said it launched air strikes on another al Shabaab base on Saturday killing more than 150 Islamist fighters. Al Shabaab said the number was exaggerated.

It was not immediately possible to obtain any U.S. comment.

Al Shabaab's military operations spokesman told Reuters the two helicopters landed on the banks of the River Shabelle and commandos from the aircraft advanced on the base.

""They were masked and spoke foreign languages which our fighters could not understand,"" Abu Musab told Reuters. ""We do not know who they were but we foiled them.""

He said the commandos carried rocket launchers and M16 rifles - referring to a weapon used by U.S. forces although Abu Musab did not mention any nationality.

Residents in the area confirmed there had been a gun battle and said they saw helicopters in the area. They said the mobile phone network did not work during fighting.

""We were awoken by exchange of heavy guns,"" said resident Ahmed Farah speaking by phone later on Wednesday. ""We could see the helicopters land and fly.""

He said al Shabaab later sealed the area so it was not possible to know if there were any casualties.

Al Shabaab, which wants to topple the Western-backed Somali government, has launched a spate of bombings in Mogadishu and elsewhere in the past two weeks, killing dozens of people. A car bomb killed at least three police officers on Wednesday.

Although the Queen of England is featured predominantly on Canada's currency, the new note will showcase a Canadian - either by birth or naturalization - who has shown leadership or achievement in the service of the country.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau in making the announcement noted that, with the exception of the queen, women have ""largely been unrepresented"" on Canada's bank notes.

Celine Dion need not apply - to the chagrin of at least one Twitter commentator - because candidates also must have been deceased for at least 25 years.

Nominations submitted to the Bank of Canada will be reviewed by an independent advisory council made up of academics and other experts that will draw up a short list to be submitted to the finance minister. The new note will be issued in 2018.

Following the announcement, which coincided with International Women's Day, the Bank of Canada tweeted that the first name submitted was Canadian suffragist Nellie McClung, who died in 1951.

The Bank of Canada did not specify which bank note would feature the iconic woman.

The move follows in the footsteps of the United States, which last year announced it would feature the face of a woman on a redesigned $10 bill to be unveiled in 2020.

Shares of Chipotle fell as much as 6.1 percent before easing, down 3.5 percent to $506.12 in afternoon trading.

The closure of the Chipotle in Billerica, Massachusetts, was seen as a test of a new food safety system rolled out after a series of illnesses hit the fresh burrito chain last year.

""They did the right thing,"" said Howard Penney, who covers the chain for Hedgeye Risk Management. However, he argued that Chipotle was still a ""broken company"" and that it would take years to return to its peak performance.

One employee was confirmed ill with norovirus and two more are suspected to have the virus, the top health official of the town of Billerica said.

The cleaned restaurant was scheduled to reopen on Thursday, Billerica Public Health Director Richard Berube told reporters, adding that the employees suspected of having the virus did not come to work on Wednesday.

""They called in sick so that was very fortunate,"" he said outside the closed restaurant.

Berube, the company and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health all said no customers were known to be sick.

Chipotle is trying to repair its reputation after a series of food-safety incidents. Those include two E.coli outbreaks linked to its restaurants that sickened more than 50 people in 10 states, as well as separate outbreaks of norovirus, a highly contagious virus known as the ""winter vomiting bug"", in Massachusetts and California that involved more than 350 diners.

Berube said Chipotle has been ""very proactive."" Remaining staff at the burrito restaurant would be screened for norovirus, he added.

Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold said the company closed the restaurant after four employees called in sick. Berube said three employees were sick or suspected of being sick.

The restaurant closure comes as Chipotle has tried to lure back diners with coupons for a free burrito and other food.

Chipotle sales have fallen sharply since the E.coli outbreaks came to light late last year. The stock traded above $750 last summer.

Sales at established Chipotle restaurants tumbled 14.6 percent in the fourth quarter, including a drop of 30 percent in the month of December.

""The publicity around this news announcement will be another negative data-point that may affect consumer demand,"" CRT Capital analyst Lynne Collier said in a client note.

Chipotle temporarily closed all of its U.S. restaurants on Feb. 8 during prime lunch hours to hold staff meetings on food safety.

Up to Tuesday's close of $524.69, the company's stock had fallen about 18 percent since the first E.coli outbreak was reported on Oct. 31.

Teva, the world's biggest generic drugsmaker, will divest some drugs already on the market and others in the pipeline to address competition concerns by the European Commission, the people said. The package includes products from both Teva and Allergan.

Other sources had previously told Reuters that assets worth about $1 billion in the United States, Europe and the Middle East would be sold in order to secure the green light from regulators.

Teva will gain bigger economies of scale, a crucial element in the low-margin generic drugs business, with the deal, the largest in Israel's corporate history.

The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the case on Thursday, and Teva declined to comment.

The deal, which requires U.S. approval, has triggered a warning from the American Antitrust Institute that a more concentrated generic market usually comes with higher prices. The think-tank also said divestments may not be enough to ensure competition in the market in a letter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in January.

The San Antonio, Texas-based company has been battling with creditors, a group made up mostly of hedge funds, after it moved Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc shares to another subsidiary, Broader Media LLC.

iHeart this week received a default notice from the creditors, arguing the transfer is technically a default, and saying they could call their debt due in 60 days - a sum more than $6 billion - according to a lawsuit iHeart filed in State District Court in Bexar County, Texas.

The lawsuit also claims that the creditors' actions threaten to force the company into bankruptcy.

The restraining order iHeart won expires in 14 days, but the court may extend it, according to a public filing from the company. The order also stops the creditors from issuing additional notices of default.

iHeart said in a prepared statement that it was pleased with the outcome and looks forward to a favorable ruling.

The share move could be used to help the company, struggling with a $21 billion debt load, to find other financing opportunities, Moody's Investors Service said in a research note.

Silicon Valleys hoodie-wearing tech entrepreneurs are the poster kids of innovation. But the innovators who are really changing the world are more likely to wear labcoats and hold government-related jobs in Grenoble, Munich or Tokyo. That's the conclusion of Reuters Top 25 Global Innovators  Government, a list that identifies and ranks the publicly funded institutions doing the most to advance science and technology.

Topping the list is France's Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), for its research into areas including renewable power, public health, and information security. Rounding out the top three: Germanys Fraunhofer Society and Japans Science and Technology Agency.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 25 Compare Institutions | Methodology

On a country-by-country basis, the United States leads the list, with six organizations ranked (France and Japan each have four, and Germany has three). The Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) is the top U.S. finisher, placing fourth.

The rankings were compiled by the Intellectual Property & Science division of Thomson Reuters, which used proprietary data and analysis tools to examine patents and research papers from the past eight years to find the governmental organizations most likely to change the world. A separate ranking of similar data from universities was published last year.

It took a government agency to put a man on the moon, and even in the age of the Internet, governments are still moving science and technology forward. They do pure research that private companies often find it hard to justify and afford, and make discoveries that launch entire industries: publicly funded organizations split the atom, invented the Internet, and mapped the human genome.

There are 16,000 technicians, engineers and researchers in 10 government-run centers throughout France working on the next great innovation. Theyre all a part of CEA, a public research institution specializing in nuclear and renewable energies, defense and security, as well as information and health technologies. Established by General Charles de Gaulle at the end of World War II, the organization represents France in the nuclear sector, promoting safe and responsible use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.

CEA ranks first among government research institutes in part because its researchers apply for and receive significantly more patents than most government organizations - an indication that their research has strong potential for commercial value. Those patents are also frequently cited by outside researchers, showing that CEA has a big impact on R&D efforts at other organizations. CEA receives the majority of its funding from the French government, and works closely with national agencies on projects ranging from building nuclear-powered naval vessels to improving the nation's cybersecurity. But it also has more than 500 industrial partners, and its research has led to the creation of 115 spinoff companies since 2000, including Paris-based biopharmaceutical company Theranexus, which is working on advanced treatments for psychiatric disorders.

The second most innovative institution on the Top 25 Global Innovators  Government list also focuses on developing technology that can help fuel private industry. Germanys Fraunhofer Society is Europe's largest applied research institution, with 24,000 staff members in 67 institutes and research units. Public sector funds account for only about a third of its annual budget; most of the Society's research is funded by contracts with industry.

European institutions account for nine out of 25 ranked institutions, more than any other continent. Asia comes in second with eight institutions, including third-place finisher the Japan Science & Technology Agency, or JST. An independent administrative institution under the government's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, it works primarily with academia, industry and other international research institutions. Three JST scientists won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2014 for inventing efficient blue-light-emitting diodes, which have enabled bright, energy-saving white-light sources.

HHS, the top-ranked government innovator in the U.S., is a cabinet-level department of the federal government tasked with protecting the health of American citizens. Although primarily known as a regulatory and service agency, the department's 11 operating divisions include some of the nation's most active centers of scientific research, including the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration. (Patents filed by these institutions list the name of their parent agency, so for the purposes of this list, Thomson Reuters ranked HHS instead of its subsidiaries.)

Also on the list: The United States Navy and the United States Army. Like HHS, these military service organizations arent best known for science, but they perform a wide range of basic and applied research in pursuit of their mission. More than 60 researchers have won a Nobel Prize for work funded by the Office of Naval Research since it was established in 1946. The United States Army Laboratory, established in 1992, has developed products such as advanced coatings to shield vehicles from chemical warfare, which are now used to protect monuments, sculptures and artworks.

To compile the ranking, the IP & Science division of Thomson Reuters began by identifying more than 500 global organizations - including universities, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions - that published the most articles in academic journals. Then they identified the total number of patents filed by each organization and evaluated each candidate on factors including how many patents it filed, how often those applications were granted, how many patents were filed to global patent offices in addition to local authorities and how often the patents were cited by other patents. Candidates were also evaluated in terms of the number of articles published by researchers in academic journals, how often those papers were cited by patents and how many articles featured a co-author from industry. Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included government-run or funded organizations, and then ranked them based on their performance. Click here for the methodology.

The coalition denounced Amadou's detention and justified its decision to withdraw by saying the constitutional court had not followed procedure when it announced definitive first-round results on Tuesday and had also not proven its independence.

The coalition, which unites about 20 political parties including Amadou's MODEN, also asked its deputies to cease activities at the National Assembly.

Issoufou fell just short of outright victory in the first round on Feb. 21 and was expected to win the run-off as several smaller parties have said they will support him.

He campaigned on a promise to clamp down on Islamist militants and revive the economy in Niger, one of the world's poorest countries.

The Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which is based in Nigeria, has staged a series of cross-border attacks in Niger's southeastern Diffa region, forcing the government to impose a state of emergency there.

Niger produces uranium and oil but is ranked last in the United Nations' Human Development Index and has one of the world's highest fertility rates.

It ranks 114th out of 142 countries in the 2015 prosperity index run by the British-based Legatum Institute.

MONTREAL Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) Chief Executive Officer Hunter Harrison on Wednesday said CSX Corp (CSX.O) has several strengths as a merger target, but stressed that he never made a formal offer for the U.S. railroad.

CP, which launched a $28 billion bid in November to merge with U.S. railroad Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N), could make an equal case for CSX, Harrison told the J.P. Morgan Aviation, Transportation & Industrials Conference in New York.

""They would both work for us.""

Harrison acknowledged that CP had made mistakes in its bid for Norfolk Southern, which the railroad's board of directors has repeatedly rejected.

""One of the things that I'm wrestling with is clearly we made some mistakes along the way,"" he said, without identifying any specific errors.

CP has filed a shareholder proposal for Norfolk Southern's annual general meeting that calls for talks to be held between the two railroads. A date for the meeting has not been announced, although previous ones have been held in May.

""Presently this is kind of our last effort, the last thing we know to do and we hope it will work,"" Harrison said. ""If not we're going to go back and run our railroad.""

Earlier this month, CP said it was looking at all legal options in response to what it described as concerted efforts by certain U.S. railroads to block the proposed merger.

As a potential merger target, CSX, like Norfolk Southern, has a lot of strengths from a fiscal standpoint and because of the markets it serves, he said. Harrison said he had held a 90-minute meeting with CSX in 2014, but had not made a formal offer at the time, explaining that a merger would not work ""culturally.""

Harrison did not discuss a report in the Wall Street Journal that the two railroads met again in January 2016, where CSX was said to have rebuffed CP's merger approach..

A CP spokesman could not comment Wednesday on the reported meeting, but noted that Harrison did not personally meet with CSX in January.

She's asking for $225,000 (USD) in back pay. The lawsuit alleges that the agency, Trump Model Management, employed Palmer using an H1-B visa, which allows U.S. employers to hire so-called ""specialized"" foreign labor. The agency listed Palmer's salary as ""at least $75,000 per year"" for three years on the application. But the model says she received less than $4000 during that time. Trump, who's had to fend off a number of accusations during his bid for president, is not named in the suit. But his attorney argues that the $75,000 a year figure was simply a guess, not a guarantee. And that the contract required Palmer ""to promptly reimburse"" the agency ""for any and all costs and expenses"". Palmer says those reimbursements amounted to 80 percent of her earnings, which were deducted by the agency. A decision is expected by the end of March.",[]

The resolution to amend the state's constitution passed 23-9 after the majority Republican caucus used a parliamentary maneuver to end the filibuster, which began at 4:00 p.m. CST on Monday, said Lauren Hieger, communications director for the Missouri Senate Majority Caucus.

READ MORE: Lead in the water: The corrosive dangers lurking in private wells

The amendment must be voted on again in the Senate next week before passing to the lower house, where Republicans have a majority, and then to the state's voters, Hieger said.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, applauded the effort by the Senate minority to block the resolution. ""Rewriting our state's constitution to condone discrimination would be contrary to our values and harmful to our economy,"" Nixon said in a statement on Wednesday.

The legislation is among a series of measures introduced around the country by conservatives in response to last year's U.S. Supreme Court legalization of same-sex marriage. The measures seek to protect religious groups and companies from being fined or punished if they decline to provide services such as wedding cakes or flowers to same-sex couples.



RECOMMENDED: Republicans sue State Department for Clinton emails

Republicans who backed the amendment said it was about religious freedom, but Democrats said it would enshrine discrimination in the state's constitution.

Given their minority position in both chambers of Missouri's General Assembly, Democrats chose to filibuster, debating overnight on Monday and Tuesday to block the initiative.

""Inspired by senators' heroic stand against discrimination in #MO. The nation is watching & cheering you on!"" Nixon tweeted on Tuesday night.

""In our pluralistic society, we should have room to respect the religious freedom of Missourians,"" Republican Senator Bob Onder, who sponsored the bill, told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday morning. He said the language of the bill was modified in a compromise on Tuesday to narrowly define wedding vendors.

The American Civil Liberties Union civil rights group said it would work to fight the bill in Missouri's House of Representatives.

""This amendment raises serious constitutional concerns because it singles out same-sex couples for discrimination,"" Jeffrey Mittman, executive director of ACLU of Missouri, said in a statement.

Por 10 votos a 1, o Supremo acolheu os argumentos feitos em acao movida pelo PPS com base na Constituicao de 1988, alegando que proibe integrantes do Ministerio Publico, como e o caso de Wellington Cesar, de assumirem outros cargos publicos, exceto os de professor.

Os ministros Edson Fachin, Luis Roberto Barroso, Teori Zavascki, Rosa Webber, Luiz Fux, Dias Toffoli, Carmen Lucia, Celso de Mello e Ricardo Lewandowski acompanharam o voto do relator do caso, ministro Gilmar Mendes, no qual afirmou que membros do Ministerio Publico nao podem exercer cargos publicos, exceto os de professor.

Apenas o ministro Marco Aurelio Mello votou contra a acao proposta pelo PPS e, ainda assim, por entender que o partido escolheu o instrumento juridico incorreto para questionar a nomeacao de Wellington Cesar.

Em seu voto, Mendes argumentou que, ao atuar no Poder Executivo, um integrante do MP se torna subordinado ao chefe de um outro Poder, o que, na avaliacao do magistrado, fere a independencia do Ministerio Publico.

A decisao do Supremo e mais um golpe para o governo Dilma, que ja sofre com a possibilidade de abertura de um processo de impeachment e com acoes que pedem sua cassacao junto ao Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF).

Wellington Cesar tomou posse no ministerio ha menos de uma semana em substituicao a Jose Eduardo Cardozo, que asumiu o comando da Advocacia-Geral da Uniao.

Cardozo, na estreia na tribuna do STF a frente do novo cargo, negou que houvesse incompatibilidade e argumentou que a harmonizacao e total entre o Ministerio Publico e o Ministerio da Justica.

O ministro da Secretaria de Governo, Ricardo Berzoini, afirmou apos julgamento do STF que ainda nao ha uma decisao sobre um novo ministro e alegou que e necessario aguardar a opcao de Wellington Cesar.

Mobile payments company Square Inc's revenue beat analysts' estimates in its first quarterly results since going public in November, easing pressure on CEO Jack Dorsey who is also leading turnaround efforts at Twitter Inc.

Square's shares rose as much as 7 percent after market on Wednesday, before giving up some of the gains. The stock had closed up 4.8 percent at $12.03 during the day.

The company's gross payment volume (GPV)  the total dollar amount of all card payments processed by sellers  rose 47 percent to $10.2 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31.

""Historically, the fourth quarter has been our strongest revenue quarter as sellers typically generate additional GPV during the holiday season,"" Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said on a conference call.

Transaction revenue  earned from businesses processing payments through Square's devices  grew 44.7 percent to $298.5 million.

The company, founded in 2009, has built a substantial customer base with a credit card reader that turns a mobile device into a payment terminal. The company also makes point-of-sale registers, and contactless and chip-enabled card readers.

Hardware revenue more than tripled to $6 million in the quarter.

However, Square is facing rising competition in the payments market from Apple Inc's Apple Pay and startups such as Stripe Inc.

Also, Dorsey's dual role as CEOs at Twitter and Square has been a sore point with investors at both companies. On his part, Dorsey has looked to play down the concerns.

Since his return to Twitter in July, Dorsey has unleashed a series of big changes at the micro-blogging service provider, looking to draw more users.

Square's total net revenue rose 49.2 percent to $374.4 million in the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $343.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company forecast adjusted revenue of $600 million-$620 million for 2016, above the $452 million it reported a year earlier.

However, net loss attributable to common stockholders widened to $80.5 million, or 34 cents per share, from $37.1 million, or 25 cents per share.

Square has been investing heavily in new hardware and building out its lending business, Square Capital.

The company's shares have mostly stayed below the first trading close of $13.07 and even slipped below the deeply discounted IPO price of $9 for a brief period, hitting a low of $8.06 on Feb. 3.

Since then, the stock had risen nearly 50 percent through Wednesday's close.

Teva, the world's biggest generic drugsmaker, will divest some drugs already on the market and others in the pipeline to address competition concerns by the European Commission, the people said. The package includes products from both Teva and Allergan.

Other sources had previously told Reuters that assets worth about $1 billion in the United States, Europe and the Middle East would be sold in order to secure the green light from regulators.

Teva will gain bigger economies of scale, a crucial element in the low-margin generic drugs business, with the deal, the largest in Israel's corporate history.

The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the case on Thursday, and Teva declined to comment.

The deal, which requires U.S. approval, has triggered a warning from the American Antitrust Institute that a more concentrated generic market usually comes with higher prices. The think-tank also said divestments may not be enough to ensure competition in the market in a letter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in January.

Dublin-based Botox-maker Allergan in turn is to be acquired by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) in a $160 billion deal creating the world's largest drugmaker.

Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) said on Wednesday it would buy U.S. options exchange operator International Securities Exchange for $1.1 billion from Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1Gn.DE), the latest deal to emerge from a spate of exchange merger talks.

ISE operates three electronic options exchanges which together account for more than 15 percent of U.S. volume, while Nasdaq operates another three. Combined, Nasdaq would command more than 40 percent of the market, extending its lead as the No. 1 U.S. options exchange operator.

""The ability to further that lead gives us advantages as to how we could serve our customers because you have a different volume versus scale arrangement,"" Nasdaq Chief Executive Bob Greifeld said in an interview.

The deal would also free up capital for Deutsche Boerse, which has said it plans to merge with the London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE.L) to create a European trading powerhouse that could better compete against U.S. rivals.

Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) said it may make a rival bid for the LSE, raising the prospects of a takeover battle.

Nasdaq, which plans to move ISE's trading platforms onto Nasdaq technology, said it could strip out $40 million from the two businesses through the transaction.

The deal would also give Nasdaq an additional 20 percent stake in the Options Clearing Corporation, for a total of 40 percent ownership in the world's largest equity derivatives clearing corporation.

Greifeld said he had been looking to buy ISE for years, and talks with Deutsche Boerse CEO Carsten Kengeter picked up over the past three months.

The deal does not include ISE's stake in No. 2 U.S. stock exchange operator BATS Global Markets, or blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings, which will continue to be owned by Deutsche Boerse, the German company said.

Nasdaq said the transaction was expected to be finalized in the second half of the year, pending regulatory approval, and it would likely increase earnings within 12 months of closing.

Nasdaq has made several acquisitions in recent years that have helped boost its profits and share price. These include Chi-X Canada, that country's largest alternative trading system, in a deal that closed last month; and index provider Dorsey, Wright & Associates last year.

Michael Horn, speaks at their media reception during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, January 10, 2016.

Michael Horn, President and CEO of Volkswagen America, reacts to being mobbed by the media after he apologized for the Volkswagen diesel scandal at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, United States in a November 18, 2015 file photo.

Michael Horn, President and CEO of Volkswagen America, introduces the new Beetle Dune at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, United States in a November 18, 2015 file photo.

WASHINGTON Volkswagen AG's top U.S. executive is stepping down nearly six months after the German automaker admitted to installing software to allow 580,000 diesel U.S. vehicles to emit excess emissions, the company said on Wednesday.

Michael Horn, who has been president and chief executive officer of Volkswagen Group of America since 2014, is leaving by mutual agreement ""to pursue other opportunities effective immediately,"" VW said.

Horn, 54, could not immediately be reached. A lawyer for Horn did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

The German automaker said on an interim basis, Hinrich J. Woebcken, a former BMW executive who ran global purchasing among other jobs, is filling Horn's job. In January, VW named Woebcken as head of VW's North American region, effective April 1.

Horn sent an email to employees thanking them for supporting him and for pulling together during the crisis.

Horn's departure comes as VW continues to negotiate with California, the Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency on possible fixes or buybacks for the diesel vehicles that emit up to 40 times legally allowable pollution. It faces a March 24 deadline to tell a federal judge whether it has an acceptable fix.

A top California official told state lawmakers Tuesday that VW may only be able to mount a partial fix and may have to pay to mitigate the harm caused by allowing vehicles to remain on the road.

Volkswagen faces an ongoing Justice Department criminal investigation. The Justice Department sued VW in January seeking up to $46 billion for violating environmental regulations and sent VW a civil subpoena under a bank fraud law.

Alan Brown, general manager of Hendrick Volkswagen in Frisco, Texas who is president of the National Volkswagen Dealer Advisory Council, praised Horn's tenure at VW and said he had talked to Horn over the last three days about his departure. Brown told Reuters Horn had been offered other jobs at Volkswagen outside the United States, but declined to take them.

Brown said it was critical VW maintain the strategy of growing U.S. volume and noted dealers have strongly supported the automaker through the crisis.

""We are not working out of gas stations any more,"" Brown said, noting VW's about U.S. 650 dealers have invested $1 billion over the last decade in facilities.

Brown is flying to Germany on Sunday and staying through Wednesday for meetings with VW executives in the aftermath of Horn's departure.

VW brand U.S. sales are down 14 percent this year after falling 5 percent last year. VW still faces a stop sale on all new diesel vehicles.

Brown said it was important VW stick with the business plan it approved to expand U.S. sales by quickly refreshing and redesigning vehicles.

U.S. VW dealers ""don't want a handout. They want a chance to win,"" Brown said. He said VW should scrap the idea of positioning itself as a ""near premium brand"" and return to its roots in the 1960s of selling mass market vehicles like the iconic Beetle.

Dennis Gaudet, a New Hampshire VW dealer, said Brown was ""probably the most popular (head) we've had as long as I've been a dealer"" and added he knew the American market ""better than most.""

During the initial response to the crisis, Horn was VW's public face in the United States, apologizing days after the scandal became public and testifying before Congress.

""Lets be clear about this: our company was dishonest  with the EPA and the California Air Resources Board  and with all of you. And in my German words: We totally screwed up. We must fix those cars,"" Horn said on Sept. 21.

In October, Horn told a U.S. House of Representatives panel that VWs supervisory board and top leadership did not intentionally order the cheating, but said it was the work of a few individuals.

Horn told Congress he had no knowledge of the cheating.

Horn joined VW in 1990 and held a series of jobs, including VW sales for Europe, before he became CEO based at VW's U.S. headquarters in Herndon, Virginia following the resignation of his predecessor, Jonathan Browning who abruptly resigned after VW brand sales fell in 2013. Sales fell despite an aggressive plan announced in 2008 by VW to triple sales in 10 years.

Mildronate (Meldonium) medication capsules are pictured on the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, in this November 23, 2010 file photo.

A manufacturing operator works at the Mildronate (Meldonium) medication packaging process in the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, November 23, 2010. Picture taken November 23, 2010.

LONDON, March 9 The medicine Maria Sharapova says she has taken for 10 years due to a family history of heart issues and diabetes is an old drug sold in just a few Eastern European countries that can also boost exercise tolerance.

The tennis star tested positive for the banned drug meldonium, or Mildronate, in a sample taken on January 26, the day of her Australian Open quarter finals defeat to Serena Williams.

RECOMMENDED: Trump's foreign labor practices in the spotlight

She said her family doctor had first given her the drug 10 years ago after she frequently became sick, had irregular electrocardiogram results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.

The 28-year old Russian, a five-time grand slam champion and the highest paid woman in sports, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said.

For the health conditions Sharapova says she has, however, doctors say the scientific evidence for Mildronate is limited compared with many medicines widely available in Europe and the United States, where Sharapova trains, which have full regulatory backing and years of robust safety and efficacy data.

LATVIAN DRUG

Meldonium is cheap and available over the counter without a prescription in some eastern European countries, where it is marketed as Mildronate by the Latvian pharmaceutical firm Grindeks (GRD1R.RI).

The drug, originally developed by scientists at the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, is not licensed by two of the world's biggest medicines regulators: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States where Sharapova trains, and the EU's European Medicines Agency.

RECOMMENDED: Iran tests more missiles, says capable of reaching Israel

A spokeswoman for Grindeks said the firm had not applied for a license for Mildronate from either the FDA or the EMA, but said the drug is registered in Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union.

She said it is designed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular diseases, including angina, chronic heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other cardiovascular disorders.

Grindeks' also promotes it for people with reduced working capacity from physical or psycho-emotional ""overload"", and during recovery from cerebrovascular disorders, head injury and encephalitis. It is not indicated for diabetes.

Tim Chico, a consultant cardiologist at Britain's Sheffield University, said it was unlikely that such a young and extremely fit woman would be suffering from a serious heart condition like angina, or would be able to play top level tennis if she were.

Asked how long the drug should be given to a patient, the Grindeks spokeswoman said in an emailed statement: ""Depending on the patient health condition, treatment course of meldonium preparations may vary from 4 to 6 weeks"". Such courses could be repeated two or three times in a year.

In an emailed reply to questions from Reuters about her medical reasons for using the drug, Sharapova's lawyer John Haggerty said: ""While I cannot go into detail out of respect for the ITF process, I can confirm that Ms Sharapova had abnormal EKG tests in 2006 and was also diagnosed with asthenia (a lack of energy or strength), decreased immunity and diabetes indicators.""

""She also had a family history of heart conditions,"" Haggerty said. ""The Mildronate and the other medicines recommended by her doctor treated these conditions.""

Munir Pirmohamed, a professor of molecular and clinical pharmacology at Britain's University of Liverpool, said the crucial issue with Mildronate for him is its lack of approval from EU and U.S. regulators.

""As a physician, this is not something I have, or would ever, prescribe,"" he said.

Others noted it was rare for a doctor treating illness to prescribe a drug that is unavailable in the country where the patient lives.

""Sharapova has been a U.S. resident since early in her career, which does bring in a question of how or why she is using a drug that is not licensed there,"" said Tom Bassindale, a lecturer in forensic science at Sheffield Hallam University.

Sharapova's agent Max Eisenbud was not available at his Miami office and did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

HELPS MUSCLES COPE

Whatever its medical benefits, research suggests Mildronate may have potential as a performance-enhancing drug for sports.

It reduces the level of a metabolite called carnetine in muscles, and by doing that helps muscles cope better with high levels of stress and low oxygen levels.

""Because it effects the cellular metabolism, it would increase energy production within cells and therefore make oxygen utilization more efficient,"" said Pirmohamed.

In a 2010 academic paper published in a review journal called Seminars in Cardiovascular Medicine and cited on the Grindeks company website, it has been shown to improve exercise tolerance in patients with heart problems.

The World Anti-Doping Agency, which banned the drug in January after previously having it on a ""watch list"", ranks it as a prohibited metabolic modulator and cites ""evidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance.""

Grindeks says the drug could protect athletes from cell damage, but says it would be unlikely to improve their competitive performance.

It would be ""reasonable to recommend (sports people) to use meldonium as a cell protector to avoid heart failure or muscle damage in case of unwanted overload,"" the spokeswoman said.

Athletes ""should not expect increase of physical capacity, but, for sure, they will be protected against ischemic damages of cells in case of overload.""

U.S. banks and money funds would face difficulties if the Federal Reserve were to adopt negative interest rates as a policy tool to fight recession or to avert deflation, the bank's analysts said.

German, French, Italian and Spanish banks hold more loans than securities as a portion of their overall assets than their U.S. and Japanese counterparts.

""This leaves core banks potentially more exposed to a negative rate environment than others in the periphery or in comparison to Japanese or U.S. banks,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a research report published on Wednesday.

German banks have the highest percentage of loans among the four core euro zone groups at 58 percent. This compared with 47 percent among Japanese banks and 55 percent among U.S. banks.

In June 2014, the European Central Bank cut policy rates into negative territory, which essentially charges banks for leaving reserves at the ECB.

BEIJING China's February trade performance was far worse than economists had expected, with exports tumbling the most in over six years, days after top leaders sought to reassure investors that the outlook for the world's second-largest economy remains solid.

Exports fell 25.4 percent from a year earlier, twice as much as markets had feared as demand skidded in all of China's major markets, while imports slumped 13.8 percent, the 16th straight month of decline.

The export drop was the biggest since May 2009, but economists said it may not necessarily point to a significant worsening in economic conditions due to sharply reduced business activity during the long Lunar New Year holidays, which fell in early February this year.

Still, January-February exports on a combined basis, which should iron out some of the holiday effect, fell 17.8 percent and imports 16.7 percent, pointing to persistently weak demand at home and abroad that is weighing on the economy of the world's largest trading nation.

""Exports were very strong last year in February because the Lunar New Year started so late and much of the usual disruption from the holiday was pushed into March. So the implication is that we'll probably see a significant reversal and a stronger number next month,"" said Julian Evans-Prichard, China Economist at Capital Economics in Singapore.

""We suspect that overall exports remain weak but we dont see much evidence of marked deterioration, for instance there was no sudden drop-off in export orders in the Markit PMI (activity survey), and they generally do a pretty good job of adjusting for seasonality.""

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected February exports to fall by 12.5 percent, with imports seen down 10.0 percent.

China posted a trade surplus of $32.59 billion for the month, down from $63.29 billion in January, the General Administration of Customs said on Tuesday.

NEW 2016 GROWTH TARGET ALREADY AT RISK?

After missing trade goals repeatedly in recent years, China's leaders did not give an estimate for trade growth in 2016 when they set out key economic targets in parliament on Saturday, reflecting deep uncertainty about global demand.

Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng said last month that he was confident that China's trade conditions would stabilize and improve in 2016, though most analysts see no improvement in sight.

""The sharp drop in imports also shatters the hope that China is rolling out a stimulus package that would boost the demand for commodities,"" said Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank in Singapore.

""The recent rally in bulk commodities, led by iron ore, might be only short-lived.""

Spot iron ore prices rocketed nearly 20 percent to the highest in more than eight months on Monday, buoyed by expectations that Chinese steel mills are planning an output boost ahead of an expected crackdown on air pollution.

China's iron ore imports rose 6.4 percent in Jan-Feb, though anti-dumping measures are squeezing steelmakers who are trying to keep mills running by increasing sales overseas.

Goldman Sachs, however, said the iron ore rally would not last in the absence of a significant improvement in Chinese domestic steel demand, sticking to its bearish take on one of this year's biggest commodity comebacks.

China's leaders set an economic growth target of 6.5 percent to 7 percent for 2016 as they opened the annual session of parliament last week, compared with 6.9 percent last year, the country's slowest expansion in a quarter of a century.

As part of efforts to stimulate activity, policymakers have proposed raising the 2016 fiscal deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product, from 2015's budgeted 2.3 percent.

Economists also expect further reductions this year in interest rates and the amount of money that banks must hold in reserve, extending a year-long stimulus blitz. In late February, the central bank cut bank reserve ratio requirements, releasing an estimated $100 billion in cash for lending.

""Overall, today's trade data, together with high-frequency data and leading indicators, suggest that growth momentum weakened further in January-February,"" economists from Japanese bank Nomura said in a research note.

""We maintain our forecast of real GDP growth slowing to 5.8 percent in 2016 from 6.9 percent in 2015.""

Premier Li Keqiang acknowledged in parliament on Saturday that leaders face ""a tough battle"" to keep the economy growing by at least 6.5 percent over the next five years, while pushing hard to create more jobs and restructuring state-owned enterprises.

Having grown up in an educated family in cosmopolitan Karachi, her life couldnt have been more different than the subject of her latest documentary, the Oscar-winning A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness.

The documentary, which premiered on HBO Monday night, follows the story of 19-year-old Saba Qaiser from rural Punjab, whose father and uncle tried to kill her after she married a man without their approval.

The film and the award prompted lots of conversation in Pakistan on honour killings, where brothers, fathers or uncles murder women to protect their family honour.

I think this Oscar and the recognition that comes with it is the first step towards driving the conversation in the right direction, said Obaid-Chinoy, 37, speaking by telephone from Karachi.

More than 500 men and women died in honour killings in 2015, according to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. Most of these killings did not result in prosecutions.

After the win, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who screened the movie at his home, reiterated that his government was pushing a law to stop such killings.

As a filmmaker, thats the biggest reward  to see the tremendous change you can bring about in your country, said Obaid-Chinoy, who won her first Academy award in 2012 for directing Saving Face a film on the horrors endured by women who suffer acid attacks in Pakistan.

The director came across Sabas story in a local newspaper. She found the victim, who was recuperating from a bullet wound in a hospital in Gujranwala. In interviews with Sabas family, the documentary reveals how the teenager had no support from anyone, including her mother and sister. They think Saba got what she deserved for bringing dishonour upon their family and making them outcasts.



The biggest challenge I had in making this documentary was not in dealing with the authorities or the police. It was countering the mindset of the people in Pakistani society who think its OK to kill someone in the name of honour, Obaid-Chinoy said.

Sabas father and uncle, who were in jail when Obaid-Chinoy was filming, were defiant. Maqsood, her father, repeatedly defends himself in Punjabi. Im an honorable man. I was obliged to do it. Maqsood says he would have tried to kill Sabas husband had their paths crossed.

Obaid-Chinoy argues with Maqsood. In that powerful moment, she emerges as a woman first and a journalist second  as someone who cannot stand by as Maqsood justifies his action on honour and on Islam. Its a reminder of how far some people in some nations have to go toward acknowledging that women should be able to fall in love and marry without fearing for their lives, and an especially potent one as the world marks International Womens Day on Tuesday.

SKOPJE Macedonia has closed its border completely to illegal migrants after Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia announced tight new restrictions on migrant entry, a police official said on Wednesday.

Thousands of migrants have built up on the Greek side of the Macedonian border. Macedonia had been allowing small numbers of Syrians and Iraqis through but stopped this after its neighbours tightened up their policies.

""We have completely closed the border,"" the police official, who declined to be named, told Reuters.

According to the Macedonian Interior Ministry, no migrants entered from Greece on Tuesday.

""Macedonia will act according to the decisions taken by other countries on the Balkan route,"" an Interior Ministry spokesman said, referring to the main routes taken by more than a million migrants to reach the European Union over the last year.

Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia said on Tuesday they would place new restrictions on the entry of migrants. The decisions were announced hours after EU leaders outlined an agreement intended to end a mass movement to reach wealthy countries in Europe from war zones.

Croatia's Interior Minister Vlaho Orepic told a news conference on Wednesday in Zagreb that the new decision meant reestablishing of a ""regular border regime"".

""The essence of this is to firmly stick to a regular border regime and to be ready to react to any exceptional circumstances,"" Orepic said. He added that talks were proceeding on return of 408 migrants, currently stranded in a camp in Croatia, to Greece.

Around 1,000 migrants remain stranded in a refugee camp on the Macedonian side of the Serbian border while more than 400 are stranded in ""No Man's Land"" between Serbia and Macedonia. They refuse to go back to Macedonia and are not being allowed to cross in to Serbia.

Florida lawmakers on Wednesday gave the thumbs-up to living together without being married, sending to the governor a bill repealing the state's Reconstruction-era ban on cohabitation by unmarried couples.

The old law made it illegal to ""lewdly and lasciviously"" live together without being married to each other - language that presumably differentiated between romantic couples sharing a bed and non-romantic roommates splitting the rent.

In either case, sponsors said, it is a law that is impossible to enforce but dangerous to have on the books.

""You shouldn't have statutes that are not being enforced,"" said state Representative Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda, a Tallahassee Democrat and bill sponsor. ""You'd have to arrest a half-million people, if we enforced this.""

The repeal statute leaves in place a section of the 1868 law making it a misdemeanor to engage ""in open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior,"" regardless of marital status.

It is difficult to determine if anyone gets arrested for cohabitation, since the offense is combined in the state with public lewdness, said Rehwinkel Vasilinda, a law school instructor.

But the law ""could be used in a discriminatory manner"" if a jealous ex-spouse or prosecutor wanted to harass a person or unmarried couple, she said.

The cohabitation ban is the latest in a string of antiquated and rarely-if-ever-enforced sex laws being repealed across the country - either by new laws, referendum, or court action, the most notable being bans on same-sex intercourse struck down by the courts in recent years.

If Florida's repeal passes the governor's muster, only Mississippi and Michigan will be the holdouts on laws requiring couples to marry before sharing roof and bed, according to a staff analysis of the Florida bill.

The bill was also sponsored by state Senator Eleanor Sobel, a Hollywood Democrat.

The repeal earned the overwhelming support of the Florida lawmakers, with a unanimous vote in the state Senate and five dissenters in the House.

Among them was Representative Jennifer Sullivan, a Republican from Mount Dora, who said she ""ran on a pro-family platform"" and could not vote to legalize cohabitation.

""Based on my own faith and what I believe, I voted accordingly,"" she said. ""My faith affects everything I do and who I am, so I'm just being consistent with who I said I was as a candidate.""

Creative director Karl Lagerfeld's frequently spectacular sets at Paris Fashion Week are well known but the 82-year old designer opted for a paired-down dressing room feel this season, all plush cream carpets and walls of mirrors. The twist was that all the guests were seated on the front row of the lengthy catwalk; gone were the banks of benches to be replaced by rows of gold chairs which brought the people closer to the clothes. Lagerfeld said that people would not complain as they would be able to see every detail. On international women's day, Lagerfeld's women were ready to take on the world -- impractical footwear was banished in favour of flat riding boots, their two sections held together with laces. And with a half-mile march from one end of the runway to the other, the flat shoes came in handy. The designer has also decided that hats are back. His padded boaters were everywhere in colours ranging from fuschia to black, in leather and tweed but Lagerfeld said they were meant to be functional, not fussy. The collection opened with a parade in pink -- hot, fuschia and lavender -- with Chanel's classic tweed suits renewed with deconstructed fringes and denim details. Away from the suits, the collection was not classic Autumn/Winter, with silky floral prints and layered peasant dresses topped with pearls. Also joining Williams at the show were Willow Smith and her mother Jada Pinkett Smith, as well as French actress Isabelle Huppert.",[]

Adopting a single IT platform marks a further step in the integration of the two companies, allowing them and individual client brands to monitor available stocks online and in-store as well as facilitate deliveries.

Yoox Net-a-Porter said IBM's Order Management software would help it deliver the stock synergies announced when the merger was agreed, which in turn would lead to higher sell-though and retail margins.

However, the IBM deal, whose financial details were not disclosed, is partly why Net-a-Porter (NAP) has lost key IT staff in recent months to rivals such as Amazon and Farfetch, sources close to the company told Reuters.

NAP technology chief Hugh Fahy, for example, left last month to become chief technology officer at Internet retailer Not-on-the-high-street.

The sources said that while IBM's technology allowed for the creation of a harmonized IT platform, it was also available to all retailers and therefore hardly a differentiating factor in what has become a highly competitive market.

Some of the IT people who left NAP said IBM systems did not allow them to be as creative in terms of applications and functionalities as the company's in-house systems. It also meant the job in the coming months was going to be more about integrating existing systems than creating new ones.

""It is like hiring carpenters to put together an Ikea cupboard,"" one of the sources said.

NAP said the departures were part of the normal process associated with mergers.

Yoox NAP said the IBM platform would free up time for IT services team to focus on innovation and the development of bespoke e-commerce solutions.

""This will enable us to speed up innovation and create a group level platform,"" said Alex Alexander, Yoox NAP's chief information officer, a systems integration specialist who worked at Barclays bank and joined last year from retailer Wal-Mart, where he designed an omni-channel strategy for its UK unit Asda.

Yoox NAP said it was hiring more than 100 staff, split between Bologna and London to expand its IT team.

SHANGHAI China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) on Thursday said it has signed a deal for a $3 billion five-year loan, which will help the e-commerce giant as it snaps up stakes in companies within China and overseas.

Alibaba, led by founder Jack Ma, has been expanding in areas beyond its core e-commerce base, such as online video, as volume growth in its online shopping business slows.

The firm said in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it had signed the syndicated loan deal with a group of eight lead arrangers. It added that the amount could increase if there was steep demand.

""The loan, which is subject to upsize through oversubscriptions in syndication, has a five-year bullet maturity and is priced at 110 basis points over LIBOR,"" the company said in the filing, referring to the benchmark interest rate used by many global banks when making loans.

Alibaba added that the loan would be used for ""general corporate purposes"", without expanding on what this meant.

The Wall Street Journal cited sources last month saying Alibaba was in talks with several banks to borrow up to $4 billion to fund expansion plans, including acquisitions.

NEW YORK Oil prices rose as much as 5 percent on Wednesday, with U.S. crude hitting three-month highs after a big gasoline inventory drawdown amid improving demand overshadowed growing record high crude stockpiles.

Speculation that top producers might agree soon to an output freeze also supported crude oil.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled up $1.42, or about 4 percent, at $41.07 a barrel.

U.S. crude futures CLc1 finished up $1.79, or 5 percent, at $38.29 a barrel after hitting a three-month high of $38.51.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude stockpiles USOILC=ECI rose 3.9 million barrels last week to reach nearly 522 million barrels, in its fourth week of building to record highs.[EIA/S]

But gasoline inventories USOILG=ECI fell 4.5 million barrels, nearly triple forecasts, in the largest weekly draw in almost two years.

U.S. gasoline demand over past four weeks was 7 percent higher than a year ago, the EIA said.

""Gasoline is the star of the show today,"" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at New York-headquartered energy data provider ClipperData. ""Ongoing strength in demand has yielded a large draw to gasoline inventories despite a rebound in refinery runs.""

U.S. gasoline futures RBc1 hit six-month highs, rallying 6 percent. The crack spread for gasoline 1RBc1-CLc1, a measure of profit margin refiners get for turning a barrel of crude into the motor fuel, scaled seven-month highs.

Oil has gained about 50 percent from 12-year lows hit less than two months ago, since OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Venezuela, along with non-OPEC exporter Russia, pledged to leave supply at January's levels if others cooperated.

Some analysts said the rally was excessive.

""We feel that values could consolidate well into next week or longer, prior to enough momentum shift to force an ultimate $9-10 crude price cut,"" said Jim Ritterbusch at Chicago-based oil advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates.

Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said it expected this year's average price of crude to be lower than last year's, reflecting the glut.

Oil rallied earlier in the day after an Iraqi oil official told a state newspaper that producers in and outside of OPEC plan to meet in Moscow on March 20 to discuss the output freeze. Russia's energy ministry, however, said no date or place had been set.

Credit ratings agency Moody's warned of more output declines if oil producers defaulted on debt because of low prices. Reuters exclusively reported that Saudi Arabia was seeking its first significant foreign borrowing in over a decade to help cover a record budget deficit from weak crude prices.

Skopje/Budapest/Didim Zwei Tage nach dem EU-Turkei-Gipfel zur Losung der Fluchtlingskrise haben mehrere Balkan-Staaten den Weg fur Hilfesuchende nach Norden vollstandig versperrt.

Gleichzeitig registrierten turkische Behorden am Mittwoch an der Agais-Kusteeinen Ansturm von Fluchtlingen, die offenbar vor Inkrafttreten des Abkommens nach Griechenland ubersetzen wollten. In Deutschland und im Europa-Parlament hielt die Kritik an den geplanten Vereinbarungen zwischen der Europaischen Union und der Turkei an, die kommende Woche besiegelt werden sollen.

Mazedonien schloss nach Angaben eines Mitarbeiters der Polizei seine Grenzen vollstandig fur Fluchtlinge, nachdem es in den Tagen zuvor noch eine kleine Anzahl von Syrern und Irakern ins Land gelassen hatte. Das Land folgte dem Beispiel Sloweniens und Serbiens, die keine Durchreise von Fluchtlingen auf dem Weg nach Deutschland oder anderen nordeuropaischen Staaten mehr zulassen wollen.

UNGARN ERWAGT BAU EINES NEUEN GRENZZAUNS IM SUDEN

Auch Ungarn verscharfte seine Fluchtlingspolitik und kundigte an, mehr Soldaten und Polizisten an seine Sudgrenze zu schicken. Die Regierung werde Vorbereitungen treffen, um an der Grenze zu Rumanien, das im Sudosten an Ungarn stot, notfalls rasch einen Zaun errichten zu konnen, sagte Innenminister Sandor Pinter. Ungarn hatte vor einigen Monaten bereits an der Grenze zu Serbien und Kroatien einen Zaun gezogen.

In Brussel dankte EU-Ratsprasident Donald Tusk fur die Schlieung der Grenzen. ""Der irregulare Strom von Migranten uber die Westbalkanroute ist zu einem Ende gekommen"", twitterte er. ""Das ist keine Frage einseitiger Manahmen, sondern von gemeinsamen Beschlussen der 28 EU-Staaten."" Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel hatte allerdings gemahnt, es durfe nicht Ziel sein, mit einseitigen Grenzschlieungen nur einigen Landern zu helfen. Ziel musse vielmehr sein, mit dem Schutz der EU-Auengrenzen allen Mitgliedstaaten nachhaltig zu helfen. Tusk erklarte nun, er danke den Landern des Westbalkans dafur, die gemeinsame Strategie der EU in Teilen umzusetzen, um mit der Fluchtlingskrise umzugehen.

Die Turkei hatte bei dem EU-Gipfel in Brussel angeboten, alle in Griechenland ankommenden Migranten zuruckzunehmen. Fur jeden zuruckgefuhrten Syrer soll ein anderer syrischer Fluchtling von der EU direkt aus der Turkei aufgenommen werden. Als Gegenleistung erwartet die Regierung in Ankara mehr Geld von der EU, Visa-Freiheit fur seine Burger und deutlich schnellere Beitrittsverhandlungen zur EU.

VIELE FLUCHTLINGE SUCHEN WEG NACH GRIECHENLAND

Die Plane brachten offenbar viele Menschen dazu, in Richtung Griechenland aufzubrechen, um dem erwarteten Inkrafttreten des Abkommens zuvorzukommen. Die turkische Kustenwache nahm mehrere Dutzend Fluchtlinge in Gewahrsam, die in Hohlen an der Kuste auf die Uberfahrt warteten. Eine Gruppe von 42 Migranten, darunter uber ein Dutzend Kinder, war bereits auf ein Gelande der Kustenwache im Ferienort Didim gebracht und mit Decken versorgt worden. An einem anderen Kustenabschnitt wurde eine groe Anzahl von Fluchtlingen von Polizisten bewacht, wahrend sie auf Busse warteten, die sie wegbringen sollten. Auf See fing ein Boot der Kustenwache einen kleinen Frachter ab, der offenkundig Fluchtlinge nach Griechenland bringen sollte. Noch wahrend die Fluchtlinge festgenommen wurden, erreichten neue Hilfesuchende Didim per Taxi.

In Deutschland pochte die CSU darauf, die geplante Visa-Befreiung fur Turken an die Einstufung des Landes als sicheren Herkunftsstaat koppeln. Das wurde die Abschiebung turkischer Fluchtlinge in ihr Heimatland erleichtern. Im EU-Parlament erklarte der Vorsitzende der Liberalen-Fraktion, Guy Verhofstadt, er empfinde das geplante Abkommen als grotenteils problematisch. Kritik kam auch von Grunen und Linken. ""Wir schlieen einen Deal mit einem Land, das bereit ist, Menschen im eigenen Land zu toten"", sagte Linken-Fraktionschefin Gabi Zimmer mit Blick auf das Vorgehen der turkischen Armee gegen kurdische Rebellen. Die Menschenrechtsorganisation Amnesty International kritisierte das geplante Abkommen als Todessto fur das Recht auf Asyl.",[]

WASHINGTON The director of the Google self-driving car project and auto industry executives will testify before Congress next week on efforts to develop safe and effective autonomous cars.

Senator John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, said on Tuesday that Chris Urmson, director of self-driving cars at Alphabet Inc unit Google, will testify at on March 15.

Urmson will testify alongside executives from General Motors Co, Delphi Automotive PLC and privately held ride-hailing service Lyft Inc to talk about ""advancements in autonomous vehicle technology and its anticipated benefits for Americans,"" the committee said.

In January, Detroit-based GM said it would invest $500 million in Lyft Inc and laid out plans to develop an on-demand network of self-driving cars with the ride-sharing service.

The committee wants witnesses' views ""on the appropriate role of government in promoting innovation including removing unnecessary hurdles, and their strategy to grow consumer adoption of this new technology.""

Major automakers and technology companies are racing to develop and sell vehicles that can drive themselves, but they have complained that state and federal safety rules are impeding testing and ultimate deployment of such vehicles.

In January, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it may waive some vehicle safety rules to allow more driverless cars to operate on U.S. roads as part of a broader effort to speed up development of self-driving vehicles.

Safety regulators will write guidelines for self-driving cars within six months, Transporation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in January.

On Feb. 4, NHTSA said the artificial intelligence system piloting a self-driving Google car could be considered the driver under federal law, a major step toward ultimately winning approval for autonomous vehicles on the roads.

But Google said last month it bears ""some responsibility"" after one of its self-driving cars struck a municipal bus in Mountain View, California on Feb. 14.

The crash may be the first case of one of its autonomous cars hitting another vehicle and the fault of the self-driving car. The Mountain View-based Internet search leader said it made changes to its software after the crash to avoid future incidents.

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir delivers a statement after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry at the State Department in Washington, February 8, 2016.

CAIRO/RIYADH A Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said on Wednesday it had exchanged prisoners with its Houthi opponents and also welcomed a pause in combat on the border, prompting hopes of a push to end the year-long war that has killed some 6,000 people.

Riyadh's confirmation of a rare confidence-building measure in the conflict came a day after senior Yemeni officials said a delegation from the Houthis, who are allies of the kingdom's arch foe Iran, was in Saudi Arabia for talks to end the war.

However, both the Saudi Arabian and Yemeni foreign ministers later said any formal negotiations to end the fighting could only take place under the auspices of the United Nations and must include Yemen's internationally recognized government.

Riyadh and a coalition of Arab states entered Yemen's civil war a year ago in an attempt to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi after the Houthis and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh ousted him from power.

The Saudi state news agency SPA said Yemeni tribal mediators had facilitated the exchange of a Saudi lieutenant captured by the Houthis for seven Yemeni prisoners held in the kingdom.

The agency gave no further details, but some Yemeni media have reported that the exchange happened on the border between the two countries earlier this week.

Quoting a Saudi statement, SPA also said: ""The leadership of the coalition forces welcomed the continuation of a state of calm along the border ... which contributes to arriving at a political solution.""

After meeting his Gulf Arab and Yemeni counterparts, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said he backed U.N. special envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed's efforts to resolve the crisis based on U.N. resolution 2216, which calls on the Houthis to return power to Hadi's government.

However, he added in a news conference that the lull was important to deliver aid and medical supplies to people in northern regions of Yemen.

Saleh's General People's Congress party said in a statement it supported any efforts to bring peace to Yemen.

HOUTHIS SNUB IRAN

Yemen's conflict has fallen into a stalemate, in which the Houthis still control the capital Sanaa and other major cities in central Yemen, while its guerrilla forces have shelled and harassed Saudi forces along the rugged northern frontier.

In what could be a goodwill message to Saudi Arabia, a senior Houthi official sought to distance his group from Riyadh's main regional foe Tehran, telling Iranian officials in a Facebook posting to stay out of Yemen's conflict.

""Officials in the Islamic Republic of Iran must be silent and leave aside the exploitation of the Yemen file,"" said Yousef al-Feshi, a member of the Revolutionary Committee which runs areas of Yemen held by the Houthis.

Asked about the posting, Jubeir said he had not seen it but that it appeared to be a ""positive"" statement.

Sunni power Saudi Arabia has long accused Shi'ite Iran of trying to expand its influence in Yemen by helping the Houthis, who hail from the Zaydi branch of Shi'ite Islam.

The comments by Feshi, who is seen as close to the Houthis' overall leader Abdel-Malek al-Houthi, were the first snub by the group to Iran, long seen as its main supporter.

On Tuesday, Brigadier General Masoud Jazayeri, deputy chief of staff of Iran's armed forces, suggested that Tehran could send military advisers to help the Houthis in Yemen just as it has done in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad's forces.

The coalition spokesman, Brigadier General Ahmed al-Asseri, said Yemeni tribal chiefs had asked for a period of calm to let humanitarian supplies pass through but he declined to be drawn into commenting on the reported visit by a Houthi delegation.

""It is too early to focus on those who are carrying out this role,"" Asseri told the Saudi-owned al-Arabiya TV. ""Let's focus on the result, that there be benefit to our brothers who are affected by what the Houthi militias are carrying out. We do not want to talk about individuals.""

Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdelmalek al-Mekhlafi said the talks in Saudi Arabia were ""on the intelligence level about prisoners and other issues"", adding that peace talks could only happen in accordance with the U.N. resolution.

""This is the only way forward with political negotiations. Anything else is operational and not political,"" Mekhlafi said after the meeting with his Gulf Arab counterparts in Riyadh.

reuters.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,Do you suffer from Russophobia? The Kremlin thinks you might.,"['Posted Smarynakurskaya', 'Posted Paulharper', 'Lucian Kim Is A Berlin-based Journalist Who Has Covered The Ukraine Conflict For Slate Newsweek Buzzfeed He Previously Worked As A Correspondent For Bloomberg News In Moscow The Christian Science Monitor In Berlin', 'Posted No_apartheid', 'Posted Radfo', 'Posted Laster', 'Lucian Kim', ""Any Opinions Expressed Here Are The Author's Own"", 'Posted Danram', 'Posted Jundi']","If Russian officials are to be believed, the reason people worry about what Russia might do next is because they suffer from Russophobia, an irrational fear of all things Russian.

In February, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov assailed the fashion of Russophobia in certain capitals during a visit to Germany. Then Russias defense ministry accused General Philip Breedlove of Russophobia. The commander of U.S. forces in Europe had testified that the United States and its allies were deterring Russia now and preparing to fight and win if necessary following the Kremlins military adventures in Ukraine and Syria.

Russophobe has become a convenient label for anyone who disagrees with Russian President Vladimir Putins aggressive behavior at home and abroad. You are not criticizing an authoritarian leader and his erratic policies; you are instead attacking the Russian nation.

Russias state media churns out reports on how enemies are tirelessly seeking to isolate the country  when in fact it is Putins own actions that are closing off Russia.

When I first visited Moscow as a college student 25 years ago, the Soviet Union was in its last year of existence. Kremlin reformer Mikhail Gorbachev was opening up the country after more than seven decades of communism, and Russians were hungry to rejoin the world. Goodwill, curiosity and hope were the overriding feelings among Russians and Americans alike. My host parents in Moscow even displayed a picture of then-President George H.W. Bush in their living room.

The Cold War was finally over. I was fascinated by the parallel world that had existed behind the Iron Curtain and shocked by the deprivations that people endured. Later, as a journalist based in Moscow, I would encounter dozens of Russians who welcomed me into their homes and hearts. It helped, of course, that I tried my damnedest to speak Russian. But it never hurt to be American. Often it was an advantage.

My initial interest in Russia led me to explore other countries that had belonged to the Soviet empire: Ukraine, Poland, the Baltic states, the Central Asian republics. Although anti-Russian rhetoric has cheapened the political discourse in those places, the Russian language is still widely understood, if not actively used. Given their difficult history with Russia, eastern European countries viewed membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a prudent defensive measure. Putins surprise attack on Ukraine proved them right.

To me, the folly of Russophobia became most obvious in Ukraine. Most of my Ukrainian friends speak Russian as their first language, and many have parents or grandparents from Russia. They arent afraid of Russia but of its revanchist, autocratic government.

The crux of the problem between Russia and its former satellites is that nationalism was the driving force behind the independence movements that split apart the Soviet Union. Estonians, Lithuanians and Georgians knew who they were and what they wanted: their own countries.

But from Russians perspective, it looked like their neighbors were abandoning them. Russians never had to liberate themselves from the Soviet Union: They just woke up one day in its ideological ruins. Not surprisingly, Russian nationalism today ties together a jumble of monarchist, Orthodox Christian and communist strands.

The appeal of Russophobia isnt just based on resentment about the breakup of an empire. Its also rooted in the frustration that the Western model of governance proved a more attractive way of running a country.

Putin, now in his 17th year of ruling Russia, is preoccupied with regime survival. Thats one reason the Kremlin is working so hard to discredit liberal democracy as a system of government. Telling Russians to fear the West because the West hates Russia is a way of distracting the population from the deficiencies of one-man rule.

Ever since my first visit to Russia in 1991, Russians have asked me why I decided to learn their language and travel to their country. People were incredulous that an American without any Russian roots could be so interested in their country.

My answer was simple: the mellifluous Russian language, the richness of Russian literature, the vastness of the countrys geography and the diversity of its peoples. It was all about what Russians themselves call the Russian soul  a generosity of spirit and a knack for improvisation amid adversity.

In their bluster about a brave new Russky Mir (Russian world) to redeem the perceived humiliations of the past, Russias current rulers are putting their own insecurities on full display. In the process, they have squandered the countrys greatest resource, which isnt oil and gas but Russias enormous soft power.

Ironically, the biggest Russophobes inhabit Russias highest political offices. They are the people who believe the essentialist argument that the Russian people are too immature for real democracy and can only be ruled by a strong leader.

Russophobia isnt an international problem. Its a domestic one.",[]

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said on Wednesday it had signed a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA.N) 767 widebody freighter aircraft to handle more of its own deliveries in the United States.

The deal comes at a time when the world's biggest online retailer is offering ever-faster, and increasingly free, deliveries for millions of online orders.

Amazon, which relies on carriers like United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) to deliver most of its packages, spent $11.5 billion on shipping last year.

In a bid to assume more control over its supply chain and reduce costs, Amazon has rolled out thousands of trailers and launched a program that uses contract drivers to deliver fast orders.

But analysts said the long-rumored plan to build its own air fleet posed little threat to the leading delivery companies.

""This is an incremental negative for FDX and UPS as it will likely remove some higher yielding express freight and parcel volume from each of the respective networks,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst John Barnes wrote in a client note.

UPS, the world's No. 1 package delivery company, operates about 240 large planes while FedEx has a fleet of about 370, Barnes noted. FedEx and UPS shares were down about 1.5 percent.

FedEx said on Wednesday the announcement was not a surprise and called Amazon a valuable customer.

""We work closely with Amazon and have been aware for some time about their need for supplemental air capacity related to inventory management,"" said Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications at FedEx.

The leased planes will start to go into operation on April 1, Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email.

Amazon has been testing deliveries by drones but has not said when they would be in service.

The duration of the leases will be five to seven years, lessor Air Transport Services Group Inc (ATSG.O) said.

As part of the agreement, Amazon has the right to buy up to 19.9 percent of ATSG's stock over five years at $9.73 per share.

ATSG's stock soared almost 27 percent to a record high of $14.90, before paring gains to about 16 percent.

The contract is the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement, which divided up most of the Arab lands that had been under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. The world that document created exists now only on yellowed maps, and the issues left unsettled  primarily the need for separate Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish territories  have come home begging. War is not fixing this; diplomacy might.

In November 2014, I wrote the only solution to Islamic State was to use American peacekeepers to create a stable, tri-state solution to the Sunni-Shiite-Kurd divide inside Iraq.

However, in the intervening 15 months, Turkey and Russia entered the fight, and the Saudis may soon join the fray. Meanwhile, the United States and its allies  as well as Iraq, Islamic State and Iran  never left. Only a massive diplomatic effort, involving all parties now on the playing field, including Islamic State, has any potential of ending the bloodshed. That means a redivision of the region along current ethnic, tribal, religious and political lines.

A new Sykes-Picot Agreement, if you will.

The old Sykes-Picot Agreement was enforced by the superpowers of the day, Britain and France, with buy-in from Russia. The immediate aim was colonialism; the long-term goal stability, following the massive realignment of power that was World War One. The lines were literally drawn for the next nine decades.

Another important goal of the era, creating Kurdistan, never actually happened. The 1920 Treaty of Sevres left an opening for a referendum on Kurdish independence. Problem one: the referendum only included plans for Kurds outside of Syria and Iraq. Problem two: the referendum never happened, a victim of fighting that saw the Turkish people separate themselves from the remains of the Ottoman Empire and fight for two years to prevent the dismantling of what is now modern Turkey. The result was 20 million Kurds scattered across parts of modern Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Syria.

From a geopolitical perspective, heres what we have now: the 2003 invasion of Iraq blew open the struggle among the Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. It unleashed the forces behind some of the Arab Spring-driven chaos in Syria, and drew Iran deep into the Iraqi conflict. Shiite militia and Iraqi government attacks on Sunnis opened the door for Islamic State to step in as their protector.

The struggle metastasized into the ongoing, broader conflict. The Kurds are expanding the land they control, out of Iraq, and into Turkish and Syrian territory. The Turks look to repel that effort, and perhaps seize some territory to tidy up their own border with Syria. Russia has re-entered the region as a military force. The Saudis may yet send in troops. Iran is already there via proxy forces. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad still holds territory, but only alongside Islamic State. The United States is training, assisting and equipping groups often fighting each other.

That all has led to human suffering on a genocidal scale, including refugee flows no one seems sure how best to handle. The ongoing effort to bomb away the problems has resulted in destroying cities like Ramadi, Kobane, Homs, and soon Mosul, in order to save them. Four American presidents have made war in the region without concrete results, and Obamas successor will be number five.

The only answer left, the one not yet tried, is to negotiate a comprehensive resolution that addresses all of the issues, borders and struggles now underway. That resolution will need to be enforced with military power coordinated by the United States, Russia and Iran, with each speaking for, and agreeing to corral, its proxies.

It will mean giving Islamic State a seat at the table, as the British were forced to do with the Irish Republican Army in the 1990s to resolve the troubles in Northern Ireland. One, by definition, must negotiate peace with ones enemies. That is why, in part, the current ceasefire in Syria, which excluded Islamic State, has little chance of achieving any long-term progress.

Out of the new negotiations will have to emerge a Kurdistan, with land from Turkey, Iraq, perhaps Iran, and Syria. Assad will stay in power as a Russian proxy. Irans hold on Shiite Iraq will strengthen. A Sunni homeland, to include the political entity Islamic State will morph into, will need to be assured via a strict hands-off policy by Baghdad.

That Sunni homeland offers the first real way to geographically contain Islamic State. There obviously is risk in overtly allowing Islamic State to continue to exist, though that lives alongside the questions of whether it can be militarily destroyed, or if another group will simply take its place, as Islamic State did with al Qaeda in Iraq. These groups are symptoms of the broader Sunni-Shiite problem, not problems of their own per se.

The payoff of such a broad resolution will be a measure of stability, and a framework to enforce it. American efforts will shift from fanning the flames (American weapons are as ubiquitous as iPhones in the region) to putting out fires.

At risk for not acting: an empowered Islamic State, thriving on more chaos. An explosive dissolution of Iraq. A Russian-Turkish fight that could involve NATO. The shift from a Saudi-Iranian proxy war to a straightforward conflict between the two countries. A spark that forces Israel to act. A mini-world war, in the worlds most flammable region, that will create its own unexpected and uncontrolled realignment of power, and leave behind a warehouse of the dead.

Yes, I hate it, too. It is a very imperfect resolution. But an elegant solution is no longer viable.",[]

IDOMENI, Greece Six-day-old Asima lies on her back a few metres away from a line of public toilets used by crowds of refugees and migrants stranded at a muddy border outpost in northern Greece.

She is one of the youngest of thousands of children trapped in what aid workers say is a petri dish of filth and festering infections, as European leaders work out what to do with the growing masses fleeing conflict zones and heading to Europe.

Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) says there are at least 40 pregnant women in Idomeni camp on the Macedonian border, and 40 percent of its population are children.

There are many babies at the camp, and they are vulnerable to respiratory infections, said Christian Reynders, deputy coordinator for MSF at Idomeni.

""Refugees set fires at night to keep their families warm. They burn everything, wood, plastic bags, old clothes. The smoke is toxic and we are afraid that respiratory infection especially for newborn babies might create permanent problems to their breathing system,"" he added.

MSF doctors see about 60 children a day suffering from the results of the humidity and smoke, he said.

By the latest count, there were about 36,000 refugees and migrants stranded in Greece on Wednesday, their plans to travel further north blocked by border shutdowns throughout the Balkans.

Asimas Syrian mother gave birth in the town of Kilkis, about 40 km (25 miles) away from the camp which has sprouted up in muddy meadows.

But she then promptly returned, waiting with at least 13,000 others to cross a frontier which now appears permanently shut.

A nurse from the 'Arsis' charity changes Asimas nappy, saying she knows of at least five infants stuck in squalid conditions.

""I few minutes ago we had a three-month-old baby in who only weighed three kilos, the nurse said, less than half the usual weight for that age.

""A few days after giving birth their parents bring them back to the camp. They are afraid of losing their place to cross the borders. Many are malnourished.

Sarala, in her early twenties, has been living there for 19 days, in a tiny tent covered in mud. She fled Idlib in Syria with her daughter, then 15 days old. She crossed into Greece about a month ago and wants to go to Germany.

The baby is wearing a pink babygrow also spattered with mud.

""Ill stay at the camp until Macedonia open the borders,"" she told Reuters. She wouldnt contemplate leaving for better conditions elsewhere. ""I was one of the first to arrive at Idomeni. I don't want to lose an opportunity to pass"".

Its just that he wanted to be president  so she was going to do her utmost to make sure Ronnie got the chance.

In their 50-plus-year marriage, they never stopped dating. It was a lifelong continuation of their first meeting. For they met on a blind date, when he was the president of the Screen Actors Guild and her name had mistakenly showed up on a list of suspected communists in Hollywood.

Since her death on Sunday at age 94, many have commented they never saw any two people more in love than Nancy and Ronald Reagan. I thought the same. Their love and devotion constituted one of the great marriages of the American presidency. They always slept together in the same bed  and would have scoffed had someone suggested otherwise. They wrote love letters to each other. They served as a great balm to each other, becoming better people as each drew strength in the others presence.

She saw herself as his strongest advocate. Yet the serious advice she gave was invariably in private. One key reason that would prompt her to act was if she felt her husband was being ill-served by those around him. She felt his sunny optimism might keep him from grasping dangers around him.

It was pragmatic matters of personnel, rather than policy, that most often drew her attention. Nancy Reagan had originally suggested, for example, that her husband hire the Republican strategist John Sears, who had worked with President Richard M. Nixon. But when she decided that Sears was ineffective as Reagans 1980 presidential campaign manager, she began trying, at first tentatively, to fire him.

Later, as she developed more confidence in her judgment, Nancy Reagan played a major role in the ouster of Donald Regan from his job as White House chief of staff. As the Iran-Contra scandal played out during Reagans second term, she saw Regans actions as hurting rather than helping her husband.

She looked out for her husbands interests  personal as well as professional. Particularly after the 1981 assassination attempt, Nancy Reagan was vigilant when it came to her husbands health. And her efforts were proactive, as well as reactive.

For she knew that her husbands optimistic outlook might cause him to overlook physical dangers as well as professional. She worried even as Reagan enjoyed working at their California ranch well into his 70s. He would clear brush and often wanted, for example, to climb up onto the roof to fix it, or just clear it off. No matter how strongly she would caution him against it.

One afternoon, she needed to go into Santa Barbara, California, the nearest town, for some groceries. She warned Ronnie to stay safe while she was gone. She even told their ranch hand, Dennis Le Blanc, who was an old family friend, to make sure to keep Ronnie off the roof. Yet, she returned several hours later to find him, shirtless, up on the roof repairing tiles.

After Ronnie was stricken by Alzheimers, she tried to protect him here as well. She raised millions for Alzheimers research and fought to institute more stem-cell studies.

Perhaps her greatest role was in being her husbands protector and guide, as he descended into the abyss of Alzheimers. There was no glory in this, no media attention, no cheers of the crowd. Just a loving and tender wife caring for her loving and tender husband as he slipped inexorably away, away from the limelight.

Meanwhile, she was taking steps to make sure he was not forgotten, particularly with the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, which has served to host many Republican presidential debates. She co-operated on books about him and encouraged the lectures and talks that celebrated Ronnies achievements.

At the last, though, they simply wanted to be alone, together.

And now they are.

Nancy Reagan, RIP.",[]

Some 14,000 people are stranded there after new border restrictions were imposed along the Balkan migration route. Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia said on Tuesday (March 8) they would place new restrictions on the entry of migrants and Macedonia responded on Wednesday by closing its border completely to illegal migrants, a police official said. Ai walked around the makeshift camp speaking with the migrants - seeing for himself the difficult conditions they have to brave as they wait to cross over to Macedonia and continue their trek northwards to wealthier European states. Ai, known for his criticism of China's human rights record, said he was witnessing a ""huge, big violation of human rights"" in the middle of Europe. ""What we have seen here is almost unbelievable, you know. If you say this is in the middle of Europe, all the people stuck here, and there's no hope for them even to be transferred to anywhere else, you know. It's just in the rain, in the cold, and women, children, all the people waiting for some bread, or some dry clothes, and this is a very sad situation and people have no hope because the door is closed, totally shut off. I think this is a huge, big violation of human rights, right in front of us. I don't know what is going to come out from this, but in Lesbos people still come in thousands every day, and here nobody tells them what to do, and they stay here, still having hope to go to Germany or some other location, but I think, as the sky is getting darker and I don't think there's much hope for them,"" he said. People fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and beyond have flooded into the EU since early 2015, most making the perilous sea crossing from Turkey to Greece, then heading north through the Balkans to Germany. But a cascade of border shutdowns in the Balkans has caused the blocking of the so-called 'Balkans corridor' used by more than a million people since the migratory wave started a year ago. More than 34,0000 people are now trapped on Greece's islands and mainland. At an emergency EU-Turkey summit on Monday (March 7), aimed to stem the migrant influx to Europe, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told leaders of the bloc Ankara was willing to take back all migrants who enter Europe from Turkey in future in return for financial aid, faster EU entry talks and quicker visa-free travel for its citizens. EU leaders aim to work out key details with Turkey by the next scheduled summit on March 17-18.

Facebook Inc is acquiring Masquerade Technologies Inc, creator of the popular face-swapping app MSQRD, as part of efforts by the world's largest social network operator to build its video services.

NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Mesfin Getahun, an Ethiopian living in a remote refugee camp on Kenya's northern border, earns $10,000 a month from his wholesale and retail business and employs more than 30 people.

After arriving in the camp 15 years ago, he worked as a restaurant cleaner, slowly saving money for his own business, which sells food and household goods.

""Being a refugee is not a reason for being unsuccessful in business and life,"" he told the United Nations, which profiled him as one of several successful entrepreneurs in the huge camp of Kakuma, home to some 180,000 refugees from the region.

""All it takes is dedication and the will to work hard to achieve one's dream.""

Mesfin is part of what aid workers hope will become a new breed of refugees who can provide for themselves, boost local economies and relieve the pressure on an aid system buckling under the unprecedented number of global emergencies.

The United Nations is appealing for $20 billion in humanitarian aid in 2016, five times the amount it sought a decade ago, for crises stretching from Syria to a dozen African nations hit by drought.

""It's not the case that finance and humanitarian resources to respond don't exist,"" said Pete Manfield, regional representative for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

""It's that we are not adequately working with others, particularly at the local level, to find where capacities exist that are not being used.""

Manfield was speaking at the launch on Tuesday of an online platform linking the private sector in East Africa with aid agencies and local government to improve the response to emergencies.

Aid groups hope greater private sector involvement will cut costs and improve access to conflict zones like Somalia.

""If Coke has access to deliver Coke and we can't get vaccines in, surely theres a discussion (to be had),"" said Manfield.

NEW MODEL

The United Nations is piloting the new model for private sector-refugee cooperation in Kalobeyei, a 15 square kilometre (5.8 square mile) extension planned for Kakuma, which has become congested since civil war broke out in South Sudan in 2013.

Permission to extend Kakuma came with conditions attached, said Raouf Mazou, country representative for the United Nations refugee agency.

""The challenge that was given to us by the governor of Turkana was to say: 'Don't do another refugee camp... Do something which will serve both the host population and the refugee population',"" Mazou said.

The United Nations has replaced some of the food aid ration with cash so that local businesses can sell their products to the refugees.

It hopes Kalobeyei will become an urban settlement, not a camp, where both refugees and locals can live, do business and get services like electricity, Mazou said.

Solar lighting company D.light, which sells lights for as little as $5, has joined the East Africa platform.

""There's an opportunity to really create a sustainable market for renewable energy in these places,"" said Kate Montgomery, the company's director of global partnerships, adding that $2.1 billion a year is spent on fuel for displaced people around the world.

Companies like Unilever and Safaricom, Kenya's leading mobile phone service provider, are already making a good profit in Kenya's camps.

The Kakuma branch of Equity Bank, the Kenyan bank which has the largest number of depositors in East Africa, has 50,000 customers, both refugees and locals.

RIGHT TO WORK

The East African initiative reflects the global challenge of providing for refugees at a time when a record 60 million people have fled their homes because of violence, oppression or drought.

Kenya hosts the second largest number of refugees on the African continent, some having arrived as long as 25 years ago. Legally, all refugees must live in camps and they cannot work.

With limited funding for protracted displacements, the United Nations has repeatedly cut food rations for refugees in Kenya.

There have been tensions between poor locals living around the camps, who often suffer drought and hunger, and the refugees who receive free food, healthcare and education.

""The majority of refugees if given an opportunity... could fend for themselves,"" said Mazou. ""The support we provide to refugees has to be limited and has to lead to self-reliance.""

Refugees who set up businesses are usually better at rebuilding their lives when they return home than those who have depended on aid for 20 years, he said.

The Kenyan government remains cautious, fearing the initiative could encourage refugees to settle permanently in Kenya, competing with locals for jobs and government services.

""When you create permanence, the whole mentality and psychology of being in a place is entrenched,"" Tom Amolo, Political and Diplomatic Secretary in the Foreign Affairs Ministry, said at the launch.

""We will work with you... but it will also not detract or remove the primary responsibility of international organisations to do their part.""

Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports

A manufacturing operator works at the Mildronate (Meldonium) medication packaging process in the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, November 23, 2010.

LONDON, The medicine Maria Sharapova says she has taken for 10 years due to a family history of heart issues and diabetes is an old drug sold in just a few Eastern European countries that can also boost exercise tolerance.

The tennis star tested positive for the banned drug meldonium, or Mildronate, in a sample taken on Jan. 26, the day of her Australian Open quarter finals defeat by Serena Williams.

She said her family doctor had first given her the drug 10 years ago after she frequently became sick, had irregular electrocardiogram results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.

The 28-year-old Russian, a five-time grand slam champion and the highest paid woman in sports, will be provisionally suspended from March 12, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said.

For the health conditions Sharapova says she has, however, doctors say the scientific evidence for Mildronate is limited compared with many medicines widely available in Europe and the United States, where Sharapova trains, which have full regulatory backing and years of robust safety and efficacy data.

LATVIAN DRUG

Meldonium is cheap and available over the counter without a prescription in some eastern European countries, where it is marketed as Mildronate by the Latvian pharmaceutical firm Grindeks (GRD1R.RI).

The drug, originally developed by scientists at the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, is not licensed by two of the world's biggest medicines regulators: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States and the EU's European Medicines Agency.

A spokeswoman for Grindeks said the firm had not applied for a licence for Mildronate from either the FDA or the EMA, but the drug is registered in Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union.

She said it is designed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular diseases, including angina, chronic heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other cardiovascular disorders.

Grindeks' also promotes it for people with reduced working capacity due to physical or psycho-emotional ""overload"", and during recovery from cerebrovascular disorders, head injury and encephalitis. It is not indicated for diabetes.

Tim Chico, a consultant cardiologist at Britain's Sheffield University, said it was unlikely that such a young and extremely fit woman would be suffering from a serious heart condition like angina, or would be able to play top level tennis if she were.

Asked how long the drug should be given to a patient, the Grindeks spokeswoman said in an emailed statement: ""Depending on the patient health condition, treatment course of meldonium preparations may vary from 4 to 6 weeks"". Such courses could be repeated two or three times in a year.

In an emailed reply to questions from Reuters about her medical reasons for using the drug, Sharapova's lawyer John Haggerty said: ""While I cannot go into detail out of respect for the ITF process, I can confirm that Ms Sharapova had abnormal EKG tests in 2006 and was also diagnosed with asthenia (a lack of energy or strength), decreased immunity and diabetes indicators.""

""She also had a family history of heart conditions,"" Haggerty said. ""The Mildronate and the other medicines recommended by her doctor treated these conditions.""

Latvia expressed sadness over the banning of the drug.

""It's sad that there is such a situation, that this drug has been banned,"" said a spokesman for Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis. ""Especially given that is one of the most significant accomplishments of Latvian scientists in general.""

Ivars Kalvins invented the drug in the 1970s when Latvia was still a Soviet republic. He told a local newspaper in 2009 that it had been used to boost troops' fighting stamina in the 1980s. At that time Soviet forces were in Afghanistan.

Kirovs Lipmans, chairman of Grindeks, said use of the drug did not constitute doping and criticised the government for not defending its reputation.

Munir Pirmohamed, a professor of molecular and clinical pharmacology at Britain's University of Liverpool, said the crucial issue with Mildronate for him is its lack of approval from EU and U.S. regulators.

""As a physician, this is not something I have, or would ever, prescribe,"" he said.

Others noted it was rare for a doctor treating illness to prescribe a drug that is unavailable in the country where the patient lives.

""Sharapova has been a U.S. resident since early in her career, which does bring in a question of how or why she is using a drug that is not licensed there,"" said Tom Bassindale, a lecturer in forensic science at Sheffield Hallam University.

Sharapova's agent Max Eisenbud was not available at his Miami office and did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

HELPS MUSCLES COPE

Whatever its medical benefits, research suggests Mildronate may have potential as a performance-enhancing drug for sports.

It reduces the level of a metabolite called carnetine in muscles, and by doing that helps muscles cope better with high levels of stress and low oxygen levels.

""Because it effects the cellular metabolism, it would increase energy production within cells and therefore make oxygen utilisation more efficient,"" said Pirmohamed.

In a 2010 academic paper published in a review journal called Seminars in Cardiovascular Medicine and cited on the Grindeks company website, it has been shown to improve exercise tolerance in patients with heart problems.

The World Anti-Doping Agency, which banned the drug in January after previously having it on a ""watch list"", ranks it as a prohibited metabolic modulator and cites ""evidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance"".

Grindeks says the drug could protect athletes from cell damage, but it would be unlikely to improve their competitive performance.

It would be ""reasonable to recommend (sports people) to use meldonium as a cell protector to avoid heart failure or muscle damage in case of unwanted overload,"" the spokeswoman said.

Athletes ""should not expect increase of physical capacity, but, for sure, they will be protected against ischemic damages of cells in case of overload.""

He was considered the most successful music producer ever, cited in the Guinness Book of Records for having more than 50 No. 1 hit records over five decades in the United States and Britain alone.

He helped score, arrange, and produce many of the band's biggest hits, including ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand,"" ""A Day in the Life"", Yesterday, ""Eleanor Rigby"" and ""Love Me Do"".

""Im so sad to hear the news of the passing of dear George Martin,"" Beatle Paul McCartney said in a statement on Wednesday.

""If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle it was George.""

A statement from Martin's family confirmed he had died peacefully at his home on Tuesday evening.

Earlier, Ringo Starr, the Beatles' drummer, had announced his death on Twitter: ""God bless George Martin peace and love to Judy and his family... George will be missed.""

Starr followed the message by posting a black and white photo of the Fab Four with Martin, saying ""Thank you for all your love and kindness George.""

Martin served as producer, collaborator and mentor to Beatles John Lennon, George Harrison, McCartney and Starr.

Lennon was shot dead in New York in 1980. Harrison died of cancer in 2001.

Tributes from the music world poured in on Twitter. ""RIP to my musical brother George Martin. We were friends since 1964, & I am so thankful 4 that gift,"" said American music producer Quincy Jones.

Lenny Kravitz said: ""The legends are really going home!"" Boy George said: ""George Martin. Gentleman and legend"", while Mark Ronson said Martin was ""the greatest British record producer of all time.""

Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron said on Twitter: ""George Martin was a giant of music - working with the Fab Four to create the world's most enduring pop music.""

""YESTERDAY""

During his seven-decade career in the music industry, Martin produced almost all of the Beatles' recordings and also worked with Gerry & the Pacemakers, Shirley Bassey, Cilla Black, Jeff Beck, America, Cheap Trick and other acts.

Martin started work at Abbey Road Studios in 1950 producing records for EMI's Parlophone label.

He was noted for his comedy recordings with the likes of Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Beyond the Fringe and got his first Number 1 with The Temperance Seven in 1961. He signed The Beatles in 1962

The young band members were rough around the edges, but Martin saw their commercial promise and with them helped revolutionise the art of popular music recording.

His 1979 autobiography, ""All You Need Is Ears"", chronicles his discovery of the Beatles and their creative process.

Martin was knighted in 1996. In 2006, working with his son, Giles Martin, he helped develop the Beatles-inspired Cirque du Soleil show ""Love"" in Las Vegas, which went on to reap his two most recent Grammys.

LONDON The UK Supreme Court has ruled a ""contrived"" scheme used by Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and UBS UBSG.S> to allow the banks and their bankers to escape 135 million pounds ($192 million)in tax on bonuses was unlawful.

The arrangement, which dated back to 2004, involved bankers receiving bonuses in the form of shares in specially created companies, rather than cash, the UK's tax authority, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), said on Wednesday.

By making the bonus awards in this way, the banks hoped their employees would avoid making national insurance payments and benefit from an income tax break in a way which the Supreme Court said parliament had not intended it to be used.

""This is an important victory and confirmation from the UK's highest court that tax avoidance is simply unacceptable,"" junior finance minister David Gauke said in a statement.

""The UK is home to some of the worlds most successful banks and we have been clear we expect them and their employees to pay their fair share of tax,"" he added.

Revelations about how some very wealthy individuals and major corporations pay little tax on vast earnings  often legally -- has sparked public anger in recent years, putting pressure on the government and on HMRC, which lawmakers frequently say is too lenient on both tax evaders and avoiders.

A spokesman for Deutche Bank said it noted the decision and that all tax and national insurance relating to the scheme had already been paid.

UBS said it was disappointed by the ruling.

""This matter concerns a disagreement over the interpretation of highly technical tax legislation and dates back to a one-off compensation plan for 2003,"" a spokesman said.

OTTAWA Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday said he would neither fight Donald Trump, nor support him, but understood the Republican's appeal for people fed up with politics, who he said had also voted for controversial Toronto mayor Rob Ford.

Trudeau - who will visit Washington this week for talks with President Barack Obama - took office last November and will be in power when the next occupant of the White House takes over in January 2017.

Trudeau also suggested Trump might not be serious about policy platforms such as tearing up the North American Free Trade Agreement, which could badly damage Canada's economy.

""I'm not going to pick a fight with Donald Trump right now. I'm not going to support him either, obviously,"" Trudeau told a live forum hosted by the Huffington Post when pressed to condemn the Republican.

Trudeau said he was watching the United States closely ""to see how it deals with what is obviously a very real set of issues around frustration toward the body politic"" which had been seen around the world.

He cited the case of Ford, the former populist mayor of Toronto who gained global notoriety for admitting to smoking crack while in office.

""We had a mayor called Rob Ford here for a while and there's a lot of people who didn't get it. But he tapped into a very real and legitimate sense that people had around who politicians were,"" said Trudeau.

The prime minister seemed less concerned when asked about Trump's proposals to temporarily bar Muslims from the United States and deport millions of illegal immigrants.

""Let's see if the things that he needed to say in order to secure the Republican nomination are the same things he chooses to say in order to win the Presidency, if that's what happens,"" he said.

WASHINGTON Technology companies could face civil penalties for refusing to comply with court orders to help investigators access encrypted data under draft legislation nearing completion in the U.S. Senate, sources familiar with continuing discussions told Reuters on Wednesday.

The long-awaited legislation from Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, may be introduced as soon as next week, one of the sources said.

It would expose companies like Apple Inc, which is fighting a magistrate judge's order to unlock an iPhone connected to the mass-shooting in San Bernardino, California, to contempt of court proceedings and related penalties, the source said.

Senators are expected to circulate the draft bill among interested parties next week and hope to introduce it soon after, though a timetable is not final, the source said.

The Senators' proposal would not seek criminal penalties, as some media reports have stated, the sources said.

The controversial proposal faces an uphill climb in a gridlocked Congress during an election year and would likely be opposed by Silicon Valley.

Tech companies have largely supported Apple in its legal fight against the Justice Department, which is seeking access to a phone used by Rizwan Farook, one of two shooters in the San Bernardino attack last December in which 14 were killed and 22 wounded.

It is particularly unlikely the proposal will gain traction in the U.S. House of Representatives, which staked out positions strongly supporting digital privacy in the wake of revelations about government-sanctioned surveillance of communications by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.

Last year, amid stiff private sector opposition, the White House backed away from pushing for legislation to require U.S. technology firms to provide investigators with mechanisms to overcome encryption protections.

But the issue found renewed life after the shootings in San Bernardino and Paris. An August email from Robert Litt, the top U.S. intelligence community lawyer, obtained by the Washington Post, noted that momentum on the issue ""could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement.""

Separately, Democratic Senator Mark Warner and Republican Representative Michael McCaul last week introduced legislation to create a national commission to further explore solutions to the so-called going dark problem, where strong encryption has made it more difficult for law enforcement to access communications belonging to criminal suspects.

The contract is the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement, which divided up most of the Arab lands that had been under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. The world that document created exists now only on yellowed maps, and the issues left unsettled  primarily the need for separate Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish territories  have come home begging. War is not fixing this; diplomacy might.

In November 2014, I wrote the only solution to Islamic State was to use American peacekeepers to create a stable, tri-state solution to the Sunni-Shiite-Kurd divide inside Iraq.

However, in the intervening 15 months, Turkey and Russia entered the fight, and the Saudis may soon join the fray. Meanwhile, the United States and its allies  as well as Iraq, Islamic State and Iran  never left. Only a massive diplomatic effort, involving all parties now on the playing field, including Islamic State, has any potential of ending the bloodshed. That means a redivision of the region along current ethnic, tribal, religious and political lines.

A new Sykes-Picot Agreement, if you will.

The old Sykes-Picot Agreement was enforced by the superpowers of the day, Britain and France, with buy-in from Russia. The immediate aim was colonialism; the long-term goal stability, following the massive realignment of power that was World War One. The lines were literally drawn for the next nine decades.

Another important goal of the era, creating Kurdistan, never actually happened. The 1920 Treaty of Sevres left an opening for a referendum on Kurdish independence. Problem one: the referendum only included plans for Kurds outside of Syria and Iraq. Problem two: the referendum never happened, a victim of fighting that saw the Turkish people separate themselves from the remains of the Ottoman Empire and fight for two years to prevent the dismantling of what is now modern Turkey. The result was 20 million Kurds scattered across parts of modern Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Syria.

From a geopolitical perspective, heres what we have now: the 2003 invasion of Iraq blew open the struggle among the Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. It unleashed the forces behind some of the Arab Spring-driven chaos in Syria, and drew Iran deep into the Iraqi conflict. Shiite militia and Iraqi government attacks on Sunnis opened the door for Islamic State to step in as their protector.

The struggle metastasized into the ongoing, broader conflict. The Kurds are expanding the land they control, out of Iraq, and into Turkish and Syrian territory. The Turks look to repel that effort, and perhaps seize some territory to tidy up their own border with Syria. Russia has re-entered the region as a military force. The Saudis may yet send in troops. Iran is already there via proxy forces. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad still holds territory, but only alongside Islamic State. The United States is training, assisting and equipping groups often fighting each other.

That all has led to human suffering on a genocidal scale, including refugee flows no one seems sure how best to handle. The ongoing effort to bomb away the problems has resulted in destroying cities like Ramadi, Kobane, Homs, and soon Mosul, in order to save them. Four American presidents have made war in the region without concrete results, and Obamas successor will be number five.

The only answer left, the one not yet tried, is to negotiate a comprehensive resolution that addresses all of the issues, borders and struggles now underway. That resolution will need to be enforced with military power coordinated by the United States, Russia and Iran, with each speaking for, and agreeing to corral, its proxies.

It will mean giving Islamic State a seat at the table, as the British were forced to do with the Irish Republican Army in the 1990s to resolve the troubles in Northern Ireland. One, by definition, must negotiate peace with ones enemies. That is why, in part, the current ceasefire in Syria, which excluded Islamic State, has little chance of achieving any long-term progress.

Out of the new negotiations will have to emerge a Kurdistan, with land from Turkey, Iraq, perhaps Iran, and Syria. Assad will stay in power as a Russian proxy. Irans hold on Shiite Iraq will strengthen. A Sunni homeland, to include the political entity Islamic State will morph into, will need to be assured via a strict hands-off policy by Baghdad.

That Sunni homeland offers the first real way to geographically contain Islamic State. There obviously is risk in overtly allowing Islamic State to continue to exist, though that lives alongside the questions of whether it can be militarily destroyed, or if another group will simply take its place, as Islamic State did with al Qaeda in Iraq. These groups are symptoms of the broader Sunni-Shiite problem, not problems of their own per se.

The payoff of such a broad resolution will be a measure of stability, and a framework to enforce it. American efforts will shift from fanning the flames (American weapons are as ubiquitous as iPhones in the region) to putting out fires.

At risk for not acting: an empowered Islamic State, thriving on more chaos. An explosive dissolution of Iraq. A Russian-Turkish fight that could involve NATO. The shift from a Saudi-Iranian proxy war to a straightforward conflict between the two countries. A spark that forces Israel to act. A mini-world war, in the worlds most flammable region, that will create its own unexpected and uncontrolled realignment of power, and leave behind a warehouse of the dead.

Yes, I hate it, too. It is a very imperfect resolution. But an elegant solution is no longer viable.",[]

The Federal Reserve should remain on track to raise interest rates later this year despite the U.S. economy's weak start to the year and a stock market sell-off...

BOSTON The perpetrators of a $100 million digital heist at Bangladesh's central bank had deep knowledge of the institution's internal workings, likely gained by spying on bank workers, security experts said.

Unknown hackers breached Bangladesh Bank in early February, stole credentials for payment transfers and then ordered transfers out of a Federal Reserve Bank of New York account held by Bangladesh Bank, according to Bangladesh Bank officials.

Bangladesh government officials blamed the Fed for the attack when they disclosed the loss. The New York Fed responded on Tuesday saying there was no evidence its systems were compromised in the attack, one of the biggest bank thefts in history.

The Fed said it followed normal procedures when responding to requests that appeared to be from Bangladesh Bank, which were made and authenticated over SWIFT. Belgian-based SWIFT, a member-owned cooperative that banks use for account transfer requests and other secure messages, declined to comment on specifics of the case.

Security experts said that to pull off the attack, cyber criminals had to first gather information about Bangladesh Bank's procedures for ordering transfers, so that the fraudulent requests would not raise red flags.

In addition to stealing credentials for processing transfers, the hackers likely spied on Bangladesh Bank staff to get a deep understanding of the central bank's operations, according to experts in banking fraud.

Kayvan Alikhani, a senior director with security firm RSA, said that in addition to user names and passwords for accessing SWIFT, the hackers likely needed to obtain cryptographic keys that authenticated the senders.

Such certificates can be copied and used by impostors if they are not properly secured, he said.

You are only as good as your weakest link when getting access to the SWIFT network and doing a transfer, Alikhani said.

In a round of robberies disclosed last year, a group dubbed the Carbanak gang hacked into a number of banks around the world, seized control of computers that access SWIFT, then ordered fraudulent transfers.

They siphoned money through SWIFT after observing how bank employees crafted their messages so they could follow correct protocols, said Juan Guerrero, a researcher with Kaspersky Lab, which studied the campaign.

""The genius of the attacker in the Carbanak case is taking the time to learn directly from the victim and thus bypass fraud prevention measures through sheer mimicry, Guerrero told Reuters.

Another hacking method that could have been used is known as ""social engineering,"" where attackers play on human psychology to manipulate victims.

They get that information by hacking email accounts of employees who process transfers, said Tom Kellermann, a former member of the World Bank's security team.

""They sit and watch regular communications to understand when somebody would be most receptive to a specially crafted social-engineering email instructing them to make the transfer,"" said Kellermann, now chief executive of investment firm Strategic Cyber Ventures.

The opinions expressed are her own.

Raghuram Rajan is too important to lose. Under the Indian central bank governors watch, the countrys economy has been hailed as a bright spot in a turbulent world. Yet one of Rajans biggest tasks is far from complete. Confidence will take a hit if he doesnt stick around when his three-year term ends in September.

When Rajan took charge of the Reserve Bank of India in 2013, inflation was nearing double digits. Now it has almost halved. The governor has enshrined price stability as the central banks primary objective. Last month, the government formally proposed handing responsibility for setting interest rates to a monetary policy committee. The result will be a more credible institution that is less dependent on a strong chief.

The former University of Chicago professor may be less dispensable in other areas, however. Most notably, the RBI is leading a fight to fix Indias bad debt problem. Rajan has made waves by criticising tycoons who use their influence to keep rolling over loans even though they have little intention of repaying banks, many of which are state-owned.

Though lenders are recognising more of their loans as troubled, the true extent of the problem is not yet clear. There are also doubts whether the Indian governments 1.8 trillion rupee ($26.8 billion) plan to recapitalise state banks to meet global capital requirements by 2019 will be sufficient.

Its hard to identify equally qualified successors who could fill Rajans shoes. A new governor may find it harder to keep up the pressure on lenders. If banks go back to ignoring bad loans as they have done in the past, the countrys growth will suffer.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has the power to extend Rajans tenure by two years. Many of the governors predecessors served five-year terms. Though the two men have their differences  Rajan has lectured the government about the need to promote tolerance, for example  they appear to agree on key financial issues. Its not clear if Rajan wants to stay on. But Modi should certainly try to pin him down.",[]

MONROE, EUA Donald Trump ficou mais proximo de conquistar a nomeacao para ser o candidato republicano a presidente dos Estados Unidos em 2016 com as suas ultimas vitorias em primarias e, nesta quarta-feira, pediu para que as forcas dentro do partido contrarias a sua campanha o apoiem ou corram o risco de perder para os democratas em novembro.

O magnata do setor imobiliario adotou um tom mais conciliador em relacao a corrente principal republicana que tem resistido bastante ao seu avanco, apoiando primeiro candidatos favoritos que fracassaram nas votacoes e, depois, colocando dinheiro em campanhas contra ele.

""Se nos aceitarmos o que esta acontecendo e todo mundo se unir, em vez de gastar todo esse dinheiro nesses anuncios que, francamente, sao equivocados, e eles sao apenas anuncios falsos, disse Trump ao canal de TV Fox News. Se todo mundo se unir, ninguem pode derrotar o Partido Republicano. Nos seguiriamos para Washington.

Trump, o favorito para ganhar a nomeacao do partido para as eleicoes de 8 de novembro, elogiou o presidente da Camara dos Deputados, Paul Ryan, depois de falar com ele pelo telefone nesta semana, chamando o lider republicano de um bom homem. O gabinete de Ryan disse que o parlamentar esta telefonando para todos os candidatos republicanos para discutir uma pauta de politicas conservadoras.

Com as vitorias em previas na terca-feira, levando a importante Michigan e tambem Mississippi e Havai, o bilionario de Nova York, de 69 anos, se contrapos a uma semana de ataques vindos da corrente principal republicana e a previsoes de que a sua campanha poderia estar perdendo ritmo.

A vitoria convincente em Michigan restaurou o impeto da sua campanha, limitando o prospecto de as forcas anti-Trump do partido o pararem, no momento em que varias disputas relevantes se aproximam em 15 de marco.

Com as vitorias da terca-feira, Trump aumentou a sua vantagem em numeros de delegados, na busca dos 1.237 necessarios para levar a nomeacao. Trump tem agora 446 delegados, com o senador Ted Cruz, do Texas, em segundo lugar com 347, de acordo com o The New York Times.

Cruz, de 45 anos, que ganhou disputas suficientes para se apresentar como uma alternativa viavel a Trump, ganhou o apoio da ex-rival republicana Carly Fiorina nesta quarta-feira e fez um apelo para que republicanos anti-Trump facam o mesmo.

Se voce nao quer Donald Trump como candidato, se voce nao quer entregar a eleicao numa bandeja de prata para Hillary Clinton e os democratas, entao eu peco para que voce se junte a nos, disse Cruz em Miami.

Trump, ex-astro de um reality show, tem apimentado a sua campanha com ataques a rivais e criticos. Muitos republicanos tradicionais tem se ofendido com as suas declaracoes sobre muculmanos, imigrantes e mulheres, ao mesmo tempo que tem ficado alarmados pelas suas ameacas a tratados de comercio internacional.

Na disputa do Partido Democrata, Bernie Sanders surpreendeu a favorita Hillary Clinton numa vitoria apertada em Michigan, dando a sua campanha nova energia. Hillary venceu em Mississippi, mas a vitoria de Sanders em Michigan foi vista como um resultado que provavelmente resultara numa luta prolongada pela candidatura.

A campanha de Hillary Clinton tem sido afetada por causa do seu uso de um e-mail privado quando ela era secretaria de Estado. Num sinal de que o tema nao vai sair de pauta, o Comite Nacional Republicano entrou com um processo nesta quarta-feira para obter registros de Hillary e seus assessores.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 21:34:12+00:00,"Exclusive: Obama committed to Pacific trade deal, even as opposition spreads - Rice",['Roberta Rampton'],"U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice (C) joins President Barack Obama as he participates in a bilateral meeting at the State House in Nairobi, in this July 25, 2015 file photo.

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama is fully committed to pushing for Congress to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal despite anti-trade sentiment gaining steam on the presidential election campaign trail, National Security Adviser Susan Rice said on Wednesday.

Voter anxiety and anger over international trade and the 12-nation Pacific trade pact have helped propel the campaign of Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, as well as Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.

""The president remains fully committed to working to achieve ratification on the U.S. side and encouraging all of our TPP partners to move through their domestic processes to do the same,"" Rice told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.

For Obama, the TPP is a legacy issue, and standing firm on the pact reassures other nations with high expectations for the deal. At the same time, it highlights a division with Clinton, a close political ally, who has been grappling with Democratic anxiety about trade on the campaign trail.

Obama's commitment to the trade deal means that it will likely remain a hot campaign issue and exposes Clinton to trade-bashing rhetoric ahead of the Nov. 8 vote to elect Obama's successor.

Sanders has accused Clinton of backing ""disastrous"" trade policies that moved manufacturing jobs overseas, and questioned the sincerity of her opposition to the TPP since she became a presidential candidate.

Clinton had supported the trade pact when she was secretary of state during Obama's first term, but later said she was worried the deal would not do enough to crack down on currency manipulation or protect consumers from excessively high drug prices.

Sanders' unexpected victory in the Democratic primary in Michigan on Tuesday suggests that his criticism is resonating with some voters, and could spell trouble ahead for Clinton in states such as Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

Trump's anti-free trade rhetoric and promise to slap taxes on cars and parts shipped in from Mexico have also found support among Republican voters, helping him score a big victory in the party' primary in Michigan on Tuesday.

""There have been times - and this is one of them - where anti-trade sentiment has attained some salience in our domestic politics as well as in other countries,"" Rice said.

""There's been an evolution over the decades in the nature of trade agreements and in the caliber of trade agreements. And I'm not sure that that has fully been absorbed in the public mindset or the political discourse,"" she said.

Obama has repeatedly said that the TPP will expand markets for U.S. exporters and has high standards on labor and the environment that were not part of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.

Rice said policy makers face the challenge of being able to articulate the benefits of TPP and ""to not allow the sort of traditional 'old saws' of the critical narrative about trade to go unchallenged, when to a considerable extent they're based on agreements of the past.""

Rice made her comments ahead of a summit between Obama and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, a nation also wrestling with the merits of the TPP. The economy of Canada, the largest market for U.S. exports, is heavily reliant on open trade with the United States.

Gli altri due - Fausto Piano e Salvatore Failla - erano stati uccisi precedentemente in uno scontro a fuoco.

Britain's Queen Elizabeth attends the formal unveiling of the new logo for Crossrail, which is to be named the Elizabeth line, at the construction site of the Bond Street station in central London, February 23, 2016.

LONDON Buckingham Palace said it had launched an official complaint with Britain's press watchdog on Wednesday over a newspaper report that Queen Elizabeth backs a British exit from the European Union, saying the monarch remains politically neutral.

Under the front-page headline ""Queen backs Brexit"", The Sun newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying that Elizabeth had made her opposition to British membership of the EU clear on at least two occasions over the past decade.

""The Queen remains politically neutral, as she has for 63 years,"" the palace said in a statement. ""We will not comment on spurious, anonymously sourced claims. The referendum is a matter for the British people to decide.""

It said aides had taken the rare step of writing to the chairman of the Independent Press Standards Organisation to complain, citing a clause of the editors' code of conduct relating to accuracy.

Opinion polls show voters are divided over membership ahead of a June 23 referendum so even the perception that Elizabeth, who must remain above politics under Britain's unwritten constitution, may favor an exit from the 28-member bloc could be damaging for the campaign to keep Britain in.

The Sun, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, said the queen had told then Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg at a Windsor Castle lunch in 2011 that the EU was heading in the wrong direction.

Clegg called the report nonsense. ""I've no recollection of this happening & its not the sort of thing I would forget,"" he said on Twitter.

The newspaper, British's best selling daily which has repeatedly criticized Britain's EU membership, also said the monarch told lawmakers at a separate meeting that she did not understand Europe.

""The Sun stands by its story, which was based upon two impeccable sources and presented in a robust, accessible fashion. The Sun will defend this complaint vigorously,"" a spokesman said.

Less than a week before the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Elizabeth said she hoped Scots would think carefully about the future, a comment which was interpreted as giving support to those seeking to preserve the United Kingdom.

The queen is not the first royal to have been pulled into the increasingly febrile EU debate.

Her grandson Prince William was criticized by some papers, including the Sun, over a speech he gave to British diplomats last month about the importance of Britain working with other nations.

CAPE TOWN South Africa's Eskom will increase its capital expenditure by 44 percent to 324 billion rand ($21 billion) over the next five years to build new power stations, the state-owned company said on Wednesday.

The cash-strapped state-owned utility also said it had 85 billion rand of funding, representing nearly all of the capital needed, for 2016 and 2017 in a presentation to parliament.

""There is a significant amount of the funding that will be required over the next two years that is relatively committed already in terms of signed facilities that we can draw on as and when projects require the funding,"" said Anoj Singh, Eskom's chief financial officer.

Eskom is building three new power plants to help shore up power reserves in Africa's most industrialised country, and expects to add 5,620 megawatts (MW) to the network by 2018 when units at Medupi and Kusile's coal-fired plants come online.

Eskom, which was granted a lower tariff than it had requested of 9.4 percent by the electricity regulator, said it had significantly reduced the amount it spent on diesel to 40 million rand in February from 854 million rand in October, its CEO Brian Molefe said.

The company had also managed to save 9 billion rand and increased net profit 22 percent to 11.3 billion rand at the end of September and was not in danger financially, he said.

""Our liquidity position has improved. We are nowhere near bankruptcy as was said a few years ago,"" Molefe told parliament.

Reiterating his support for South Africa's proposed nuclear build plan, Molefe said the sole nuclear plant, Koeberg near Cape Town, provided the cheapest form of energy.

Speaking to reporters after Eskom's presentation, a senior energy official said government would request for proposals at the end of the month to add 9,600 MW of new nuclear power to the grid.

To meet its targeted nuclear generation capacity, South Africa's government has said it plans to build six new nuclear power plants by 2030 at a cost estimated between 400 billion rand and 1 trillion rand ($34-$84 billion).

Iranian state television showed footage of two Qadr missiles being launched from northern Iran, which the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said hit targets 1,400 km (870 miles) away.

Iranian agencies said the missiles were stamped with the Hebrew words, ""Israel should be wiped from the pages of history,"" though the inscription could not be seen on any photographs.

Clinton, a former secretary of state under President Barack Obama, said she was ""deeply concerned"" by the tests, the second round of Iranian missile launches in two days.

""Iran should face sanctions for these activities and the

international community must demonstrate that Iran's threats

toward Israel will not be tolerated,"" said Clinton, who is ahead in the race to be Democratic nominee at the Nov. 8 presidential elections.

Her call for sanctions reflected a tougher line against Iran's recent missile activity than that taken so far by the White House, which said it is aware of and reviewing reports of the Iranian tests, and would determine an appropriate response.

""We know that Iran is in a season of carrying out a number of military activities, and so it certainly would not be a surprise if there are additional launches over the next several days,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

The Iranian move on Wednesday came despite warning from the U.S. State Department after Tuesday's missile tests that Washington continues to ""aggressively apply our unilateral tools

to counter threats from Iran's missile program,"" a possible reference to additional U.S. sanctions.

Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Wednesday with Iran's foreign minister about the test-firing of two ballistic missiles, a State Department spokesman said.

The missile tests underline a rift in Iran between hard-line factions opposed to normalizing relations with the West, and

President Hassan Rouhani's relatively moderate government, which is trying to attract foreign investors to Iran.

ISRAEL IN MIND

Iran's IRGC said the missiles tested on Wednesday were designed with Israel in mind.

""The reason we designed our missiles with a range of 2,000 km is to be able to hit our enemy the Zionist regime from a safe distance,"" Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by the ISNA agency. The nearest point in Iran is around 1,000 km (600 miles) from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon told Israel Radio the tests showed Iran's hostility had not changed since implementing a nuclear deal with world powers in January, despite Rouhani's overtures to the West.

""To my regret there are some in the West who are misled by the honeyed words of part of the Iranian leadership while the other part continues to procure equipment and weaponry, to arm terrorist groups,"" Yaalon said.

Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee, said: Iran is making a mockery of President Obamas vow to confront Irans dangerous and illicit acts.

He urged Obama to ""aggressively enforce all sanctions against Irans missile programs, support for terrorism and human rights abuses. No more looking the other way.

Washington imposed sanctions against businesses and individuals in January over another missile test in October 2015. But the IRGC said it would not bow to pressure.

""The more sanctions and pressure our enemies apply ... the more we will develop our missile program,"" Hajizadeh said on state television.

The IRGC maintains dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles, the largest stock in the Middle East. It says they are solely for defensive use with conventional, non-nuclear warheads.

Tehran has denied U.S. accusations of acting ""provocatively,"" citing the long history of U.S. interventions in the Middle East and its own right to self-defense.

La CGT, Force ouvriere et une vingtaine de mouvements de jeunesse avaient appele a cette journee d'action qui s'est egalement traduite par le blocage de 90 lycees sur quelque 2.500 etablissements, selon les chiffres de l'Education nationale.

Parallelement a une greve des cheminots, dont les revendications portent sur les conditions de travail, 176 rassemblements ou defiles ont ete organises.

Les organisateurs evaluent le nombre de participants a 400.000, voire un demi-million d'apres le syndicat etudiant Unef, dont environ 100.000 a Paris, 20.000 a Toulouse, plus de 10.000 a Lyon, 6.000 a Rennes ou 15.000 a Bordeaux.

Le ministere de l'Interieur parle de 224.000 manifestants sur tout le territoire francais, dont 27.000 a 29.000 pour le cortege parisien, environ 10.000 a Toulouse, 7.000 a Lyon, 4.500 a Rennes et 9.000 a Bordeaux.

Les manifestants entendaient adresser un coup de semonce a l'executif, a cinq jours de la conclusion des consultations menees par le gouvernement sur ce projet de reforme, dont une partie de la gauche et des syndicats ne veut pas.

""Derriere moi et partout en France, c'est une premiere grosse mobilisation. On demarre fort et il faut donc continuer a elargir"", a declare Philippe Martinez, secretaire general de la CGT, interroge en tete du cortege parisien.

""Il appartient maintenant au gouvernement de prendre conscience du rejet de son projet et den tirer les consequences"", peut-on lire dans un communique de FO, qui promet de ""maintenir la pression"".

SOULAGEMENT AU GOUVERNEMENT

Mais le gouvernement peut pousser un soupir de soulagement, les jeunes ne s'etant, a ce stade, pas massivement mobilises.

""Nous regardons les choses avec serenite"", a dit sur iTELE le secretaire d'Etat aux Relations avec le Parlement, Jean-Marie Le Guen, qui a ajoute ""avoir vu des mobilisations plus fortes"".

A Lyon, le defile a donne lieu a des heurts entre manifestants et policiers, qui ont essuye des jets de pierre et riposte au moyen de gaz lacrymogenes. Trois personnes ont ete interpellees.

A Nantes, Marseille ou Rennes, des lyceens et des etudiants ont participe a ce mouvement, lance a l'origine par des organisations de jeunesse comme les syndicats Unef, Fidl et UNL et le Mouvement des jeunes socialistes (MJS).

""La jeunesse a un role a jouer pour entrainer le monde du travail avec elle car avec la loi El Khomri, on a atteint le point de non-retour et c'est tout le systeme qu'il faut remettre en cause"", disait Marine, une etudiante bordelaise.

Les organisations de jeunes ont prevu une autre journee d'action le 17 mars, nouveau test avant la vaste mobilisation du 31 mars, sous la forme de manifestations et de greves, a laquelle appellent a la fois les syndicats etudiant et lyceens et la CGT, FO ou la FSU.

L'humeur de la jeunesse est suivie attentivement par le gouvernement, dix ans apres le mouvement qui a contraint le Premier ministre d'alors, Dominique de Villepin, a retirer le contrat premiere embauche (CPE) sous la pression de la rue.

La CFDT, principal syndicat reformiste, n'est pas partie prenante a la mobilisation actuelle mais menace de durcir sa position si elle n'obtient pas une reecriture du texte, et notamment le retrait de l'article fixant un plafond pour les indemnites prud'homales en cas de licenciement abusif.

""J'invite (le gouvernement) a faire des arbitrages consequents avec des modifications substantielles, sinon la CFDT se mobilisera"", a dit Laurent Berger mercredi matin sur BFM TV.

Parallelement, la greve des cheminots a fortement perturbe le trafic, avec un train sur trois sur certains axes TGV et les lignes TER, Intercites, Transiliens. Le trafic est en revanche demeure quasiment normal pour le metro parisien.

MONTEE EN PUISSANCE ?

Le taux de participation a ce mouvement unitaire organise par la CGT, l'UNSA, la CFDT et SUD Rail s'elevait parmi les personnel a 35,5% selon la direction de la SNCF, et a environ 50% selon la Federation CGT des cheminots.

Pour Philippe Martinez, le report du 9 au 24 mars de la presentation du projet de loi en conseil des ministres pour rattraper l'absence de concertation en amont ne suffira pas.

""La CGT a presente un projet (...) On a des propositions tres concretes on peut en discuter des que ce texte-la est retire"", a-t-il declare sur France Inter.

Son homologue de FO, Jean-Claude Mailly, a reitere sur RTL sa demande de suspension du projet de reforme pour le remettre a plat : ""Maintenant ils veulent discuter mais 15 jours de report, (...) ca ne sert a rien.""

Il a predit une montee en puissance du mouvement de contestation si le texte est maintenu.

Selon l'entourage de Manuel Valls et ses interlocuteurs des derniers jours, le gouvernement est pret a ""bouger des curseurs"" mais sans remettre en cause l'equilibre general du texte.

Le president du Medef, Pierre Gattaz, a demande mardi au Premier ministre de ne pas ""denaturer"" un projet de loi considere par l'organisation patronale comme une ""rupture"" salutaire susceptible de relancer les embauches.

RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO A alta dos precos de alimentacao, transportes e habitacao mostrou algum alivio em fevereiro e a inflacao oficial brasileira desacelerou para o nivel mais baixo em quatro meses, em um reflexo da recessao que pode ajudar o Banco Central na tarefa de domar o avanco dos precos.

O Indice Nacional de Precos ao Consumidor Amplo (IPCA) registrou alta de 0,90 por cento em fevereiro, apos avancar 1,27 por cento no mes anterior, informou nesta quarta-feira o Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica (IBGE).

Em 12 meses, a alta acumulada do indice ate fevereiro foi a 10,36 por cento, desacelerando sobre os 10,71 por cento de janeiro.

Em ambos os casos, os resultados sao os mais baixos desde outubro do ano passado, quando o IPCA avancou 0,82 por cento na base mensal e 9,93 por cento em 12 meses, ultima vez em que ficou abaixo dos dois digitos.

Assim, os numeros comecam a dar algum folego as expectativas de que os precos comecariam a ceder depois de a economia brasileira ter registrado o pior desempenho em 25 anos no ano passado.

""A queda da atividade economica, com o aumento da taxa de desemprego, tem esse efeito sobre a inflacao, e ja observamos essa dinamica"", destacou o economista da Austin Rating Wellington Ramos.

Os resultados ficaram abaixo das expectativas em pesquisa da Reuters de avanco de 1,0 por cento na comparacao mensal e de 10,47 por cento em 12 meses.

ALIMENTOS

O maior destaque em fevereiro ficou para Educacao, com alta de 5,90 por cento como reflexo dos reajustes de inicio de ano, apos avancar 0,31 por cento em janeiro. Ja Alimentacao e Bebidas desacelerou o avanco em fevereiro a 1,06 por cento, de 2,28 por cento.

""Itens importantes como refeicao fora de casa, carne e cafe moido estao apresentando decrescimo. O que vemos e...uma limitacao do consumo por conta da conjuntura economica"", destacou a economista do IBGE Eulina Nunes dos Santos.

Apesar do alivio nos precos dos alimentos, que tem importante peso sobre a renda das familias, esse grupo mais Educacao responderam por 60 por cento do IPCA do mes, ou 0,54 ponto percentual.

Tambem apresentaram desaceleracao importante Transportes, para uma alta de 0,62 por cento sobre 1,77 por cento em janeiro, e Habitacao, cujos precos passaram a cair 0,15 por cento depois de subirem 0,81 por cento no primeiro mes do ano.

Ajudou nesse resultado de Habitacao o recuo de 2,16 por cento nas contas de energia eletrica diante da reducao no valor da bandeira tarifaria vermelha.

""A energia vai comecar a ajudar a inflacao uma vez que em marco a bandeira passou para amarela e em abril a bandeira tarifaria sera verde"", completou Eulina.

Apesar da forte recessao que o pais enfrenta, a inflacao deve terminar 2016 bem acima do teto da meta --de 4,5 por cento pelo IPCA, com margem de tolerancia de 2 pontos percentuais para mais ou menos-- pela segunda vez. A expectativa em pesquisa Focus do BC e de alta do IPCA de 7,59 por cento no final do ano.

Mesmo com a fraqueza da economia, diante da inflacao elevada, o BC manteve a Selic em 14,25 por cento ao ano pela quinta vez seguida, deixando claro que nao deve cortar a taxa basica de juros tao cedo.

A expectativa agora gira em torno da divulgacao da ata dessa reuniao, na quinta-feira. Mas o resultado do IPCA levou as taxas dos contratos de juros futuros a recuarem com forca nesta sessao, ja que a desaceleracao da inflacao alimenta expectativas de corte na taxa basica de juros para estimular a economia.

""Vemos o BC terminando este ano com reducao da Selic pelo fato de a recessao segurar a inflacao"", disse Ramos, da Austin Rating, calculando a Selic em 11,50 por cento ao final de 2016. Ja a pesquisa Focus aponta para Selic a 14,25 por cento no final do ano.",[]

SINGAPORE Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) is seeking 35,000 tonnes of Euro 4 diesel in a rare move to fill a supply void, traders said on Wednesday.

The tender, which closes on March 14, is for a 20,000-tonne cargo to be discharged at Paradeep port on April 9-13, and the remaining 15,000 tonnes to be discharged at Ennore port during the same period.

It is too early to determine whether BPCL will become a regular importer of the Euro 4 grade diesel, traders said, as it depends on price.

But this mirrored an unusual move by Indian Oil Corp (IOC) early last year when it sought to import petrol to cater to growing demand as the fuel was more expensive to buy from local refiners.

IOC, India's top refiner by capacity, went on to become a regular importer of petrol in 2015, adding to the supply tightness that affected the fuel last year.

But its imports have slowed this year following the start-up of its Paradip refinery.

Diesel supply, depending on grades, has been aplenty from Asia to Europe since last year, traders said.

India plans to go straight to Euro 6 diesel (and petrol) by 2020 from the current Euro 4 fuels in major cities and Euro 3 fuels across the rest of the country in a move to combat pollution.

BPCL owns refineries in Kochi and Mumbai.

reuters.com,2015-09-15 22:32:07+00:00,Big Investors on Campus: Why VCs are scouting student startups,['Reuters Editorial'],"For decades, venture capital firms followed a standard playbook: target promising startups as they hit their stride and invest up to $10 million or so for a series A round. But the rules were changing in 2009, when Sequoia Capital helped raise $2 million for use by Y Combinator, a seed funder gaining a high-profile reputation for making small $20,000 bets on startups such as Dropbox and Scribd, both of which were conceived of by college kids.

To identify other promising investments, VCs began paying attention to the earliest point in the tech life cycle: the moment when company founders were still developing ideas in dorm rooms.

The rest of Silicon Valley's Sand Hill Road, the preferred address for top venture firms, has followed suit. By 2011, Xfund, a collaboration between New Enterprise Associates, Accel Partners and Breyer Capital, launched a $100 million fund and set up two offices, one on Brattle Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts (home to MIT and Harvard) and the other in Menlo Park, California, down the street from Stanford's campus. ""It's a kind of embedded situation that is unique,"" says Patrick Chung, co-founder and general partner at Xfund.

Xfund has to compete with two other Stanford-focused funds: StartX, an accelerator directly affiliated with the university, and Dorm Room Fund, which has outposts in four cities, including the Bay area. Students run the latter fund and it's backed by First Round Capital, a San Francisco VC which has funded Uber, Gigya and TaskRabbit.

Whereas most VCs prefer founders with engineering or computer science degrees, Xfund partner Chung seeks out liberal arts majors, often from Harvard.

Building an innovative product often doesn't come down to technical chops, he argues, but the ability to perform cross-discipline thinking. ""There is a whole class of entrepreneurs who are being ignored,"" Chung says. Harvard startups have comprised about 25 percent of Xfund's investments, with 20 percent coming from MIT, 10 percent from Stanford and another 7 percent from University of California, Berkeley.

At Lightspeed Venture Partners, another Sand Hill Road firm, the partners founded a summer fellowship program in 2007 that grants nascent student-run companies up to $50,000 to work on their product in Silicon Valley for three months. Lightspeed manages $3 billion and its recent successes include Snapchat, Nest and GrubHub. Pinterest is the best known product to come out of Lightspeed's summer fellowship. Stanford provides the program more entrepreneurs than any other school, and Lightspeed associate partner David Dubick says that's due to his firm's across-the-street proximity to Stanford's campus, as well as word-of-mouth marketing that gives the fellowship program more visibility on campuses where alumni already exist. Last summer's program included student teams from Stanford, MIT, UCLA and the University of Illinois.

Related Coverage  Special Report: At Stanford, venture capital reaches into the dorm

It's not necessarily true that the students at Stanford make better entrepreneurs, says Dubick. ""But investors latch onto patterns that have worked in the past."" Sometimes, Dubick notes, the best entrepreneurs come from out-of-the-way schools ""where not everybody is mining the waters.""

In that spirit, one of Lightspeed's newer portfolio companies, Handshake, comes from graduates of Michigan Tech, a school so far north that it's a nine-hour drive from Detroit. The career services startup helps businesses find and hire talented university students, and after drawing $3.5 million in seed funding, has more than 60 university clients and 20,000 employers on board.

For other VCs, regional preferences play a role. St. Louis's Cultivation Capital, which manages $105 million, watches Midwest schools where big West Coast investors have blind spots. Cultivation looks to Washington University in St. Louis for life sciences startups. One of Cultivation's partners is a senior lecturer at Wash U, and the firm's full-time recruiter also works on the school's placement staff, helping Cultivation pick up early leads.

Brian Matthews, managing partner for Cultivation's tech funds, stays tight with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, a place whose alumni have produced hits such as Netscape, PayPal, Yelp and YouTube. Matthews or his principals talk to engineering professors or staff in the commercialization office at least once a month. He also speaks regularly with two venture funds based at UIUC.

In San Diego, far down the coast from Sand Hill Road, Avalon Ventures scouts the University of California San Diego for life sciences companies and development. The firm, which has $750 million under management, has completed three deals with UCSD companies in the past several years, with two exits, one of them an IPO. ""It's about having those relationships with faculty and the tech transfer offices,"" says Jay Lichter, Avalon's managing director. ""But you have to do more than stop by once a month, it's about your reputation at the school. When you say you're going to do a deal, you have to follow through and do the deal.""

Sequoia has gone even farther, bringing on ""student ambassadors"" at 8 to 10 campuses across the country. These tech and entrepreneurially focused students let Sequoia know when interesting startups take root on campus-and they also make recommendations on the kinds of activities Sequoia should participate in to build a name at the school. Says Sequoia partner Bryan Schreier: ""We try to do just a few things on campus, but we want them to really count.""

reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:27:52+00:00,Exclusive: Bank of America hiring bankers for new middle-market push - sources,"['Dan Freed', 'Olivia Oran']","Bank of America Corp is hiring a new team of investment bankers who cater to mid-size companies, four years after dismantling a similar business, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The precise number of middle-market bankers it plans to add could not be determined, but one person said it would be fewer than 10.

The hiring comes as Bank of America is reducing staff more broadly, while also trying to grow in areas where it believes it can gain market share. As the second-biggest U.S. lender with a large commercial banking business, executives believe Bank of America can make inroads in advising mid-sized companies on mergers and stock and bond offerings, the sources said. Middle-market deals are generally considered transactions worth less than $500 million.

The bank also hopes the push will lead to additional business such as managing money for executives at mid-sized companies. Sources asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media about matters that have not been made public.

Bank of America announced internally last year that Vice Chairman Mark Stephanz would create a group that provides investment banking services to mid-size companies. The hiring is part of that effort. His team will work together with counterparts in the commercial bank who provide traditional loans and cash management services, sources said.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender previously launched a middle-market business in 2007, with over 30 investment bankers who focused on mergers and acquisitions. It abandoned the effort in 2012 to focus on larger clients and bigger deals, sources said.

In 2015, Bank of America ranked fourth in global M&A league tables, according to Thomson Reuters data. It ranked 23rd globally for middle-market deals.

Bank of America generated around 17 percent of its M&A fees from middle market deals, the lowest percentage of any big Wall Street bank except Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Last year, M&A hit a record volume of nearly $5 trillion, due to mega deals like Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA's $106 billion acquisition of SABMiller Plc and oil firm Royal Dutch Shell Plc's $70 billion purchase of BG Group Plc.

But some Wall Street executives predict blockbuster deals will slow down this year. In January, JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said she expects to see fewer giant mergers and more mid-sized deals.

Bank of America has been hiring salespeople to drum up business, even as it has cut support staff and underperformers as part of a multi-year cost-cutting initiative. Last year alone, it cut more than 10,000 jobs.

The bank laid off a number of investment bankers on Tuesday because of weak markets, one of the sources said.

International Cricket Council (ICC) Chief Executive David Richardson gestures as he speaks during a news conference in New Delhi, India, March 9, 2016.

NEW DELHI The most anticipated match of the World Twenty20 between hosts India and arch-rivals Pakistan was shifted to Kolkata on Wednesday over concerns about security in the original venue for the March 19 clash at Dharamsala.

The marquee contest between the neighbours ran into trouble with Indian war veterans in the state of Himachal Pradesh, where Dharamsala is located, opposing the hosting of a match against Pakistan after militants killed seven security personnel in a Jan. 2 attack on the Indian Air Force base at nearby Pathankot.

Pakistan said on Wednesday it had arrested several members of the Jaish-e-Mohammad militant group, which is suspected of masterminding the attack near Dharamsala and 25 km (16 miles) from the Pakistan border.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) delayed the departure of the men's and women's teams and sent a delegation to review security at Dharamsala, which boasts one of India's most beautiful stadiums with snow-capped mountains in the background.

After Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh's warning of possible disruption, the organisers took the ""difficult decision"" to shift the contest from the picturesque sleepy hill town to Kolkata's usually boisterous Eden Gardens.

""We looked at the security situation and we agreed in the end that the level of uncertainties that exist around that match was too great to take a risk,"" International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive David Richardson told reporters.

""The safety and security of the event is of paramount importance to the ICC and we've taken into consideration the concerns shared with us by our security advisors as well as the Pakistan Cricket Board.""

Richardson, however, all but ruled out a sanction against the state cricket association in Himachal Pradesh.

""We had to make this decision for safety and security reasons. I don't think it's reasonable to suggest that we'll be taking disciplinary action against the state association in that province.""

The ICC official said the organisers were still awaiting an absolute assurance from Pakistan of their participation in the sixth edition of the tournament.

""The decision has just been conveyed to them... We are now obviously very hopeful that they would now board the plane and come to the event.""

BITTER NEIGHBOURS

Top cricket countries have refused to tour Pakistan since 2009 when gunmen attacked a bus carrying a visiting Sri Lanka team near Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium.

Shaharyar Khan, the PCB chairman, had said on Monday that there was no question of the country not playing in the tournament but that other venues needed to be considered to replace Dharamsala.

Pakistan and India have fought three wars since becoming separate countries in 1947, two of them over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.

Bilateral cricketing ties between the neighbours remain suspended after gunmen killed 166 people in Mumbai in a three-day rampage in 2008 which India blames on a Pakistani militant group.

Pakistan's cricket team have in the past received a hostile reception in Mumbai, venue of the second semi-final of the World Twenty20 which got underway on Tuesday, where members of a regional political party dug up a pitch in 1991 on the eve of a test match.

Richardson said if Pakistan reached the last four they would play their semi-final in New Delhi on March 30.

""If Pakistan makes the semi-finals, their semi-final won't be played in Mumbai,"" Richardson said.

""We've chosen the venues where Pakistan is due to play very carefully, taking into account safety and security issues.""

Pakistan open their tournament on March 16 against a qualifying team in Kolkata before the match against India three days later. They will also face New Zealand on March 22 and Australia on March 25, with both of those matches in Mohali.

As this Reuters graphic shows, once debt is factored in, the Verizon acquisition is just the 13th biggest global deal so far this year. A number of the top 10 deals arent as much mergers as piecemeal purchases of desirable parts of one companys business, and its unclear whether AOL will be kept intact or disassembled for parts.

So far, Verizon hasnt done much to telegraph its intentions for AOL, though cannibalizing and/or relaunching some of the companys components seems an option. AOL has discussed spinning off The Huffington Post, which is valued at as much as $1 billion, and many analysts see AOLs mobile advertising capabilities as the companys main asset.

AOLs 2000 merger with Time Warner is generally regarded as a catastrophe, but those who bet on the company when it was subsequently spun back off look have made out pretty well.

""We have a love affair with the UK. I mean we've had it since 1964 ... they [British fans] understand our music, they understand us,"" Gordy told Reuters, when asked about Motown's appeal across the Atlantic.

""UK is fabulous, we have so many great memories here.""

Gordy, 86, was accompanied by Robinson to the London premiere, and both received a standing ovation from the audience at curtain call.

Asked what was the secret behind Motown's success, Gordy said: ""Probably love ... and great poetry and music by this guy right here,"" pointing to Robinson.

From rhythm and blues, soul music as well as pop later on, the Motown Sound features a string of popular hits made famous by the label's African-American stars, who also influenced U.S. culture during the civil rights era with their songs.

On Broadway, the musical opened to strong box office sales and got four Tony Award nominations. The London show is taking bookings to February 2017.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 00:08:10+00:00,"No Obama meeting with Fidel Castro, dissident talks on track: White House","['Matt Spetalnick', 'Jeff Mason']","A picture of former Cuban President Fidel Castro is seen inside a private shop under refurbishment in Havana, February 24, 2016.

WASHINGTON The White House has ruled out an encounter between President Barack Obama and revolutionary leader Fidel Castro in Cuba this month and is confident the Cuban government will not create obstacles to a meeting between Obama and dissidents in Havana, a top adviser said on Wednesday.

Despite the goal of improving ties between former Cold War foes, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Obama would not use his trip to meet Cuba's demands that he shutter Radio and TV Marti, U.S. broadcasters created to transmit anti-communist programing to the island nation.

Obama plans to hold talks with Cuban President Raul Castro during his historic March 20-22 visit but will not meet with Castro's brother, a legendary figure who took power in a 1959 revolution and led Cuba for 49 years.

""We've had no discussion about that meeting taking place, and we certainly wouldn't seek it,"" Rhodes, who was one of the negotiators in secret talks that led to a thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations, told Reuters in an interview.

Asked if a meeting was ruled out, Rhodes said: ""Yes.""

A meeting with the elder Castro could overshadow a trip that is meant to focus on the future of the U.S.-Cuba relationship rather than its troubled past. Castro, 89, stepped down from power after a series of health problems and rarely leaves his Havana home, though he occasionally meets visiting dignitaries.

The White House has said previously it did not expect a Fidel Castro meeting to occur but did not say it was ruled out.

The administration made clear when it set up Obama's trip that he would meet with anti-government dissidents in Havana despite the Cuban leadership's objections to what it sees as meddling in the country's internal affairs.

Rhodes said the list of participants had not been finalized and the meeting would take place in a U.S. facility, which suggests the U.S. embassy or ambassador's residence.

That meeting would take place after official events with Raul Castro.

Cuban dissidents in the past have reported being detained in their homes or picked up by police en route to major international events such as summits or papal visits, but Rhodes said he did not anticipate that happening for Obama's trip.

""We haven't worked out the logistics, but ... they have not suggested that they will throw up those types of obstacles,"" he said, adding the United States would be watching whether Cuba detained or harassed activists in connection with the visit.

Two of Cuba's most prominent dissidents, Berta Soler and Jose Daniel Ferrer, were detained on Tuesday, according to dissident groups.

Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, on Wednesday met with Cuban-American activists and U.S. human rights advocates and told them Obama would meet Cuban ""independent civil society"" representatives chosen by his aides, the White House said.

OUTSTANDING DIFFERENCES

Obama's Republican critics have accused him of playing down human rights concerns in order to pursue rapprochement with Cuba, which began in December 2014 and is now seen as a major piece of his foreign policy legacy.

The Cuban government has done little to reciprocate for a series of U.S. measures that eased restrictions on U.S.-Cuba travel and trade. It is unclear whether it will make any large gestures during Obama's visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president since 1928.

Rhodes countered that the outreach to Cuba was aimed at helping the local population while opening up commercial opportunities for Americans.

The administration plans to roll out further measures next week to chip away at decades-old restrictions to commerce.

Obama also wants to lift the embargo on Cuba, which is only possible through congressional action. Republican leaders in Congress oppose such a move.

Other differences remain. The Obama administration is not considering returning the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay to the Cuban government, and Rhodes said it would not make changes to the Radio and TV Marti broadcasters at this time.

Both issues are irritants that the Cubans consider obstacles to full normalization with Washington.

""The Cubans don't like Radio Marti and TV Marti for sure,"" Rhodes said. ""There's only so much you can get to.""

The U.S. government launched Radio Marti in 1983 and later added TV Marti to transmit anti-communist news and information into Cuba, where the government has a monopoly on the media.

A decision on whether to put an end to a U.S. program that encourages Cuban doctors and nurses on overseas assignments to defect was not tied to the trip either, Rhodes said.

STILL AND MOVING IMAGE MONTAGE OF CHARLIE HEBDO AND PARIS NOVEMBER ATTACKS AND TRIBUTES WITH ENGLISH CAPTIONS STORY: A year after Islamist militants attacked satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket in Paris, France has been commemorating the victims with eulogies, memorial plaques and another cartoon lampooning religion. Heavy security has been planned for the ceremonies honouring the 17 victims of the January 7-9, 2015 gunfire sprees in the French capital, which proved to be a grim forerunner of the suicide bombings and shootings in the city 10 months later in which 130 people died. Charlie Hebdo, known for its satirical covers gleefully ridiculing political and religious leaders, lost many of its top editorial staff when two Islamist militants broke into an editorial meeting on January 7, 2015 and fired bullets at them. Another militant murdered a policewoman the next day, took hostages at the HyperCacher supermarket on January 9, 2015 and killed four of them before police shot him dead. Other police cornered the escaped Charlie Hebdo gunmen in a printing plant north of Paris and killed them that same afternoon. Charlie Hebdo put out a special edition with a cover cartoon showing an angry God with blood on his hands and a Kalashnikov automatic rifle strapped to his back with the headline reading ""One year later, the assassin is still on the run"". An editorial, released before publication on Wednesday, said the magazine would continue despite religious extremists who wanted to muzzle it. ""They won't be the ones to see Charlie die - Charlie will see them kick the bucket,"" it declared. The attacks prompted a worldwide solidarity movement, with the ""Je Suis Charlie"" (I am Charlie) slogan going viral on social media. In the second wave of attacks on November 13, 2015, Islamist militants killed people in Paris cafes and a concert hall and attacked a stadium in what was the nation's worst post-war atrocity. On Tuesday (January 5), President Francois Hollande attended a low-key ceremony unveiling commemorative plaques at the main sites of the January 2015 attacks. He is due to unveil another plaque in memory of the murdered policewoman on Saturday (January 9). On Sunday (January 10), a more public ceremony is planned at Place de la Republique, the square in eastern Paris that attracted mass rallies in favour of free speech and democratic values after the attacks and became an informal memorial.",[]
reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:48:09+00:00,Trump rebounds in White House race; Sanders surprises Clinton,['Ginger Gibson'],"MONROE, N.C. Republican leaders opposed to Donald Trump becoming the party's U.S. presidential candidate warned on Wednesday that the billionaire businessman could become unstoppable if he wins two crucial nominating contests next week.

One of Trump's fiercest critics in the Republican Party, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, said that if the billionaire businessman extends his winning streak into crucial contests next week, the New Yorker's path to the nomination was all but inevitable.

""I'm worried that if we lose Florida and Ohio he may be unstoppable,"" said Graham, a former Republican candidate who was among the party's large field of early White House hopefuls.

With victories in nominating contests on Tuesday in three out of four states, Trump maintained his lead over the three remaining challengers in the race to be the Republican candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election.

On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton's surprise loss to Bernie Sanders in the important Michigan primary laid bare growing voter anger over trade, raising warning flags for her ahead of a possible election showdown against Trump.

On Wednesday, the often-combative Trump struck a more conciliatory tone toward the Republican establishment that has fiercely resisted his advance - first by backing favourite candidates who failed to win votes, then by pouring money into campaigns against him.

""If we embrace what is happening and everyone came together, instead of spending all this money on these ads ...,"" Trump told Fox News. ""If everyone came together, no one could beat the Republican Party. We would walk into Washington.""

He also praised U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan after speaking with him by phone this week, calling the Republican leader a ""good man.""

Trump, 69, fended off a week of attacks from the party's establishment and defied predictions his campaign might be losing steam with his primary wins on Tuesday in Michigan, the biggest prize of the night, as well as Mississippi and Hawaii. His closest challenger, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, won Idaho.

Trump's convincing win in Michigan narrowed prospects for the party's anti-Trump forces to stop him before next Tuesday's contests, which also include Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri.

Trump now has 458 of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination, with Cruz second with 359 delegates, according to the Associated Press. Rival Marco Rubio trails with 151 delegates, while John Kasich is far behind with 54.

ENDORSEMENTS: ANY ONE BUT TRUMP

Cruz, with enough primary victories to present himself as a viable Trump alternative, won the endorsement of former Republican rival Carly Fiorina on Wednesday and appealed to anti-Trump Republicans to back him.

""If you don't want to see Donald Trump as the nominee, if you don't want to hand the election on a silver platter to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, then I ask you to join us,"" Cruz said.

Trump, a former reality TV show host, has peppered his campaign with put-downs of rivals and critics. Many mainstream Republicans have been offended by his statements on Muslims, immigrants and women and alarmed by his threats to international trade deals.

But Cruz, 45, is a hard alternative for some of the mainstream Republican leadership to get behind. A fiscal and social conservative, he is unpopular with fellow senators who were targets of his personal attacks and who blame him for orchestrating a government shutdown in 2013 in a failed attempt to derail President Barack Obama's healthcare reforms.

In January, Graham called a choice between Trump and Cruz like ""being shot or poisoned."" But the senator softened his tone on Wednesday, saying it had become increasingly clear that ""Ted Cruz is the most viable alternative to Donald Trump.""

An aide to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who dropped out of the race last month, said Bush would meet with Cruz, fellow Floridian Rubio, and Kasich, governor of Ohio, in Miami before the March 15 contests. It was not clear if he planned to make an endorsement.

Clinton, 68, won in Mississippi, but the victory in Michigan by her opponent from Vermont was expected to prolong the fight to pick a candidate.

Clinton holds a sizable delegate lead, with 1,221 compared with Sanders' 571. She has been helped by winning Southern states by big margins and keeping most of her losses narrow.

Clinton's campaign has been dogged by questions over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and - in a sign the issue will not go away - the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit on Wednesday seeking emails between Clinton and her aides.

Trump could open a sizable delegate lead if he is able to win next Tuesday in Florida, Ohio, or Illinois, states that allot all their delegates to the winner.

Kasich, 63, of Ohio, and Rubio, 44, of Florida, could throw a wrench into Trump's delegate stash if they win in their home states next week.

ATLANTA Bobbi Kristina Brown's former boyfriend Nick Gordon has been wrongly targeted in the criminal probe of her 2015 death despite his efforts to save her life after finding her unresponsive in a bathtub in her Georgia home, his lawyers said on Tuesday.

The lawyers called on prosecutors to end speculation that the death of late pop singer Whitney Houston's daughter resulted from any criminal behaviour on Gordon's part.

""The truth is that Nick tried to save Bobbi Kristina's life. The truth is that Nick cooperated with law enforcement since day one,"" said lawyers Joe Habachy and Jose Baez.

""The Fulton County District Attorney's office has tried to make Nick a murderer despite having clear and convincing evidence that Bobbi Kristina's death was nothing more than a tragic accident,"" they added in a joint statement.

Fulton County prosecutors have said the investigation into Brown's death is ongoing but have not named any targets of their probe. The office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.

Brown was the only child of R&B singer Bobby Brown and Houston, who drowned in a hotel bathtub in Beverly Hills, California in 2012 at age 48. Bobbi Kristina Brown was 22 at the time of her death.

Autopsy results released last week did not say whether her death resulted from an accident or an intentional act such as suicide or homicide.

The circumstances under which she entered a bathtub in her north Atlanta home were unknown, the autopsy report said, leading the medical examiner to classify her manner of death as undetermined.

The autopsy showed evidence of recent cocaine use, as well as other drugs and alcohol in her system.

Gordon and Bobbi Kristina referred to each other as husband and wife, but Bobby Brown said they never legally married. Gordon said he was barred from visiting her during the six months she spent in a coma before her death last July.

In a lawsuit filed by the conservator of Bobbi Kristina Brown's estate, Gordon has been accused of causing her death and stealing from her bank account while she was in the coma.

""The truth is that no one loved Bobbi Kristina more than Nick and no one has suffered more as a result of her death then Nick,"" his lawyers said.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 19:34:05+00:00,Government loses parliamentary vote on longer Sunday trading hours,['Reuters Editorial'],"EDINBURGH/LONDON British Prime Minister David Cameron was rebuffed in parliament on Wednesday when members of his own party joined with opposition lawmakers to block government plans to allow shops to open for longer on a Sunday.

In sometimes angry exchanges, lawmakers from all sides said there was little demand for such changes, which would put pressure on shop staff to work longer hours.

Cameron's party is already divided over a June 23 vote on whether Britain should remain in the European Union.

Despite the proposed changes referring to England and Wales, the Scottish National Party voted with the rebels.

""Sunday is still special for many and the government should ... ensure that there is a proper place for Sundays, for families, for businesses and for workers,"" Conservative lawmaker David Burrowes, who led the rebellion, said during a three-hour debate.

Under current laws, large stores in England and Wales can open for only six hours on a Sunday. The rules were suspended during the London Olympics in 2012, a change the government said had led to a surge in sales.

The government had planned to give local authorities the power to relax the rules on Sunday trading in their area, and tried to stave off a rebellion by offering a pilot scheme first in a small number of areas.

Many anticipated a domino effect as neighbouring areas had to follow suit or lose business.

The government says the boom in online shopping means high street retailers should be able to open longer to compete.

The SNP, which runs Scotland's devolved government, says it is not opposed to extended Sunday opening as it already exists in Scotland, but objected to the potential loss of income for shop staff who work for employers operating throughout the UK, with UK-wide employment conditions.

More generous pay for working on a Sunday in Scotland could be in jeopardy, they argue.

""As someone who works 9-5, Monday to Friday, I appreciate being able to shop at the weekend. But it would be a shame if people here (in Scotland) have their pay cut because it's been extended to the rest of the country,"" said Anna Grant, 36, a design studio manager, shopping in central Edinburgh.

A report from economic consultancy Biggar Economics said Scotland's workforce could lose 74 million pounds per year because of Sunday trading changes south of the border, with each Scottish worker losing around 1,300 pounds annually.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:58:56+00:00,Myanmar on edge as long wait for new president ends,['Timothy Mclaughlin'],"Myanmar's National League for Democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi arrives for the opening of the new parliament in Naypyitaw February 1, 2016.

NAYPYITAW Four months after Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won a crushing electoral victory over a government made up of former generals, Myanmar's citizens should finally find out who their new president will be on Thursday.

It won't be Suu Kyi. The NLD leader and Nobel peace prize laureate is barred from holding the office under a junta-drafted 2008 constitution because her children are not Myanmar citizens.

The wildly popular Suu Kyi has said that she will run the country regardless through a proxy she would name as president. But she and the NLD leadership have kept the identity of their nominee a closely guarded secret even from rank-and-file MPs.

They have done so partly out of fear a rushed and overly enthusiastic reaction to the election victory could put the sensitive transition at risk. In 1990, the military tossed out results of an election that the NLD won and remained in power.

Suu Kyi has repeatedly said she hoped to reach a compromise with the armed forces that would allow her to assume the presidency.

But talks since the election to bridge the differences failed, sources in her camp said, leading to a deepening rift between Suu Kyi and the military.

The secrecy has fueled a presidential guessing game in a country keen to see the NLD, many of whose members were jailed during years of military rule, complete its transition from democracy movement to ruling party.

Lawmakers from the NLD-dominated parliament that sat for the first time on Feb. 1, said on Wednesday they were eager for the nomination process to get under way.

""It is a very big change, like the Magna Carta,"" said Myint Lwin, a lower house lawmaker from the NLD. ""I'm proud to be involved in this history.""

Speculation on the NLD presidential nominee has ranged from Suu Kyi's personal physician to her chief-of-staff. In recent days, it has focused on her close friend Htin Kyaw. He runs the Daw Khin Kyi Foundation, a charity to assist people in Myanmar's poorest areas founded by Suu Kyi and named after her mother.

RECONCILIATION GESTURE

Three presidential candidates will be nominated on Thursday - one by the lower house, one by the upper house, and one by the military bloc in parliament. The constitution gives the armed forces a quarter of seats in both houses.

""We will propose the vice presidential candidates tomorrow in both Pyithu and Amyotha Hluttaw,"" said NLD spokesman Dr Zaw Myint Maung referring to Myanmar parliament's lower and upper house chambers.

Because the NLD has a comfortable majority in both chambers it will effectively control two of the nominations, with the party's second pick widely expected to be a representative of one of Myanmar's ethnic minorities.

The two losing nominees become vice presidents, meaning that a nominee from an ethnic party would be proposed with that role in mind in line with Suu Kyi's goal of forming a government for national reconciliation.

Local media have named Thet Swe, a former navy chief who stepped down last year to run in the election representing the far flung Coco Islands, as one of the possible nominees for the military.

The three nominees do not need to be lawmakers, but they will be vetted by a parliamentary commission.

After that, both houses of parliament will come together for a joint session to vote on the presidency.

The NLD's huge majority means that whichever candidate it backs as president will win.

The president picks the cabinet that will take over from President Thein Sein's outgoing government on April 1, with the exception of the heads of the home, defense and border security ministries who will be appointed by the armed forces chief.

There was confusion among members of parliament on Wednesday over how soon the presidential vote would take place.

A director from the parliament told Reuters that the vote would not be held until at least Monday.

New NLD members of parliament said they remained in the dark over who would be nominated.

""We only have the news from Facebook,"" said Sein Mya Aye, a lower house NLD lawmaker.

U.N. mediator for Syria, Staffan de Mistura talks to Reuters during an interview at the U.N. in Geneva, Switzerland March 1, 2016.

BEIRUT/GENEVA The Syrian opposition said on Wednesday there had been fewer breaches of a truce agreement by the government and its allies in the past day as a U.N. envoy unveiled plans to resume peace talks next week.

The ""cessation of hostilities agreement"" brokered by the United States and Russia has slowed the war considerably despite accusations of violations on all sides, preparing the ground for talks which the United Nations plans to convene in Geneva.

The talks will coincide with the fifth anniversary of a conflict that began with protests against President Bashar al-Assad before descending into a multi-sided war that has drawn in foreign governments and allowed the growth of Islamic State.

U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura said he planned to launch substantive peace talks on Monday, focusing on issues of Syria's future governance, elections within 18 months, and a new constitution.

While the opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC) has yet to declare whether it will attend, spokesman Salem al-Muslat said it was positive that the talks would ""start ... with discussion of the matter of political transition"".

He said the HNC would announce its decision very soon.

The Syrian government, its position strengthened by more than five months of Russian air strikes, has also yet to say whether it will attend. There was no immediate response from Damascus to de Mistura's remarks. The Syrian foreign minister is due to give a news conference on Saturday at noon (1000 GMT).

Peace talks convened in Geneva two years ago collapsed as the sides' were unable to agree an agenda: Damascus wanted a focus on fighting terrorism - the term it uses for the rebellion - while the opposition wanted talks on transitional government.

TALKS ABORTED

De Mistura aborted a previous attempt to hold talks on Feb. 3 and urged countries in the International Syria Support Group, led by the United States and Russia, to do more preparatory work.

The result was the cessation of hostilities which Western governments say has largely held since it came into effect on Feb. 27. It has been accompanied by more aid deliveries to opposition areas besieged by government forces, though fighting has continued in some important areas of northwestern Syria.

Rebel groups fighting to topple Assad had initially said they would support a two-week halt to the fighting. De Mistura said on Wednesday however that it was an ""open-ended concept"".

The next round of talks would not run beyond March 24. There would then be a break of a week or 10 days before resuming.

Asked if the talks could be delayed further from an original start date of March 7, de Mistura said the format gave him a lot of flexibility.

Jan Egeland, who chairs the Syria humanitarian task force, said the United Nations had delivered aid to 10 of 18 besieged areas across the country in the last four weeks, and was working to overcome obstacles and reach remaining areas.

The truce agreement, accepted by Assad's government and many of his enemies, was the first of its kind in a war that has killed more than 250,000 people and caused a major refugee crisis.

The agreement has not been directly signed by the warring parties and is less binding than a formal ceasefire. It does not cover Islamic State or the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, whose fighters are deployed in western Syria in close proximity to rebel groups that have agreed to cease fire.

Russia says it has recorded opposition violations including supplies of weapons via Turkey to rebels in Syria.

FEWER VIOLATIONS

Muslat of the HNC said: ""The violations of the truce were great at the start, but yesterday they were much fewer. There are perhaps some positive matters that we are seeing.""

Speaking to Reuters, he said a government blockade of the Damascus suburb of Daraya must be lifted in order to ""pave the way to the start of negotiations"". He added this was not a condition for the attending talks but a humanitarian requirement.

Despite the relative success of the cessation of hostilities, the peace talks face great challenges, including the question of Assad's future.

The opposition says Assad must be removed from power at the start of a transition, while some of his Western enemies have backed away from that position, saying he must go at some point.

Russia has said that the matter should not be predetermined and Syrians should be left to choose. Assad has meanwhile ruled out anything that contravene the constitution, including the idea of a transitional governing body sought by the opposition.

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-JubeIr reiterated his government's tough line on Assad, who has also been boosted by Iranian military support. Saudi Arabia, which is in conflict with Iran across the region, has been a major sponsor of the Syrian insurgency.

""The choice for Bashar al-Assad is to either leave through a political process or the Syrian people will continue to fight until militarily they oust him,"" Jubeir said.

A police officer keeps watch near a cemetery where the bodies of soldiers and civilians who were killed during Monday's attack on army and police posts by Islamist fighters will be buried in the town of Ben Guerdan, Tunisia, near the Libyan border March 9, 2016.

TUNIS Tunisian troops have killed 10 Islamist militants around Ben Guerdan on the Libyan border after an Islamic State attack on Monday that killed at least 55 people.

In military raids late on Tuesday and into Wednesday morning around the town, one soldier was also killed. Two of the militants were killed after being tracked to a construction site, the defense and interior ministries said.

About 50 Islamic State militants launched a dawn attack on army and police posts in Ben Guerdan on Monday, Tunisia's government said, in one of the insurgent group's largest assaults on Tunisia. The army killed 36 of the attackers.

Twelve soldiers and seven civilians were also killed.

""Most of the attackers were Tunisians, and the majority of them were already in Ben Guerdan except for a few who infiltrated from Libya or maybe crossed over at the Ras Jdir border point,"" government spokesman Khaled Chaouket said.

Prime Minister Habib Essid blamed the attack on Islamic State, which has grown in strength just over the border in Libya, taking advantage of the chaos there to expand its presence and draw in foreign recruits.

Since its 2011 uprising against autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia has moved toward democracy. But it has also been battling a growing Islamist militancy at home and more than 3,000 Tunisians have left to fight for Islamic State and other jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq.

Tunisian security officials say Tunisians are taking more and more command positions in Islamic State in Libya and Tunisian fighters are returning from Iraq and Syria to join the group there.

A U.S. air strike last month on the Libyan town of Sabratha near Tunisia's border targeted a Tunisian Islamic State commander. At least 40 militants were killed in that strike on an Islamic State training base.

Growing security turmoil in Libya, where two rival governments and armed factions vie for control, has allowed Islamic State to thrive just over Tunisia's border, and Western governments are considering air strikes and special forces operations against the group there.

The new Global Asset Management Group will help boost the investment banking coverage of these alternative asset managers, which will also include pension funds and some family offices.

A Citi spokesman confirmed the contents of the memo.

Ahmad, vice chairman of Citi's institutional clients group, and Coleman, global head of Citi's alternative assets group, will co-head this new group while maintaining their previous responsibilities.

Ahmad and Coleman will also review ""client prioritization"" and make sure the corporate and investment banking teams have the right structure, resources and capital to serve these asset managers, according to the memo.

This increased coverage should help the bank execute more deals for these asset managers, who have previously been served by teams of bankers spread out across the bank.

The newly formed group will work closely with the Financial Institutions Group to bank these clients, and also the markets business, the memo said.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 00:08:10+00:00,"No Obama meeting with Fidel Castro, dissident talks on track: White House","['Matt Spetalnick', 'Jeff Mason']","A picture of former Cuban President Fidel Castro is seen inside a private shop under refurbishment in Havana, February 24, 2016.

WASHINGTON The White House has ruled out an encounter between President Barack Obama and revolutionary leader Fidel Castro in Cuba this month and is confident the Cuban government will not create obstacles to a meeting between Obama and dissidents in Havana, a top adviser said on Wednesday.

Despite the goal of improving ties between former Cold War foes, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Obama would not use his trip to meet Cuba's demands that he shutter Radio and TV Marti, U.S. broadcasters created to transmit anti-communist programing to the island nation.

Obama plans to hold talks with Cuban President Raul Castro during his historic March 20-22 visit but will not meet with Castro's brother, a legendary figure who took power in a 1959 revolution and led Cuba for 49 years.

""We've had no discussion about that meeting taking place, and we certainly wouldn't seek it,"" Rhodes, who was one of the negotiators in secret talks that led to a thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations, told Reuters in an interview.

Asked if a meeting was ruled out, Rhodes said: ""Yes.""

A meeting with the elder Castro could overshadow a trip that is meant to focus on the future of the U.S.-Cuba relationship rather than its troubled past. Castro, 89, stepped down from power after a series of health problems and rarely leaves his Havana home, though he occasionally meets visiting dignitaries.

The White House has said previously it did not expect a Fidel Castro meeting to occur but did not say it was ruled out.

The administration made clear when it set up Obama's trip that he would meet with anti-government dissidents in Havana despite the Cuban leadership's objections to what it sees as meddling in the country's internal affairs.

Rhodes said the list of participants had not been finalized and the meeting would take place in a U.S. facility, which suggests the U.S. embassy or ambassador's residence.

That meeting would take place after official events with Raul Castro.

Cuban dissidents in the past have reported being detained in their homes or picked up by police en route to major international events such as summits or papal visits, but Rhodes said he did not anticipate that happening for Obama's trip.

""We haven't worked out the logistics, but ... they have not suggested that they will throw up those types of obstacles,"" he said, adding the United States would be watching whether Cuba detained or harassed activists in connection with the visit.

Two of Cuba's most prominent dissidents, Berta Soler and Jose Daniel Ferrer, were detained on Tuesday, according to dissident groups.

Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, on Wednesday met with Cuban-American activists and U.S. human rights advocates and told them Obama would meet Cuban ""independent civil society"" representatives chosen by his aides, the White House said.

OUTSTANDING DIFFERENCES

Obama's Republican critics have accused him of playing down human rights concerns in order to pursue rapprochement with Cuba, which began in December 2014 and is now seen as a major piece of his foreign policy legacy.

The Cuban government has done little to reciprocate for a series of U.S. measures that eased restrictions on U.S.-Cuba travel and trade. It is unclear whether it will make any large gestures during Obama's visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president since 1928.

Rhodes countered that the outreach to Cuba was aimed at helping the local population while opening up commercial opportunities for Americans.

The administration plans to roll out further measures next week to chip away at decades-old restrictions to commerce.

Obama also wants to lift the embargo on Cuba, which is only possible through congressional action. Republican leaders in Congress oppose such a move.

Other differences remain. The Obama administration is not considering returning the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay to the Cuban government, and Rhodes said it would not make changes to the Radio and TV Marti broadcasters at this time.

Both issues are irritants that the Cubans consider obstacles to full normalization with Washington.

""The Cubans don't like Radio Marti and TV Marti for sure,"" Rhodes said. ""There's only so much you can get to.""

The U.S. government launched Radio Marti in 1983 and later added TV Marti to transmit anti-communist news and information into Cuba, where the government has a monopoly on the media.

A decision on whether to put an end to a U.S. program that encourages Cuban doctors and nurses on overseas assignments to defect was not tied to the trip either, Rhodes said.

In a long editorial on Wednesday in Communist Party newspaper Granma and other official media, Cuba demanded Washington cease meddling in its internal affairs and said Obama could do more to change U.S. policy.

The White House brushed off the piece and defended the president's trip next month as an opportunity to engage both with Cuba's government and its citizens.

Obama will visit on March 20-22, 15 months after he and Cuban President Raul Castro agreed to end more than five decades of Cold War-era animosity.

They have restored diplomatic ties, and Obama has relaxed a trade sanctions and travel restrictions, leading Republican opponents and some of the president's fellow Democrats to question whether Washington was offering too much without reciprocation from Havana.

But the editorial made it clear that Cuba still has a long list of grievances with the United States, starting with the comprehensive trade embargo. Obama wants to rescind the embargo but Republican leadership in Congress has blocked the move.

Cuba also objected to U.S. support for its political dissidents, whom some Americans consider champions of human rights but whom the Cuban government views as an unrepresentative minority funded by U.S. interests.

""(The United States) should abandon the pretense of fabricating an internal political opposition, paid for with money from U.S. taxpayers,"" the nearly 3,000-word editorial said.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters that Obama's ""long agenda includes visiting with political opposition of the Cuban government and standing up for, in a very tangible way, the universal human rights of the Cuban people.""

Obama visit will be only the second by a U.S. president and the first since the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro that overthrew a pro-American government.

The editorial said Cuba no one should assume Cuba had to ""renounce any of its principles or cede the slightest bit in its defense"" to do so.

The two countries have also negotiated greater cooperation on law enforcement and environmental issues and agreed to resume scheduled commercial flights and postal services. Obama has removed Cuba from a list of state sponsors of terrorism.

The editorial acknowledged Obama had taken positive steps but criticized their ""limited nature and the existence of other regulations and intimidation caused by the overall blockade that has been in force for more than 50 years.""

reuters.com,2016-03-05 16:43:50+00:00,Newly-weds Rupert Murdoch and Jerry Hall blessed in London church,['James Davey'],"LONDON Media mogul Rupert Murdoch and actress and model Jerry Hall celebrated their marriage with a blessing service on Saturday at St. Bride's church on London's Fleet Street, the spiritual home of British journalism.

A star-studded guest list included actor Michael Caine, Irish rockstar Bob Geldof, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and British Justice Secretary Michael Gove, a senior figure among those who want the UK to leave the European Union.

But conspicuous by their absence were Prime Minister David Cameron and finance minister George Osborne, who want Britain to stay in the 28-member bloc.

Murdoch and Hall wed on Friday in a private ceremony in central London, after which the now four-times married 84-year-old said he was the happiest man in the world.

Murdoch, executive chairman of News Corp (NWSA.O) and owner of 21st Century Fox Inc, and Hall, 59, posed for photographs after the service at the historic church, which is famed for its wedding-cake spire, but simply smiled and made no comment to the waiting media.

Texan model and actress Hall was wearing a pale blue chiffon and silk wedding gown, reported to have been designed by Vivienne Westwood, while Murdoch was dressed in a navy suit, white shirt and brown shoes. He sported a single white rose in his breast pocket.

GUEST LIST

The couple's 10 children from previous relationships attended the service, as did Rebekah Brooks, who returned to run Murdoch's British newspapers in September, and Robert Thomson, CEO of News Corp.

Other guests included former Rolling Stone Bill Wyman, artist Tracey Emin, photographer David Bailey and UK employment minister Priti Patel, who like Gove is backing Brexit.

Murdoch is an influential figure in Britain through his ownership of a clutch of newspapers.

Last month his Sun on Sunday publication said Cameron had failed to get a proper deal for Britain from other EU leaders and on Thursday he tweeted that the UK government had made false claims about the implications of Brexit aimed at scaring voters.

Murdoch and Hall began dating last summer after being introduced while in Australia and were first seen in public together at the Rugby Union World Cup Final in London in October. They got engaged in January.

Hall was previously in a long-term relationship with Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger.

St. Bride's is located on Fleet Street, where Britain's major newspapers were located from the 1700s to the 1980s.

Murdoch had an instrumental role in Fleet Street's demise as a press hub when he moved his print works to east London.

""Within months the printing dinosaur that was Fleet Street was dead. By 1989 all the national newspapers had decamped as other proprietors followed Murdoch's lead,"" the church's own website says.

SEOUL North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast city of Wonsan early on Thursday, flying approximately 500 km (300 miles), South Korea's military said.

North Korea has a large stockpile of short-range missiles and is developing long-range and intercontinental missiles.

Reports of the missiles being fired coincide with already heightened tension on the Korean peninsula after the North conducted its fourth nuclear test in January and launched a long-range rocket last month, leading to new U.N. Security Council and bilateral U.S. sanctions.

The North fired six rockets into the sea last week using a multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) from Wonsan, supervised by leader Kim Jong Un who ordered his military to be prepared to launch pre-emptive attacks against enemies.

Kim said on Wednesday his country has miniaturized nuclear warheads to mount on ballistic missiles and ordered improvements in the power and precision of its arsenal in his first direct comment about nuclear warhead miniaturization.

State Department spokesman John Kirby declined to comment on Kim's claim to have miniaturized nuclear warheads and accused him of ""provocative rhetoric.""

""I'd say the young man needs to pay more attention to the North Korean people and taking care of them than in pursuing these sorts of reckless capabilities,"" Kirby said.

The Pentagon said this week it had not seen North Korea demonstrate a capability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead. But Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the department was working on U.S. ballistic missile defenses to be prepared.

North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 but its claim to have set off a miniaturized hydrogen bomb has been disputed by the U.S. and South Korean governments and many experts.

U.S. and South Korean troops began large-scale military drills this week, which the North called ""nuclear war moves"" and threatened to respond with an all-out offensive.

Florida legislators on Wednesday approved abortion restrictions that include requirements for physicians similar to a Texas law currently under review by the Supreme Court and prohibited state funding for routine care at abortion clinics.

The measure imposes regulations that could force clinics to close, provider Planned Parenthood said. Supporters argue it aims to protect women's health, while opponents called it an attack on groups assisting women in terminating pregnancies.

Lets get Florida out of the abortion business, said State Senator Aaron Bean, a Republican from Jacksonville, during a heated debate. Thats what this bill does.

The legislation passed largely along party lines in the Florida House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans. Republican Governor Rick Scott did not immediately say if he will sign it.

Florida is among many states adopting new abortion laws as conservatives seek to chip away at the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision to legalize abortion. Another Florida law passed last year requiring women to wait 24 hours before getting an abortion recently took effect.

The newly passed legislation requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, a type of formal affiliation that can be difficult to obtain, while tightening rules on disposal of aborted fetal tissue.

Clinics would have to meet the more stringent safety standards of ambulatory surgery centers and also face annual inspections.

The legislation blocks state funding for low-income women receiving routine care, such as sexually transmitted disease screening and birth control, at clinics that perform abortions.

What were doing is pulling the rug out from under women who have enough problems in life, said State Senator Gwen Margolis, a Miami Democrat.

The bill is similar to a 2013 Texas law that included admitting privilege requirements for doctors and stringent regulations for clinic buildings. It is under review by the Supreme Court, considering its first major abortion case in years. A ruling is expected by late June.

""Florida would, in one bill, do the damage it took Texas years to inflict on women,"" said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a statement.

The high court has temporarily blocked a similar Louisiana law that had closed clinics in the state.

The Florida legislation would not stop anyone from ending a pregnancy, argued state senator Kelli Stargel, a Republican from Lakeland.

This legislation makes certain that our limited taxpayer dollars are not being used to support organizations that provide elective abortions, she said.

SHANGHAI China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) on Thursday said it has signed a deal for a $3 billion five-year loan, which will help the e-commerce giant as it snaps up stakes in companies within China and overseas.

Alibaba, led by founder Jack Ma, has been expanding in areas beyond its core e-commerce base, such as online video, as volume growth in its online shopping business slows.

The firm said in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it had signed the syndicated loan deal with a group of eight lead arrangers. It added that the amount could increase if there was steep demand.

""The loan, which is subject to upsize through oversubscriptions in syndication, has a five-year bullet maturity and is priced at 110 basis points over LIBOR,"" the company said in the filing, referring to the benchmark interest rate used by many global banks when making loans.

Alibaba added that the loan would be used for ""general corporate purposes"", without expanding on what this meant.

The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury on March 8 and unsealed on Wednesday as the anti-government protesters appeared in a federal court in Portland, supersedes an earlier indictment in the case.

It adds new charges against protest leader Ammon Bundy and other sympathizers who were indicted last month of conspiring to impede federal officers policing the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge during a long-simmering fight over land rights.

The takeover, which began on Jan. 2 with at least a dozen armed men, was sparked by the return to prison of two Oregon ranchers convicted of setting fires that spread to federal property in the vicinity of the refuge.

It also marked the latest flare-up in the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion, a decades-old conflict over federal control of millions of acres in the West.

On Tuesday, a county prosecutor said protest leader Robert ""LaVoy"" Finicum, who was fatally shot by Oregon State Police in late January during a traffic stop, was struck three times in the back during the incident. The prosecutor deemed the slaying ""justified and necessary.""

The superseding indictment lists 26 defendants. Each is charged with the initial charge of conspiring to impede federal agents. It newly accuses some of the protesters of: possession of firearms and dangerous weapons in federal facilities, use and carry of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, and depredation of government property.

That last charge was leveled against protester Sean Anderson and another sympathizer, whose name has been redacted from court documents. It alleges the pair damaged an archeological site considered sacred to the Burns Paiute Tribe through the use of excavation and heavy equipment.

The FBI has said it was working with the Tribe to identify damage to the tribe's artifacts and sacred burial grounds during the 41-day occupation.

Three armed occupiers were also indicted on charges of theft of government property, including a 2012 Ford F-350 Truck and cameras and related equipment.

In his strongest intervention so far in the politically charged debate about Britain's EU referendum, Carney said he was not making any recommendation about how to vote.

But his comments, in an often heated exchange with eurosceptic lawmakers, are likely to be welcomed by Cameron who is battling to swing voters behind the ""In"" campaign.

Britain is due to vote on June 23 on whether to remain in the bloc, raising the possibility of years of uncertainty for the world's fifth-biggest economy if it decides to leave.

Last month, Cameron asked the BoE to set out ""the facts"" about Britain's EU membership.

Carney said the BoE would not assess the long-term implications of the referendum for the economy. But a vote for Brexit, as leaving is widely called, would deliver a short-term hit to growth and sterling, and foreign investment would probably also diminish.

Asked about the implications of an exit for Britain's huge banking industry, Carney said some big financial firms might move business out of Britain if the country did not secure the same kind of access it currently has to the EU. That kind of negotiation could take ""a very long time"", he said.

""One would expect some activity to move,"" Carney told lawmakers in the British parliament. ""I'd say a number of institutions are contingency planning for that possibility.""

Carney, a Canadian, has sought to avoid giving explicit support for either side of the referendum battle.

But a BoE report last year that highlighted benefits to Britain's economy from being in the EU was attacked as political interference by some ""Out"" campaigners.

Jacob Rees-Mogg, a member of the ruling Conservative Party, said on Tuesday it was ""beneath the dignity"" of the BoE to make ""speculative"" comments about the benefits of EU membership and that Carney was damaging the BoE's reputation.

In 2014, Carney made comments that put the economic implications of Scottish independence high in the minds of voters who decided to remain in Britain at a referendum.

Speaking on Tuesday, Carney recognized there were risks from remaining inside the EU due to the greater integration planned by the 19-member euro zone. But he praised a deal struck by Cameron last month that set out the terms of Britain's membership of the EU, saying it would help the BoE do its job.

British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) director general, John Longworth, resigned late on Sunday after he breached the group's neutral stance on the in-out referendum to be held on June 23 by saying that the EU was incapable of meaningful reform and Britain could have a bright economic future outside the bloc.

After his resignation was announced, Longworth criticized Cameron, who argues that Britain's national security and economic stability would be at risk if it votes to leave the 28-nation EU, though his ruling Conservative Party is deeply split.

""It is highly irresponsible of the government of the country to be peddling hyperbole,"" Longworth told the Daily Telegraph newspaper in an interview published on Monday.

""If the government keeps peddling the line that it will be a disaster if we leave, which it actually won't be, they are going to put the country in a position where it will be damaged if we do.""

Longworth's comments mark the latest spat in what is becoming an increasingly divisive battle over Britain's future in the EU. Polls show public opinion is finely balanced and the issue has split senior members of Cameron's cabinet, pitting him against popular London Mayor Boris Johnson.

Announcing Longworth's resignation, BCC president Nora Senior said his personal views on the referendum were ""likely to create confusion regarding the BCC's neutral stance"".

Cameron's office rejected media reports which cited people close to Longworth as saying that it had pressured the BCC to remove him from his position.

""No pressure was applied,"" Cameron's spokeswoman said.

""OUT"" CAMP FURIOUS

The BCC's Senior also said ""no external factors"" had been involved.

""No politician or interest group had any influence on the BCC board decision to suspend Mr Longworth. His subsequent resignation was agreed mutually between Mr Longworth and the BCC,"" she said.

Johnson, the 'Out' campaign's most high-profile backer, said on Sunday it was ""scandalous"" that Longworth had been forced to step aside for what he said was a ""a passionate optimistic view"" on Britain's future prospects outside the EU.

Conservative lawmaker and former defense secretary Liam Fox, who is also campaigning for 'Out', said it was inappropriate to use ""the apparatus of the state"" to put pressure on those expressing their personal views.

The BCC represents thousands of British businesses and its own research indicates a majority of them favor Britain remaining in the EU.

Prominent British companies such as BP and GlaxoSmithKline have cautioned that Britain's $2.9 trillion economy could face years of uncertain negotiations if voters chose to leave the EU. ""Out"" campaigners say such warnings are overblown.

The Republican National Committee filed two lawsuits on Wednesday seeking to obtain emails related to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's tenure as U.S. secretary of state.

Clinton, front-runner to be her party's candidate in November's general election, has faced questions about her emails since it emerged a year ago that she used a private email account and a private server during her time in the post from 2009-2013.

Clinton has apologized for the email arrangement, which is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but has said she did nothing wrong and believes the government will vindicate her.

The RNC said it filed the lawsuits after the State Department failed to respond in a timely manner to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted in December. It sought the information to ensure the public has information to decide if Clinton is ""fit to serve"" as president, the RNC said in a statement.

The first lawsuit seeks emails, BlackBerry Messenger or text messages between then-Secretary of State Clinton and several key senior aides, including her chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, and director of policy planning, Jake Sullivan.

The second lawsuit seeks emails and other electronic exchanges between nearly a dozen State Department officials and any Clinton associate using one of more than a dozen different internet domain names. It covers the period between Feb. 1, 2013, when Clinton left the job, and Dec. 4, 2015.

The request includes any emails to the State Department officials from Clinton's campaign website, HillaryClinton.com, or the website of former President Bill Clinton's foundation, ClintonFoundation.org.

The suit also targets emails from domains like MediaMatters.org, a liberal non-profit group that seeks to counter what it believes is misleading conservative information in the U.S. media.

SAO PAULO Former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva could join Brazil's government if he wishes, the minister in charge of legislative affairs, Ricardo Berzoini, said on Wednesday, a move that would give him some protection from prosecution.

Lula was briefly detained for questioning by police on Friday, after investigators said they had evidence he was among the main political beneficiaries of a kickback scheme at state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro, commonly known as Petrobras.

Brazilian media reported on Wednesday that members of the ruling Workers Party (PT) were pressuring Rousseff to offer Lula a ministerial portfolio in President Dilma Rousseff's cabinet that would shield him from possible detention.

If Lula were appointed to a ministry, he could only be tried in the Supreme Court, placing him out of the reach of the judge in Curitiba pursuing the investigation into kickbacks at Petrobras.

""The ball is in his court,"" Berzoini told Reuters. ""The government is good with it. Which government would not want to have Pele on the field,"" he said, comparing Lula to the legendary Brazilian football player.

According to two sources close to the former president, he is reluctant to join the government but pressure from the Workers Party is having some effect.

""The best chance that he has is to accept a ministry and for the trial to go to the Supreme Court so he receives a fair hearing,"" said one source close to the former president.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 18:16:00+00:00,Big U.S. banks to take on tech rivals with instant payments,['David Henry'],"A sign outside the headquarters of JP Morgan Chase & Co in New York, September 19, 2013.

NEW YORK Depositors at some of the largest U.S. banks are finally going to get the chance to do something quick and simple: send money to another person's account instantaneously by mobile phone.

The idea has been in the works for at least five years, and in the meantime, Silicon Valley has made incursions into the industry's role as a payment intermediary. But now, big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Wells Fargo & Co and U.S. Bancorp are starting to plug into a system they jointly own, called clearXchange, that will allow each others' customers to transfer money in a flash when they split a dinner check, rent payment or vacation bill.

""What we are doing now is delivering payments in real time, which is what our customers have asked for,"" Mary Harman, managing director for payments at Bank of America, said in an interview. The bank is one of two that have started rolling out the system to customers.

While technology companies like PayPal Holdings and Facebook Inc already offer snazzy payment apps that appeal to young consumers, the banking industry has a crucial advantage because it controls how quickly money actually moves between bank accounts. Individuals transferred some $200 billion to one another using mobile phones and computers last year, according to Javelin Strategy & Research.

Bank executives and analysts who closely track payment systems say that if clearXchange is fast, functional and user-friendly, banks can make up for lost ground.

Bank of America plans to announce on Wednesday that its customers can transfer funds instantly through clearXchange with customers of U.S. Bancorp, which said last week that it was plugged into the speediest part of the network. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Capital One Financial Corp representatives told Reuters they plan to offer the service later this year.

Wells Fargo & Co said on Wednesday that it is working to roll out instant payments in the middle of this year.

Analysts expect PNC Financial Services Group Inc will also start this year. A representative declined to comment.

Those six banks are among the seven largest by deposits in the United States. Regional bank BB&T Corp is also one of the seven owners of the network, but is not ready to announce its plans, a spokesman said.

Citigroup, which has the fourth most U.S. deposits, has not joined clearXchange. A spokeswoman declined to say why. Citigroup uses an older network called Popmoney, which is owned by Fiserv Inc, for person-to-person payments.

SLOW TO ADAPT

Today, if a customer wants to transfer cash to another person digitally  whether on an app like Paypal's Venmo, or through an individual bank's payment transfer system, like Chase's QuickPay  it usually takes one to three days for money to move to an account at another institution. On clearXchange, the cash can move instantaneously with the tap of a finger.

The initiative is particularly important for banks as their customer base shifts from a generation that cashed paper checks and got mortgages by walking into a branch, to one that goes online first to transact and borrow. It's important for banks to cater to 18-to-34-year-old Americans in the so-called Millennial generation as they enter their prime years for borrowing and saving.

But adapting to these behavioral changes was a low priority for U.S. banks after the financial crisis, as they grappled with losses, fines, new regulations and slow revenue growth. In short order, financial technology startups filled the void  not just in payments, but in areas ranging from student loans to financial planning. If banks don't catch up quickly, they may end up losing some young customers altogether, analysts said.

""There is a short window of opportunity for the banks,"" said Michael Moeser, director of payments for Javelin.

For clearXchange to be successful, it needs to reach a critical mass of participants so that depositors will be able to transfer funds among most of their friends, relatives and colleagues. Until more banks connect to provide immediate service, the network has little value.

Any U.S. bank or credit union can participate in clearXchange, and its owners hope many more will. The network says its members represent two-thirds of U.S. deposits.

Banks in other parts of the world are making similar moves. In the U.K., for instance, there is an app called Paym that allows individuals to transfer up to 250 pounds ($355) to another user's bank account. Nordic countries are leading the way toward a cashless society, with mobile payment apps Swish in Sweden and MobilePay in Denmark.

Analysts expect the mobile banking market to keep growing as consumers become more aware of apps, and as the technology improves.

VIRAL NATURE

Venmo, which launched in 2012, handled $7.5 billion of person-to-person payments last year. In January, the company moved $1 billion between individuals  up tenfold in two years, said Bill Ready, PayPal's global head of product and engineering, who brought Venmo to PayPal as part of a 2013 deal.

Those figures track well below the $22 billion of cash swapped digitally by Bank of America customers last year, or the $20 billion Chase QuickPay handled. But Venmo is growing rapidly, and its popularity has come almost entirely by word of mouth, as friends ask friends to sign up, said Ready. Facebook's Messenger app offers a similar service.

While these apps send immediate alerts that money is on the way, they still rely on banks to make sure cash is available and move it. And, unlike banks, they have no control over the speed at which that occurs.

""As a Bank of America customer, when I hit send, a couple of seconds later the U.S. Bank customer will see the money in their account,"" said Bank of America's Harman.

Even so, Ready, the senior PayPal executive, said he is skeptical clearXchange will be a success. ""The banks have a hard time working with one another,"" he said, adding that it would be difficult for them to ""recreate the viral nature of Venmo.""

Facebook representatives declined to comment on the banks' plan, but said the company is continuing to improve Messenger's payment functions.

The banking industry's advantage could be short-lived, though. The network that Venmo and others often use to transfer funds will begin phasing in daily settlement in September. That network, called the Automated Clearing House Network, is a not-for-profit association whose members are financial firms.

""If Venmo becomes real-time,"" said Javelin's Moeser, ""then the banks have no differentiator anymore.""

Banks that are part of clearXchange realize they must overcome the buzz and momentum that existing apps have gathered. They are working to come up with a catchier name than clearXchange, and hope to launch a marketing campaign around the middle of this year, said Harman.

""The important thing,"" she said, ""is that we are acting now.""

CAPE TOWN The Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) has provisionally suspended executive committee member Edzai Kasinauyo over allegations he was involved in an attempt to fix an African Nations Cup qualifier scheduled for later this month.

The 40-year-old, who played for Zimbabwe at the Nations Cup finals in 2006, is being investigated over a Group L away game against Swaziland on March 25, ZIFA said in a statement on Wednesday.

Kasinauyo has denied any wrongdoing and said that there was evidence that would exonerate him.

""This is very sensitive issue with far-reaching consequences because it gets to the heart of my integrity, not only as a person but also as a football leader,"" he told Zimbabwe's Herald newspaper, saying that he was in ""total shock"".

""The only relief that I have right now is that I'm being told there is evidence and that will paint the correct picture and help set me free.""

The Confederation of African Football (CAF) issued a statement on Wednesday saying it would liaise with soccer's world ruling body FIFA to ""activate the mechanisms necessary"" to ensure other Nations Cup qualifiers were not open to manipulation.

ZIFA's recent history has been littered with problems and in 2012, after several years of investigation, 13 players and officials were banned for life for match-fixing in what became known as the ""Asiagate"" scandal.

A further 69 were suspended for their part in fixing friendly internationals that Zimbabwe played in Asia, where games were manipulated under the instruction of a Singapore-based betting syndicate.

The last of those suspensions for administrators, match officials, players and coaches were lifted this year as an investigation by FIFA into the matter stalled.

Swaziland and Zimbabwe are top of Africa Nations Cup qualification Group L on four points after two games, with the winners gaining automatic entry to next year's tournament in Gabon. Malawi and Guinea are the other teams in the group.

Place settings and floral arrangements for the State Dinner welcoming Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau are seen during a press preview in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington March 9, 2016.

WASHINGTON The White House is eager to turn the page on the years-long fight over a crude oil pipeline with Canada and celebrate its close economic and security ties with its northern neighbor, U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said on Wednesday.

Trade between the United States and Canada and joint efforts to curb climate change will loom large on the agenda for the meeting between President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Washington on Thursday.

It will be followed by a star-studded state dinner meant to recognize the importance of the bilateral relationship, the first state dinner to honor Canada in 19 years.

Trudeau's Liberals came to power in November by ousting right-wing Conservative leader Stephen Harper, whose ties with Washington deteriorated as he hectored Obama over the Keystone XL pipeline.

President Barack Obama blocked the project last year, a victory for environmentalists who had campaigned against the pipeline.

The spat is in the past, Rice said.

""In any bilateral relationship, there are going to be issues of difference and occasional friction,"" she told Reuters in an interview.

""The complexity and the breadth and the depth of the U.S-Canada relationship is such that no single issue can overshadow the totality of the relationship,"" she said.

Obama and Trudeau will discuss the next steps for the ""Beyond the Border"" initiative, a plan to speed travel and trade, Rice said.

""With the longest peaceful border and $2 billion a day in trade in both directions, we have an enormous shared stake in a border that is open for business and open for travel - and safe,"" Rice said.

Trudeau campaigned to strengthen ties with the United States, but also promised he would pull out six fighter jets from the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

Rice said the White House is satisfied with steps that Trudeau took to beef up training, surveillance and other support to the coalition.

""Taken as a whole, we view the Canadian stepped-up contribution to the counter-ISIL campaign as being very, very valuable and welcome,"" Rice said, using an acronym for Islamic State.

The White House has also watched closely as Trudeau welcomed 25,000 Syrian refugees to Canada in four months.

""We've seen thus far that Canada is taking very seriously its responsibility to its own citizens and to our common security to be vigilant as it welcomes these new refugees,"" Rice said.

NIESR estimated that Britain's economy grew at a quarterly rate of 0.3 percent in the three months to February, down from 0.4 percent in the three months to January.

Britain's economy grew 0.5 percent in the final quarter of 2015, and if growth fell to 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2016, it would be the weakest calendar quarter since late 2012.

NIESR researcher Jack Meaning said this looked unlikely.

""Output growth at the start of 2016 has been subdued,"" he said. ""However, it appears that December 2015 may have been a low point for GDP and ... output growth for the first quarter may strengthen slightly.""

Manufacturing output in January showed a bigger-than-expected rebound after falling in December, official figures showed earlier on Wednesday.

NIESR forecast last month that Britain's economy would grow by 2.3 percent in 2016 as a whole, similar to 2015.

GENEVA Syria's cessation of hostilities is open-ended, U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said on Wednesday, brushing off a perception that the truce needs renewing this weekend.

He told reporters he would now press on with more peace talks - though neither the Syrian government nor the opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC) have confirmed they will attend.

De Mistura said he had heard some of the warring sides had indicated the ceasefire, which started at midnight Feb. 27, would expire in two weeks.

""From the U.N. point of view and the Geneva meetings we have been having on the task force and certainly (the) Munich understanding, there was an open-ended concept regarding the cessation of hostilities,"" he said after a meeting on Syrian humanitarian issues in Geneva.

The Munich meeting in February was a key point in Syrian peace process, when De Mistura asked its international backers, led by the United States and Russia, to do more to make the warring sides come to the table to negotiate.

They hatched a plan for a ceasefire, and the opposition High Negotiations Committee said it would support a two-week halt to the fighting.

De Mistura plans to launch substantive peace talks on Monday, and said they will focus on the core issues of governance, elections within 18 months and a new constitution.

The round of talks would not run beyond March 24, and there would then be a break before resuming, he said, without giving details.

Asked if the talks could be delayed further from an original start date of March 7, De Mistura said the format gave him a lot of flexibility.

The United Nations, which has delivered aid to 10 of 18 besieged areas across Syria in the last four weeks, is working to overcome obstacles and reach remaining areas, said Jan Egeland who chairs the humanitarian task force.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 04:05:25+00:00,ANALYSIS - Sharapova fallout shows sponsors have no tolerance for banned drugs,['Ben Klayman'],"In the day following Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova's admission that she failed a drug test, sponsors Nike, Porsche and Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer dropped her like a hot potato.

Before social media demanded instant responses, sponsors often waited weeks or months before severing ties with an athlete - giving them the benefit of the doubt.

With so much invested in a global sponsorship industry IEG estimates at $60 billion, sponsors now scramble to avoid the taint of scandal so athletes caught doping at the Olympics this summer should also expect a quick end to their lucrative contracts.

""Given the attention that use of performance-enhancing drugs in just about all sports has garnered over the last several years, sponsors are going to cut as quickly as they can,"" said Brian Socolow, head of the sports practice group at Loeb & Loeb law firm, which has represented both athletes and companies in endorsement deals.

""They don't want to get caught sponsoring the next Lance Armstrong,"" he added, referring to the disgraced cyclist who was stripped of seven Tour de France titles and banned for life in 2012 after a U.S. anti-doping probe. Armstrong later admitted using performance-enhancing drugs in a television interview.

While Armstrong's story took years to play out as he initially denied reports of his drug use, Sharapova quickly called a press conference on Monday to say she had tested positive for meldonium, which she said she was taking to treat diabetes and low magnesium. The drug was only banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency as of Jan. 1. [nL1N16F1IE][nL5N16G3S3]

Sports apparel giant Nike Inc (NKE.N) and German carmaker Porsche, a Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) unit, responded by suspending their sponsorship deals, while Tag Heuer, owned by French luxury goods group LVMH (LVMH.PA), ended talks to extend a contract that had expired in December.

Sponsor decisions on whether to stick with a spokesperson or team are driven by money, industry officials said. If they feel the sponsorship can still work, companies stand by their man, woman or sports group, like many have done with soccer's world governing body FIFA or the International Olympic Committee through their respective scandals.

Industry executives agreed Sharapova was smart to get in front of the news, announcing the positive test herself and apologising for her mistake.

As a result, she will likely get a second chance with the public and sponsors alike, industry executives said. However, a lengthy suspension could in effect end her playing career and damage her status as one of the highest paid off-field female athletes. Forbes estimates her off-court career earnings at more than $200 million.

""In many ways, she's the ideal spokesperson for a brand. She's very attractive, highly successful and very competitive,"" said San Diego State University marketing professor George Belch, who has used a Harvard case study about her in his classes to tout her ability as a spokesperson.

Sharapova's failed drug test at January's Australian Open, one of four annual Grand Slam events, will likely lead to a ban for the 28 year old. Still ranked among the top players, she has won five Grand Slam titles in her career.

While some critics argue a double standard exists for female athletes, several industry officials said Tiger Woods' sex scandal or the rape allegations against Kobe Bryant in the past would both play out differently in today's social media-driven culture.

Issues companies may have waited out not long ago, now demand immediate attention, and some believe it being an Olympic year only raises the pressure to move fast.

Consumer products companies like those associated with Sharapova have even more reason to move quickly to distance themselves from bad news, industry officials said.

""It takes a lot of time and money to build a lifestyle brand,"" said Gary Fechter, an attorney at McCarter & English who has represented companies in sponsorship deals for almost four decades.

And for sponsors that may have felt they were overpaying Sharapova, her positive drug test offers a ""back-door out,"" he said.

A source close to the tennis star said her team was encouraged that Nike and Porsche simply suspended their deals rather than terminating them, suggesting the door may be open to reopening them in the future.

In the short term, however, Sharapova's standing will surely take a hit.

Her ""trust"" scores in an index created by the Marketing Arm for clients to measure celebrity influence will likely take a significant dip, managing director Matt Delzell said.

Sharapova currently ranks in the top third, in the range of former New York Yankee all-star shortstop Derek Jeter, comedian Seth Myers and singer Demi Lovato, according to the unit of the Omnicom Group Inc (OMC.N), which books sports personalities for companies.

reuters.com,,Modernist architecture in Eritrea,['Thomas Mukoya'],"Advertisement

In an often forgotten corner of the Horn of Africa, Eritrea's capital boasts one of the worlds finest collections of early 20th century architecture and the authorities want it declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

When Italy's colonial experiment in Eritrea ended in 1941, it left behind an array of Rationalist, Futurist, Art Deco and other Modernist styles in Asmara, a city whose historic heart has changed little since the Italians lived and worked there.

In following decades, conflict ravaged Eritrea, leaving the nation isolated and stifling development. But the violence by-passed the city, and the capital has never been swamped by the kind of construction that raced ahead elsewhere in Africa. Elegant avenues are flanked by the Art Deco Cinema Impero, the imposing lines of the Education Ministry that once housed the Fascist party headquarters and the Futurist Fiat Tagliero garage with gravity-defying concrete cantilevered wings, extending 15 metres either side without the support of pillars.

Fiat Tagliero building designed by the Italian architect Giuseppe Pettazzi. Italian architects used what had been an amalgamation of highland villages centuries earlier as ""an ideal blank canvas"", according to UNESCO's description, to practise what were, at the time, some of the world's most avant garde designs.

Roma Cinema on Samatat Avenue. Italians nicknamed it ""La Piccola Roma"" or ""Little Rome"". ""The city is very intact and maintains its original character,"" said Medhanie Teklemariam, coordinator for the Asmara Heritage Project, which has drawn up an inventory of about 4,300 buildings in Asmara's historic perimeter. The nomination dossier for World Heritage Site status was submitted to UNESCO this year, with a decision expected in 2017.

Faithful sit outside the Nda Mariam Orthodox Cathedral. If approved, Asmara would benefit from technical assistance, helping renovate and preserve the historic buildings, which include offices, government buildings and homes. World Heritage Site status could also draw visitors to a barely trodden tourist trail. Eritrea has soaring mountains and a long Red Sea coast, but no international hotel chains.

Albergo Italia Hotel, built in 1899, stands on Nakfa Avenue. The authorities have also carefully protected the architectural assets, adhering to 1938 building regulations. New planning regulations are being drawn up but some rules, such as limiting buildings to 60 metres high, are likely to remain. ""If we are going to exceed above this height, I think we are going to destroy the skyline of Asmara,"" said Medhanie.

A 52-metre-high bell tower is seen at St. Joseph's Catholic Cathedral on Liberation Avenue. The Italians left their mark in other ways. Pizza and pasta are almost national dishes - and expertly cooked. Italians also brought cycle racing to Eritrea and it has become a national passion - images of Eritrean cyclist Daniel Teklehaimanot, who wore the King of the Mountains jersey in the 2015 Tour de France, are plastered in hotels and shops. Street-side cafes are filled with the grumble and hiss of polished coffee machines serving up espressos and macchiatos.

Seeking to mirror the bigger and older empires of Britain and France, Eritrea was Italy's route ""to enter the big business of imperialism,"" said Federico Niglia, a history professor at Luiss University in Rome. Coinciding with a period when there was an ""explosion of art"" in Italy, Asmara's architecture was one way to show off Italy's approach to colonial management, he added. But Italy's ambitions lay beyond Eritrea, which was seen as simply the starting point of a far grander empire in East Africa. It had long had its eyes on Ethiopia next door, a nation it briefly occupied from 1936 until it was ejected in 1941. Unlike Asmara, a city Italians shaped during several decades there, Addis Ababa's soaring skyline and rapid expansion have overshadowed the few reminders of Ethiopia's brush with Italian rule.",[]

Somali policemen look at the wreckage of a car at the scene of an explosion following an attack in Somalia's capital Mogadishu, March 9, 2016.

MOGADISHU Islamist militants in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, set off a vehicle packed with explosives next to a cafe near a police building on Wednesday, killing at least three police officers.

The Islamist al Shabaab group, which wants to topple the Western-backed government, claimed responsibility. A spokesman for the group told Reuters that 10 police officers were killed, a figure that was higher than the three deaths police reported.

Al Shabaab often cites a higher death toll than the figure given by officials.

""Three police officers died in this car bomb,"" Ali Mohamed Hirsi, the commander of Mogadishu police, told reporters at the scene, where blood was visible near the tea shop frequented by officers. ""The police officers were among police being trained.""

Police said a second device went off, but caused no casualties after police spotted it beforehand and caught two men in the small, three-wheeled vehicle.

In the past two weeks, al Shabaab has launched mortar bomb attacks near the presidential palace, blown up a car bomb near a busy park in Mogadishu, and set off twin blasts in a town northwest of the capital. Dozens of people have been killed.

U.S. air strikes targeted an al Shabaab facility on Saturday and U.S. officials said more than 150 fighters were killed. Al Shabaab confirmed an attack on an area they controlled but said the U.S. casualty figure was exaggerated without giving their own number.

A member of the media, wearing a protective suit and a mask, looks at the No. 3 reactor building at Tokyo Electric Power Co's (TEPCO) tsunami-crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Okuma town, Fukushima prefecture, Japan in this February 10, 2016 file photo.

The robots sent in to find highly radioactive fuel at Fukushima's nuclear reactors have died; a subterranean ""ice wall"" around the crippled plant meant to stop groundwater from becoming contaminated has yet to be finished. And authorities still dont how to dispose of highly radioactive water stored in an ever mounting number of tanks around the site.

Five years ago, one of the worst earthquakes in history triggered a 10-metre high tsunami that crashed into the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station causing multiple meltdowns. Nearly 19,000 people were killed or left missing and 160,000 lost their homes and livelihoods.

Today, the radiation at the Fukushima plant is still so powerful it has proven impossible to get into its bowels to find and remove the extremely dangerous blobs of melted fuel rods.

The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) 9501.t, has made some progress, such as removing hundreds of spent fuel roads in one damaged building. But the technology needed to establish the location of the melted fuel rods in the other three reactors at the plant has not been developed.

It is extremely difficult to access the inside of the nuclear plant,"" Naohero Masuda, Tepco's head of decommissioning said in an interview. ""The biggest obstacle is the radiation.

The fuel rods melted through their containment vessels in the reactors, and no one knows exactly where they are now. This part of the plant is so dangerous to humans, Tepco has been developing robots, which can swim under water and negotiate obstacles in damaged tunnels and piping to search for the melted fuel rods.

But as soon as they get close to the reactors, the radiation destroys their wiring and renders them useless, causing long delays, Masuda said.

Each robot has to be custom-built for each building.It takes two years to develop a single-function robot, Masuda said.

IRRADIATED WATER

Tepco, which was fiercely criticized for its handling of the disaster, says conditions at the Fukushima power station, site of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in Ukraine 30 years ago, have improved dramatically. Radiation levels in many places at the site are now as low as those in Tokyo.

More than 8,000 workers are at the plant at any one time, according to officials on a recent tour. Traffic is constant as they spread across the site, removing debris, building storage tanks, laying piping and preparing to dismantle parts of the plant.

Much of the work involves pumping a steady torrent of water into the wrecked and highly radiated reactors to cool them down. Afterward, the radiated water is then pumped out of the plant and stored in tanks that are proliferating around the site.

What to do with the nearly million tonnes of radioactive water is one of the biggest challenges, said Akiro Ono, the site manager. Ono said he is deeply worried the storage tanks will leak radioactive water in the sea - as they have done several times before - prompting strong criticism for the government.

The utility has so far failed to get the backing of local fishermen to release water it has treated into the ocean.

Ono estimates that Tepco has completed around 10 percent of the work to clear the site up - the decommissioning process could take 30 to 40 years. But until the company locates the fuel, it wont be able to assess progress and final costs, experts say.

The much touted use of X-ray like muon rays has yielded little information about the location of the melted fuel and the last robot inserted into one of the reactors sent only grainy images before breaking down.

ICE WALL

Tepco is building the worlds biggest ice wall to keep groundwater from flowing into the basements of the damaged reactors and getting contaminated.

First suggested in 2013 and strongly backed by the government, the wall was completed in February, after months of delays and questions surrounding its effectiveness. Later this year, Tepco plans to pump water into the wall - which looks a bit like the piping behind a refrigerator - to start the freezing process.

Stopping the ground water intrusion into the plant is critical, said Artie Gunderson, a former nuclear engineer.

The reactors continue to bleed radiation into the ground water and thence into the Pacific Ocean, Gunderson said. ""When Tepco finally stops the groundwater, that will be the end of the beginning.

While he would not rule out the possibility that small amounts of radiation are reaching the ocean, Masuda, the head of decommissioning, said the leaks have ended after the company built a wall along the shoreline near the reactors whose depth goes to below the seabed.

I am not about to say that it is absolutely zero, but because of this wall the amount of release has dramatically dropped, he said.

SEOUL North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast city of Wonsan early on Thursday, flying approximately 500 km (300 miles), South Korea's military said.

North Korea has a large stockpile of short-range missiles and is developing long-range and intercontinental missiles.

Reports of the missiles being fired coincide with already heightened tension on the Korean peninsula after the North conducted its fourth nuclear test in January and launched a long-range rocket last month, leading to new U.N. Security Council and bilateral U.S. sanctions.

The North fired six rockets into the sea last week using a multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) from Wonsan, supervised by leader Kim Jong Un who ordered his military to be prepared to launch pre-emptive attacks against enemies.

Kim said on Wednesday his country has miniaturized nuclear warheads to mount on ballistic missiles and ordered improvements in the power and precision of its arsenal in his first direct comment about nuclear warhead miniaturization.

State Department spokesman John Kirby declined to comment on Kim's claim to have miniaturized nuclear warheads and accused him of ""provocative rhetoric.""

""I'd say the young man needs to pay more attention to the North Korean people and taking care of them than in pursuing these sorts of reckless capabilities,"" Kirby said.

The Pentagon said this week it had not seen North Korea demonstrate a capability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead. But Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the department was working on U.S. ballistic missile defenses to be prepared.

North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 but its claim to have set off a miniaturized hydrogen bomb has been disputed by the U.S. and South Korean governments and many experts.

U.S. and South Korean troops began large-scale military drills this week, which the North called ""nuclear war moves"" and threatened to respond with an all-out offensive.

MILANO/LONDRA Ferrari ha collocato oggi il suo primo bond, a 7 anni da 500 milioni di euro, destinato al rifinanziamento del debito.

L'operazione, attesa gia da qualche tempo e preparata da un roadshow a cui ha partecipato il presidente Sergio Marchionne, ha incassato la buona risposta del mercato con ordini per circa 2,7 miliardi, anche se Ferrari ha dovuto comunque pagare un premio legato alla scelta di emettere senza rating.

Secondo il servizio Ifr di Thomson Reuters, l'obbligazione, senior unsecured con scadenza 16 marzo 2023 e cedola 1,5%, e stata prezzata a reoffer 99,977, per un rendimento a scadenza dell'1,656%, pari ad un premio di 140 pb su midswap. La prima guidance era in area 160 pb, poi rivista in area 145 (+/- 5 pb).

PREMIO DI 70 PB SU EMISSIONE UNRATED

Un operatore ricorda che i lead manager hanno indicato come 'comparable' del bond diverse scadenze (tra 2019 e 2026) di Bmw (rating A+ per S&P), Lvmh (A+), Luxottica (A-) e Adidas (unrated), che oggi scambiano sensibilmente sotto il rendimento di Ferrari.

""Il premio per l'emissione senza rating lo valuto una settantina di punti: tenendo conto di cio il pricing a 140 e stato 'fair'. Altri 20 punti di premio andavano per il fatto che si trattava di una prima emissione, ma questi sono stati riassorbiti in mattinata col book"" afferma l'operatore.

Joint bookrunner dell'operazione sono stati Bnp Paribas, Citi e Jp Morgan, affiancate da Imi, BofA Merrill Lynch, Credit Agricole, Mediobanca, SocGen, Ubs e UniCredit.

'STAND ALONE'

Come preannunciato dalla societa l'emissione andra in particolare a rifinanziare il prestito 'ponte' da 500 milioni concesso dalle banche in seguito alla separazione da Fca, nell'ambito di una linea sindacata da 2,5 miliardi.

""Quella e la cifra che interessava a Ferrari e dunque non si e andati oltre i 500 milioni, anche se il collocamento e andato molto bene"", commenta un lead manager, aggiungendo che l'emissione odierna e probabilmente destinata a rimanere un 'una tantum': ""il business di Ferrari genera cassa e resta sostanzialmente di nicchia, grandi esigenze non ce ne sono"".

A fine 2015 il debito lordo di Ferrari ammontava a 2,26 miliardi, quello netto a 1,938; per il 2016 e previsto un Ebitda adjusted di 770 milioni e un debito netto di 1,950 miliardi [nL8N15H2F2]. Marchionne ha recentemente dichiarato l'intenzione di azzerare il debito netto della societa entro il 2019.

U.S.-based Uber plans to expand in Tanzania, Uganda and Ghana this year and will focus on convincing...

NAIROBI U.S.-based Uber plans to expand in Tanzania, Uganda and Ghana this year and will focus on convincing traditional taxi drivers to work for the ride-hailing service, Alon Lits, Uber's general manager for sub-Saharan Africa, said.

Traffic-clogged roads, high rates of urban crime and a lack of credit card are big challenges Uber faces in sub-Saharan Africa, where it operates in seven cities in South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya.

But its biggest problem is the one it faces from Rome to Rio; the friction with traditional taxi drivers who see Uber as a threat to their livelihoods.

In the Kenyan capital Nairobi, Uber's fastest growing market in sub-Saharan Africa, an Uber driver was attacked and his car torched last month after the government rejected calls by Kenya's taxi association to ban the company.

""Part of our strategy when we launch in new markets will be that engagement up front with taxi operators,"" Lits told Reuters in an interview in Nairobi. ""We will be doing a better job of engaging.""

That strategy will involve convincing traditional taxi drivers to work for Uber, showing them they can continue working on their own, but when they don't have a fare they can also choose to use the Uber smartphone app to pick up passengers and make extra money.

Lits said Uber, which operates in more than 400 cities worldwide, will set up East and West Africa ""hubs"" in Nairobi and Lagos to act as launchpads for forays into Tanzania, Uganda and Ghana, and would begin operating in a second city each in Nigeria and Kenya.

""We feel we are at a point now where we have a strong sense for what it takes to build a successful Uber business in Africa,"" Lits said.

In Europe and North America, Uber accounts are tied to a customer's credit card, eliminating the need for cash. But in sub-Saharan Africa, where only about a third of people own a bank account, low credit cards usage has presented another obstacle to Uber's growth.

Lits said Uber's experiment in Kenya to let riders pay fares with cash or via mobile money had boosted growth in Nairobi, where about 100,000 people open the Uber app once a month.

""It's definitely going to be part of our strategy as we push across Africa,"" he said.

Lits said Uber's overtures to prospective full-time Uber drivers in sub-Saharan Africa - where the company launched in 2013 - will be mainly financial. As with traditional taxis, most Uber drivers rent their vehicles, which eats into their income.

In Kenya and Nigeria, the company is looking to make it cheaper for Uber drivers to rent vehicles.

In South Africa, the company has teamed up with a financing company to help drivers obtain car loans based on their work history with Uber, including the customer ratings they received on the app.

reuters.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,The candidate and the spelling bee,"[""Any Opinions Expressed Here Are The Author's Own"", 'Jonathan Allen']","Is Hillary Clinton a bad speller or just well-versed in the language of diplomacy? In a story on Sunday analyzing the Democratic candidates sending of classified information through her private email server while serving as the nations most senior diplomat, the Washington Post seems to think its the former.

Reported the Post:For example, Clinton wrote an email in July 2012 to Deputy Secretary of State William Burns and other top department officials with the subject line Agrement [sic] for Egypt, the Post writes. Sic is the Latin shorthand newspapers use to denote that they are accurately quoting someone elses grammatical error.

If Clinton had intended to write Agreement then she certainly missed the mark and earned the Posts schoolmarmish [sic]. A more generous reading is that she was using a bit of obscure diplo-speak: agrement is the name given to the process of one country asking another to accept a new ambassador. And both the State Department and the United Nations often render it agrement, dropping the French words accent even when not apparently typing it out on a smartphone.

Matt Lee, an Associated Press journalist and the eminence grise of the U.S. State Departments press corps, drew attention to the Washington Posts possibly erroneous belief that Clinton was in error on his Twitter account, and devoted some of his Sunday to badgering the Post to strike out what he views as an unfair sic.

As of Sunday evening, to Lees irritation, the Posts story online still read: Agrement [sic] for Egypt [sic].",[]

As a Canadian who has lived and worked in the United States for more than 15 years, Ive always felt like a bit of an outsider, with my strangely pronounced words and a deep knowledge of maple syrup.

But with Donald Trumps commanding lead in delegates and polls for the Republican presidential nomination, Im finding that a new dynamic is developing: Americans are coming up to me, shyly and sweetly, and asking how exactly to get out.

In classroom terms, its as if the quirky nerd in the corner suddenly became Homecoming King.

When one friend first raised the question, I laughed. After all, people always make these kind of dramatic proclamations during election season.

So I thought she was kidding. She wasnt.

Im 100 percent serious, she said. Im going to wait until around June to see if hes winning in the polls  and then Im going to ask you what to do.

No wonder Google data editor Simon Rogers reported that, as Super Tuesday results rolled in, searches for How can I move to Canada spiked by 350 percent in just a few hours (later rising by more than 1,000 percent).

The prospect of a Trump-branded White House truly scares some people. Enough to make them actually consider a frosty future north of the 49th parallel, filled with hockey pucks, Tim Hortons coffee and Montreal bagels.

Some of my Canadian compatriots in the United States are even foreseeing some ripe romantic possibilities. One New York City lawyer I know has just seen her value on the dating market skyrocket  she has a Canadian passport and can move back to Vancouver whenever she wants.

As such, she is willing to consider the right American gentleman. But rest assured: The standards just got raised.

For the right offer, I will consider giving my hand in marriage to a smart, funny, catch of an American man looking to flee to Canada, she said, tongue-in-cheek. And by the right offer, I mean we need to fall in love. Wed better get started.

An added bonus: The countrys immigration minister recently said he is planning a new policy of offering permanent residency status to all spouses of Canadians, immediately upon arrival.

Other Canuck friends are noticing the trend, too. One recently attended a literary conference in Arizona. A hot topic among attendees? Moving to Canada if Trump got elected, she marvels. Republicans didnt like him any better than Democrats!

It should be noted, though: My American friends seem to assume, because of my mere Canadian-ness, that I somehow hold magic keys to the country, and can open doors for them. They envision simply walking through those doors, and then skating happily along Ottawas Rideau Canal with Justin Trudeau and a piping mug of hot chocolate.

So let me be clear: I do not run the immigration department. I dont know Justin. I am a freelance writer who lives in Brooklyn with a beagle.

There is a process  a path to citizenship, one might say  just as there is in America, involving countless forms and background checks and waiting periods. (Memo to self: Perhaps build a wall?)

As Trump continues to rack up more states, Canadians are starting to sense the rising panic south of the border. One Nova Scotian even did some expert trolling on social media recently, inviting those frightened of a Trump future to come start a new life in Cape Breton (http://cbiftrumpwins.com/).

But for my frantic American friends, I did feel it was my moral obligation to ask the Canadian government whether these masses of Trump refugees could get some special dispensation, and move to the front of the line.

Sorry, hosers  no dice. All applicants who apply to Canadas immigration programs are treated equally no matter where they are from, a government spokesman replied dryly, pointing potential applicants to the Come to Canada website.

Anyway, maybe none of this shall come to pass. Maybe Trump will lose the election and return to Celebrity Apprentice to fire Dennis Rodman or Gary Busey, and we can all go back to our regularly scheduled programming.

But maybe not, eh?",[]

The opinions expressed are his own.

American courts are taking aim at assault weapons  and putting a freer market in sight. Several federal judges recently upheld bans on the guns, which their makers call modern sporting rifles, adding heft to a Connecticut lawsuit that tests rules shielding firearms manufacturers from liability. The case is still a stretch, but growing recognition of limits on gun rights may eventually force the likes of Remington Arms and Smith & Wesson to compete without unfair legal protection.

The deadly 2012 shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school prompted New York, Maryland and other states to prohibit sales of semi-automatic high-capacity weapons like the AR-15 used in the massacre. Families of the victims targeted the gunmakers themselves, testing a loophole in the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.

That law bars most lawsuits but allows claims of negligent entrustment  supplying a product used to inflict harm. The suit alleges Remington, a gun distributor and a seller owned at the time by private equity firm Cerberus, negligently and willfully entrusted the public with a military-style rifle that was never meant for civilians.

The families face an uphill battle proving the dealer knew or should have known the gun would be used for nefarious purposes, as the law requires. The protections for manufacturers like Remington are even tougher. Yet a judge is hearing the case only about 20 miles from the tragedy, and she seemed receptive to the families arguments at a hearing last month.

Developments beyond Connecticut may also help their case. On Friday, a federal appeals court gave Marylands assault-weapons ban a reprieve, just days before opponents of New Yorks conceded defeat and declined to seek Supreme Court review  citing the death of gun-rights champion Justice Antonin Scalia as a factor. Other appellate judges have let prohibitions on these weapons stand, acknowledging there are highly lethal firearms that even the right to bear arms may not cover.

Thats potentially powerful support for a ruling in favor of the Newtown families. And if their case succeeds, gunsmiths might join virtually every other U.S. company in being legally accountable for selling an unreasonably dangerous product. As things stand now, the likes of Remington, Smith & Wesson and Sturm Ruger can engage in risky behavior that other firms must avoid.

Gun-rights advocates say thats just the price of freedom under the Constitutions Second Amendment. It sounds, however, a lot more like blatantly unfair competition.",[]

The Federal Reserve should remain on track to raise interest rates later this year despite the U.S. economy's weak start to the year and a stock market sell-off...

BOSTON The perpetrators of a $100 million digital heist at Bangladesh's central bank had deep knowledge of the institution's internal workings, likely gained by spying on bank workers, security experts said.

Unknown hackers breached Bangladesh Bank in early February, stole credentials for payment transfers and then ordered transfers out of a Federal Reserve Bank of New York account held by Bangladesh Bank, according to Bangladesh Bank officials.

Bangladesh government officials blamed the Fed for the attack when they disclosed the loss. The New York Fed responded on Tuesday saying there was no evidence its systems were compromised in the attack, one of the biggest bank thefts in history.

The Fed said it followed normal procedures when responding to requests that appeared to be from Bangladesh Bank, which were made and authenticated over SWIFT. Belgian-based SWIFT, a member-owned cooperative that banks use for account transfer requests and other secure messages, declined to comment on specifics of the case.

Security experts said that to pull off the attack, cyber criminals had to first gather information about Bangladesh Bank's procedures for ordering transfers, so that the fraudulent requests would not raise red flags.

In addition to stealing credentials for processing transfers, the hackers likely spied on Bangladesh Bank staff to get a deep understanding of the central bank's operations, according to experts in banking fraud.

Kayvan Alikhani, a senior director with security firm RSA, said that in addition to user names and passwords for accessing SWIFT, the hackers likely needed to obtain cryptographic keys that authenticated the senders.

Such certificates can be copied and used by impostors if they are not properly secured, he said.

You are only as good as your weakest link when getting access to the SWIFT network and doing a transfer, Alikhani said.

In a round of robberies disclosed last year, a group dubbed the Carbanak gang hacked into a number of banks around the world, seized control of computers that access SWIFT, then ordered fraudulent transfers.

They siphoned money through SWIFT after observing how bank employees crafted their messages so they could follow correct protocols, said Juan Guerrero, a researcher with Kaspersky Lab, which studied the campaign.

""The genius of the attacker in the Carbanak case is taking the time to learn directly from the victim and thus bypass fraud prevention measures through sheer mimicry, Guerrero told Reuters.

Another hacking method that could have been used is known as ""social engineering,"" where attackers play on human psychology to manipulate victims.

They get that information by hacking email accounts of employees who process transfers, said Tom Kellermann, a former member of the World Bank's security team.

""They sit and watch regular communications to understand when somebody would be most receptive to a specially crafted social-engineering email instructing them to make the transfer,"" said Kellermann, now chief executive of investment firm Strategic Cyber Ventures.

The New Zealand dollar NZD=D4 nursed losses after tumbling more than a cent after the RBNZ's decision early on Wednesday to cut its official cash rate by 25 basis points to 2.25 percent, citing a material decline in a range of inflation expectation measures. The central bank also signaled at least one more rate cut to come.

The New Zealand currency was last steady around a one-week low at $0.6655, after tumbling from the overnight high of $0.6809.

The ECB is expected to cut the deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.40 percent, announce more asset purchases and possibly introduce tiered interest rates like the Bank of Japan in a bid to boost inflation, according to a Reuters poll published on Monday.

""This is probably not a consensus view, but the market is almost pricing in the entire kitchen sink from the ECB, and I think it's setting itself up for disappointment,"" said Jennifer Vail, head of fixed-income research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon.

While tighter financial conditions a month ago may have warranted more drastic easing steps, some of those conditions have showed signs of improvement, she said, and therefore she expects only a further cut to interest rates into negative territory and a modest increase in purchases under the quantitative easing program.

""The size of their response has to be directly related to stress in the market,"" Vail said, adding that the euro could get a bump higher after the policy meeting outcome.

The common currency was down 0.1 percent at $1.0986 EUR= and slipped about 0.2 percent against the yen to 124.39 EURJPY=.

The dollar was steady against its Japanese counterpart at 113.26 yen JPY=.

Pershing Square, run by activist investor Bill Ackman, bought a stake in Valeant last year when the drugmaker's shares were on the rise. They have fallen 68 percent since.

Valeant said later on Wednesday it had jointly ended litigation with R&O Pharmacy with both sides asking the court to dismiss case. R&O was not immediately available for comment on the settlement.

While Valeant did not disclose the terms of the settlement, it said the resolution included a payment by R&O to Valeant. [nPn3vWq4v]

R&O sued Valeant in federal court in California on Oct. 6, after receiving a demand letter from Valeant for more than $69 million, money that R&O said it did not owe. [nL1N12P0OC]

Valeant later countersued R&O, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Last fall, the company became the target of two U.S. state investigations into its drug pricing practices, and its relationship with Philidor RX Services, a pharmacy selling its dermatology products, came under scrutiny and was dissolved. [nL3N12U450]

During the last two weeks, the company delayed its annual financial filing with regulators, postponed a preliminary earnings announcement, and said it would restate financials. Chief Executive Officer Michael Pearson returned from a two-month medical leave and a top dermatology executive left. It also disclosed an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Stephen Fraidin, a veteran Wall Street lawyer who is vice chairman at Pershing Square, joined the board, Valeant said. He previously worked at the Kirkland & Ellis law firm before joining Pershing last year.

Fred Eshelman, a drug executive who founded Furiex Pharmaceuticals Inc, and Thomas Ross, an academic who is a fellow at Duke University and president emeritus of the University of North Carolina, also joined the board.

Anders Lonner, former CEO of Swedish specialty drug company Meda AB (MEDAa.ST), stepped down from the board, Valeant said. The board now has 14 members.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has an ""underperform"" rating on the stock, said in a research note that Pershing Square had proposed Eshelman for the board at Allergan during its and Valeant's failed hostile bid for the company.

Maris said investors will likely have reservations about Ross as well, given his ties to Duke University, to which CEO Pearson has donated $45 million.

Valeant plans to report preliminary fourth-quarter earnings and hold a conference call on March 15.

On Tuesday, Ackman said the company will reveal ""messy"" fourth- and first-quarter results, and said Valeant needed to stabilize soon. If not, new management will be brought in or the company will be sold, he said.

Valeant's board set up a committee last year to look into the relationship between Valeant and Philidor. As a result of that ongoing investigation, it is restating financials. The committee is advised by Mark Filip, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis.

On Wednesday, its shares rose 6.6 percent to $67.20.

Police fired tear gas around midday, about 150-200 migrants and activists threw stones, and three makeshift shelters were set ablaze, according to a Reuters photographer at the site. Earlier, one person was arrested for trying to stop a group of about 20 workers under heavy police protection from clearing the site, where about 3,000 people are staying. ""The migrants are just going to run and hide in the woods and the police are going to have to go after them,"" said activist Francois Guennoc of the Auberge des Migrants migrant support group. Regional Prefect Fabienne Buccio had said the police presence was needed because ""extremists"" could try to intimidate migrants into turning down housing offers or buses to reception centers. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said last week that authorities would work with humanitarian organizations to relocate the migrants to a nearby park of converted shipping containers or other reception centers around France. On Thursday, a judge upheld a government order to evict migrants living in the southern part of the camp, although a few makeshift buildings of social importance such as a school and a theater are to remain untouched. Thousands of migrants fleeing war and poverty, from Afghanistan to Syria, have converged on the northern port over the past year. Many attempt to climb illegally onto trains using the Channel Tunnel or into lorries heading to Britain where they hope to settle.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:48:09+00:00,Trump rebounds in White House race; Sanders surprises Clinton,['Ginger Gibson'],"MONROE, N.C. Republican leaders opposed to Donald Trump becoming the party's U.S. presidential candidate warned on Wednesday that the billionaire businessman could become unstoppable if he wins two crucial nominating contests next week.

One of Trump's fiercest critics in the Republican Party, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, said that if the billionaire businessman extends his winning streak into crucial contests next week, the New Yorker's path to the nomination was all but inevitable.

""I'm worried that if we lose Florida and Ohio he may be unstoppable,"" said Graham, a former Republican candidate who was among the party's large field of early White House hopefuls.

With victories in nominating contests on Tuesday in three out of four states, Trump maintained his lead over the three remaining challengers in the race to be the Republican candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election.

On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton's surprise loss to Bernie Sanders in the important Michigan primary laid bare growing voter anger over trade, raising warning flags for her ahead of a possible election showdown against Trump.

On Wednesday, the often-combative Trump struck a more conciliatory tone toward the Republican establishment that has fiercely resisted his advance - first by backing favourite candidates who failed to win votes, then by pouring money into campaigns against him.

""If we embrace what is happening and everyone came together, instead of spending all this money on these ads ...,"" Trump told Fox News. ""If everyone came together, no one could beat the Republican Party. We would walk into Washington.""

He also praised U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan after speaking with him by phone this week, calling the Republican leader a ""good man.""

Trump, 69, fended off a week of attacks from the party's establishment and defied predictions his campaign might be losing steam with his primary wins on Tuesday in Michigan, the biggest prize of the night, as well as Mississippi and Hawaii. His closest challenger, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, won Idaho.

Trump's convincing win in Michigan narrowed prospects for the party's anti-Trump forces to stop him before next Tuesday's contests, which also include Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri.

Trump now has 458 of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination, with Cruz second with 359 delegates, according to the Associated Press. Rival Marco Rubio trails with 151 delegates, while John Kasich is far behind with 54.

ENDORSEMENTS: ANY ONE BUT TRUMP

Cruz, with enough primary victories to present himself as a viable Trump alternative, won the endorsement of former Republican rival Carly Fiorina on Wednesday and appealed to anti-Trump Republicans to back him.

""If you don't want to see Donald Trump as the nominee, if you don't want to hand the election on a silver platter to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, then I ask you to join us,"" Cruz said.

Trump, a former reality TV show host, has peppered his campaign with put-downs of rivals and critics. Many mainstream Republicans have been offended by his statements on Muslims, immigrants and women and alarmed by his threats to international trade deals.

But Cruz, 45, is a hard alternative for some of the mainstream Republican leadership to get behind. A fiscal and social conservative, he is unpopular with fellow senators who were targets of his personal attacks and who blame him for orchestrating a government shutdown in 2013 in a failed attempt to derail President Barack Obama's healthcare reforms.

In January, Graham called a choice between Trump and Cruz like ""being shot or poisoned."" But the senator softened his tone on Wednesday, saying it had become increasingly clear that ""Ted Cruz is the most viable alternative to Donald Trump.""

An aide to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who dropped out of the race last month, said Bush would meet with Cruz, fellow Floridian Rubio, and Kasich, governor of Ohio, in Miami before the March 15 contests. It was not clear if he planned to make an endorsement.

Clinton, 68, won in Mississippi, but the victory in Michigan by her opponent from Vermont was expected to prolong the fight to pick a candidate.

Clinton holds a sizable delegate lead, with 1,221 compared with Sanders' 571. She has been helped by winning Southern states by big margins and keeping most of her losses narrow.

Clinton's campaign has been dogged by questions over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and - in a sign the issue will not go away - the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit on Wednesday seeking emails between Clinton and her aides.

Trump could open a sizable delegate lead if he is able to win next Tuesday in Florida, Ohio, or Illinois, states that allot all their delegates to the winner.

Kasich, 63, of Ohio, and Rubio, 44, of Florida, could throw a wrench into Trump's delegate stash if they win in their home states next week.

UNITED NATIONS The United States and Iraq on Wednesday hosted a meeting of senior diplomats and U.N. officials to discuss the possible collapse of the Mosul hydro-electric dam, which U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power said would create a catastrophe of ""epic proportions.""

Mosul dam has sustained structural flaws since its construction in the 1980s. If it collapsed, a wall of water would flood the heavily populated Tigris River valley.

Wednesday's meeting at the United Nations included Power and her Iraqi counterpart, Mohamed Ali Alhakim, experts from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, officials from the U.N. Development Program and Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and other senior diplomats.

""The briefings on the Mosul dam today were chilling,"" Power said in a statement issued by the U.S. mission to the United Nations. ""While important steps have been taken to address a potential breach, the dam could still fail.""

""In the event of a breach, there is the potential in some places for a flood wave up to 14 meters (15 yards) high that could sweep up everything in its path, including people, cars, unexploded ordnance, waste and other hazardous material, further endangering massive population centers,"" she said.

Power said all U.N. member states should be prepared to help prevent what would be ""a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions.""

Approximately 500,000 to 1.47 million Iraqis live in the flood path, the U.S. statement said.

Iraq has signed a contract with Italy's Trevi Group worth 273 million euros (US$296 million) to reinforce and maintain the Mosul dam for 18 months.

Italy has said it planned to send 450 troops to protect the site of the dam, which is 3.6 km (2.2 miles) long and close to territory held by Islamic State militants.

Islamic State militants seized the dam in August 2014, raising fears they might blow it up. It was taken two weeks later by Iraqi government forces backed by U.S.-led coalition air strikes.

The Iraqi government has said it is taking precautions against the dam's collapse, while seeking to play down the risk.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:54:04+00:00,Peru bars Fujimori's biggest rival from presidential race,['Mitra Taj'],"Peru's presidential candidate Julio Guzman attends a news conference after the Special Jury of Elections, which approves presidential tickets, accepted a citizen's petition to declare Guzman's candidacy 'inadmissible' for the upcoming April elections, in Lima March 4, 2016....

LIMA Peru's electoral board kicked the main rival to presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori out of the race on a technicality on Wednesday, removing the front-runner's biggest obstacle to winning the office once held by her jailed father.

Fujimori, a center-right career politician and daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori, looks all but certain to win the April 10 first round after the board's 3-2 decision against centrist technocrat Julio Guzman but she cannot be sure of securing the 50 percent needed to win outright.

The National Jury of Elections ruled Guzman cannot take part in the elections because his party failed to comply with electoral procedures when registering its presidential ticket.

Guzman had been the only candidate seen coming close to tying with Fujimori in a run-off vote, but voters could still punish her in the second round if they feel Guzman and another candidate, Cesar Acuna, were pushed unfairly from the race.

The election winner would replace President Ollanta Humala, whose five year term ends this year.

Guzman, little known just months ago, vowed to keep campaigning while exhausting all legal avenues to get reinstated. He also heaped pressure on the electoral board to bar four other candidates, including Fujimori, from the contest, citing similar questions over compliance with election rules.

""If their cases are not treated with the same criteria, the current election and potential elected authorities will be illegitimate,"" Guzman said in a statement.

Fujimori's opponents accuse her and her running mate of illegally dishing out gifts and prizes to voters while campaigning - accusations she called ""absurd.""

The electoral board also rejected wealthy former governor and center-left populist Acuna's appeal to stay in the race after he gave cash to poor voters while campaigning, in violation of a new law.

Acuna, who had sunk to fourth place amid allegations of plagiarism, said he accepted the decision even though he thought it was undemocratic. Unlike Guzman, Acuna's party can still take part in elections and win congressional seats.

Recent opinion polls indicated the quarter of votes that Guzman and Acuna expected to draw in the first round would be split among several candidates, with Fujimori and former prime minister Pedro Pablo Kuczynski benefiting most.

'HORRIBLE PRECEDENT'

Guzman said he would launch an ""extraordinary"" appeal before the electoral board, a move constitutional lawyers said was unlikely to succeed. Guzman said a delegation from the Organization of American States was traveling to Peru on Monday.

He said he would also seek the intervention of the local courts as well as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, processes that could take months.

Guzman's candidacy bounced between electoral boards for more than a month, exasperating many Peruvians and stoking suspicions of foul play. The electoral board chief, who voted in favor of admitting Guzman, said last month he had received death threats.

Peru's electoral board has not sparked so much controversy since 2000, when it let Alberto Fujimori run for a third term despite a constitutional ban. Fujimori is now serving a 25-year jail sentence for ordering death squads to conduct massacres in the fight to quash a leftist insurgency and for corruption.

""No modern democracy excludes major presidential candidates...for breaking minor rules,"" said Harvard University political scientist Steve Levitsky. ""It's a horrible precedent.""

On the streets of Lima, many voters said Guzman and Acuna deserved to be excluded for breaking rules, but their supporters said that they felt cheated and would spoil their ballots. Voting is mandatory in Peru.

""It's not fair. Supposedly this is a democracy and everyone can take part,"" said Carlos Ortega, a 39-year-old engineer who had intended to vote for Acuna. ""If this continues, the only one left will be Keiko.""

reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:28:37+00:00,Pennsylvania gun control advocates challenge law on city gun rules,['Daniel Kelley'],"PHILADELPHIA Pennsylvania gun control advocates on Wednesday asked the state's top court to knock down a 2014 law allowing gun-rights lobbying groups to sue cities that adopt gun restrictions and recoup legal costs if they prevail.

Firearms advocates, including the National Rifle Association, contend the law is necessary to prevent gun owners from becoming ensnared by a patchwork of municipal ordinances that violate their right to bear arms.

Gun control advocates challenged the law on a technicality - that it passed as part of what they called an unrelated piece of legislation.

""These two bills were cobbled together for political expediency at the end of the legislative session,"" Martin Black, representing five Democratic lawmakers who sued to overturn the law, told the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.More than 80 towns across Pennsylvania repealed gun laws - ranging from requirements that owners report lost or stolen firearms to bans on guns in public parks - rather than face hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal bills to defend ordinances that were seldom enforced. Five municipalities, including Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, have faced lawsuits under the law.

The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the right to bear arms, and efforts to regulate gun ownership are often fiercely contested.

Wednesday's arguments focused on the tortured legislative history of the bill and whether its passage violated a provision of the state's Constitution that specifies that laws must focus on a single issue.

A lower court found last June that the passage was unconstitutional because Republican lawmakers tucked the firearms legislation into a bill dealing with scrap metal.

That bill passed on the final day of the 2014 legislative session and was so rushed that Republican Governor Tom Corbett signed the wrong bill.

Republican legislators said at the time that the language was necessary because towns were ignoring laws that made it a criminal offense for towns to pass gun restrictions.

""What does suing the city over a firearms matter have to do with the theft of copper wire?"" asked a skeptical Justice David Wecht.

Attorney Nick Orloff, arguing on behalf of Republican legislators, said both bills dealt with crime prevention.

""It's meant to deter crime,"" Orloff said.

But Shira Goodman, executive director of CeaseFire PA, scoffed at that idea.

""Say the city of Philadelphia passes a soda tax,"" Goodman said. ""If I don't drink soda, I don't get to sue because I didn't pay the tax.""

Pershing Square, run by activist investor Bill Ackman, bought a stake in Valeant last year when the drugmaker's shares were on the rise. They have fallen 68 percent since.

Valeant said later on Wednesday it had jointly ended litigation with R&O Pharmacy with both sides asking the court to dismiss case. R&O was not immediately available for comment on the settlement.

While Valeant did not disclose the terms of the settlement, it said the resolution included a payment by R&O to Valeant. [nPn3vWq4v]

R&O sued Valeant in federal court in California on Oct. 6, after receiving a demand letter from Valeant for more than $69 million, money that R&O said it did not owe. [nL1N12P0OC]

Valeant later countersued R&O, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Last fall, the company became the target of two U.S. state investigations into its drug pricing practices, and its relationship with Philidor RX Services, a pharmacy selling its dermatology products, came under scrutiny and was dissolved. [nL3N12U450]

During the last two weeks, the company delayed its annual financial filing with regulators, postponed a preliminary earnings announcement, and said it would restate financials. Chief Executive Officer Michael Pearson returned from a two-month medical leave and a top dermatology executive left. It also disclosed an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Stephen Fraidin, a veteran Wall Street lawyer who is vice chairman at Pershing Square, joined the board, Valeant said. He previously worked at the Kirkland & Ellis law firm before joining Pershing last year.

Fred Eshelman, a drug executive who founded Furiex Pharmaceuticals Inc, and Thomas Ross, an academic who is a fellow at Duke University and president emeritus of the University of North Carolina, also joined the board.

Anders Lonner, former CEO of Swedish specialty drug company Meda AB (MEDAa.ST), stepped down from the board, Valeant said. The board now has 14 members.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has an ""underperform"" rating on the stock, said in a research note that Pershing Square had proposed Eshelman for the board at Allergan during its and Valeant's failed hostile bid for the company.

Maris said investors will likely have reservations about Ross as well, given his ties to Duke University, to which CEO Pearson has donated $45 million.

Valeant plans to report preliminary fourth-quarter earnings and hold a conference call on March 15.

On Tuesday, Ackman said the company will reveal ""messy"" fourth- and first-quarter results, and said Valeant needed to stabilize soon. If not, new management will be brought in or the company will be sold, he said.

Valeant's board set up a committee last year to look into the relationship between Valeant and Philidor. As a result of that ongoing investigation, it is restating financials. The committee is advised by Mark Filip, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis.

On Wednesday, its shares rose 6.6 percent to $67.20.

Kaufman, who wrote the screenplays for ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", has not been a presence in the cinema since he made his directorial debut with the highly regarded but quirky ""Synecdoche, New York"" (2008). He is making his return with this 90-minute film focusing on a motivational speaker named Michael, who flies into Cincinnati from Britain on a soul-sapping business trip. Suffering from the type of identity crisis for which Kaufman characters are famous, Michael meets up during his one-night visit with an old flame, who has never gotten over him dumping her, and a woman named Lisa, who has come to hear him speak and who gives Michael new inspiration for life. Kaufman told Reuters that this was ""another experiment."" Having not worked with stop motion animation before, he described it as ""exciting and scary and fun."" Jennifer Jason Leigh (""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"") is Lisa, whom Michael decides to rechristen Anomalisa when he falls for her. David Thewlis (Remus Lupin in ""Harry Potter"") voices Michael and Tom Noonan (""12 Monkeys"" TV series) is everyone else -- from the taxi driver who drives Michael to his hotel, to the receptionist, to everyone, male and female, in the hotel bar and so on. Kaufman said that the idea of Noonan voicing all the other characters was inspired by a psychotic belief called the Fregoli delusion where you think that ""everyone else in the world is the same person."" ""Anomalisa"" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, a Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film, and five Annie Awards. It became the first animated film to win the Grand Jury Prizeat the 72nd Venice International Film Festival, after premiering at the Telluride Film Festival.

He was considered the most successful music producer ever, cited in the Guinness Book of Records for having more than 50 No. 1 hit records over five decades in the United States and Britain alone.

He helped score, arrange, and produce many of the band's biggest hits, including ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand,"" ""A Day in the Life"", Yesterday, ""Eleanor Rigby"" and ""Love Me Do"".

""Im so sad to hear the news of the passing of dear George Martin,"" Beatle Paul McCartney said in a statement on Wednesday.

""If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle it was George.""

A statement from Martin's family confirmed he had died peacefully at his home on Tuesday evening.

Earlier, Ringo Starr, the Beatles' drummer, had announced his death on Twitter: ""God bless George Martin peace and love to Judy and his family... George will be missed.""

Starr followed the message by posting a black and white photo of the Fab Four with Martin, saying ""Thank you for all your love and kindness George.""

Martin served as producer, collaborator and mentor to Beatles John Lennon, George Harrison, McCartney and Starr.

Lennon was shot dead in New York in 1980. Harrison died of cancer in 2001.

Tributes from the music world poured in on Twitter. ""RIP to my musical brother George Martin. We were friends since 1964, & I am so thankful 4 that gift,"" said American music producer Quincy Jones.

Lenny Kravitz said: ""The legends are really going home!"" Boy George said: ""George Martin. Gentleman and legend"", while Mark Ronson said Martin was ""the greatest British record producer of all time.""

Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron said on Twitter: ""George Martin was a giant of music - working with the Fab Four to create the world's most enduring pop music.""

""YESTERDAY""

During his seven-decade career in the music industry, Martin produced almost all of the Beatles' recordings and also worked with Gerry & the Pacemakers, Shirley Bassey, Cilla Black, Jeff Beck, America, Cheap Trick and other acts.

Martin started work at Abbey Road Studios in 1950 producing records for EMI's Parlophone label.

He was noted for his comedy recordings with the likes of Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Beyond the Fringe and got his first Number 1 with The Temperance Seven in 1961. He signed The Beatles in 1962

The young band members were rough around the edges, but Martin saw their commercial promise and with them helped revolutionise the art of popular music recording.

His 1979 autobiography, ""All You Need Is Ears"", chronicles his discovery of the Beatles and their creative process.

Martin was knighted in 1996. In 2006, working with his son, Giles Martin, he helped develop the Beatles-inspired Cirque du Soleil show ""Love"" in Las Vegas, which went on to reap his two most recent Grammys.

Teva, the world's biggest generic drugsmaker, will divest some drugs already on the market and others in the pipeline to address competition concerns by the European Commission, the people said. The package includes products from both Teva and Allergan.

Other sources had previously told Reuters that assets worth about $1 billion in the United States, Europe and the Middle East would be sold in order to secure the green light from regulators.

Teva will gain bigger economies of scale, a crucial element in the low-margin generic drugs business, with the deal, the largest in Israel's corporate history.

The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the case on Thursday, and Teva declined to comment.

The deal, which requires U.S. approval, has triggered a warning from the American Antitrust Institute that a more concentrated generic market usually comes with higher prices. The think-tank also said divestments may not be enough to ensure competition in the market in a letter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in January.

Dublin-based Botox-maker Allergan in turn is to be acquired by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) in a $160 billion deal creating the world's largest drugmaker.

Migrants wave the German flag as they protest at a makeshift camp on the Greek-Macedonian border, near the village of Idomeni, Greece March 9, 2016.

BRUSSELS For the second time since Europe's migration crisis began last year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has stunned her European Union partners by staking her political capital on a unilateral initiative and demanding their support.

After rolling out the welcome mat in September for Syrian refugees streaming into Europe, to the alarm of many European leaders who were not consulted, she has now gambled on a last-minute deal with Turkey to stop the migrant flow.

Whether that tentative bargain - improvised in the middle of the night a week before German regional elections in which her party faces losses - will turn out to be a breakthrough or a landmine in the migrant crisis remains to be seen.

Reaction at home to Merkel's Turkish gamble has been mixed. Top-selling Bild newspaper welcomed the deal with the headline ""Ball in Turkey's court"", but some of her own conservative lawmakers object to giving Turks visa-free travel in exchange.

German officials say it was Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu who surprised everyone by arriving at a meeting with Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in Brussels on Sunday night with a bold plan offering to take back all migrants who cross into Europe in return for political and economic rewards.

Merkel immediately sensed that the deal could ""change the whole dynamic"", a German official said, adding that the gains would far outweigh concessions the EU would make in return.

Davutoglu's price was a doubling of European money to keep Syrian refugees in Turkey, faster visa liberalisation for Turks and accelerated EU membership talks for Ankara.

European Union diplomats and officials in Brussels were flabbergasted by the proposal sprung on them at a summit on Monday, with some irritated at having been kept in the dark during the preparations.

""Ask Mrs Merkel,"" one responded when asked how the idea of sending back all migrants, including Syrian refugees, to Turkey was compatible with international law.

LITTLE CLUE

European Council President Donald Tusk - who chaired Monday's summit - spent two days in Ankara and Istanbul last week meeting Davutoglu and President Tayyip Erdogan, working for a different deal, and was given little clue of what was coming.

Neither Tusk nor European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was invited to the Sunday night preparatory meeting.

Nor was France, Germany's closest European partner, which has minimised its commitment to take in refugees due to security fears since last November's Islamist attacks in Paris but also to the rise of far-right anti-immigration leader Marine Le Pen.

While Merkel took care to involve French President Francois Hollande in her diplomacy with Russia over Ukraine, she turned to Rutte this time as one of the few EU leaders willing to take in Syrian refugees directly from Turkey. Rutte also has a role in running the six-month Dutch presidency of EU meetings.

The proposal for a one-for-one swap in which Europe would admit one Syrian refugee from Turkey for each one the Turks took back from Greek islands - among the most contentious aspects of the draft deal - was first introduced by the Dutch. That left open how many might be brought to Europe - after Merkel found no takers for earlier German suggestions of accepting hundreds of thousands.

Diplomats said that when some leaders asked Tusk why he had not briefed them about the Turkish plan after his trip, he acknowledged that he had not known about the crucial offer to take back all migrants and refugees until Monday morning.

In fact, the former Polish prime minister was caught in a tug-of-war between Merkel and Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann, who infuriated her by holding a conference of central European and Balkan countries last month, without Germany or Greece, to coordinate the closure of their borders to migrants.

""There was a race between Merkel's Plan A and the central Europeans' Plan B, which she suspected Tusk of supporting,"" one EU envoy said. ""So Tusk was sidelined."" Tusk was indeed pushing hard for a closure of the Balkan migration route and had secured broad support for that from EU envoys on Sunday afternoon.

Plan A, which Merkel called a ""European solution"", entailed persuading Ankara to stop migrants leaving its shores, returning those who do not qualify for asylum to home countries or to Turkey, and sharing out legitimate refugees among EU countries.

Plan B, reflecting scepticism that Ankara would deliver and exhaustion with continued arrivals, involved shutting borders across the Balkans and bottling up new migrants in Greece. For Tusk, that was a way of showing the Turks that if they did not halt departures, Europe would act alone and withdraw its offers.

Davutoglu's Plan C was more ambitious than either, but there are big doubts about whether it can be implemented, whether it will work and whether it is legal.

IMPRESSION OF PROGRESS

Although Merkel denied domestic motives, the timing was helpful. The initiative offered a crucial sign of progress six days before votes in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt on which her political future may be riding.

Heavy defeats for her Christian Democrats could weaken her and might raise question marks over her ability to lead the party into next year's general election, although her popularity is still high and no alternative leader is in sight.

The legality, enforceability and feasibility of Davutoglu's offer will only be tested after the state polls.

Officially, the European Commission is clinging to the line that a formal agreement with Turkey to be concluded at the next summit on March 17-18 will ""at the end of it"" comply with both European and international law.

Juncker said European law allowed the return of irregular migrants to any ""safe"" third country, but added that Greece and Turkey would need to amend some domestic rules.

EU insiders say for the proposed arrangement to be legal, Turkey would have to change the way it applies the Geneva Convention on refugees to include non-European nationals, and Greece would have to create a special court to hear asylum seekers' appeals against being sent back to Turkey.

Under EU rules, migrants are entitled to appeal against being returned to a third country on grounds of a risk to their life or safety there, but the court would not consider their claim for protection from their own country.

Merkel's embrace of the Turkish plan may pose political problems for Hollande, British Prime Minister David Cameron - struggling to win a referendum in June on staying in the EU in which immigration is a big issue - and Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, whose country is the most outspoken in the EU about Turkey's human rights record.

However, most fellow leaders are reluctant to resist Merkel, the EU's longest-serving national leader at the head of its most powerful member state, in her hour of political need.

The protest took place at the Blanco Galindo bridge which joins the central city of Cochabamba with the rest of the country. The demonstrators are seeking a 500 boliviano ($72 U.S. dollar) monthly benefit, an increase from the current 83 boliviano ($12 U.S. dollar) monthly amount, and have been protesting for several weeks. A similar protest took place last month. Some demonstrators are going to extremes by allowing themselves to be enclosed for days inside a tiny brick enclosure. One woman, Prima Manuel, said she and the others were getting desperate as they have not received any response from the government. ""We ask the government and authorities to please engage in a dialogue with this sector (of people with disabilities). If they will not hold talks, it doesn't matter. I feel sorry for my colleagues who have to suffer hanging up there in the heat!"" Manuel said. Local media reported the government had allocated some 40 million bolivianos ($5.8 million U.S. dollars) for the disabled. But the pool has been divided into two groups - half has been paid out as a monthly stipend and the other half has been used for funding projects for the disabled. The Cochabamba protesters said the funds going to the projects do not help and they want everything to be paid out as a monthly stipend. Meanwhile, Cochabamba Governor Ivan Canelas told local media the matter had to be solved by the federal government. The demonstrators said they will continue protesting even if it means making a wheelchair-bound march to La Paz. Other cities, such as Potosi, Santa Cruz, Sucre and El Alto, have joined in with protests, which include hunger strikes.",[]
reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:27:52+00:00,Exclusive: Bank of America hiring bankers for new middle-market push - sources,"['Dan Freed', 'Olivia Oran']","Bank of America Corp is hiring a new team of investment bankers who cater to mid-size companies, four years after dismantling a similar business, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The precise number of middle-market bankers it plans to add could not be determined, but one person said it would be fewer than 10.

The hiring comes as Bank of America is reducing staff more broadly, while also trying to grow in areas where it believes it can gain market share. As the second-biggest U.S. lender with a large commercial banking business, executives believe Bank of America can make inroads in advising mid-sized companies on mergers and stock and bond offerings, the sources said. Middle-market deals are generally considered transactions worth less than $500 million.

The bank also hopes the push will lead to additional business such as managing money for executives at mid-sized companies. Sources asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media about matters that have not been made public.

Bank of America announced internally last year that Vice Chairman Mark Stephanz would create a group that provides investment banking services to mid-size companies. The hiring is part of that effort. His team will work together with counterparts in the commercial bank who provide traditional loans and cash management services, sources said.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender previously launched a middle-market business in 2007, with over 30 investment bankers who focused on mergers and acquisitions. It abandoned the effort in 2012 to focus on larger clients and bigger deals, sources said.

In 2015, Bank of America ranked fourth in global M&A league tables, according to Thomson Reuters data. It ranked 23rd globally for middle-market deals.

Bank of America generated around 17 percent of its M&A fees from middle market deals, the lowest percentage of any big Wall Street bank except Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Last year, M&A hit a record volume of nearly $5 trillion, due to mega deals like Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA's $106 billion acquisition of SABMiller Plc and oil firm Royal Dutch Shell Plc's $70 billion purchase of BG Group Plc.

But some Wall Street executives predict blockbuster deals will slow down this year. In January, JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said she expects to see fewer giant mergers and more mid-sized deals.

Bank of America has been hiring salespeople to drum up business, even as it has cut support staff and underperformers as part of a multi-year cost-cutting initiative. Last year alone, it cut more than 10,000 jobs.

The bank laid off a number of investment bankers on Tuesday because of weak markets, one of the sources said.

Por Eduardo Simoes

SAO PAULO O Ministerio Publico Estadual de Sao Paulo apresentou nesta quarta-feira denuncia contra o ex-presidente Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva no caso em que e investigado por suspeita de ser o proprietario oculto de um apartamento triplex no Guaruja, no litoral paulista, informou a assessoria de imprensa do orgao.

O ex-presidente nega ser proprietario do triplex, e sua defesa afirma que o promotor Cassio Conserino, responsavel pela investigacao contra Lula, nao e competente para realizar a investigacao por ter descumprido as regras do Ministerio Publico ao assumir o caso e por ter emitido, ainda na avaliacao da defesa, prejulgamento contra Lula.

O imovel no Guaruja tambem e alvo de investigacoes do Ministerio Publico Federal por alegacoes de que unidades do predio teriam sido usadas para lavagem de dinheiro do pagamento de propina pela construtora OAS, que fez a obra e e uma das investigadas pela operacao Lava Jato.

Em nota apos o anuncio da denuncia do MP, a defesa do Lula afirmou que Conserino ja havia antecipado a imprensa que denunciaria o ex-presidente e que a ""formalizacao do resultado"" apenas deixa claro ""que a apuracao nao foi isenta, decorrendo tao somente da parcialidade e da intencao deliberada de macular a imagem de Lula, imputando crime a pessoa que o promotor sabe ser inocente"".

""Conserino transformou duas visitas a um apartamento no Guaruja em ocultacao de patrimonio. A familia do ex-presidente Lula nunca escondeu que detinha uma cota-parte de um empreendimento da Bancoop (cooperativa imobiliaria dos bancarios), tendo solicitado o resgate desta cota no final de 2015"", afirma a nota, que lembra que o promotor e alvo de sindicancia por sua conduta no caso.

Tambem em nota, o Instituto Lula reiterou a avaliacao de que o promotor prejulgou o caso, que nao e o promotor natural do caso e voltou a dizer que o ex-presidente nao cometeu irregularidades.

""O ex-presidente Lula nao e proprietario nem de triplex no Guaruja nem de sitio em Atibaia, e nao cometeu nenhuma ilegalidade. Ele apresentou sua defesa e documentos que provam isso ao promotor Cassio Conserino"", disse o instituto.

""Essa denuncia so reforca necessidade do Supremo Tribunal Federal de avaliar acao dos advogados do ex-presidente sobre a competencia da investigacao feita em duplicidade pelo Ministerio Publico Federal e pelo Ministerio Publico de Sao Paulo.""

A avaliacao do Palacio do Planalto, segundo uma fonte, sobre a denuncia e que teve um forte componente politico, especialmente por ser anunciada as vesperas das manifestacoes contra o governo, marcadas para o proximo domingo, em todo o pais.

Essa fonte palaciana disse ainda, sob condicao de anonimato, que a denuncia do MP paulista reforca a ideia de que Lula assuma um ministerio, o que lhe daria foro privilegiado junto ao Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) e tiraria o ex-presidente do alcance do MP paulista.

Alem da denuncia pelo MP de Sao Paulo, Lula tambem foi o principal alvo da 24a fase da operacao Lava Jato, que investiga um bilionario esquema de corrupcao na Petrobras, sob suspeita de ter recebido vantagens indevidas de empreiteiras investigadas na Lava Jato.

Entre essas vantagens estariam o triplex no Guaruja e um sitio em Atibaia (SP).

Na ultima sexta-feira, data em que foi deflagrada a fase mais recente da Lava Jato, Lula foi obrigado a prestar depoimento a Policia Federal apos o juiz federal Sergio Moro, que cuida das acoes da Lava Jato na primeira instancia, emitir mandado de conducao coercitiva contra ele.

Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) said on Wednesday it would buy U.S. options exchange operator International Securities Exchange for $1.1 billion from Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1Gn.DE), the latest deal to emerge from a spate of exchange merger talks.

ISE operates three electronic options exchanges which together account for more than 15 percent of U.S. volume, while Nasdaq operates another three. Combined, Nasdaq would command more than 40 percent of the market, extending its lead as the No. 1 U.S. options exchange operator.

""The ability to further that lead gives us advantages as to how we could serve our customers because you have a different volume versus scale arrangement,"" Nasdaq Chief Executive Bob Greifeld said in an interview.

The deal would also free up capital for Deutsche Boerse, which has said it plans to merge with the London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE.L) to create a European trading powerhouse that could better compete against U.S. rivals.

Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) said it may make a rival bid for the LSE, raising the prospects of a takeover battle.

Nasdaq, which plans to move ISE's trading platforms onto Nasdaq technology, said it could strip out $40 million from the two businesses through the transaction.

The deal would also give Nasdaq an additional 20 percent stake in the Options Clearing Corporation, for a total of 40 percent ownership in the world's largest equity derivatives clearing corporation.

Greifeld said he had been looking to buy ISE for years, and talks with Deutsche Boerse CEO Carsten Kengeter picked up over the past three months.

The deal does not include ISE's stake in No. 2 U.S. stock exchange operator BATS Global Markets, or blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings, which will continue to be owned by Deutsche Boerse, the German company said.

Nasdaq said the transaction was expected to be finalized in the second half of the year, pending regulatory approval, and it would likely increase earnings within 12 months of closing.

Nasdaq has made several acquisitions in recent years that have helped boost its profits and share price. These include Chi-X Canada, that country's largest alternative trading system, in a deal that closed last month; and index provider Dorsey, Wright & Associates last year.

WASHINGTON The Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear Apple Inc's challenge to an appellate court decision that it conspired with five publishers to increase e-book prices, meaning it will have to pay $450 million as part of a settlement.

The court's decision not to hear the case leaves in place a June 2015 ruling by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that found Apple (AAPL.O) liable for engaging in a conspiracy that violated federal antitrust laws.

Apple, in asking the high court to hear the case, said the June appeals court decision that the company had conspired with the publishers contradicted Supreme Court precedent and would ""chill innovation and risk-taking.""

The 2nd Circuit's ruling followed a 2013 decision by U.S. District Judge Denise Cote that Apple played a ""central role"" in a conspiracy with publishers to raise e-book prices.

The Justice Department said the scheme caused some e-book prices to rise to $12.99 or $14.99 from the $9.99 price previously charged by market leader Amazon.com Inc.(AMZN.O)

""Apples liability for knowingly conspiring with book publishers to raise the prices of e-books is settled once and for all,"" said Bill Baer, head of the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division.

Publishers that the Justice Department said conspired with Apple include Lagardere SCA's (LAGA.PA) Hachette Book Group Inc, News Corp's (NWSA.O) HarperCollins Publishers LLC, Penguin Group Inc, CBS Corp's (CBS.N) Simon & Schuster Inc and Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH's Macmillan.

RECOMMENDED: A hacker's ransom for Apple customers

On Feb. 17, the appeals court in New York upheld the proposed settlement, which had been challenged by an e-books purchaser.

The publishers were concerned about the price of e-books being pushed down by Amazon while Apple was looking for a way to make its new iPad product a hit and was seeking to break up Amazon's low-cost dominance in the digital book market.

Apple and the publishers agreed on an arrangement in which Apple would get a 30 percent commission and publishers were allowed to set the prices for their books, a tactic known as ""agency pricing"" that prevents discounting.

The publishers also agreed they would charge all outlets the same amount, meaning Amazon was forced to raise its prices. E-books that had cost $9.99 suddenly cost $12.99 or $14.99.

Amazon said in a statement it was ""ready to distribute the court-mandated settlement funds to Kindle customers as soon as were instructed to move forward.""

Apple did not respond to requests for comment.

Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports

Mildronate (Meldonium) medication capsules are pictured on the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, in this November 23, 2010 file photo.

A manufacturing operator works at the Mildronate (Meldonium) medication packaging process in the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, November 23, 2010. Picture taken November 23, 2010.

LONDON, March 9 The medicine Maria Sharapova says she has taken for 10 years due to a family history of heart issues and diabetes is an old drug sold in just a few Eastern European countries that can also boost exercise tolerance.

The tennis star tested positive for the banned drug meldonium, or Mildronate, in a sample taken on January 26, the day of her Australian Open quarter finals defeat to Serena Williams.

RECOMMENDED: Trump's foreign labor practices in the spotlight

She said her family doctor had first given her the drug 10 years ago after she frequently became sick, had irregular electrocardiogram results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.

The 28-year old Russian, a five-time grand slam champion and the highest paid woman in sports, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said.

For the health conditions Sharapova says she has, however, doctors say the scientific evidence for Mildronate is limited compared with many medicines widely available in Europe and the United States, where Sharapova trains, which have full regulatory backing and years of robust safety and efficacy data.

LATVIAN DRUG

Meldonium is cheap and available over the counter without a prescription in some eastern European countries, where it is marketed as Mildronate by the Latvian pharmaceutical firm Grindeks (GRD1R.RI).

The drug, originally developed by scientists at the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, is not licensed by two of the world's biggest medicines regulators: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States where Sharapova trains, and the EU's European Medicines Agency.

RECOMMENDED: Iran tests more missiles, says capable of reaching Israel

A spokeswoman for Grindeks said the firm had not applied for a license for Mildronate from either the FDA or the EMA, but said the drug is registered in Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union.

She said it is designed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular diseases, including angina, chronic heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other cardiovascular disorders.

Grindeks' also promotes it for people with reduced working capacity from physical or psycho-emotional ""overload"", and during recovery from cerebrovascular disorders, head injury and encephalitis. It is not indicated for diabetes.

Tim Chico, a consultant cardiologist at Britain's Sheffield University, said it was unlikely that such a young and extremely fit woman would be suffering from a serious heart condition like angina, or would be able to play top level tennis if she were.

Asked how long the drug should be given to a patient, the Grindeks spokeswoman said in an emailed statement: ""Depending on the patient health condition, treatment course of meldonium preparations may vary from 4 to 6 weeks"". Such courses could be repeated two or three times in a year.

In an emailed reply to questions from Reuters about her medical reasons for using the drug, Sharapova's lawyer John Haggerty said: ""While I cannot go into detail out of respect for the ITF process, I can confirm that Ms Sharapova had abnormal EKG tests in 2006 and was also diagnosed with asthenia (a lack of energy or strength), decreased immunity and diabetes indicators.""

""She also had a family history of heart conditions,"" Haggerty said. ""The Mildronate and the other medicines recommended by her doctor treated these conditions.""

Munir Pirmohamed, a professor of molecular and clinical pharmacology at Britain's University of Liverpool, said the crucial issue with Mildronate for him is its lack of approval from EU and U.S. regulators.

""As a physician, this is not something I have, or would ever, prescribe,"" he said.

Others noted it was rare for a doctor treating illness to prescribe a drug that is unavailable in the country where the patient lives.

""Sharapova has been a U.S. resident since early in her career, which does bring in a question of how or why she is using a drug that is not licensed there,"" said Tom Bassindale, a lecturer in forensic science at Sheffield Hallam University.

Sharapova's agent Max Eisenbud was not available at his Miami office and did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

HELPS MUSCLES COPE

Whatever its medical benefits, research suggests Mildronate may have potential as a performance-enhancing drug for sports.

It reduces the level of a metabolite called carnetine in muscles, and by doing that helps muscles cope better with high levels of stress and low oxygen levels.

""Because it effects the cellular metabolism, it would increase energy production within cells and therefore make oxygen utilization more efficient,"" said Pirmohamed.

In a 2010 academic paper published in a review journal called Seminars in Cardiovascular Medicine and cited on the Grindeks company website, it has been shown to improve exercise tolerance in patients with heart problems.

The World Anti-Doping Agency, which banned the drug in January after previously having it on a ""watch list"", ranks it as a prohibited metabolic modulator and cites ""evidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance.""

Grindeks says the drug could protect athletes from cell damage, but says it would be unlikely to improve their competitive performance.

It would be ""reasonable to recommend (sports people) to use meldonium as a cell protector to avoid heart failure or muscle damage in case of unwanted overload,"" the spokeswoman said.

Athletes ""should not expect increase of physical capacity, but, for sure, they will be protected against ischemic damages of cells in case of overload.""

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks during Question Period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Canada, February 24, 2016.

A cyclist passes U.S. and Canadian flags placed side-by-side on the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House in Washington March 8, 2016.

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are set to discuss new ideas for curbing climate change and expanding trade during an Oval Office meeting this week, White House officials said during a preview on Tuesday.

Trudeau, who pledged to repair frayed ties with the United States when he took office in November, will meet with Obama on Thursday ahead of a star-studded state dinner.

The White House, which sees a natural partner in Trudeau, hopes the two countries can commit to cut methane emissions from the energy sector by 40 percent to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025, and endorse an initiative to stop routine flaring from oil and gas fields, said Todd Stern, the U.S. climate envoy.

The commitment of both leaders to addressing this global challenge is clear and I expect under their leadership North America will make significant progress this year, Stern told reporters.

Stern said the two countries also are looking at ways to make carbon emissions from the aviation sector ""neutral,"" starting in 2020 through the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization.

The United States also hopes to accelerate the timetable to phase out HFCs, industrial gases that have far more potential to trap the earth's heat than carbon dioxide, through an amendment to the Montreal Protocol, Stern said.

On trade, a hot-button issue for both Democrats and Republicans in the race to succeed Obama in the Nov. 8 presidential election, the leaders are likely to discuss two longstanding irritants, softwood lumber and meat labeling.

A deal governing Canadian softwood lumber exports expired last year, and the two nations are talking about a new arrangement, said Mark Feierstein, the White House National Security Council's senior director for the Western hemisphere.

""Were open to exploring all options with Canada at this point,"" Feierstein said, declining to put timelines on when a deal may be reached.

OTTAWA The United States sees no urgent need for a new energy pipeline between Canada and the United States, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday, in a broadcast interview ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

The U.S. government will evaluate new proposals individually, but is looking at new, cleaner technologies, Kerry said to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

""We have some 300 pipelines, it's not as if we're pipeline-less,"" Kerry said, according to a story on the broadcaster's website. ""Things change, technologies in particular help to change things, and we need to push the technology curve.""

Trudeau will attend a state dinner on Thursday, becoming the first Canadian leader to do so since 1997, as the two countries aim to fix a frayed relationship.

U.S. President Barack Obama last year blocked the cross-border Keystone XL crude oil pipeline proposed by TransCanada Corp in a victory for environmentalists.

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama is fully committed to pushing for Congress to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal despite anti-trade sentiment gaining steam on the presidential election campaign trail, National Security Adviser Susan Rice said on Wednesday.

Voter anxiety and anger over international trade and the 12-nation Pacific trade pact have helped propel the campaign of Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, as well as Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.

""The president remains fully committed to working to achieve ratification on the U.S. side and encouraging all of our TPP partners to move through their domestic processes to do the same,"" Rice told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.

For Obama, the TPP is a legacy issue, and standing firm on the pact reassures other nations with high expectations for the deal. At the same time, it highlights a division with Clinton, a close political ally, who has been grappling with Democratic anxiety about trade on the campaign trail.

Obama's commitment to the trade deal means that it will likely remain a hot campaign issue and exposes Clinton to trade-bashing rhetoric ahead of the Nov. 8 vote to elect Obama's successor.

Sanders has accused Clinton of backing ""disastrous"" trade policies that moved manufacturing jobs overseas, and questioned the sincerity of her opposition to the TPP since she became a presidential candidate.

Clinton had supported the trade pact when she was secretary of state during Obama's first term, but later said she was worried the deal would not do enough to crack down on currency manipulation or protect consumers from excessively high drug prices.

Sanders' unexpected victory in the Democratic primary in Michigan on Tuesday suggests that his criticism is resonating with some voters, and could spell trouble ahead for Clinton in states such as Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

Trump's anti-free trade rhetoric and promise to slap taxes on cars and parts shipped in from Mexico have also found support among Republican voters, helping him score a big victory in the party' primary in Michigan on Tuesday.

""There have been times - and this is one of them - where anti-trade sentiment has attained some salience in our domestic politics as well as in other countries,"" Rice said.

""There's been an evolution over the decades in the nature of trade agreements and in the caliber of trade agreements. And I'm not sure that that has fully been absorbed in the public mindset or the political discourse,"" she said.

Obama has repeatedly said that the TPP will expand markets for U.S. exporters and has high standards on labor and the environment that were not part of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.

Rice said policy makers face the challenge of being able to articulate the benefits of TPP and ""to not allow the sort of traditional 'old saws' of the critical narrative about trade to go unchallenged, when to a considerable extent they're based on agreements of the past.""

Rice made her comments ahead of a summit between Obama and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, a nation also wrestling with the merits of the TPP. The economy of Canada, the largest market for U.S. exports, is heavily reliant on open trade with the United States.

However, he said there was still discussion of whether U.S. taxpayer funds could be used to finance the purchase.

President Barack Obama's administration announced on Feb. 12 that it had approved the sale of the Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) aircraft as well as radars and other equipment to Pakistan.

It drew immediate criticism from India and concern from some members of Congress.

Republican Senator Rand Paul in late February invoked legislation known as the Arms Export Control Act in the hope of stopping the sale by passing a Resolution of Disapproval, calling Pakistan ""an uncertain ally.""

Cardin told reporters he opposed Paul's resolution and expected it would fail, with the chamber's Republican and Democratic leaders opposing it. The measure could be taken up by the Senate as soon as Thursday.

Cardin said lawmakers had concerns about Pakistan's nuclear program, commitment to fighting terrorist organizations and cooperation in the Afghanistan peace process but generally supported the sale.

""It was not controversial that Pakistan needs to modernize its air force and its counter insurgency and counter-terrorism activities, particularly in the mountainous territory of the border with Afghanistan,"" he said.

Congress is currently considering a request to ""reprogram"" some funds, in other words, use them for a different purpose than allocated in a budget bill, to help finance the deal.

Cardin said he was not yet prepared to make a judgment on whether U.S. taxpayer funds should be used to help Pakistan with the purchase.

First, they missed Senator Ted Cruzs surging popularity in the Louisiana primary. Then they were totally wrong in the Michigan Democratic race, consistently predicting a double-digit margin of victory for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, not U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who narrowly won Tuesday night.

This week, no doubt, anyone whos in the business of predicting races is busy double-checking their methods.

As the U.S. political polling editor for Reuters, I should say at this point that the Reuters/Ipsos poll doesnt predict state primaries, in part for the simple reason that theyre really hard to get right. Turnout is usually low at state nomination contests, and its tough to determine whos going to show up. In Michigans case, for example, its possible that polls of likely voters focused too heavily on politically active Democrats and not enough on new voters who were inspired by Sanders.

That said, were always looking for ways to improve. This year may turn out to be the year of the frustrated American  when people who were turned off by politics in the past finally showed up to vote. The challenge, then, is to make sure that were fairly accounting for all of these people into our poll.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll is different from many others in that we interview everyone before we decide whos a likely voter. We then consider their reported voting history, registration status, interest in election news and certainty about showing up on Election Day. That wont change, though its possible that well fine-tune this analysis before November after checking our results with primary returns in large states. Were also looking at several other ways to improve the way we predict turnout in the general election like cross-referencing voter files.

Come November, our poll will be put to the test. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was considered one of the most accurate in 2012, and we hope to keep that going this year.",[]

LONDON Athletics superpower Russia is running out of time to eradicate doping and may not be able to send a track and field team to this year's Rio Olympics, Dick Pound, chair of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) independent commission, said on Wednesday.

""There seems to be some evidence that they're just changing deck chairs on the Titanic,"" he told an anti-doping conference.

Russian athletes were banned from international competition after a report by Pound's commission revealing widespread doping and corruption with involvement from Russian and international athletics officials.

Sweeping reforms of Russian athletics authorities were ordered to enable the ban to be lifted.

""My guess is Russia may not make it back for Rio. The IAAF and WADA are not going to risk their reputations by rolling over and playing dead,"" Pound said, referring to the sport's world governing International Association of Athletics Federations.

Last week a German TV documentary contained fresh allegations of malpractice in Russia's anti-doping system.

Amongst the claims in Sunday's ARD program were that Russian coaches suspended in the worst corruption and doping scandal to hit the sport were still working in athletics, while others continued to provide banned substances to athletes.

""We said to them at the time if you stop complaining about the (WADA) report you have a chance. Whether their progress is sufficient enough? I don't think they are devoting all their time and energy into getting where they ought to be.

""We knew it would be a stretch for them but if they devoted themselves, heart and soul, to getting it done, it would be possible. Yet here we are four months later and I think somehow they must have convinced themselves that it would go away.

""Clearly it's not going to go away. Neither WADA nor the IAAF are going to buy a band-aid solution,"" he told Reuters.

The ARD reports in recent months on doping in Russian sport were based on information provided by whistleblowers Vitaly Stepanov, who formerly worked for Russia's anti-doping agency, and his wife Yuliya, an 800 metres runner banned for doping.

FINANCIAL SUPPORT

WADA chairman Craig Reedie, who also addressed delegates, said he had appealed to the IAAF and the International Olympic Committee to allow Yuliya to compete as an independent athlete in Rio.

Reedie said that contrary to media reports, WADA had also offered financial support and relocation to the Stepanovs who currently live in an undisclosed location outside Russia.

""For the record, I, WADA and the anti-doping community are very grateful,"" Reedie said.

Branded as traitors at home, Vitaly, Yuliya and their young son have been in hiding since the documentary aired in December 2014. They have changed residences nine times and are living under assumed names.

""Without them it would have been a case of 'Niet, not possible, it's lies'. They gave us hard evidence,"" Pound said.

Russia, a superpower of the sport alongside the United States, will be allowed to return to competition, including August's Rio Olympics, when it proves to WADA and the IAAF that it has met a series of conditions regarding its anti-doping operation.

Although Reedie said Russia was co-operating, the key was an agreement for the country to fund two independent experts to rebuild its tainted anti-doping unit (RUSADA).

The doping and corruption scandal is amongst the worst in athletics history and has put into question lucrative global sponsorship deals as well as results and medal awards in past international competitions.

Reedie said more investment was needed in clean sport, saying WADA was 'punching above its weight' on a budget of $30 million, about the same amount as a top tennis player can earn in endorsements each year.

""When you look at the damage being done to athletics, the damage to sport, I just wonder why very well resourced commercial companies might not think an investment in clean sport might pay dividends,"" Reedie said.

""Nike know where I am, as do Adidas.""

DETROIT The Virginia Automobile Dealers Association (VADA) on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and Virginia state officials to keep the electric car maker from opening a second dealership in the state.

The VADA claims in the suit filed in circuit court in Fairfax County, Virginia, that Tesla and the state's Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner, Richard D. Holcomb, are violating a 2013 agreement that Tesla could not consider owning and operating a second dealership in Virginia until at least August 2017.

Tesla has a dealership in Tysons Corner in the relatively affluent area of northern Virginia near Washington, D.C., which opened in February 2015.

Don Hall, president of the VADA, said in an interview with Reuters that Tesla and the Virginia DMV tried to keep the VADA in the dark about Tesla's efforts to open a second dealership.

The suit claims that Holcomb named a hearing officer for a DMV hearing of the Tesla request and that a hearing is set for March 31.

""They tried to get this done very quickly, in the dark of the night, in hopes that no one could know about it,"" Hall said.

A member of his organization learned of a real estate deal for property in Richmond for a Tesla store, alerting him to the request and, eventually, the lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Hall said.

Calls to Tesla and to the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles were not immediately returned on Wednesday afternoon.

Tesla has been fighting for the right to own and operate its own dealerships, and has sought to open its own stores in several states despite franchise laws that do not allow, in most cases, a manufacturer to own and operate an auto dealership.

WASHINGTON The White House has ruled out an encounter between President Barack Obama and revolutionary leader Fidel Castro in Cuba this month and is confident the Cuban government will not create obstacles to a meeting between Obama and dissidents in Havana, a top adviser said on Wednesday.

Despite the goal of improving ties between former Cold War foes, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Obama would not use his trip to meet Cuba's demands that he shutter Radio and TV Marti, U.S. broadcasters created to transmit anti-communist programing to the island nation.

Obama plans to hold talks with Cuban President Raul Castro during his historic March 20-22 visit but will not meet with Castro's brother, a legendary figure who took power in a 1959 revolution and led Cuba for 49 years.

""We've had no discussion about that meeting taking place, and we certainly wouldn't seek it,"" Rhodes, who was one of the negotiators in secret talks that led to a thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations, told Reuters in an interview.

Asked if a meeting was ruled out, Rhodes said: ""Yes.""

A meeting with the elder Castro could overshadow a trip that is meant to focus on the future of the U.S.-Cuba relationship rather than its troubled past. Castro, 89, stepped down from power after a series of health problems and rarely leaves his Havana home, though he occasionally meets visiting dignitaries.

The White House has said previously it did not expect a Fidel Castro meeting to occur but did not say it was ruled out.

The administration made clear when it set up Obama's trip that he would meet with anti-government dissidents in Havana despite the Cuban leadership's objections to what it sees as meddling in the country's internal affairs.

Rhodes said the list of participants had not been finalized and the meeting would take place in a U.S. facility, which suggests the U.S. embassy or ambassador's residence.

That meeting would take place after official events with Raul Castro.

Cuban dissidents in the past have reported being detained in their homes or picked up by police en route to major international events such as summits or papal visits, but Rhodes said he did not anticipate that happening for Obama's trip.

""We haven't worked out the logistics, but ... they have not suggested that they will throw up those types of obstacles,"" he said, adding the United States would be watching whether Cuba detained or harassed activists in connection with the visit.

Two of Cuba's most prominent dissidents, Berta Soler and Jose Daniel Ferrer, were detained on Tuesday, according to dissident groups.

Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, on Wednesday met with Cuban-American activists and U.S. human rights advocates and told them Obama would meet Cuban ""independent civil society"" representatives chosen by his aides, the White House said.

OUTSTANDING DIFFERENCES

Obama's Republican critics have accused him of playing down human rights concerns in order to pursue rapprochement with Cuba, which began in December 2014 and is now seen as a major piece of his foreign policy legacy.

The Cuban government has done little to reciprocate for a series of U.S. measures that eased restrictions on U.S.-Cuba travel and trade. It is unclear whether it will make any large gestures during Obama's visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president since 1928.

Rhodes countered that the outreach to Cuba was aimed at helping the local population while opening up commercial opportunities for Americans.

The administration plans to roll out further measures next week to chip away at decades-old restrictions to commerce.

Obama also wants to lift the embargo on Cuba, which is only possible through congressional action. Republican leaders in Congress oppose such a move.

Other differences remain. The Obama administration is not considering returning the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay to the Cuban government, and Rhodes said it would not make changes to the Radio and TV Marti broadcasters at this time.

Both issues are irritants that the Cubans consider obstacles to full normalization with Washington.

""The Cubans don't like Radio Marti and TV Marti for sure,"" Rhodes said. ""There's only so much you can get to.""

The U.S. government launched Radio Marti in 1983 and later added TV Marti to transmit anti-communist news and information into Cuba, where the government has a monopoly on the media.

A decision on whether to put an end to a U.S. program that encourages Cuban doctors and nurses on overseas assignments to defect was not tied to the trip either, Rhodes said.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 19:36:08+00:00,Amazon to start air delivery network with leasing deal,['Sai Sachin R Mari Saito'],"An ''Amazon Fresh'' delivery truck is seen parked in Brooklyn, New York, August 28, 2015.

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said on Wednesday it had signed a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA.N) 767 widebody freighter aircraft to handle more of its own deliveries in the United States.

The deal comes at a time when the world's biggest online retailer is offering ever-faster, and increasingly free, deliveries for millions of online orders.

Amazon, which relies on carriers like United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) to deliver most of its packages, spent $11.5 billion on shipping last year.

In a bid to assume more control over its supply chain and reduce costs, Amazon has rolled out thousands of trailers and launched a programme that uses contract drivers to deliver fast orders.

But analysts said the long-rumoured plan to build its own air fleet posed little threat to the leading delivery companies.

""This is an incremental negative for FDX and UPS as it will likely remove some higher yielding express freight and parcel volume from each of the respective networks,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst John Barnes wrote in a client note.

UPS, the world's No. 1 package delivery company, operates about 240 large planes while FedEx has a fleet of about 370, Barnes noted. FedEx and UPS shares were down about 1.5 percent.

FedEx said on Wednesday the announcement was not a surprise and called Amazon a valuable customer.

""We work closely with Amazon and have been aware for some time about their need for supplemental air capacity related to inventory management,"" said Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications at FedEx.

The leased planes will start to go into operation on April 1, Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email.

Amazon has been testing deliveries by drones but has not said when they would be in service.

The duration of the leases will be five to seven years, lessor Air Transport Services Group Inc (ATSG.O) said.

As part of the agreement, Amazon has the right to buy up to 19.9 percent of ATSG's stock over five years at $9.73 per share.

ATSG's stock soared almost 27 percent to a record high of $14.90, before paring gains to about 16 percent.

The Caisse also announced the appointment of Anita Marangoly George as managing director for South Asia. Based in New Delhi, George will head up the new CDPQ India unit to seek investment opportunities across all asset classes.

Canadian pension funds are expanding into new territories and investing directly in assets such as infrastructure and real estate as they seek alternatives to volatile global equity markets and low-yielding government bonds.

India is viewed as a prime investment opportunity, given its rapid economic growth and burgeoning middle class. The Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, Canada's biggest public pension fund, set up an office in Mumbai last year to scout for opportunities.

Caisse Chief Executive Officer Michael Sabia in a statement cited India's ""scope and quality of investment opportunities, the potential for strategic partnerships with leading Indian entrepreneurs, and the current government's intention to pursue essential economic reforms.""

A estimativa bilionaria foi feita pelo ministro de Minas e Energia, Eduardo Braga, em comunicado que anunciou a autorizacao para prorrogacao de concessoes de campos da Rodada Zero de 1998, a prorrogacao do Repetro e estudos para contratacao sob regime de partilha de areas unitizaveis.

""Estamos sentindo o governo tomando medidas e fazendo acoes no sentido de estimular e dar um sinal para a industria de que o Brasil esta buscando se tornar mais competitivo"", afirmou a Reuters o presidente do Instituto Brasileiro do Petroleo, Gas e Biocombustiveis (IBP), Jorge Camargo.

""A prorrogacao das concessoes esta nessa direcao, assim como Repetro, licitacao da unitizacao... a gente ve com entusiasmo e expectativa porque o Brasil comeca a tomar medidas para se tornar mais atraente"", comentou.

As iniciativas foram listadas em resolucao do Conselho Nacional de Politica Energetica (CNPE), que afirmou que ""o atual cenario mundial vem produzindo fortes impactos no mercado de petroleo e gas... com precos que dificultam a viabilizacao economica dos investimentos"".

Na resolucao, o CNPE autorizou a Agencia Nacional do Petroleo, Gas Natural e Biocombustiveis (ANP) a prorrogar os contratos de concessao da Rodada Zero, quando foram ratificados os direitos da Petrobras sobre os campos que se encontravam em producao antes da quebra do monopolio da estatal nas atividades de exploracao e producao de petroleo e gas natural no pais.

Entre os campos incluidos na Rodada Zero esta Marlim, da Petrobras, um dos maiores produtores do Brasil. A prorrogacao dos contratos permitira maior visibilidade e retorno sobre os investimentos das companhias.

A Rodada Zero tambem confirmou direitos sobre blocos em exploracao e desenvolvimento.

A prorrogacao sera feita apenas para campos cuja extensao do prazo de producao se mostre viavel para alem do periodo contratual original. Para a renovacao, o concessionario devera apresentar novo plano de desenvolvimento, com indicacao de investimentos a serem realizados.

""O prazo de prorrogacao devera ser compativel com as expectativas de producao decorrentes do novo plano de desenvolvimento e dos novos investimentos, limitado a 27 anos"", segundo o texto no Diario Oficial da Uniao.

O CNPE tambem determinou a ANP que em ate 30 dias notifique concessionarias de campos sem producao nos ultimos seis meses para que retomem a atividade nos proximos 12 meses ou transfiram os direitos sobre esses campos para outras empresas.

De acordo com a resolucao, a ANP devera iniciar processo de extincao das concessoes das empresas que nao cumprirem a determinacao.

""Existem campos com capacidade de produzir, mas encontram-se paralisados, comprometendo o aproveitamento racional de recursos energeticos, a geracao de empregos e a arrecadacao de royalties pela Uniao, Estados e municipios"", afirmou o CNPE.

Camargo, do IBP, apoiou a iniciativa do governo e disse que e uma medida comum no setor de petroleo.

""Isso e um movimento muito comum no mundo. As vezes sao campos nao muito atraentes, sao os menores ou em fase madura. A maioria em terra. E, com o preco baixo nao justificaria o investimento para retomar. Acho que o governo faz bem em colocar uma pressao sobre as empresas. Tem que ser feito dentro do arcabouco legal porque e uma concessao"", comentou.

O conselho tambem propos a prorrogacao da vigencia do regime aduaneiro especial de exportacao e importacao de bens destinados a atividades de pesquisa e producao de petroleo, o Repetro.

""Como o Repetro acabaria em 2019 e a industria trabalha com longo prazo, fazer um investimento aqui sem o Repetro inibiria investimentos. Foi uma boa ideia estender porque o governo esta consciente de que o setor de petroleo e gas sera muito importante para ajudar a tirar o Brasil da crise e da recessao"", disse Camargo.

Por fim, o CNPE determinou ao Ministerio de Minas e Energia que conclua estudos necessarios para propor ao conselho os parametros tecnicos e economicos a serem considerados na contratacao, sob o regime de partilha, de areas unitizaveis que extrapolem os blocos concedidos e estejam localizadas dentro do poligono do pre-sal.

Na terca-feira, o secretario de Petroleo e Gas do Ministerio de Minas e Energia, Marco Antonio Almeida, adiantou que o governo pretende realizar em 2017 uma licitacao de areas unitizaveis, ou seja, reservas interligaveis com areas ja licitadas, que sao passiveis de uma exploracao unificada.

""Ha areas no pre-sal que nao evoluem porque um pedaco grande da descoberta esta em area contigua"", explicou Almeida.

Bees impact 50-80 percent of the global food supply, so the issue extends beyond healthy sweeteners.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 14:42:04+00:00,Europe's deal with Turkey fails to deter migrant attempts for now,"['Dasha Afanasieva', 'Melih Aslan']","DIDIM, Turkey Turkey's coastguard intercepted dozens of mostly Syrian migrants in coves along the Aegean coast on Wednesday as they continued to attempt perilous sea crossings to Greece despite Ankara's efforts to stem the flow under a deal with the European Union.

A group of 42 people, more than a dozen of them children, sat inside a coastguard compound, some lying under blankets, in the seaside resort of Didim after being detained. Scores more waited among boulders by the beach, watched by armed police, as a bus came to take them away.

""We're afraid of staying here and afraid of staying in Syria ... We're fleeing to the country that will take us. We want safety, someone to care for us,"" said Sameeha Abdullah, one of the group near the beach, who fled Syria's civil war.

Just offshore, a coastguard boat approached what appeared to be a small vessel carrying more migrants. Some officials fear a scramble to cross to the nearby Greek islands, despite increased NATO-backed sea patrols in the Aegean, before the tentative agreement with the EU comes into full force.

Under the draft deal struck on Monday, Turkey agreed to take back all irregular migrants in exchange for more funding, an earlier introduction of visa-free travel to Europe for Turks, and a speeding up of Ankara's long-stalled EU membership talks.

The aim, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and EU leaders have said, is to discourage illegal migrants and break the business model of human smugglers who have fuelled Europe's largest migration crisis since World War Two. The message, they say, is simple: try to cross illegally and get sent straight back.

But in a shabby sea-front hotel in Didim, off whose coast 25 migrants drowned on Sunday when their boat capsized, few had heard of the deal. A group of migrants from the Iraqi city of Mosul, stuck because they could not afford to pay the smugglers, said they were still determined to leave.

""Even if they catch me, what am I going to do here? I may as well die trying,"" said Hussein, 45, who said his three sons were killed by Islamic State militants in Iraq.

The hotelier, who gave his name as Enes, said a group of 20 Syrians, whom he collectively charged 500 lira ($170) for the night, had left yesterday for Europe. But he was sure more would come.

""Even if Europe gave Turkey hundreds of billions for refugees, Syrians still wouldn't stay. Most of their family is there so they're joining them,"" he said.

LEGALITY QUESTIONED

Turkey has no intention of sending refugees back to conflict zones and sees no legal hurdles to implementing the deal, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Wednesday, after meetings with Belgian officials in Ankara.

EU and Turkish officials are scrambling to finalise the deal before their next summit on March 17-18, and Cavusoglu said the bloc had largely accepted Turkey's terms.

But the United Nations and human rights groups have warned that blanket returns without considering individual asylum cases could be illegal. And it remains far from clear that the message will get through to desperate families who see smuggling as their surest route into Europe as its borders close.

Even as groups of migrants were detained on the beaches, more arrived by taxi in Didim, a popular holiday resort with yachts bobbing in its marina. Some carried bags, children in tow, and headed for the town's small hotels, which like in other parts of the Aegean coast, have been profiting from migrant business in the tourism low season.

""The markets, the hotels, the restaurants - everyone was smiling. Because of the refugees we eat bread,"" said the manager of one hostel. The hostel is in Basmane, a run-down neighbourhood of Izmir, the main city on the Turkish Aegean coast and long a stopover for migrants trying to reach Europe during the Iraq wars and Arab Spring uprisings.

NEW GROUPS ARRIVING

More than a million people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and beyond have flooded into the EU since early 2015, most crossing the Aegean from Turkey to Greece in small boats, then heading north through the Balkans to Germany.

Border shutdowns further north have blocked the 'Balkans corridor', leaving tens of thousands of migrants trapped in Greece. Macedonia has closed its border to illegal migrants after Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia announced tight new restrictions on migrant entry.

Rights group Amnesty International called the proposed mass return of migrants under the EU deal with Turkey a ""death blow to the right to seek asylum"". Relief charity Doctors without Borders said it was cynical and inhumane.

But Davutoglu insisted the preliminary deal would not stop Syrian refugees legitimately seeking shelter in Europe. He and Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras signed an amendment to the countries' readmission agreement late on Tuesday to make returning third country nationals easier.

""The aim here is to discourage irregular migration and ... to recognise those Syrians in our camps who the EU will accept - though we will not force anyone to go against their will - on legal routes,"" he said after a meeting with Tsipras in Izmir.

Under the tentative deal with Ankara, the EU would admit one refugee directly from Turkey for each Syrian it took back from the Greek Aegean islands. Those who attempted the sea route illegally would be returned and go to the back of the queue.

With new groups of migrants from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere continuing to arrive along Turkey's coast in the hope of crossing to Greece, that message appears for now not to be getting through, to the frustration of some local residents.

""Whatever's necessary should be done. The refugees should be gathered in one spot in my opinion. Everything should be done to ensure everyone's comfort, peace and welfare,"" said Armagan Gulcicek, an Izmir resident in a street full of cafes and stores popular with migrants, some of them selling life jackets.

""Lets put an end to this nonsense.""

reuters.com,2016-03-09 18:05:57+00:00,'Fifth Beatle' George Martin dies aged 90,['Reuters Editorial'],"LOS ANGELES/LONDON George Martin, known as ""the fifth Beatle"" for his work in shaping the band that became one of the world's most influential music forces, has died at the age of 90.

He was considered the most successful music producer ever, cited in the Guinness Book of Records for having more than 50 No. 1 hit records over five decades in the United States and Britain alone.

He helped score, arrange, and produce many of the band's biggest hits, including ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand,"" ""A Day in the Life"", Yesterday, ""Eleanor Rigby"" and ""Love Me Do"".

""Im so sad to hear the news of the passing of dear George Martin,"" Beatle Paul McCartney said in a statement on Wednesday.

""If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle it was George.""

A statement from Martin's family confirmed he had died peacefully at his home on Tuesday evening.

Earlier, Ringo Starr, the Beatles' drummer, had announced his death on Twitter: ""God bless George Martin peace and love to Judy and his family... George will be missed.""

Starr followed the message by posting a black and white photo of the Fab Four with Martin, saying ""Thank you for all your love and kindness George.""

Martin served as producer, collaborator and mentor to Beatles John Lennon, George Harrison, McCartney and Starr.

Lennon was shot dead in New York in 1980. Harrison died of cancer in 2001.

Tributes from the music world poured in on Twitter. ""RIP to my musical brother George Martin. We were friends since 1964, & I am so thankful 4 that gift,"" said American music producer Quincy Jones.

Lenny Kravitz said: ""The legends are really going home!"" Boy George said: ""George Martin. Gentleman and legend"", while Mark Ronson said Martin was ""the greatest British record producer of all time.""

Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron said on Twitter: ""George Martin was a giant of music - working with the Fab Four to create the world's most enduring pop music.""

""YESTERDAY""

During his seven-decade career in the music industry, Martin produced almost all of the Beatles' recordings and also worked with Gerry & the Pacemakers, Shirley Bassey, Cilla Black, Jeff Beck, America, Cheap Trick and other acts.

Martin started work at Abbey Road Studios in 1950 producing records for EMI's Parlophone label.

He was noted for his comedy recordings with the likes of Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Beyond the Fringe and got his first Number 1 with The Temperance Seven in 1961. He signed The Beatles in 1962

The young band members were rough around the edges, but Martin saw their commercial promise and with them helped revolutionise the art of popular music recording.

His 1979 autobiography, ""All You Need Is Ears"", chronicles his discovery of the Beatles and their creative process.

Martin was knighted in 1996. In 2006, working with his son, Giles Martin, he helped develop the Beatles-inspired Cirque du Soleil show ""Love"" in Las Vegas, which went on to reap his two most recent Grammys.

NEW YORK Oil prices rose as much as 5 percent on Wednesday, with U.S. crude hitting three-month highs after a big gasoline inventory drawdown amid improving demand overshadowed growing record high crude stockpiles.

Speculation that top producers might agree soon to an output freeze also supported crude oil.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled up $1.42, or about 4 percent, at $41.07 a barrel.

U.S. crude futures CLc1 finished up $1.79, or 5 percent, at $38.29 a barrel after hitting a three-month high of $38.51.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude stockpiles USOILC=ECI rose 3.9 million barrels last week to reach nearly 522 million barrels, in its fourth week of building to record highs.[EIA/S]

But gasoline inventories USOILG=ECI fell 4.5 million barrels, nearly triple forecasts, in the largest weekly draw in almost two years.

U.S. gasoline demand over past four weeks was 7 percent higher than a year ago, the EIA said.

""Gasoline is the star of the show today,"" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at New York-headquartered energy data provider ClipperData. ""Ongoing strength in demand has yielded a large draw to gasoline inventories despite a rebound in refinery runs.""

U.S. gasoline futures RBc1 hit six-month highs, rallying 6 percent. The crack spread for gasoline 1RBc1-CLc1, a measure of profit margin refiners get for turning a barrel of crude into the motor fuel, scaled seven-month highs.

Oil has gained about 50 percent from 12-year lows hit less than two months ago, since OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Venezuela, along with non-OPEC exporter Russia, pledged to leave supply at January's levels if others cooperated.

Some analysts said the rally was excessive.

""We feel that values could consolidate well into next week or longer, prior to enough momentum shift to force an ultimate $9-10 crude price cut,"" said Jim Ritterbusch at Chicago-based oil advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates.

Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said it expected this year's average price of crude to be lower than last year's, reflecting the glut.

Oil rallied earlier in the day after an Iraqi oil official told a state newspaper that producers in and outside of OPEC plan to meet in Moscow on March 20 to discuss the output freeze. Russia's energy ministry, however, said no date or place had been set.

Credit ratings agency Moody's warned of more output declines if oil producers defaulted on debt because of low prices. Reuters exclusively reported that Saudi Arabia was seeking its first significant foreign borrowing in over a decade to help cover a record budget deficit from weak crude prices.

UNITED NATIONS The United States and Iraq on Wednesday hosted a meeting of senior diplomats and U.N. officials to discuss the possible collapse of the Mosul hydro-electric dam, which U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power said would create a catastrophe of ""epic proportions.""

Mosul dam has sustained structural flaws since its construction in the 1980s. If it collapsed, a wall of water would flood the heavily populated Tigris River valley.

Wednesday's meeting at the United Nations included Power and her Iraqi counterpart, Mohamed Ali Alhakim, experts from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, officials from the U.N. Development Program and Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and other senior diplomats.

""The briefings on the Mosul dam today were chilling,"" Power said in a statement issued by the U.S. mission to the United Nations. ""While important steps have been taken to address a potential breach, the dam could still fail.""

""In the event of a breach, there is the potential in some places for a flood wave up to 14 meters (15 yards) high that could sweep up everything in its path, including people, cars, unexploded ordnance, waste and other hazardous material, further endangering massive population centers,"" she said.

Power said all U.N. member states should be prepared to help prevent what would be ""a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions.""

Approximately 500,000 to 1.47 million Iraqis live in the flood path, the U.S. statement said.

Iraq has signed a contract with Italy's Trevi Group worth 273 million euros (US$296 million) to reinforce and maintain the Mosul dam for 18 months.

Italy has said it planned to send 450 troops to protect the site of the dam, which is 3.6 km (2.2 miles) long and close to territory held by Islamic State militants.

Islamic State militants seized the dam in August 2014, raising fears they might blow it up. It was taken two weeks later by Iraqi government forces backed by U.S.-led coalition air strikes.

The Iraqi government has said it is taking precautions against the dam's collapse, while seeking to play down the risk.

Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, World Health Organization (WHO) Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation attends a news conference on the Zika virus at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, March 9, 2016.

GENEVA Widespread spraying to eliminate mosquitoes has failed to significantly stop the spread of dengue fever and it may be the same case for the Zika virus linked to neurological disorders, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday.

The emphasis should be put on enlisting families and communities to protect themselves and eliminate from their homes the mosquitoes that carry the disease, which has spread rapidly in Brazil and Latin America, it said.

Releasing genetically modified mosquitoes or irradiating insects also needed to be studied, but evaluation of such novel methods should be done with ""extreme rigor"", the WHO warned.

A three-day meeting of experts set two other top priorities for research: speeding development of tools to diagnose Zika infections and of vaccines to prevent the disease. But they said vaccine trials may come too late for the current outbreak.

WHO Assistant Director General Marie-Paule Kieny said experts had told the meeting that there was no evidence that traditional mosquito control methods had had any significant impact on transmission of dengue, a virus close to Zika.

""This is important because we must be sure that we invest in interventions that work,"" Kieny told a news briefing.

""Certainly it is worth continuing to try to use this method for the lack of other interventions.""

She said the Aedes aegyptii species of mosquito that carries Zika is the ""cockroach of mosquitoes"" because it stays mainly indoors and is hard to eradicate. Efforts to control it needed to be much more targeted to communities and households.

""Then we will see whether it works or not,"" she said.

On Tuesday, the WHO advised pregnant women not to travel to areas with outbreaks of Zika virus due to the potential risk of birth defects, a condition known as microcephaly.

Zika has been linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, another neurological disorder, but neither link has been yet proven.

The most advanced candidate vaccines for Zika are still a few months away from entering early human clinical trials, Kieny said.

""It is therefore possible that vaccines may come late for the current Latin American outbreak, but the development of a vaccine remains an imperative, in particular vaccines suitable for pregnant women and women of child-bearing age,"" she said.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:11:20+00:00,Clinton's surprise Michigan loss exposes risks for her on trade,['Andy Sullivan'],"Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks to supporters about the primary voting results in Michigan and other states at her campaign rally in Cleveland, Ohio, March 8, 2016.

WASHINGTON Democrat Hillary Clinton's unexpected defeat in Michigan has laid bare growing voter anger over international trade, raising warning flags for her ahead of a possible presidential election showdown against Republican front-runner Donald Trump.

Trump has built his campaign on pledges to scrap international trade deals and do more to protect American workers from foreign competition, tapping the same groundswell of discontent that propelled Clinton's rival Bernie Sanders to victory in the Midwestern state on Tuesday.

Clinton remains heavily favored to win the Democratic nomination. But the setback in Michigan could signal further troubles in upcoming primaries in other Rust Belt states such as Ohio, forcing her further to the left on economic issues and possibly influencing her choice for an eventual running mate, strategists said.

The backlash against 20 years of trade liberalization has stalled the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), a sweeping Pacific trade deal backed by President Barack Obama and threatens to stymie the trade agenda for years to come.

""It's politically radioactive to support free trade right now,"" said Greg Valliere, a Washington analyst for Horizon Investments, a financial firm.

Clinton's troubles with her party's left wing -- and with white, working class voters more generally -- may steer her toward a trade skeptic such as Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio as a vice presidential running mate, said Democratic strategist Steve Jarding. Political pundits had expected Clinton to pick someone to increase her appeal to Hispanic or other minority voters, such as U.S. Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro.

Sanders, 74, is unlikely to end up as Clintons running mate, partly due to his age, Democrats said.

Both Sanders, a democratic socialist, and billionaire Trump have harnessed anti-trade sentiment in their insurgent White House bids, criticizing deals like NAFTA as job killers that have depressed the living standards of working Americans.

Exit polls from Michigan, a hub of the U.S. auto industry, show widespread voter skepticism on trade that may have helped Sanders and Trump win their respective party primaries.

""She made a fundamental mistake early on in this campaign to try to stay in the center,"" Democratic strategist Steve Jarding said of Clinton. ""This cycle, there is no center.""

NUANCED TRADE STANCE

Sanders campaigned heavily against foreign trade in a state that has been hammered by overseas competition since the 1980s. Some 58 percent of his supporters in Michigan exit polls said that trade takes away U.S. jobs, while a slight majority - 53 percent - of Clinton backers said trade creates U.S. jobs.

The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, estimates that Michigan would lose 5 percent of its jobs if TPP were to take effect, the highest proportion of any state.

Gary Hunley, a substitute teacher in Dearborn, Michigan, said he believed Clinton was partially to blame for stagnant wages because NAFTA was enacted under her husband Bill Clinton's presidency in the 1990s.

""She was not a passive first lady,"" Hunley said.

Clinton's stance on trade is more nuanced than Trump's and Sanders'. After NAFTA was enacted, she voted against a free-trade deal with Central America while serving as a U.S. senator in the following decade.

As Obama's secretary of state, Clinton helped negotiate the TPP with Japan, Vietnam and other Pacific Rim countries.

As a presidential candidate, Clinton has said after reading the final language of the deal she would vote against it because it does not adequately protect U.S. workers.

Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters Wednesday there were no plans to adjust her stance and that he would ""put Secretary Clinton up against any candidate in this race on trade,"" including Trump.

Despite backing by the Obama administration, Republican lawmakers and many business groups, Republican leaders in Congress have shown no sign that they will bring TPP up for a vote this year.

The Obama administration says the deal has high labor and environmental standards that were not part of NAFTA. ""Im not sure that has fully been absorbed in the public mindset,"" U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice told Reuters. [L1N16H1VJ]

The deal may fare no better under the next president. Sanders and Trump oppose TPP, and Senator Ted Cruz, who is in second place in the Republican contest, has said he would not vote for it this year.

""They've listened to the public and politicians have caught up with the public on this,"" Brown, the Ohio Democratic senator, told Reuters.

The evidence that the TPP would help the U.S. economy much is less than conclusive.

The Peter G. Peterson Institute, a pro-trade think tank, estimates that it would boost economic growth by just 0.5 percent after 15 years.

The deal would not boost employment overall, but would result in a ""churn"" of 53,700 jobs lost and created each year, and it would boost incomes by 0.5 percent, the institute found.

Another estimate by the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University found the trade deal would slow growth by 0.54 percent after 10 years and cost 448,000 jobs in the United States.

FRANKFURT A German court has ruled against an online shopping site's use of Facebook's ""like"" button on Wednesday, dealing a further legal blow to the world's biggest social network in Germany.

The Duesseldorf district court said that retailer Peek & Cloppenburg failed to obtain proper consent before transmitting its users' computer identities to Facebook, violating Germany's data protection law and giving the retailer a commercial advantage.

The court found in favor of the North Rhine-Westphalia Consumer Association, which had complained that Peek & Cloppenburg's Fashion ID website had grabbed user data and sent it to Facebook before shoppers had decided whether to click on the ""like"" button or not.

""A mere link to a data protection statement at the foot of the website does not constitute an indication that data are being or are about to be processed,"" the court said.

Peek & Cloppenburg faces a penalty of up to 250,000 euros ($275,400) or six months' detention for a manager.

The case comes on the heels of a January ruling by Germany's highest court against Facebook's ""friend finder"" feature and an announcement last week by Germany's competition regulator that it was investigating Facebook for suspected abuse of market power with regard to data protection laws.

Facebook's ability to target advertising, helped by features such as its ""like"" button, drove a 52 percent revenue jump in the final quarter of 2015.

Germany, Europe's biggest economy, is one of the world's strictest enforcers of data protection laws and its citizens have a high sensibility to privacy issues.

""The ruling has fundamental significance for the assessment of the legality of the 'like' function with respect to data protection,"" said lawyer Sebastian Meyer, who represented the consumer group in the case.

""Companies should put pressure on the social network to adapt the 'like' function to the prevailing law.""

The association has also warned hotel portal HRS, Nivea maker Beiersdorf, shopping loyalty program Payback, ticketing company Eventim and fashion retailer KiK about similar use of the ""like"" button.

It said that four of those had since changed their practices. A first hearing in a case it has brought against Payback is due in a Munich court in May.

Peek & Cloppenburg said that it had changed its deployment of the ""like"" button last year and now required users to activate social media before sharing data with Facebook. It said it would wait for the court's written reasons for its judgment before deciding whether to appeal.

A Facebook spokesman said: ""This case is specific to a particular website and the way they have sought consent from their users in the past.

""The Like button, like many other features that are used to enhance websites, is an accepted, legal and important part of the Internet, and this ruling does not change that.""

Can this rally last without that big 20% correction at some of MarketWatch user calling. The market coming back is directly related oil. This is all about how bad the decline in oil. Hurts the economy. And causing corporate bankruptcies and other potential risk so now that we've seen what we've closer back to forty it takes a lot of pressure off of not only that oil companies in the area but the banks in the people who lent money to these companies there's a lot less risk that we see in the market bounced back to I think a more reasonable level right now. Because it seems like a horrible scenarios were off the table right now but we still not out of the it all Ross you feel that's a good time to slowly and I think slowly. And capital what signs are you looking for indicate that it's time to release happened think big my positions. But you it's a little assessor. It's just about oil. This is the big strain on the global economy. From the oil producing nations and on parts of our economy. And so if we can get loyal to a price and I think it's about 45 bucks that it it's that perfect equilibrium where people can still make money not go out of business but prices don't affect the economy in negative way I think that's going to be that sign that things are going to be okay and and and once we get through the election. We'll have a lot more certainty. I think that the real thing that we watch every game right now the price of oil. Roth I you're buying text boxes that FaceBook in that lets look at all of the FaceBook and has trailing price of 82 times earnings. And the stock is just 10% shy of the all time peak are buying these levels. Yes you know unfortunately. Meaning good stocks to have really high valuations and that causes of risk. You don't have to taken lower valuations stocks so as much as we like FaceBook of course there's risk. Involve it buying these high multiples but this is the best in breed company. Doing phenomenally well and we expect in the half of very good year this year so it works you know obviously conservatively adding to positions in that area and the same holds true with Netflix. Wonderful company executing on all fronts but you're paying a full valuation report but with these investments worth thinking long term and we also understand the risks. Because of the higher and what do you see driving FaceBook for. Well especially Aspen in the political campaign will be incredibly beneficial for FaceBook over the next six months. We there's. No question that we're gonna see a billion dollars spent on ads and it's Smart candidates spend that money on social FaceBook and Google being the main winners here but also in mr. Graham is monetizing very well and populist is beginning to sell their. And I think Ross two going back Netflix aren't the barriers to entry low in the streaming. Not when it comes to original contact and what Netflix has done is they've. Basically doubled down on regional content this year they've got so many good shows already coming out now and coming up throughout the year and moving forward as well and so Netflix realized that they were gonna become a commodity I just buying you know shows from other producers and now it's become the biggest producer Hollywood so. Netflix is in. Good shape moving forward because the hunt at making it's such high quality really.

SAO PAULO Former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva could join Brazil's government if he wishes, the minister in charge of legislative affairs, Ricardo Berzoini, said on Wednesday, a move that would give him some protection from prosecution.

Lula was briefly detained for questioning by police on Friday, after investigators said they had evidence he was among the main political beneficiaries of a kickback scheme at state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro, commonly known as Petrobras.

Brazilian media reported on Wednesday that members of the ruling Workers Party (PT) were pressuring Rousseff to offer Lula a ministerial portfolio in President Dilma Rousseff's cabinet that would shield him from possible detention.

If Lula were appointed to a ministry, he could only be tried in the Supreme Court, placing him out of the reach of the judge in Curitiba pursuing the investigation into kickbacks at Petrobras.

""The ball is in his court,"" Berzoini told Reuters. ""The government is good with it. Which government would not want to have Pele on the field,"" he said, comparing Lula to the legendary Brazilian football player.

According to two sources close to the former president, he is reluctant to join the government but pressure from the Workers Party is having some effect.

""The best chance that he has is to accept a ministry and for the trial to go to the Supreme Court so he receives a fair hearing,"" said one source close to the former president.

Crude oil and U.S. equity prices have been linked for much of 2016 to a degree that has surprised many investors. Wednesday's market action extended that trend, with WTI crude CLc1 rising nearly 5 percent and the S&P 500 energy sector .SPNY up 1.5 percent. Chevron (CVX.N) jumped 4.6 percent to $92.82 and gave the biggest boost to the energy sector.

""It's not about oil being a barometer of the global economy,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. ""A lot of it has to do with psychology.""

U.S. crude and the S&P 500 have been directionally correlated on all but six trading days this year, according to Wunderlich data.

""Stability in that asset class (oil) for a period of time will allow for the correlation to break down,"" said Hogan.

Since Feb. 11, the S&P 500 has gained 8.8 percent, but it is still down 2.7 percent for the year.

The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 36.26 points, or 0.21 percent, to 17,000.36, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 10 points, or 0.51 percent, to 1,989.26 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 25.55 points, or 0.55 percent, to 4,674.38.

In a week with a thin economic data calendar, markets will turn to the European Central Bank, which is expected to further ease monetary policy on Thursday.

Biotechnology stocks came under pressure a day after the U.S. government proposed a test program that would lower incentives to use higher-priced drugs when alternative treatments are available.

The Nasdaq Biotechnology sector .NBI fell 1.2 percent with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN.O) down 5.1 percent to $374.75 as the largest decliner on the Nasdaq 100.

Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) lost 3.4 percent to $506.63. Already reeling from several food-borne illnesses, the company temporarily shut a Massachusetts restaurant after four employees fell sick.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE on a 2.3-to-1 ratio while on the Nasdaq a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 48 new highs and 41 new lows.

About 7.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the average 8.67 billion in the previous 20 sessions.

Rowling are in for a treat this week when her digital publisher website Pottermore releases a series of four pieces of writing about wizardry entitled ""History of Magic in North America"".

The writings, posted at 1400 GMT each day from Tuesday to Friday, are meant to set the scene for the highly anticipated ""Harry Potter"" spin-off movie called ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", which is due for release in November.

Tuesday's offering, entitled ""Fourteenth Century - Seventeenth Century"", takes readers ""back through the centuries to reveal the beginnings of the North American magical community and how witches and wizards used magic before they adopted wands,"" Pottermore said.

Wednesday's piece will look at ""the dangers faced by witches and wizards in the New World"" and Thursday's will reveal ""why the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) took steps to move the magical community deeper underground"".

Friday will take readers to the ""Roaring Twenties"", when the new movie ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" starring Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne is due to begin.

""These stories will give you some idea of how the wizarding world on this continent evolved over the years, and of the names and events that lay the foundation for the arrival of 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them',"" Pottermore told Rowling fans.

In the movie Redmayne plays ""magizoologist"" Newt Scamander, ""who stops in New York following his travels to find and document magical creatures"", according to Warner Bros.

A ""magizoologist"", in Rowling's make-believe universe, is somebody who studies magical creatures.

The story is set in 1926 - decades before Rowling's fictional boy wizard Harry Potter begins his adventures at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

The film, based on Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" accompanying volume ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", marks the best-selling author's screen writing debut.

""Estamos caminhando juntos e no caminho certo para descobrir e definir de forma cada vez mais especifica todas as orientacoes em torno da microcefalia e do virus Zika, afirmou o ministro da Saude, Marcelo Castro, em entrevista coletiva em Brasilia.

Apesar de a relacao entre a microcefalia e o virus nao ter sido ainda comprovada cientificamente, tracos do virus tem sido encontrados em testes dos fluidos corporais e tecidos de maes e bebes atingidos pelo problema.

As mudancas, a segunda revisao feita pelo Brasil nos seus parametros desde o inicio do surto no ano passado, sao um esforco para adaptar o padrao do pais as informacoes recentemente anunciadas pela OMS.

A OMS esta trabalhando com o Brasil e outros paises afetados para entender melhor a microcefalia e determinar as relacoes que ela tem com o virus.

Casos suspeitos de microcefalia registrados antes das mudancas e com medidas superiores aos novos limites continuarao a ser investigados ate terem uma confirmacao positiva ou negativa, disse o ministerio.

The U.S. government will evaluate new proposals individually, but is looking at new, cleaner technologies, Kerry said to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Trudeau will attend a state dinner on Thursday, becoming the first Canadian leader to do so since 1997, as the two countries aim to fix a frayed relationship.

U.S. President Barack Obama last year blocked the cross-border Keystone XL crude oil pipeline proposed by TransCanada Corp in a victory for environmentalists.

The first batch of IDs was issued to eight types of vehicles including heavy duty trucks, vehicles for carrying hazardous materials and school buses, China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp (CASC) said in a statement which was also posted on Wednesday on the website of the central government agency that oversees state-owned companies.

If successful, the project will be expanded to all private cars in the city, the statement said. The government has in the past trialled projects in Shenzhen before rolling them out across the country.

The project could pave the way for autonomous driving, which requires vehicles to communicate with each other and traffic infrastructure in real-time, but also raises concerns over invasive government measures amid efforts to register every Internet user's real name.

The electronic markers will use radio-frequency identification that can be used in conjunction with traffic monitoring equipment, the CASC statement said, adding that it would help cut down on fake license plates and other illegal activity, while also allowing accurate data gathering for ""smart traffic applications"".

Issuing set identities for every car could also help implement targeted transport policies, such as those proposed by Wang Fengying, the general manager of Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor and a representative in parliament this week.

On Monday, Wang filed a proposal that would make petrol more expensive for gas guzzlers by requiring a card to be issued and linked to every car based on the fuel economy of the model, with more efficient vehicles paying less.

Wang similarly proposed a law suggesting a system of taxes and fees for cars based on how much they drive among other data.

Transparency International, a corruption watchdog, has accused Abacha of stealing up to $5 billion of public money during the five years he ran the oil-rich country, from 1993 until his death in 1998.

Laolu Akande, a spokesman for Nigerian Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, said Nigeria's attorney general signed a letter of intent, under the terms of which Switzerland will award Nigeria $321 million ""acquired by the Abacha family,"" Akandesaid in an emailed statement.

Swiss authorities said the letter of intent was also signed by its head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, Didier Burkhalter, and ""marks an important step toward the return of assets monitored by the World Bank"".

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, who took office last year, has made combating corruption a priority. He has asked Britain and the United States for help recovering money stolen by some of the country's elite over several years.

An economic crisis in Africa's biggest economy and oil producer, brought on by a plunge in crude prices, has made the need to recoup money lost to corruption more acute.

In 2014, Nigeria and the Abacha family reached an agreement for the West African country to get back the funds, which had been frozen, in return for dropping a complaint against the former military ruler's son, Abba Abacha.

He was charged by a Swiss court with money-laundering, fraud and forgery in April 2005, after being extradited from Germany, and later spent 561 days in custody. In 2006, Luxembourg ordered that funds held by the younger Abacha be frozen.

The news, confirming a Reuters report on Tuesday, came a day after the U.S. Commerce Department slapped export restrictions on ZTE for alleged Iran sanctions violations, a move that is expected to disrupt its sprawling global supply chain.

The U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security of the Department of Commerce added ZTE, ZTE Kangxun Telecommunications Ltd, ZTE Parsian and Beijing 8-Star International Co to its list of companies impacted, ZTE said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange.

U.S. suppliers to these companies are required to apply for a licence for the supply of the components, effective immediately, it added. Suppliers based elsewhere were not affected.

""The company is conducting a thorough assessment on the potential impacts of the restriction measures on the business and operation of the group,"" Chairman Hou Weigui said in the statement.

""As at the date of this announcement, the company has been, and will continue to be, cooperative in the investigations by the U.S. relevant governmental department, and has been actively facilitating communications with the U.S. governmental department to search for a solution.""

ZTE said there was no certainty a solution could be reached through the communications. It gave no further details. Shares of the Hong Kong-listed company, which had a market value of $1.4 billion, have been suspended since Monday.

The export restrictions against ZTE drew fire from the Chinese government, which said it was ""resolutely opposed"" to the tough measures but stopped short of announcing retaliation.

ZTE is among the largest companies that the Commerce Department has hit with a near-total export ban, according to public records.

It is the No. 4 smartphone vendor in the United States, with a 7 percent market share, behind Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co and LG Electronics Inc, according to research firm IDC. It sells handset devices to three of the four largest U.S. mobile carriers: AT&T, T-Mobile US and Sprint Corp.

NEW YORK Prominent short seller Carson Block, founder of research firm Muddy Waters LLC, said on Wednesday he remains bearish on the U.S. stock market and that the recent rally feels like a ""dead cat bounce.""

""I would say that this does feel like it is a dead cat bounce because how much more ammunition really do policymakers have?"" Block told Reuters at its New York headquarters. ""I just don't know if there are that many more bullets that central banks could fire.""

A dead cat bounce is a small, short-lived recovery in the price of a declining security, such as a stock. As of Tuesday's close, the benchmark S&P 500 Index .SPX had gained in 11 out of 17 sessions since its Feb. 11 low, and on Friday closed above its 100-day moving average for first time in 2016.

The Bank of Japan's negative rates have backfired, Block said. ""You see negative interest rates introduced in Japan, and guess what? That didn't really provide the relief that they had hoped for,"" he said.

""I've been very skeptical about the fundamentals of the U.S. economy for a long time. I don't feel that there have been permanent solutions that have been introduced.""

Block said there has been a tremendous amount of misallocation of capital, as a result of loose monetary policies.

""We knew this years ago when we saw companies issuing debt to buy back stock and pay out dividends,"" he said. ""We knew that we would be at a point in a few years where when these companies were just really, maybe not mortally wounded, but seriously wounded.""

He added: ""So from a short (selling) perspective, this is a target-rich environment because of that. There are far more companies with fewer legs to stand on than they were a few years ago.""

Corporate America chiefs have become, in many cases, compensated to think like equity traders, he said. ""Especially with larger companies, they run these businesses that in this global environment, 'Where do you really get growth?' Even if you have a new CEO come in, is this CEO so much smarter and has much better insight than the last CEO and he can figure out a way to grow?""

As a result, Block said he has seen some companies attempt to increase returns for equity holders in ways that are unsustainable.

Block made his mark in the $3 trillion hedge fund industry after he challenged accounting practices of a number of Chinese companies that trade on North American stock exchanges, then bet against them using his own money to short their stocks.

Block reiterated that he was targeting European companies and credits rated just above ""junk"" status, or BBB-, for shorting opportunities.

In Europe, ""the government and the regulators are very suspicious of short sellers. But that's also the opportunity because there is just this cultural bias against short sellers there. There are a lot more problems in the shadows, as a result of that.""

The equivalent of 1.3 million euros a minute or 2,000 euros for every man, woman and child in the euro zone. Markets, though, are looking for more. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CMC MARKETS ANALYST, MICHAEL HEWSON, SAYING: ""Currently, what's priced in is a ten basis points cut to minus 0.4, potentially another 10 billion euros in asset purchases to 70 billion euros a month, but ultimately I think there is a concern that further deposit rate cuts are going to be counter-productive, simply because of the concerns about the financial stability of the banks."" The other concerns are low inflation - it's minus 0.2 per cent. And - amid global pressures - faltering growth. Germany posting a sharp rise in industrial output on Tuesday the only sparkle in a dull data landscape. For many analysts, ECB boss Mario Draghi and his policymakers came up short at their December meeting. But there's also a worrying sense that he could be running out of options.

reuters.com,2016-03-08 00:04:15+00:00,Fed officials set battle lines on rate hikes ahead of March meet,"['Lindsay Dunsmuir', 'Howard Schneider', 'Jason Lange']","WASHINGTON After a long wait for inflation to accelerate, U.S. Federal Reserve officials face a complex and possibly divisive debate over whether recent evidence of rising prices is strong enough to move ahead with planned rate hikes.

In separate statements on Monday, policymakers at the core of that debate staked out starkly different views, with Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer saying economic data now points to the ""first stirrings"" of inflation, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard countering that the Fed should not move until inflation proves its ""persistence.""

The differing views may not matter immediately, when the Fed meets next week. A rate hike at that meeting is not expected after weeks in which oil prices have remained depressed and global equity markets have been volatile.

But it could tax Fed Chair Janet Yellen's ability to maintain consensus over the year as the Fed decides whether it is riskier to let inflation rise more quickly now, and try to control it later, or raise rates more slowly in a weak world economic environment. That discussion, largely moot over an extended period in which the Fed persistently missed its 2 percent inflation target, may be joined in full after the central bank's preferred measure of inflation rose to 1.7 percent in January.

""We're not that far away"" from an inflation target that has been elusive in an era of cheap oil, weak global demand and a strong U.S. dollar that has held down the cost of imports, Fischer said.

Fed officials have argued since mid-2014 that those inflation ""headwinds"" would pass, and recent data on prices of goods and services, as well as a jump in commodity prices, may indicate that time has finally come.

""We may well at present be seeing the first stirrings of an increase in the inflation rate,"" Fischer said, adding that an increase from too-low levels is ""something that we would like to happen.""

Investors who had largely priced out a further Fed rate hike until late this year have pushed those expectations forward in recent days, as oil has rallied and prices of some other commodities crept higher.

It may take more than that to convince Fed members like Brainard. In recent weeks even policymakers who had been among the more concerned about inflation joined her in worrying that public expectations about inflation were falling, often a precursor to even weaker price increases and possible deflation.

Brainard, the leading voice for the Fed to stay cautious in a world where China remains a risk and growth overall is slow, said one strong month is no reason to rush.

While January's data was good, ""it's just that - a data point... For me... I want to see a pattern, some persistence. That would give me some comfort,"" she said.

""Given weak and decelerating foreign demand, it is critical to carefully protect and preserve the progress we have made here at home through prudent adjustments to the policy path,"" she told a group of bankers.

The Fed in December raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. At the time, it signaled it would likely raise rates four more times this year, reflecting a stronger U.S. labor market and the view that inflation will begin to rise toward the Fed's 2 percent goal.

But an oil price slump, a global economic slowdown and volatile financial markets since the beginning of this year have convinced investors that the Fed's optimism may be misplaced.

Wall Street economists now expect just two rates hikes this year, and traders of interest-rate futures are betting there will be just one.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:46:41+00:00,Signs of life for Apple's stock as Wall St. eyes new iPhone,['Noel Randewich'],"SAN FRANCISCO After months of declines in Apple's (AAPL.O) stock, sentiment appears to be mending as investors focus on steady earnings expectations and bet that the expected launch of a new iPhone will add badly-needed fuel to sputtering sales.

Battered by nearly a year of off-and-on declines from record highs because of fears of a slowdown in iPhone sales, Apple's stock now is valued closer to IBM, which has disappointed Wall Street for the past four years with declining revenue, than to Silicon Valley technology pioneers Alphabet and Tesla Motors.

Apple shares have increased 5 percent in the past two weeks as Wall Street bets the company this month will launch a less expensive iPhone to boost sales in developing countries like China. With U.S. consumers upgrading their smartphones less often, manufacturers have been relying on China for growth.

Shareholders this week pointed to Apple's reliable cash generation, beaten down valuation and its wild card potential for future game-changing products as key reasons for owning it.

""This company has a history of doing better than expectations and surprising people,"" said Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust Company, which holds over 1 million shares of Apple. ""Where else can I go and find a company trading at 10 or 11 times earnings that has had such a great history?""

At $100.97 a share on Wednesday, Apple is selling at 10.7 times its expected earnings per share over the next 12 months. Its average forward price-earnings-ratio has been 13 over the past two years.

By comparison, Internet behemoth Alphabet (GOOGL.O), whose Android mobile platform competes against Apple's iOS, trades at 20 times expected earnings and 13-year old Tesla Motors (TSLA.O) trades at 132 times earnings. International Business Machines (IBM.N), which is struggling to expand into a high-growth business like cloud computing, has a P/E of 10.2, according to Thomson Reuters data.

""Unless something big happens, (Apple) doesn't deserve to trade at 20 to 25 times earnings anymore. It's just too big,"" said David Meier, a portfolio manager at Motley Fool Funds. ""But as a high-quality company, could it trade at 15 times earnings? Certainly.""

A target of 15 times its next 12 months' expected earnings would put Apple at around $138.

In another hint of improving sentiment, Apple's stock has recently moved above its 50-day moving average for the first time since December.

The stock's selloff in recent months has boosted Apple's dividend yield to 2.2 percent from 1.5 percent a year ago.

Analysts' covering Apple have been little help to investors. Ahead of the stock's 20-percent drop that started in December, 41 analysts recommended buying Apple shares while just one recommended selling, according to Thomson Reuters data. Currently, no analysts recommend selling, while 38 recommend buying.

A new iPhone with a smaller 4-inch screen will likely boost volumes by about 5 percent this year, an increase not yet incorporated into Wall Street's expectations, Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski wrote in a report on Monday.

Apple chip supplier Dialog Semiconductor (DLGS.DE) on Tuesday forecast March-quarter revenue below analysts' expectations, but said it still expects single-digit growth for the year. That suggests the March quarter could mark the low-point in iPhone shipments, with demand for new models building later in the year, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a research note.

Jeffrey Carbone, Senior Partner at Cornerstone Financial Partners, said Apple remains a staple holding at his firm but that he has recently turned his attention to Apple suppliers including Skyworks Solutions (SWKS.O), which he believes is undervalued.

""We have a normal weighting on Apple, we like the company, but we think the supply chain could have greater potential,"" Carbone said.

Facebook Inc is acquiring Masquerade Technologies Inc, creator of the popular face-swapping app MSQRD, as part of efforts by the world's largest social network operator to build its video services.

Wednesday's deal comes nearly three years after the Wall Street Journal reported that photo and video messaging app Snapchat had rejected an offer from Facebook. (bit.ly/1Xdz1N5)

Masquerade, which announced the deal on its website, did not disclose financial details.

The deal is more a piece of Facebook's bigger effort to innovate into video, Monness, Crespi, Hardt, & Co Inc analyst James Cakmak said.

It is unlikely that Facebook would use Masquerade to significantly draw away Snapchat users, he said.

While Snapchat has features such as bulging eyes, Masquerade allows users to add special effects including animal masks and snow to their photos and video.

Masquerade, backed by Yuri Gurski and Gagarin Capital, said founders Eugene Nevgen, Sergey Gonchar and Eugene Zatepyakin will join Facebook.

The app will continue as a standalone product, Masquerade said. (bit.ly/1pxMh4x)

CAPE TOWN South Africa left-arm spinner Aaron Phangiso has been cleared to play at the World Twenty20 tournament in India after an independent reassessment of his bowling action found it to be legal, Cricket South Africa (CSA) said on Tuesday.

The 32-year-old failed tests carried out by the International Cricket Council (ICC) on March 1 having been reported by umpires in a domestic 50-over match last month.

Phangiso was suspended from bowling until his action could be re-tested and has now been cleared to resume his career having worked with South Africa spin-bowling consultant Claude Henderson over the past week.

""It's a huge relief to be cleared and to have my bowling action passed. Its been a tough and challenging few weeks for me, Phangiso said in a CSA statement.

I'd really like to use the next few days ahead of the (World Twenty20) tournament to gain playing confidence, especially with some of the technical adjustments we have made to my action.

Phangiso will be available for South Africas series-deciding third Twenty20 international against Australia in Cape Town on Wednesday.

South Africa open their World Twenty20 campaign against England on March 18. They will also play Sri Lanka and West Indies in their pool.

Pershing Square, run by activist investor Bill Ackman, bought a stake in Valeant last year when the drugmaker's shares were on the rise. They have fallen 68 percent since.

Valeant said later on Wednesday it had jointly ended litigation with R&O Pharmacy with both sides asking the court to dismiss case. R&O was not immediately available for comment on the settlement.

While Valeant did not disclose the terms of the settlement, it said the resolution included a payment by R&O to Valeant. [nPn3vWq4v]

R&O sued Valeant in federal court in California on Oct. 6, after receiving a demand letter from Valeant for more than $69 million, money that R&O said it did not owe. [nL1N12P0OC]

Valeant later countersued R&O, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Last fall, the company became the target of two U.S. state investigations into its drug pricing practices, and its relationship with Philidor RX Services, a pharmacy selling its dermatology products, came under scrutiny and was dissolved. [nL3N12U450]

During the last two weeks, the company delayed its annual financial filing with regulators, postponed a preliminary earnings announcement, and said it would restate financials. Chief Executive Officer Michael Pearson returned from a two-month medical leave and a top dermatology executive left. It also disclosed an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Stephen Fraidin, a veteran Wall Street lawyer who is vice chairman at Pershing Square, joined the board, Valeant said. He previously worked at the Kirkland & Ellis law firm before joining Pershing last year.

Fred Eshelman, a drug executive who founded Furiex Pharmaceuticals Inc, and Thomas Ross, an academic who is a fellow at Duke University and president emeritus of the University of North Carolina, also joined the board.

Anders Lonner, former CEO of Swedish specialty drug company Meda AB (MEDAa.ST), stepped down from the board, Valeant said. The board now has 14 members.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has an ""underperform"" rating on the stock, said in a research note that Pershing Square had proposed Eshelman for the board at Allergan during its and Valeant's failed hostile bid for the company.

Maris said investors will likely have reservations about Ross as well, given his ties to Duke University, to which CEO Pearson has donated $45 million.

Valeant plans to report preliminary fourth-quarter earnings and hold a conference call on March 15.

On Tuesday, Ackman said the company will reveal ""messy"" fourth- and first-quarter results, and said Valeant needed to stabilize soon. If not, new management will be brought in or the company will be sold, he said.

Valeant's board set up a committee last year to look into the relationship between Valeant and Philidor. As a result of that ongoing investigation, it is restating financials. The committee is advised by Mark Filip, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis.

On Wednesday, its shares rose 6.6 percent to $67.20.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 15:31:05+00:00,"UK industrial output returns to growth in January, manufacturing strong",['Reuters Editorial'],"LONDON, British industrial output grew in January following a sharp fall in December, helped by a stronger than expected upturn in manufacturing, official data showed on Wednesday.

Industrial output rose by a weaker-than-expected 0.3 percent month-on-month in January after a 1.1 percent drop in December, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected it to rise 0.5 percent.

Output in manufacturing rose 0.7 percent on the month following a 0.3 percent dip, the first increase for four months and easily topping expectations for a 0.2 percent uptick.

The monthly Markit/CIPS survey of British manufacturers also showed the sector enjoyed an unexpectedly strong January, but it then suggested factory activity barely grew last month.

Britain has been one of the fastest-growing major advanced economies in the world for the last couple of years. But it has relied heavily on domestically focussed services for growth, frustrating hopes for a better-balanced recovery.

Economic growth slowed in the second half of last year and economists say it could lose more momentum in early 2016.

Industrial output was still 10.2 percent below its peak in early 2008 during the three months to January 2016, while manufacturing output was 6.4 percent smaller.

The manufacturing sector failed to contribute to British economic growth last year.

Chancellor George Osborne has warned that the economy was facing a ""dangerous cocktail"" of risks from overseas in 2016, as growth slows in major emerging markets, stock markets tumble and oil prices slump amid fading global demand.

Economists say that the Britain's planned referendum on its European Union membership could also drag on growth.

North Sea oil and gas extraction fell 6.3 percent on the month, the biggest drop since June 2014, which the ONS said could be linked to bad weather.

Brent crude oil prices slid almost 7 percent in January following a 35 percent drop for 2015 as a whole.

Compared with a year ago, industrial output was 0.2 percent higher in January.

TRIPOLI Five years after the uprising that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi, Tripoli is on edge, somewhere between peace and war.

There is a semblance of normal life in the Libyan capital and glimpses of the unexpected - kite surfers zip across choppy waves and a group of amateur cyclists in matching kit pedal along a seafront highway.

Yet the armed groups that control the city are an unsettling presence. Gunmen in balaclavas staff checkpoints on key roads, and armed brigades have been flexing their muscles in late-night parades.

It is here that a unity government nominated abroad under a U.N.-backed plan is hoping to set up shop.

But two months after the deal was signed with limited Libyan support, Reuters interviews with residents and officials, and a string of recent incidents, show that resistance from hardliners in both Tripoli and the east is still getting traction, shrinking the space for the plan to succeed.

The hardliners in Tripoli present themselves as the true guardians of the uprising, protecting Libya against a counter-revolution and foreign meddling. Those in the east claim to be saving the country from Islamist extremism.

Both speak for some of the armed factions that hold real power in Libya, and are scared of losing influence, protection and access to the country's rapidly dwindling financial resources in a political transition.

In Tripoli's Martyrs' Square, where families stroll past dozens of men saying prayers at sunset, some support the unity government, saying they are fed up with violence, cash shortages and rising prices.

""We've had enough,"" said Fardous Boukhatwa, whose family was displaced by fighting in Benghazi and was visiting Tripoli with three of her children. ""There is only one solution - reconciliation and forgiveness.""

HARDLINERS

But others echo the criticism of the Tripoli hardliners. ""The United Nations did not play the role of mediator, it was biased towards the east,"" said Abdulkarim Sadiq, a retired teacher from the suburb of Janzour. ""They cannot bring peace to Libya  they just add fuel to the fire.""

A group of teenage boys mention photos they saw on Facebook of Prime Minister-designate Fayez Seraj meeting the commander of Libya's eastern military forces, Khalifa Haftar, a former Gaddafi ally deeply mistrusted in the west.

For nearly two years, Tripoli has been under the control of armed factions that formed an alliance known as Libya Dawn to seize control of the capital.

They reinstated the old parliament, the General National Congress (GNC), and the newly elected chamber moved east to Tobruk.

The Dawn alliance has now splintered. Key brigades have said they will provide security for the unity government, but the situation is volatile.

Under the U.N.-backed plan, the GNC is meant to form a consultative chamber, and a few dozen moderates have been holding meetings in preparation.

After their third session was disrupted by protesters last week, one of those attending, Bilqasem Eggzait, said they might have to consider meeting in a different city.

The same day, a group that regularly protests against the unity government in Martyrs' Square appeared on a popular TV station to proclaim the unity government ""illegal"" and warn of ""bloodshed and a fire of sedition"" in the capital.

Early on Friday, the man nominated to head the State Council said rocket-propelled grenades were fired at his Tripoli office. The U.N. envoy to Libya swiftly condemned the incident, though the property later appeared undamaged.

On Sunday, three members of the committee tasked with preparing security in Tripoli for the new government were briefly detained, drawing further U.N. condemnation.

The chances of major clashes if the unity government came to Tripoli were small because a majority of Libyans support it, said Eggzait.

But with a unified security force to build and oil revenues at a fraction of their former value, the government would need to cut salaries for brigades of former rebels who added tens of thousands of men to the state payroll after the revolution, and this would be difficult. ""Politics in Tripoli is not about ideology, it's about money,"" he said.

GUNFIGHTS

While recent violence in Tripoli has been limited to occasional gunfights and isolated clashes, Benghazi, Libya's second city, has been a battleground for Haftar's forces and a collection of armed groups including Islamic State.

After previous promises to ""liberate"" the city came to nothing, over the past two weeks the military has taken control of several key areas, allowing some residents to return to their homes and start repairing war-torn streets.

In the recently secured neighborhood of Laithi, 42-year-old father of four Khairy Mohamed al-Qatrani said he had been able to return to his house ""thanks to Khalifa Haftar, whose Karama (Dignity) operation has thwarted the plans of Islamic State to take control of Benghazi"".

Qatrani said he hoped the army would be a neutral force in the future, but the military deadlock was broken as Haftar's allies in the eastern parliament, the House of Representatives (HOR), continued to block approval of the unity government, which includes Mahdi al-Bargathi, a Haftar rival, as defense minister.

The recent military push ""very much has to do with Haftar's need to reassert himself as the savior of the east in the face of challenges within his own camp,"" said Issandr El Amrani, North Africa director for International Crisis Group.

A majority of HOR members signed a declaration of support for the new government, but complained that hardliners had resorted to threats and physical force to prevent a vote.

A ""crisis of trust"" in the Tobruk chamber meant that voting to approve the government there had become impossible, lawmaker Ayman al-Nasr told Reuters.

Western diplomats, who say they can only provide sustained support for the fight against Islamic State in Libya at the request of a unity government, have looked on with growing exasperation.

The extremist group is in control of Gaddafi's home town of Sirte and has expanded to several other cities. This year it has launched a series of attacks on facilities in Libya's coastal ""oil crescent"".

Diplomats may now have to accept a return to negotiations, which could be complicated by the military advances in Benghazi and Haftar's enduring popularity.

Critics of the unity government plan say it was pushed through prematurely, before Libya's powerful armed factions were brought on board.

Unless this happens, with help from the regional powers that have backed both sides  Egypt and the United Arab Emirates in the east, Turkey and Qatar in the west  Libya's conflict will not be resolved, said Amrani.

""The political guys who stand in as proxies cannot negotiate for them at the end of the day,"" he said.

Assange, 44, took refuge at the embassy in June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over allegations, which he denies, that he committed rape in 2010. He says the accusation is a ploy that would eventually lead to his extradition to the United States, where a criminal investigation into the activities of WikiLeaks is still open. ""We consider that there have arisen a number of new circumstances which mean there is reason to review the earlier decision,"" Thomas Olsson, one of Assange's lawyers, said on Monday. A second lawyer representing Assange said he remained willing to be questioned in the Ecuadorian embassy, according to Sweden's national news agency. Ecuador has granted Assange asylum and he says his rights have been infringed because he is unable to travel to the South American country. Both Britain and Sweden denied that Assange was being deprived of freedom and the Swedish prosecutor in charge of the case has said she will renew an application to interview Assange. Prosecutor Marianne Ny said the U.N. panels' non-binding ruling had no impact on the case. In 2010, WikiLeaks released more than 90,000 secret documents on the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan, followed by almost 400,000 U.S. military reports detailing operations in Iraq. Those disclosures were followed by release of millions of diplomatic cables dating back to 1973. A U.S. Grand Jury investigation into WikiLeaks is ongoing.",[]

Exibido numa mostra paralela no Festival de Veneza, em 2014, ao contrario do tipico cinema meditativo iraniano, aqui o que vemos e uma satira do poder e da sede cega provocada por este.

O filme comeca com um envelhecido ditador (interpretado pelo georgiano Mikheil Gomiashvili) de um pais sem nome mostrando ao seu pequeno neto (Dachi Orvelashvilli) o que e o poder. Ao seu gosto, manda ligar e desligar a energia eletrica da cidade, deixando toda a populacao no escuro simplesmente para mostrar que pode. A partir de um unico gesto, se diz muito. Ele pode tudo, quando bem quiser.

Porem, quando pede para a energia ser religada, isso nao acontece: a Revolucao chegou! Tratado por todos como Sua Majestade, ele entao obriga toda sua familia a fugir, mas o neto se recusa, pois os dois sao muito apegados. Simbolicamente, o menino funciona como a materializacao do infantilismo que governa os mandos e desmandos do ditador. Quando sao abandonados e comecam sua propria fuga, acabam num vilarejo, onde o protagonista troca de roupa com um barbeiro e foge em busca de uma prostituta (la Sukhitashvili) que conheceu na juventude.

Makhmalbaf  assinando o roteiro com sua mulher, a tambem cineasta Marziyeh Meshkiny  faz de O Presidente uma alegoria que tanto vale para as ditaduras instauradas nas pequenas republicas da ex-Uniao Sovietica como para o mundo arabe  estas, segundo o diretor, sua verdadeira inspiracao. E, ao mesmo tempo, um filme didatico, repleto de boas intencoes, mas exagerado em seus ensinamentos e sua pouca sutileza.

Sua mensagem sobre a corrupcao do poder e, especialmente, da tirania e necessaria, mas obvia. Assim como o modo como ele retrata a Revolucao: havera um inevitavel derramamento de sangue promovido por um povo oprimido e traumatizado.

Na sua fuga, o ditador e o neto acabam ao lado de um grupo de prisioneiros politicos que ilustram a variedade do espectro de posicionamentos. E mais um dos momentos exageradamente didaticos do longa que, por natureza, fala de um assunto bastante proximo ao nosso tempo, e, por isso mesmo, acaba enfraquecido diante da forca do mundo real.

Criancas sao uma presenca constante na obra do cineasta, mas o menino aqui acaba soando como um pretexto para fazer questionamentos simples que tentam ganhar ares mais profundos: O que e morte? O que e tortura? A presenca do garoto acaba reduzida a apenas isso, fazer perguntas, e, com o tempo, O Presidente vai se esvaziando de seu potencial critico.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 14:27:22+00:00,U.N. torture envoy concerned at water-boarding rhetoric in U.S. race,['Stephanie Nebehay'],"GENEVA The U.N. torture investigator voiced concern on Wednesday at calls by some Republican candidates in the U.S. presidential race to authorize water-boarding in interrogating detainees, noting that it was illegal under domestic and international law.

Republican candidate Donald Trump softened his stance on torture last Friday, saying he would not order the U.S. military to break international laws on how to treat terrorism suspects. The night before, he indicated he might order U.S. military to break the law on interrogation tactics, including waterboarding.

Trump's rival and number two in the Republican primaries, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, said last month he would only allow limited use of the practice. He said he didn't believe waterboarding met the international definition for torture.

""Candidates in the United States have again discussed whether waterboarding is torture or not and have actually promised to bring it back and to bring even harsher techniques,"" Juan Mendez, U.N. special rappporteur on torture, told a news briefing in Geneva.

The Bush administration allowed the use of waterboarding - the practice of pouring water over a cloth covering a detainee's face to mimic the sensation of drowning - around conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. President Barack Obama banned it days after taking office in 2009.

""The Bush administration itself had withdrawn the torture memos when it was discovered that these things were happening as a matter of policy,"" Mendez said. ""Even the Republican administration had already recognized that these things are illegal.""

""They are illegal as a matter of international law, they are illegal as a matter of constitutional law in the United States, they are illegal as a matter of military law...and they are immoral anyway,"" he said.

Speaking as a U.S. citizen, rather than in his U.N. role, he said: ""Yes, I think the damage in the standing of the United States as a law-abiding nation and as an example to other states to fight crime and terrorism within the strictures of the rule of law is very seriously damaged by this kind of rhetoric.""

The Senate Intelligence Committee released a report in 2014, despite the objection of Republicans, that detailed what it called torture tactics used by the Central Intelligence Agency, including extensive use of waterboarding.

SAO PAULO O dolar fechou em queda e voltou abaixo de 3,70 reais nesta quarta-feira, dando continuidade ao vies de baixa visto recentemente em meio a alta dos precos do petroleo, a atuacao do Banco Central e ao cenario politico brasileiro.

O dolar recuou 1,12 por cento, a 3,6970 reais na venda, voltando ao patamar de 20 de novembro. A moeda norte-americana atingiu 3,6842 reais na minima da sessao e 3,7515 reais na maxima.

O dolar futuro caia cerca de 1,60 por cento, apos o fechamento do mercado a vista.

""Essa trajetoria de queda do dolar nos ultimos dias nao esta dando sinais de perder forca"", disse o operador Glauber Romano, da corretora Intercam.

A alta dos precos do petroleo trouxe folego adicional ao bom humor que vem permeando os mercados domesticos nas ultimas sessoes. A commodity foi influenciada por expectativas de que os principais produtores do mundo podem acertar ainda neste mes o congelamento da producao.

A moeda norte-americana vem recuando firmemente desde a semana passada, conforme as investigacoes de corrupcao no Brasil se aproximaram do governo da presidente Dilma Rousseff.

Muitos operadores acreditam que uma mudanca no governo poderia ajudar a resgatar a credibilidade do pais com investidores, embora alguns ressaltem que as turbulencias politicas tendem a prejudicar as perspectivas economicas no curto prazo.

A atuacao do BC tambem ajudou a trazer alivio ao mercado de cambio. A autoridade monetaria realizou nesta tarde leilao de venda de ate 2 bilhoes de dolares com compromisso de recompra para reforcar que a autoridade monetaria esta pronta para corrigir exageros.

""O BC deixou claro que esta atento. So essa indicacao ja faz efeito no mercado"", disse o gerente de derivativos de uma gestora de recursos nacional.

Pela manha, o BC promoveu mais um leilao de rolagem dos swaps que vencem no proximo mes, vendendo a oferta total de 9,6 mil contratos. Ao todo, a autoridade monetaria ja rolou 3,195 bilhoes de dolares, ou cerca de 32 por cento do lote total, que equivale a 10,092 bilhoes de dolares.",[]

MEXICO CITY Mexican construction firm ICA has readied a bankruptcy protection filing in case it fails to restructure its hefty debt load outside of court, people familiar with the matter said, adding the board was meeting on Wednesday to discuss its plans.

ICA, which has defaulted on about $60 million in interest payments since December, is struggling under a multi-billion dollar debt load made heavier by a slumping peso and a cash crunch as government spending on infrastructure has slipped.

A spokesperson for ICA (ICA.MX) was not immediately available for comment.

It hired FTI Consulting and investment bank Rothschild to help it engineer business and restructuring plans by mid-February. But the company announced last month that the proposals would not be ready until March.

According to one source, ICA's board, which is presided over by Bernardo Quintana Isaac, was meeting to analyze FTI's business plan and Rothschild's restructuring recommendations.

If ICA cannot reach agreements with its creditors outside of court, it can file for bankruptcy protection, which would allow the company to continue negotiating with its creditors without risk of lawsuits.

The bankruptcy protection filing, which has been ready since January, envisions keeping certain units that hold company assets out of bankruptcy, two sources said. That would allow them to bid for projects.

ICA shares closed up 5.75 percent at 4.6 pesos per share.

TORONTO The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, marking a nearly four-month high as oil prices rallied and the Bank of Canada refrained from action to erode the currency's recent sharp gains.

The central bank held its policy interest rate steady at 0.50 percent, citing lower market volatility and stronger non-energy exports as it waits to assess the impact of government stimulus due to be unveiled in the March 22 budget.

""What the markets were anticipating was some push-back against Canadian dollar strength,"" said Bipan Rai, executive director, macro strategy at CIBC Capital Markets.

Lack of push-back indicates the Bank of Canada is comfortable with the currency at present levels, he added.

It has rebounded 11 percent since hitting a 12-year low on Jan. 20 at C$1.4689.

Too sharp a rally could hinder a pick-up in exports that appears to be underway.

The implied probability of a rate cut this year dropped to less than 29 percent from 43 percent before the decision, according to the overnight interest rate futures market BOCWATCH. It was 80 percent a little over two weeks ago.

U.S. crude CLc1 prices settled at $38.29 a barrel, up 4.90 percent after a huge draw in U.S. gasoline inventories last week convinced the market that energy demand was improving. [O/R]

The Canadian dollar CAD=D4 ended at C$1.3250 to the greenback, or 75.47 U.S. cents, much stronger than Tuesday's close of C$1.3416, or 74.54 U.S.

The currency's weakest level was C$1.3447, while it touched its strongest since Nov. 12 at C$1.3230.

The new Liberal government is expected to run a big deficit and invest in infrastructure projects. Adding private-sector investment to projects could spur even greater spending.

There should be a slight upgrade to the Bank of Canada's economic projection in April if it incorporates what is expected from fiscal stimulus, said Mark Chandler, head of Canadian fixed income and currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Canadian government bond prices were lower across a steeper maturity curve. The two-year CA2YT=RR price fell 7.5 Canadian cents to yield 0.532 percent and the benchmark 10-year CA10YT=RR was down 61 Canadian cents to yield 1.248 percent.

The Canada-U.S. two-year bond spread was 1.8 basis points higher at -36.6 basis points, while the 10-year spread was 2.4 basis points higher at -62.8 basis points as Canadian government bonds underperformed.

Por Lisandra Paraguassu

BRASILIA O governo da presidente Dilma Rousseff ve com bons olhos a eventual participacao de Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva no ministerio, embora o ex-presidente, alvo da mais recente fase da operacao Lava Jato, resista a ideia.

O ministro da Secretaria de Governo, Ricardo Berzoini, afirmou nesta quarta-feira que o ex-presidente pode assumir um ministerio, em meio a noticias sobre essa possibilidade. Segundo Berzoini, uma nomeacao depende apenas de ele (Lula) querer.

A bola sempre esteve com ele, disse Berzoini, ao ser questionado sobre o assunto. Para o governo e bom. Qual governo nao vai querer por o Pele em campo?, comparou.

Caso assuma um ministerio, o ex-presidente passara a ter foro privilegiado junto ao Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF). Lula foi o principal alvo da 24a da Lava Jato, deflagrada na sexta-feira, e foi obrigado a prestar depoimento a Policia Federal apos mandado de conducao coercitiva expedido pelo juiz federal Sergio Moro, que cuida das acoes da operacao na primeira instancia.

O ato de Moro acendeu a luz vermelha no PT e no governo, que passou a ver chances reais de o ex-presidente ser preso.

Ate agora, a alternativa mais provavel para Lula na Esplanada seria o Ministerio das Relacoes Exteriores, com o qual o ex-presidente tem uma grande afinidade e seria bem recebido pela maior parte dos diplomatas --dentro do Itamaraty, os tempos da pasta durante o governo Lula ainda sao lembrados com saudade.

Outra possibilidade seria a Secretaria de Governo, responsavel pela articulacao politica e a cargo hoje de Berzoini.

No entanto, de acordo com duas fontes proximas ao ex-presidente, Lula ainda resiste a voltar ao governo, mas a pressao do PT tem aumentado e estaria surtindo efeito.

De acordo com uma dessas fontes, um advogado amigo de Lula analisou as informacoes disponiveis no processo da Lava Jato e sinalizou ao ex-presidente que, da forma como a investigacao esta sendo feita, ha indicios de que a intencao e realmente prende-lo.

""A melhor chance seria ele (Lula) assumir um ministerio para o processo ir ao STF e ter um julgamento justo"", disse a fonte ligada ao ex-presidente. Ela reconheceu, no entanto, que Lula continua resistindo a ideia por achar que seria uma confissao de culpa e um ato de covardia.

Uma fonte palaciana disse a Reuters que Dilma deixou claro a Lula que o governo esta aberto para que ele ocupe o cargo que achar mais adequado e que nao e preciso convite, apenas a decisao do ex-presidente.

A ideia de levar Lula para o ministerio de Dilma ja havia surgido no ano passado, durante a reforma ministerial, justamente para dar foro privilegiado ao ex-presidente, mas nao prosperou porque Lula recusou essa possibilidade acreditando que nao seria necessario.

O governo sabe que enfrentara enormes criticas se nomear Lula para um ministerio com o claro intuito de protege-lo da Lava Jato, mas avalia que ainda assim e um movimento necessario.

""Seria bom para ele, mas bom para o governo tambem, que precisa de um apoio na area politica"", disse a fonte palaciana, que pediu anonimato. ""Seria um desgaste para o governo, mas depois passa"", acrescentou.",[]

WASHINGTON, Md.  Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump cancelled, last-minute, his scheduled appearance here at the American Conservative Unions annual conference, CPAC. Liz Mair, the spokeswoman for an anti-Trump effort who had planned to protest at his speech, is taking credit for keeping him at bay.

The New York businessman doesnt have as much support here among conservatives as he seems to have among the general population of Republicans. Mair, who says she had commitments from about 50 people to join her protest, explained just how strong her disapproval is: She said in an interview Saturday shed never vote for him  not even if he won the Republican nomination and faced off against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.

There are a lot of average Americans out there on the right who are terrified of this guy being president, she said, adding she believed those voters would turn to a third-party candidate, a write-in or would simply stay home on election day rather than vote for Trump.

The idea turns on its head a fear members of the Republican establishment began to express as soon as Trump announced his White House bid last summer. Worried hed launch a third-party run if he didnt get the Republican nomination, party leaders got Trump to sign a loyalty pledge saying he wouldnt run as an independent. They, in turn, pledged to support him as the nominee. The agreement seemed to head off the possibility that a third candidate would take votes away from the Republican ticket and hand the presidency to Clinton.

Trump is succeeding as a Republican, but the third-party threat from the right remains. Its just less likely that third candidate will be The Donald. Instead, it could be the Libertarian former governor of New Mexico Gary Johnson or a yet-undetermined write-in.

Mair pointed to the success of Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, who beat the Republican nominee for her Senate seat in 2010 as a write-in on the ballot.

Its a lot harder to spell Murkowski than it is to spell Ryan or Romney or Walker or Perry, she said, referring to her other ideas for Republican write-ins, House Speaker Paul Ryan, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and former Texas Governor Rick Perry. Romney, Walker and Perry have all run for president. Ryan was Romneys running mate on the 2012 Republican presidential ticket.

Not everyone at CPAC intends to vote for a third party if Trump is the nominee. Several people asked by a reporter about the idea chuckled and walked away at the suggestion, refusing to give their names.

But Josh Paladino, a 19-year-old student at Hillsdale College in Hillsdale, Michigan, brought up the idea without any prompting. He said he so strongly disapproved of Trump that he was hoping Republican leaders would use whatever obscure party rules they could find to keep the nomination away from him. But if they couldnt, he said, hed vote for someone else.

Hopefully a conservative can get on the ballot, he said.",[]

reuters.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,A campaign that makes the political turmoil of 1968 look good,"[""Any Opinions Expressed Here Are The Author's Own"", 'Maurice Isserman', 'Posted Laster', 'Maurice Isserman Teaches History At Hamilton College Is Co-author Of America Divided The Civil War Of The', 'Posted Solidar']","There is rare agreement, on the left and the right, that the 2016 presidential election season is looking to be a repeat of Democratic Partys 1968 race.

There was a bitterly fought primary campaign that year, with fierce public debates over the Vietnam War, race relations and law and order. The campaign led to a divisive and volatile Democratic National Convention in Chicago, with clashes between antiwar protesters and club-swinging cops in the streets outside the arena, and protests inside the hall over both the war and the mayhem outside.

The resulting split in Democratic ranks, plus the widespread public belief that the country was coming apart at the seams, led to Republican Richard M. Nixons win in November. The GOP went on to win the White House in all but one of the next half-dozen elections.

This time around, however, it is Republicans who seem most vulnerable to splintering after a fevered primary season. The Donald Trump insurgency is defying the best efforts of the GOP establishment to steer primary voters to other candidates. This seems a dire threat to Trumps adopted partys prospects  not only in the November election, but also potentially for decades to come.

Trumps supporters, like many liberal anti-war Democratic primary voters did in 1968, view the race in apocalyptic terms. They will not easily be persuaded to cast their votes strategically for another nominee should a brokered convention in July deny the current GOP front-runner the nomination.

I want to see Trump go up there and do damage to the Republican Party, one middle-aged white voter in Mississippi told a reporter after former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, urged the party faithful to support other candidates.

Resentfully nihilistic sentiments among the partys base voters do not contribute to building and maintaining durable majority coalitions, though many political pundits now suggest this could happen. Just ask the Democrats in 1968.

Yet, similar to the 1968 race and identical to it are different categories. History doesnt repeat itself, Mark Twain is supposed to have said, but it does rhyme. (The Twain attribution is a little dubious, but its the kind of thing he might have said.) Consider three ways in which 1968 and 2016 resemble each other while retaining significant dissimilarities.

First, the nominating process is significantly different. In 1968 the Democratic establishments candidate, and eventual nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, did not run in a single primary. Only 14 states and the District of Columbia held primaries that year, and the victories were largely divided between two insurgent, anti-war candidates, Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy, and New York Senator Robert Kennedy. (Though a few favorite son candidates did run as surrogates for Humphrey.)

The overwhelming majority of delegates who gathered at the convention in Chicago in August 1968 were thus chosen by party insiders, chiefly elected officials, rather than primary voters. So it should not have been surprising that they proved overwhelmingly pro-Humphrey  and awarded him the nomination on the first ballot.

Many liberal voters, accordingly, sat on their hands in the falls presidential campaign.

Thanks to reforms in both parties nominating process during the 1970s, most Republican and Democratic delegates today are chosen by primary and caucus voters, allowing presidential candidates to claim a popular mandate. Thus far in the Republican race, Trump has ridden a wave of populist resentments, and is well on his way to secure the simple majority he needs for nomination on the first ballot.

Should he remain the front-runner but fall short of the necessary 1,237 delegates, the consequences for Republicans could prove even more devastating than the boss-driven selection of the presidential candidate did for the Democrats in 1968.

In 1968, Humphreys selection, however controversial within party ranks, was still politics-as-usual. If Trump fails to win on the first ballot, and party insiders manage on a subsequent ballot (the dreaded brokered convention) to steer the nomination to an alternative candidate, it will be perceived as more akin to politics-by-coup-detat. Angry Trump voters are likely to abandon the Republican Party.

Second, the gap between party insiders and insurgent candidates in 1968, while wide in terms of specific issues, especially the Vietnam War, was far narrower in terms of the candidates experience and capabilities. The candidates, ordinarily team players, had a lot in common, among themselves  and with their partys elite. In 1968, McCarthy had served in Congress for 20 years, 10 in the House of Representatives and 10 in the Senate. Kennedy, in addition to being the brother of a martyred Democratic president, had been U.S. attorney general, and spent four years as a senator. McCarthys fellow Minnesotan, Humphrey had served a term as mayor of Minneapolis, before serving three terms as a senator (the last as Democratic majority whip), before taking his place as President Lyndon B. Johnsons vice president.

They were all dyed-in-the-wool Democrats. Solid party men. None of the candidates, faced with defeat, had any intention of bolting the party for a third party effort. In a less polarizing set of circumstances, say minus the Vietnam War, its easy to imagine either Kennedy or Humphrey, and perhaps even McCarthy, proving a candidate acceptable to all the partys factions, insiders and outsiders alike.

Today, however, there is a profound disjunction in the leading Republican candidates experiences, credentials and loyalties. Real estate developer and reality television star Trump has never held or seriously pursued elective office. Cruz and Rubio have backgrounds in Republican state politics, but neither have served long  or with any particular distinction  in national office. At the start of the primary season, none would have been the Republican establishments top choice. At least two, front-runner Trump and his chief rival, Cruz, are regarded by many party insiders as deranged or disloyal. Rubio, acceptable on other grounds, is seen as a hopelessly maladroit.

Further muddying the choices is the fact that the divisions among the candidates, rather than based on a serious debate over policy direction, have devolved into playground insults. Whatever else might be said about the Democrats in 1968, they took their separate stances over real and substantive issues, such as the Vietnam War. Penis size did not emerge as a subject for discussion.

Finally, in comparing 1968 to 2016, the violence factor needs to be considered. The backdrop for the 1968 presidential campaign included the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Kennedy, campus occupations and urban riots, as well as the protests in the streets of Chicago outside the convention. The anti-war protesters chanted The whole world is watching as they were beaten and arrested by Chicago police. In a sense they were right  though not about what the world would conclude from their example.

That fall, Republican television commercials featured clips of the Chicago disturbances, and demanded How can a party that cant keep order in its own backyard hope to keep order in our 50 states?

A fair question  that today can be asked of Republicans. When the front-running candidate for the nomination has some conservative commentators invoking the specter of fascism, the Republican vision of order isnt necessarily going to play well in November.

After one black man was beaten and ejected from a Trump rally in Atlanta, the candidate commented on Fox News, Maybe he should have been roughed up, because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing, (i.e. chanting Black Lives Matter!) Following a similar event a few weeks later, Trumps response was, I love the old days. You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? Theyd be carried out on a stretcher.

The rancor displayed by Trump rally-goers, encouraged by their candidate and directed against protesters and media alike, bears some resemblance to the old days of 1968  especially the hate-filled gatherings for third-party segregationist candidate Alabama Governor George Wallace  who once vowed to run over any protesters who sat-in in front of his limousine.

What happens if Trump is denied the Republican nomination in Cleveland in July? Will his supporters, with his overt or implied approval, fill the streets outside the convention hall in violent protest? Or will some of them seek Second Mmendment solutions to their political frustrations? (One of Trumps New Hampshire campaign officials was arrested earlier this month in connection with his role in the 2014 Bundy Ranch armed standoff with federal officers in Nevada.)

The 2016 election is not simply a repeat of 1968. If the current election evokes the historical rhyme scheme of that earlier contest, it is chiefly in the stakes involved and the uncertainty of the outcome.",[]
reuters.com,2016-03-09 13:09:13+00:00,Post lasst sich von Amazon nicht Bange machen,['Reuters Editorial'],"Trucks of German mail carrier Deutsche Post are parked during a demonstration Munich, Germany, June 18, 2015. Workers at Deutsche Post are on strike over labour union Verdi's demands in a dispute over pay and conditions.

Troisdorf Die Deutsche Post sieht sich fur einen Angriff des Online-Handlers Amazon in ihrem angestammten Paketgeschaft gerustet.

""Wir bieten eine hervorragende Qualitat in unseren Diensten"", sagte Konzernchef Frank Appel am Mittwoch in Troisdorf bei Bonn. Es sei schon, wenn sich Unternehmen fur den Markt der Post interessierten - ""dies zeigt, wie attraktiv er ist"". Der Konzern habe alle Szenarien durchgespielt und bekraftige seine Ziele bis 2020. Allein in diesem Jahr will Appel das operative Ergebnis um mindestens eine Milliarde Euro auf 3,4 bis 3,7 Milliarden Euro steigern. Dabei helfen sollen das boomende Expressgeschaft und die Sanierung der kriselnden Frachtsparte, die der Post im vergangenen Jahr noch einen Gewinneinbruch eingebrockt hatte.

Amazon, in Deutschland bislang Grokunde der Post, betreibt in Olching bei Munchen ein erstes Paketzentrum, in dem rund 130 Mitarbeiter Pakete fur die Zustellung noch am gleichen oder am kommenden Tag verteilen. ""Naturlich ist das etwas, was wir uns anschauen"", raumte Post-Vorstand Jurgen Gerdes ein. Ein Abzug von Paketmengen beschadige das Geschaft der Post, doch werde dies nicht nachhaltig sein. ""Wir haben eine groe Maschinerie mit vielen, vielen Kunden."" Zudem sei davon auszugehen, dass auch Amazon weiter zu den Kunden der Post zahlen werde. Gerdes machte auch klar: ""Jeder Kunde hat das Recht, seine Geschichte fortzuschreiben."" Auch die Post tue dies - und arbeite weiter ""an einer Erfolgsgeschichte"".

Zuversichtlich stimmt den Bonner Konzern die Entwicklung auf dem gesamten Paketmarkt in Deutschland. Hatte er 2010 der Post zufolge noch ein Volumen von 6,8 Milliarden Euro, waren es 2015 bereits 9,5 Milliarden Euro. Auf die Post enfiel ein Anteil von 44 Prozent. Nun will Amazon einen Teil des Kuchens abhaben. Der US-Konzern greift fur die Auslieferung an die Kunden auf lokale Logistikunternehmen zuruck - Amazon-Kleinlaster sind also nicht unterwegs. Jedoch pruft das Unternehmen die Eroffnung weiterer Verteilzentren. Zudem hatte Amazon Stellenanzeigen geschaltet, aus denen hervorgeht, dass in Deutschland eine Amazon-eigene vollautomatische Packstationen aufgebaut werden solle. In Grobritannien bietet Amazon diese bereits an. Die Post sieht sich dafur gewappnet, sie hat allein Deutschland mit uber 2700 Packstationen uberzogen.

GEWINNRUCKGANG IM VERGANGENEN JAHR - AKTIE IM MINUS

2015 litt die Post noch unter den anhaltenden Problemen in ihrer Frachtsparte: Der operative Konzernertrag (Ebit) brach auf 2,41 (Vorjahr: 2,97) Milliarden Euro ein. Auf der Bilanz lasteten nach Post-Angaben noch Abschreibungen in einer Hohe von gut einer halben Milliarde Euro. Trotzdem wollen die Bonner eine zum Vorjahr unveranderte Dividende von 0,85 Euro je Aktie ausschutten und fur bis zu eine Milliarde Euro eigene Aktien zuruckkaufen. Zum Ende des Jahres konnte die Post den Gewinnruckgang eingrenzen - dabei geholfen hat eine Paketflut zu Weihnachten. Ruckenwind erhofft sich das Unternehmen auch von der Porto-Erhohung in Deutschland. Die Post hatte die Preise so stark angehoben wie seit fast 30 Jahren nicht mehr. Beim Massenprodukt Standardbrief stieg das Porto etwa von 62 auf 70 Cent.

Borsianer konnte der Post-Chef mit seinem positiven Ausblick dennoch nicht uberzeugen: Post-Aktien gaben 1,4 Prozent auf 23,12 Euro nach und bildeten zeitweise das Schlusslicht im Dax. Die Titel hatten allerdings seit Monatsbeginn mehr als sechs Prozent zugelegt und damit drei Mal so viel wie der Leitindex. Analysten werteten es positiv, dass der Konzern seine Prognosen fur 2016 und 2020 bestatigte.",[]

Trump, who's had to fend off a number of accusations during his bid for president, is not named in the suit.

Traditional German industrial companies like Bosch are looking to transform themselves from manufactures of equipment to service providers using data generated by their machines.

Bosch is hoping its engineering expertise will give it an advantage in making the ""Internet of Things"" (IoT), where objects communicate with each other, a reality for its customers in smart homes, connected mobility or intelligent industry.

Its announcement on Wednesday that it plans build its own cloud puts it in competition with services from U.S. technology giants Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM and Salesforce.com.

Bosch's cloud will be run out of a computing center based in Germany, which it hopes will attract customers who may have doubts about data security of U.S-owned servers.

Bosch Chief Executive Volkmar Denner told a conference in Berlin that the company was building its own IoT and would combine this with its experience in making everyday objects.

""There are product companies like Bosch trying to add software and services and there are IT companies trying to get into the physical space. The race is completely open,"" he said.

Stuttgart-based Bosch plans to run around 50 of its own in-house applications on the cloud this year, before opening up to other companies from 2017. It plans to roll out other data centers across the globe but declined to give a timeline.

More than five million devices are currently connected via Bosch's IoT software suite. Applications include a system that enables users to remotely control the temperature of their home as well sensors that help drivers find parking spaces or firms track the quality of a product once it leaves a factory.

Bosch declined to disclose how much money it was spending on the cloud specifically but said it was investing around 500 million euros ($548 million) annually in new technologies.

The company plans to charge customers based on the services that they use, but did not give revenue forecasts. Market research firm Gartner estimates that global sales in the public cloud market will exceed $200 billion this year.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 00:24:56+00:00,Exclusive: Bank of America hiring bankers for new middle-market push - sources,"['Dan Freed', 'Olivia Oran']","Bank of America Corp is hiring a new team of investment bankers who cater to midsized companies, four years after dismantling a similar business, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The precise number of middle-market bankers it plans to add could not be determined, but one person said it would be fewer than 10.

The hiring comes as Bank of America is reducing staff more broadly, while also trying to grow in areas where it believes it can gain market share. As the second-biggest U.S. lender with a large commercial banking business, executives believe Bank of America can make inroads in advising midsized companies on mergers and stock and bond offerings, the sources said. Bank of America defines middle-market as companies with $50 million to $2 billion in revenue.

The bank also hopes the push will lead to additional business such as managing money for executives at midsized companies.

Sources asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media about matters that have not been made public.

Bank of America announced internally last year that Vice Chairman Mark Stephanz would create a group that provides investment banking services to midsized companies. The hiring is part of that effort. His team will work together with counterparts in the commercial bank who provide traditional loans and cash management services, sources said.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender previously launched a middle-market business in 2007, with more than 30 investment bankers who focused on mergers and acquisitions. It abandoned the effort in 2012 to focus on larger clients and bigger deals, sources said. In 2015, Bank of America ranked fourth in global M&A league tables, according to Thomson Reuters data. It ranked 23rd globally in deals worth $500 million or less. Bank of America generated around 17 percent of its M&A fees from middle market deals, the lowest percentage of any big Wall Street bank except Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Last year, M&A hit a record volume of nearly $5 trillion, due to mega deals like Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA's $106 billion acquisition of SABMiller Plc and oil company Royal Dutch Shell Plc's $70 billion purchase of BG Group Plc. But some Wall Street executives predict blockbuster deals will slow down this year. In January, JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said she expects to see fewer massive mergers and more mid-sized deals.

Bank of America has been hiring salespeople to drum up business, even as it has cut support staff and underperformers as part of a multiyear cost-cutting initiative. Last year alone, it cut more than 10,000 jobs.

The bank laid off a number of investment bankers on Tuesday because of weak markets, one of the sources said.

O Projeto de Decreto Legislativo (PDC), que se aprovado pode gerar um impacto de 300 bilhoes de reais no estoque da divida, estava pautado para esta quarta-feira. O governo havia lancado mao de uma obstrucao para evitar uma derrota caso a proposta fosse votada.

A oposicao, por outro lado, trabalhava para evitar que a CMO aprovasse as contas do governo federal de 2014, o que configuraria uma noticia positiva para o Planalto, dias antes das manifestacoes convocadas contra presidente Dilma Rousseff, no domingo.

Apos o acordo, ficou acertado que o jogo ficaria no zero a zero: o governo abriu mao de ter a noticia positiva nesta quarta, mas tambem evita uma derrota bilionaria no plenario da Camara.

E um bom acordo, e uma vitoria da Casa, disse o lider do governo na Camara, deputado Jose Guimaraes (PT-CE).

A votacao do PDC, que para entrar em vigor precisa ser aprovado pela Camara e depois pelo Senado, esta marcada para a proxima terca-feira, dia seguinte a nova reuniao prevista entre governadores e Executivo Federal.

Pouco antes de selar o trato com a oposicao, Guimaraes e outros aliados fizeram apelos para que o projeto que susta o calculo da divida nao fosse votado.

Faco um apelo para que nos pelo menos esperassemos a conclusao da negociacao com o governo, pediu o lider do governo, seguido do vice-lider Silvio Costa (PtdoB-PE), para quem a aprovacao da materia sera uma pessima sinalizacao ao mercado.

Outros lideres aliados se manifestaram na mesma linha e ate mesmo o deputado Aguinaldo Ribeiro (PP-PB), lider do partido do autor do projeto, Esperidiao Amin (PP-SC), fez coro a Guimaraes, e pediu que a votacao fosse adiada para a proxima terca-feira.

A proposta ja havia sido pautada na semana passada, mas a analise foi adiada para que governadores pudessem negociar o tema com a presidente Dilma Rousseff, na ultima sexta-feira.

O projeto propoe a anulacao da metodologia de calculo estabelecida no Decreto no 8.616, de dezembro do ano passado, que regulamenta a mudanca de indexadores da divida dos Estados e municipios com a Uniao.

Amin criticou as tentativas de acordo promovidas pelo governo com os chefes dos Executivos estaduais, que incluiu a oferta de um alongamento da divida.

Um acordo para alongar uma divida extorsiva, fundanda em indexadores fixados em decreto e nao na lei. Se o decreto fosse aprovado aqui e no Senado, signifca negociar para valer com os Estados e municipios empoderados, e nao mendigos, tendo que ocultar a sua posicao como estao hoje, disse Amin.

Considerando que o Projeto de Decreto Legislativo (PDC) suspende as regras para o calculo do montante da divida, a Uniao ficara sem condicoes de cobrar Estados e municipios, segundo assessoria tecnica da lideranca de governo.

Por se tratar de um PDC, a proposta e sujeita a votacoes na Camara e no Senado, mas nao passa por sancao, ou seja, nao pode ser vetada pela presidente, justamente em um momento em que o governo se esforca para equilibrar as contas publicas.

The opinions expressed are her own.

Theres a glimmer of hope for the humans whose jobs in financial services are under threat from computers that can do their jobs faster and more cheaply. Buyside firms are spending more on paying traders than on technology, a new study shows. But only a select few bankers will beat the rise of the machines.

Asset managers spent an estimated $15.6 billion on trader compensation and technology in 2015, up 4 percent from the previous year, according to Greenwich Associates. The share allocated to paying humans rose by 5 percentage points to 69 percent, with the bulk of the trading staff budget earmarked for actual traders rather than support staff.

The willingness to fork out more money for traders may seem odd when layoffs on bank trading floors are creating a glut of supply. Sales, trading and research headcount in fixed income, currencies, commodities and equities has fallen by 23 percent globally in the past five years, according to analytics firm Coalition. And theres no end in sight to the trend with the likes of Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse announcing more layoffs this year.

Still, not everyone has the skills to land a job in asset management. Buyside firms want traders with a good cross-asset grounding rather than tunnel vision in a world where, for example, what happens to equities or bonds can hinge on swings in oil. The ability to read and deal with increasingly whimsical financial markets is also crucial at a time when 10 percent asset price drops can be quickly followed by gains of the same magnitude. Computers arent necessarily able to anticipate such irrational moves.

Ideal candidates need to twin such skills with the ability to find and access liquidity even in difficult times. Balance sheet constraints have taken a toll on market-making and banks have fewer staff to handle buyside relationships. Also useful will be the ability to process large amounts of data, some ability to programme and a fearless approach to quantitative analysis. The lucky few humans who tick all these boxes can look forward to machines becoming their colleagues, not their usurpers.",[]

SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO During a tour of Zika preparations in Puerto Rico, Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called Zika a ""tremendous challenge and crisis"" and said protecting pregnant women from the virus is a top priority.

In Brazil, Zika has been linked to a spike in cases of microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size and underdeveloped brains.

""Until a few months ago, no one had any idea that Zika could cause birth defects,"" Frieden told reporters Tuesday at a briefing in Puerto Rico's health department.

Frieden has been working with CDC staff and the Puerto Rican government on strategies to protect pregnant from becoming infected with the mosquito-borne virus, which Frieden called a top priority.

In Puerto Rico, the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries Zika is widespread, and Frieden said controlling it will require a multi-pronged approach involving government, municipalities, neighbors, families and society at large.

Cases of Zika are doubling weekly in Puerto Rico, and the CDC expects hundreds of thousands of individuals will become infected, including thousands of pregnant women.

To protect pregnant women, Frieden recommended using insect repellent daily and reliably.

He also suggested adding window screens and air conditioning, where possible. And he called for reducing standing water in and around homes to eliminate mosquito breeding habitats.

Frieden's comments, delivered mostly in Spanish, followed two days of briefings with staff at the CDC's Emergency Operations Center in San Juan. CDC researchers are monitoring the outbreak and studying the best ways to prevent Zika infections through education campaigns, and the distribution of Zika prevention kits for pregnant women.

Much remains unknown about Zika, including whether the virus actually causes microcephaly in babies. Brazil said it has confirmed more than 640 cases of microcephaly, and considers most of them to be related to Zika infections in the mothers. Brazil is investigating more than 4,200 additional suspected cases of microcephaly.

At the CDC's Dengue Branch in Puerto Rico, scientists are conducting research on the most effective mosquito control measures, and processing diagnostic tests from blood samples delivered daily to the laboratory.

Dr. Jorge Munoz, branch director, said in an interview they are capable of processing 400 to 500 blood samples a week. Scientists at the laboratory developed a triple test that can detect Zika, dengue and chikungunya - three different viruses carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito that is endemic in Puerto Rico.

The test will be crucial in helping to quickly sort out whether Zika was the cause of an infection or whether it was dengue and chikungunya, which also cause infection and illness.

""Puerto Rico is in a very different situation from the rest of the United States,"" Frieden told the briefing.

Besides the high density of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, Puerto Rico has a lot of housing without window screens or air conditioning.

""The combination of those two things, when you add Zika in, means the likelihood of a very large number of cases,"" Frieden said.

""In rest of the United States, we may see clusters,"" he said. But if Zika behaves the way chikungunya and dengue have, ""we will not see widespread transmission.""

For the 1930s, the Spanish Civil War, the three-year fight between Fascists (helped by Nazi German) and Republicans (armed by the Soviet Union) pointed to the far larger global disaster to come. For the 1980s, the Soviet battle to control Afghanistan, a bloody mess of occupation and insurgency, helped bring forward the collapse of the Soviet Union and set the stage for 9/11 and modern Islamist militancy.

For the 1990s, you can take your pick of the Balkans, Somalia, Rwanda or Democratic Republic of Congo. For the 2000s, it was Iraq  the ultimate demonstration of the unipolar moment and the limits, dangers and sheer short-livedness of Americas status as unchallenged global superpower.

We are, of course, little more than half way through the current decade. Already, however, it looks as though it has to be Syrias civil war.

In pure human terms, the war dwarfs any other recent conflict. Estimates of the number of Syrian dead range from 270,000 to 470,000 people. The United Nations estimates up to 7.6 million Syrians are displaced within their own country, with up to 4 million fleeing their homeland. From its relatively small beginnings as a largely unarmed revolt, the Syrian conflict has now dragged in more than a half-dozen countries.

Its broader implications continue to grow by the month. While not the sole cause of Europes migrant crisis, Syrians make up a significant proportion  perhaps even the majority  of new arrivals on the continent. The sheer numbers are producing political strains that have already torn up the ideal of a borderless Europe and may yet wreck the entire European Union project.

Syria has exemplified what Financial Times columnist Gideon Rachmann calls a zero-sum world. From the beginning, rival regional powers  particularly Shiite Iran and Sunni states led by Saudi Arabia  approached the conflict with the assumption that neither side could afford to back down or compromise without letting the other win.

From that perspective, Syria is part of a larger regional confrontation that encompasses the war in Yemen, the long-term sectarian battle for control of Iraq and, of course, attempts to rein in Iran, in general, and its nuclear program, in particular.

Increasingly, though, the war in Syria has become part of the wider, potentially more dangerous confrontation between Western powers and Russia. That confrontation also goes back years  through Kosovo and the Balkans to the Cold War.

It also goes well beyond geopolitics to a fundamental disagreement over the limits of state power, the acceptable tools to restore order and the sustainability of authoritarian government. As I wrote in September, Russian President Vladimir Putins entire domestic justification of his power comes down to the importance of maintaining a stable central government as a bulwark against instability and chaos, whatever brutality that might take.

In Syria, Russias military intervention has been a game changer. As in Ukraine in 2014, Moscow has proved itself willing to use a level of military force that the West never anticipated and, as yet, has no real strategy to counter. Nor, for now, has it shown the will or intent to do so.

If the invasion of Iraq showed a United States that saw few real restrictions to its power, Syria has demonstrated the opposite. Washington has continuously prevaricated over what to do about Syria and even now, with Russian action literally redrawing the battlefield, has little in the way of a coherent strategy.

Painting this simply as a tale of Western or U.S. presidential weakness misses the point, however. If Syria shows us anything, it is how complicated the 21st century has become and how few good choices it can leave Washington.

Of course, if the West had signaled more clearly in the Syrian uprisings early days that it would do nothing and let Syrian President Bashar al-Assad slaughter his way back to stability, it might have fatally undermined the rebellion before it started. But this would also have left many in the West feeling distinctly uncomfortable.

Launching massive military strikes against Damascus following its 2013 use of chemical weapons might have helped the credibility of any future Western red lines. But they would also have further undermined what was left of the central government, an outcome now widely seen to have been an error when tried in Iraq and Libya.

The situation on the ground, meanwhile, is ever messier. As in several other recent wars  Iraq, Ukraine, Libya and Yemen  the national armed forces of Syria have become ever less important. Most of the recent fighting is down to relatively disparate militias with increasingly complex loyalties. Already, we have seen U.S.-backed Kurdish forces fighting other U.S.-backed groups, as well as in the growing conflict with Turkey, a U.S. ally.

The one area where the United States and its European allies have been willing to take action has been the fight against Islamic State. That seems reasonable: Of all the elements in the Syrian civil war, Islamic State is by far the most direct threat to Western interests, states and populations. Taking it on is a battle possibly and even likely to be won. Islamic State has already lost significant territory and finances.

That doesnt, however, come close to providing clarity over what to do about the rest of Syria.

As international mediation and ceasefire talks stutter forward, global and regional powers have a choice.

For most of those involved, the truth is that there may still be much to be gained by fighting. Russia could keep up the pressure and win back more territory for Assad and possibly benefit closer to home if the war helped destabilize the European Union. The United States, for that matter, could finally step up and support opposition fighters, which could block any recovery for Assad and drag the Russian mission into a quagmire. Also, regional powers could throw more resources into the battle, something Saudi Arabia seemingly signaled with its talk of sending ground troops to fight Islamic State.

The alternative, though, is that all sides pull back and demonstrate a willingness to compromise. There are plenty of messy issues. The most obvious is the immediate future of Assad and those around him. What exactly the compromise turns out to be might probably be less important than whether or not there is one.

Based on the past few weeks, the signals are mixed, at best. Some local ceasefires have been brokered, though with limited but very real humanitarian benefits for those on the ground.

If ordinary Syrians come to believe the war might genuinely be over one day, they are more likely to stay in the region, which might spark a whole different collection of conflicts.

A deal over Syria would perhaps be the most positive sign that the world could overcome its myriad growing challenges and confrontations. Failing to do so, however, might point to even worse things to come.",[]

South Korea's Lee Sedol, the world's top Go player, speaks during a news conference ahead of matches against Google's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo, in Seoul, South Korea, March 8, 2016.

SEOUL Google's AlphaGo computer program on Wednesday won the first of five matches against one of the world's top players of a complex board game, Go, marking a dramatic advance for the field of artificial intelligence (AI).

South Korean professional player Lee Sedol, the holder of 18 international titles, conceded defeat in a match broadcast live, with one YouTube stream drawing tens of thousands of spectators worldwide, while domestic television gave frequent updates.

""We landed on the moon,"" Demis Hassabis, chief executive and co-founder of Google subsidiary DeepMind, which built AlphaGo, said in a tweet after the victory. ""So proud of the team!""

AlphaGo had made history in October, by becoming the first computer program ever to beat a human professional player at the ancient Asian game, which many experts consider to be the most fiendishly complicated of its kind.

But 33-year-old Lee, a much more challenging opponent, was considered a bigger hurdle for a machine to vanquish.

Lee expressed surprise at his loss.

""I didn't think AlphaGo would play the game in such a perfect manner,"" he told reporters after the match. ""I would like to express my respect to the programmers for making such an amazing program.""

Go, most popular in countries such as China, South Korea and Japan, involves two contestants moving black and white stones on a square grid, with the aim of seizing the most territory.

Experts did not expect an artificial intelligence program to beat a human professional for at least a decade, until AlphaGo's victory last year over player Fan Hui.

""Today's win is symbolic, but nevertheless a very important step,"" said Jang Woo-seok, a research fellow at the Hyundai Research Institute. ""What AlphaGo is doing is essentially cutting down the number of potential moves to consider.""

Google executives say Go offers too many possible moves for a machine to win simply through brute-force calculations, unlike chess, in which IBM's Deep Blue famously beat former world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.

Instead, they said, AlphaGo has sought to approximate human intuition, by studying old matches and using simulated games to hone itself independently.

In recent years, scientists have made strides in getting computers to think and learn in ways approaching those of people, so that artificial intelligence can one day assist in advanced fields, such as healthcare and scientific research.

""The ultimate aim is to use these general-purpose technologies and apply them to all sorts of important real world problems,"" Hassabis said ahead of the match.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 12:29:37+00:00,Russia says repeatedly warned athletes about Sharapova drug,['Reuters Editorial'],"A manufacturing operator works at the Mildronate (Meldonium) medication packaging process in the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, November 23, 2010. Picture taken November 23, 2010.

MOSCOW Russia's athletics federation, facing exclusion from the Rio Olympics over previous doping scandals, said on Wednesday it had repeatedly warned athletes and coaches not to take meldonium, the banned substance used by tennis player Maria Sharapova.

Since former world number one Sharapova admitted using meldonium, Russian sports officials have said a number of other competitors have taken the substance, which is used to treat diabetes and low magnesium, and more names could emerge.

So far none of the Russian sports people named have been involved in track and field, but if any are found to have used the drug it would set back what is already an uphill struggle by Russian athletics to prove it is tackling doping in time for the Rio Games in August this year.

In an announcement entitled: ""To the attention of sports people and coaches,"" the Russian athletics federation, or ARAF, said it was reminding people in the sport yet again that meldonium is on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned list.

""The ARAF has on multiple occasions warned sports people, coaches, and support staff that, since Jan. 1 this year meldonium is included in the list of the banned substances.""

The announcement said on several occasions last year items were posted on the federation's website stating meldonium was banned, the message was also passed on at a conference of coaches last October and at three training camps.

The governing body of world athletics, the IAAF, last year suspended Russian athletics from international competition after a report commissioned by WADA alleged there was a culture of doping in Russian athletics and that sports administrators helped cover up positive tests.

Russian sports officials say they are doing everything asked of them to comply with the IAAF's demands so they can return to competition. But they have only a few months left to get reinstated before the Rio Games.

Dick Pound, author of the report on Russia commissioned by WADA, said on Wednesday that Russia may not make it back in time for Rio.

She's asking for $225,000 (USD) in back pay. The lawsuit alleges that the agency, Trump Model Management, employed Palmer using an H1-B visa, which allows U.S. employers to hire so-called ""specialized"" foreign labor. The agency listed Palmer's salary as ""at least $75,000 per year"" for three years on the application. But the model says she received less than $4000 during that time. Trump, who's had to fend off a number of accusations during his bid for president, is not named in the suit. But his attorney argues that the $75,000 a year figure was simply a guess, not a guarantee. And that the contract required Palmer ""to promptly reimburse"" the agency ""for any and all costs and expenses"". Palmer says those reimbursements amounted to 80 percent of her earnings, which were deducted by the agency. A decision is expected by the end of March.",[]

Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, World Health Organization (WHO) Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation attends a news conference on the Zika virus at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, March 9, 2016.

GENEVA Widespread spraying to eliminate mosquitoes has failed to significantly stop the spread of dengue fever and it may be the same case for the Zika virus linked to neurological disorders, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday.

The emphasis should be put on enlisting families and communities to protect themselves and eliminate from their homes the mosquitoes that carry the disease, which has spread rapidly in Brazil and Latin America, it said.

Releasing genetically modified mosquitoes or irradiating insects also needed to be studied, but evaluation of such novel methods should be done with ""extreme rigor"", the WHO warned.

A three-day meeting of experts set two other top priorities for research: speeding development of tools to diagnose Zika infections and of vaccines to prevent the disease. But they said vaccine trials may come too late for the current outbreak.

WHO Assistant Director General Marie-Paule Kieny said experts had told the meeting that there was no evidence that traditional mosquito control methods had had any significant impact on transmission of dengue, a virus close to Zika.

""This is important because we must be sure that we invest in interventions that work,"" Kieny told a news briefing.

""Certainly it is worth continuing to try to use this method for the lack of other interventions.""

She said the Aedes aegyptii species of mosquito that carries Zika is the ""cockroach of mosquitoes"" because it stays mainly indoors and is hard to eradicate. Efforts to control it needed to be much more targeted to communities and households.

""Then we will see whether it works or not,"" she said.

On Tuesday, the WHO advised pregnant women not to travel to areas with outbreaks of Zika virus due to the potential risk of birth defects, a condition known as microcephaly.

Zika has been linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, another neurological disorder, but neither link has been yet proven.

The most advanced candidate vaccines for Zika are still a few months away from entering early human clinical trials, Kieny said.

""It is therefore possible that vaccines may come late for the current Latin American outbreak, but the development of a vaccine remains an imperative, in particular vaccines suitable for pregnant women and women of child-bearing age,"" she said.

On a catwalk of mirrored spiky columns, designer Nicolas Ghesquiere opened the autumn/winter 2016/2017 show with a black leather coat adorned with golden buttons and cinched at the waist over shiny red leather trousers and combat boots. Similar leather trousers, flared and cropped at the ankle, peppered the show in various colors and were worn with block colored knits or sleek black leather jackets that were zipped at the front. Ghesquiere, who has led a renaissance of the brand known for its monogrammed leather bags, also presented T-shirt-like dresses in block colors -- blue, red, white and black. Silk scarf prints, namely belts and chains, decorated short sleeve tops and skirts combinations. They were worn with black leather sleeves that crept up above the elbow. Looks were layered -- models, who had dark makeup, wore short or quilted jackets over long waist-cinched tops and trousers or colorful knit dresses over floral printed skirts. There were also leather bra-like tops over dresses. The outfits were accessorized with lace-up boots, mostly flat, while handbags came in a variety of shapes, colors and sizes. Some models also wore large black furry hats.

His brother, Charlie (Rod Steiger), lieutenant to a powerful mobster, has ruined Terrys promising boxing career  instructing him to throw a crucial bout so the mob could bet on his opponent. It proved to be the end of Terrys hopes. Near tears, Terry confronts his brother: I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am.

Its a speech Donald Trump will not have to utter. Those who are nominally his mob  that apparently powerless entity called the Republican establishment  tried to get him to throw the bout. He hasnt. And it now seems too late to get him out of the ring. Super Tuesdays results, in which Trump won seven of 11 states, mean he is a contender. Certainly no bum. Class, though, is more debatable.

Trump achieved this through bile, prejudice, insults and money. That was Act I. Act II has followed hard on its heels: No interval. It opened with his news conference in Palm Beach, Florida, as the Super Tuesday results rolled in. Like Benedick in Shakespeares Much Ado about Nothing, who has railed to all who would listen against the entanglements of desire for women, hes suddenly ready for love of Beatrice.

Trump is ready now for love of all. Hes a reacher-out, a generous foe, a unifier. Hes not a bum at all: How could we have thought so?

If a substantial number of Americans view this with trepidation, it cannot match the horror of Europeans. I can think of no major news organization that expresses anything but fear of a Trump presidency. If Democrat Hillary Clinton falters, or the blitz against her that Trump has promised works (shes the one great heretic in his unification church), Europeans and others, who still depend on the United States for stability, protection and a basic shared morality in world affairs, will likely be even more fearful than they are already.

The view has been much rehearsed in the primary season that Trumps mastery of reality TV, his showmanship, his Youre fired! ease of dealing with any and all problems have endeared him to millions determined to see politicians as a lost, even a malign cause. The entertainment-ization of politics has proved overwhelming and pulled the most serious of politicians onto the vaudeville stage.

Look, for an illustration, at a roast of Trump, broadcast by Comedy Central in 2011. It was a dinner devoted to comic insults  harsh, libelous and hilarious  of Trump. The comedian and actor Seth McFarlane issued a stream of putdowns of Trumps monstrous ego  the funniest claimed that, even when having sex with a beautiful woman, Trump was fantasizing about himself. Trump had volunteered for the roasting and, sitting a few feet from MacFarlane, maintained a look of amusement.

In his 1987 autobiography The Art of the Deal  now a necessary read  Trump wrote, Good publicity is preferable to bad, but from a bottom-line perspective, bad publicity is sometimes better than no publicity at all. Controversy, in short, sells.

One reason Trump accepted to be roasted was that he was considering running for president in 2012. He didnt. But that was just a postponement.

In March 2014, President Barack Obama, perhaps following the same thinking, appeared on the popular web program Between Two Ferns. Host Zach Galifianakis conducted a mocking interview. He asked Obama, for example, how he would feel when he left the presidency and people wouldnt let him win at basketball any more. Galifianakis made an elaborate display of boredom when the president spoke about the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. (Is this what they mean by drones?) Both Fox News on the right and Stephen Colbert on the left accused Obama of demeaning the presidency. Meanwhile, the program has gotten (to date) 13.5 million views on YouTube. This is what matters to the White House communications people.

Trump knew  and the White House learned  that ritual, high-profile disrespect can work to the advantage of the disrespected. It shows they can take a joke, and so are rounded people. In a way, its a tribute to their status. It makes them look cool, especially to the young.

Norman Mailer, in his 1963 book The Presidential Papers, wrote, Politics is arithmetic, but politics is also rhetoric, passion and an occasional idea to fire the imagination of millions. He expressed despair that then-President John F. Kennedy (not the least charismatic of the occupiers of the Oval Office, one would think), was too wedded to arithmetic. Mailer was probably not thinking about someone like Trump. (He would be thinking, as ever, more about himself.) But Trump is the one who fits his bill.

Trump has expressed passion  or at least convincingly acted passionately  about a number of ideas: deporting what he calls criminal, rape-inclined Mexicans; temporarily barring Muslims from entering the United States; repealing Obamacare and bringing in something much better.

In The Art of the Deal, he writes, I play to peoples fantasies ... a very effective form of promotion.

This is why he appeals to people. He is where he is because people vote for him  sometimes tongue in cheek, but often because it seems that his aggression, desire to be the best and wealth will be at their service. Trump isnt a politician, has no experience in elected office and enjoys the support of President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Yay! Hes not one of them.

As one Trump supporter, Ken Magno of Everett, Massachusetts, said: This isnt about whether hes going to do a better job or not. More or less, its the statement: Listen, were sick and tired of what you people do. And were going to put somebody in there  now that its our choice, were going to put somebody in there that basically you dont like.

A sizable part of America, many millions strong, is putting the finger up to the political class  right and left. They are responding to what Mailer thought he was calling for  passion, rhetoric, new ideas, firing the imagination of millions.

Having done all that, the nomination is Trumps to lose. Its more and more likely that hell be in a face-off with a woman who can do the arithmetic but finds showmanship far harder.",[]

The move follows complaints from local seeds companies that Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India)(MMB), a Monsanto joint venture with India's Mahyco, was charging high royalties. This prompted India's farm ministry to form a panel to look into the matter, whose recommendation the government has now accepted.

MMB has filed a case in a Delhi court, challenging the authority of the panel to determine the trade fee agreed upon by MMB and a number of Indian seed companies.

As well as cutting the royalties, the government also capped GM cotton seed prices at 800 rupees for a packet of 400 grams after appeals by some state governments and farmers to lower the rate of the Bt variety that commands 90 percent of the market.

Bt cotton seeds are being sold at between 830 and 1,100 rupees per packet in different parts of the country.

The government's move came after Monsanto threatened on Friday to pull out of the country and hold off new technology if the government forced a big cut in its payments from Indian seed companies.

India's Mahyco and U.S.-based Monsanto launched a GM cotton variety in India in 2002, helping transform the country into the world's top producer and second-largest exporter of the fiber.

Separately, the Competition Commission of India, the antitrust regulator, last month said there were indications that MMB had abused its dominant position in the country and asked its director general to complete an investigation within two months.

The cause of the blast was not immediately known. Fire investigators were working to determine the cause, and gas workers were checking to see if gas was involved, officials said. Eight firefighters and one battalion chief were taken to a local hospital with minor injuries, according to Seattle Fire Department spokeswoman Corey Orvold. The explosion occurred at 1:43 a.m. local time, leveling a restaurant and convenience store and heavily damaging a coffee shop, Orvold said. Businesses across the street also were hit. At about 6 a.m. local time Seattle Fire Chief Harold Scoggins told reporters there was still an active gas leak and fire at the site but the public was not in danger.

SEOUL North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast city of Wonsan early on Thursday, flying approximately 500 km (300 miles), South Korea's military said.

North Korea has a large stockpile of short-range missiles and is developing long-range and intercontinental missiles.

Reports of the missiles being fired coincide with already heightened tension on the Korean peninsula after the North conducted its fourth nuclear test in January and launched a long-range rocket last month, leading to new U.N. Security Council and bilateral U.S. sanctions.

The North fired six rockets into the sea last week using a multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) from Wonsan, supervised by leader Kim Jong Un who ordered his military to be prepared to launch pre-emptive attacks against enemies.

Kim said on Wednesday his country has miniaturized nuclear warheads to mount on ballistic missiles and ordered improvements in the power and precision of its arsenal in his first direct comment about nuclear warhead miniaturization.

State Department spokesman John Kirby declined to comment on Kim's claim to have miniaturized nuclear warheads and accused him of ""provocative rhetoric.""

""I'd say the young man needs to pay more attention to the North Korean people and taking care of them than in pursuing these sorts of reckless capabilities,"" Kirby said.

The Pentagon said this week it had not seen North Korea demonstrate a capability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead. But Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the department was working on U.S. ballistic missile defenses to be prepared.

North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 but its claim to have set off a miniaturized hydrogen bomb has been disputed by the U.S. and South Korean governments and many experts.

U.S. and South Korean troops began large-scale military drills this week, which the North called ""nuclear war moves"" and threatened to respond with an all-out offensive.

reuters.com,2016-03-07 13:42:38+00:00,U.S. Commerce Department to place restrictions on China's ZTE,['Steve Stecklow'],"Visitors check out products at the ZTE stand at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, February 24, 2014.

LONDON The U.S. Commerce Department is set to place export restrictions on Chinese telecoms equipment maker ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) for alleged violations of U.S. export controls on Iran, according to documents seen by Reuters.

The restrictions will make it difficult for the company to acquire U.S. products by requiring ZTE's suppliers to apply for an export license before shipping any American-made equipment or parts to ZTE. According to a Commerce Department notice that will be published next week in the U.S. Federal Register, the license applications generally will be denied.

The restrictions will take effect Tuesday, Reuters has learned, and apply to any company worldwide that wants to ship American-made products to ZTE Corp in China. Those companies are not the target of the export curbs on ZTE.

""This is a significant new burden on trade with ZTE,"" a senior official at the Commerce Department told Reuters. The official declined to comment on whether the U.S. government might take further action against ZTE.

The company can appeal against the action.

ZTE, based in the southern Chinese boomtown of Shenzhen, said in a statement on Sunday that it was aware of media reports on U.S. export restrictions.

""ZTE is highly concerned about recent media reports relating to a U.S. Department of Commerce investigation,"" the company said. ""ZTE has been working with associated U.S. government departments on investigations since 2012 and maintains constant communication with associated departments and is committed to fully address and resolve any concerns.""

Trade in shares in ZTE, which also sells consumer electronic devices such as smartphones in the United States, was suspended on Monday in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The company did not offer an explanation.

""We believe the restrictions, if implemented, will cause significant supply problems to ZTE,"" Jefferies analyst Cynthia Meng wrote in a note, adding that ZTE has major trading relationships with several U.S. companies including Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and IBM (IBM.N).

Telecoms equipment and terminal businesses combined account for 80 percent of ZTE's total revenue of 2015, Meng said. The company's revenue for last year was expected to rise 23.8 percent to a record high of 100.8 billion yuan ($15.47 billion), preliminary results showed.

ALLEGED VIOLATIONS

The Commerce Department investigated ZTE for alleged export-control violations following reports by Reuters in 2012 that the company had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars worth of hardware and software from some of America's best-known technology companies to Iran's largest telecoms carrier, Telecommunication Co of Iran (TCI), and a unit of the consortium that controls it.

The U.S. companies, which included Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), IBM (IBM.N), Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and Dell Inc [DI.UL], have all said they were not aware of the Iranian contracts. It is not clear if any of the companies still do business with ZTE.

Washington has long banned the sale of United States-made technology products to Iran. The Commerce Department's investigation focused on whether ZTE had acquired American products through front companies and then shipped them to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.

Commerce Department investigators obtained internal ZTE documents - some of which had been marked by the company as ""Top Secret"" - outlining an alleged sanctions-busting scheme. Reuters reviewed some of the documents.

The senior Commerce Department official declined to comment on whether ZTE had implemented that scheme.

The ZTE statement did not provide comment relating to the documents.

The day after the first Reuters article was published in March 2012, a ZTE spokesman said the company would ""curtail"" its business in Iran. The company later issued a statement saying: ""ZTE no longer seeks new customers in Iran and limits business activities with existing customers.""

BUSINESS IMPACT

What effect the new export restrictions will have on ZTE's global business is not clear.

One undated internal ZTE document obtained by Commerce Department investigators and reviewed by Reuters states: ""Our company has many technologies and components that came from suppliers in the U.S ... Lots of chips or software used in the products of our company are from U.S. suppliers.""

One of ZTE's websites also states that several leading U.S. technology companies, including Microsoft, Intel Corp (INTC.O), IBM and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), are ""key strategic partners of ZTE"". The terms of the partnerships are not described.

A spokeswoman for Microsoft said the company had a licensing agreement with ZTE but could not confirm if the Chinese company purchases other products, such as software. The other U.S. companies did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

The undated internal ZTE document also describes a proposal overseen by the company's legal department that describes ways to export American products subject to U.S. sanctions by using shell companies to avoid getting caught.

""The biggest advantage"" of one method is that it will make it ""harder for the U.S. government to trace it or investigate the real flow of the controlled commodities"", the document states.

In its planned action against ZTE, the Commerce Department cites the proposal, stating that the company ""planned and organized a scheme to establish, control and use a series of 'detached' companies to illicitly re-export controlled items to Iran in violation of U.S. export control laws"". It is not clear if the alleged scheme was implemented.

'TOP SECRET'

Another internal ZTE document from August 2011 that discusses ""U.S. export control risks"" facing the company allegedly was signed by several top ZTE officials, including Shi Lirong, its president.

The document, marked by the company ""Top Secret"" and ""No spreading abroad without permission of ZTE"", begins ""Dear company leaders"".

It states that ZTE ""has ongoing projects in all five major embargoed countries - Iran, Sudan, North Korea, Syria and Cuba"", adding that ""all of these projects depend on U.S.-procured items to some extent, so export control obstacles have arisen"".

The document goes on to cite ""other risks"" to ZTE, including its operations in the United States.

""R&D employees at the U.S. Research Centers often travel between China and the U.S., carrying R&D data,"" it states, in an apparent reference to research and development. ""This already severely violates the law.""

The document does not specify what law may have been violated.

The company ""needs to take preventative measures immediately, otherwise will face the risk of being investigated anytime"", the document states.

The document also states that ZTE's Iran project ""can potentially put us at risk of being put on the Blacklist by the U.S.,"" and that such an eventuality could leave the company facing ""the risk of losing the supply chain of U.S. products"".

ZTE Corp is one of the world's largest telecoms equipment makers with operations in 160 countries, according to its website. It also is a major manufacturer of mobile handsets. Founded in 1985, its shares trade on both the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock markets.

Besides ZTE, the export curbs will apply to two of its Chinese affiliates, ZTE Kangxun Telecommunications Ltd and Beijing 8-Star, and an Iranian company, ZTE Parsian.

Until the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, the use of performance enhancing drugs helped East Germany win hundreds of medals at the summer and winter Olympic Games amid fierce Cold War competition with West Germany.

An estimated 8,000-9,000 athletes were on the doping program from 1972-1989, the overwhelming majority without their knowledge.

The government on Wednesday said it had approved the drafting of a law for a one-off payment of 10,500 euros ($11,500) per eligible doping victim and expected several times more cases than the 194 beneficiaries of the first scheme in 2002.

""Today we take a step closer to our target of a renewal of the fund for GDR (East German) doping victims,"" German Interior Minister Thomas De Maiziere said in a statement.

""Given the difficult fate and bad health of many of the GDR doping victims speed is of essence,"" he said, adding he hoped to start paying out by the second half of the year.

In 2002 the German government paid out a similar amount to 194 athletes but not all those eligible came forward at the time, with many seeing the effects of doping on their health only much later.

The former East Germany's embrace of doping triggered a rapid improvement in results, with the country of 17 million almost doubling its gold medal tally from one Olympics to the next.

In the Olympic Games from 1972 to 1988, despite a boycott of the 1984 Los Angeles Games, East Germany won 384 medals. It was second in the medals table in three of the four Games in which it took part.

Today up to 2,000 former athletes are seriously ill, suffering from tumors, heart defects, infertility, depression, bulimia, and circulation and spinal problems. Some have died, others are waiting to see what health problems their children have inherited.

The launch of the fund to compensate the victims of past doping comes as athletics finds itself in the midst of one of the worst doping and corruption scandals in the sport's history.

The chairman of Parliament's Business, Innovation and Skills Committee, Iain Wright, said in a letter made public on Wednesday that Ashley had not responded to a request to attend parliament to answer questions, nor agreed in principle to attend.

""Should you fail in your reply to agree to attend on one of the dates offered to you, or a mutually convenient alternative before 1 June, the Committee reserves the right to take the matter further, including seeking the support of the House of Commons in respect of any complaint of contempt,"" Wright said in the letter to Ashley dated March 3.

Sports Direct has come under fire for its employment practices and a newspaper investigation last year said that lengthy security checks of workers at its main warehouse in Shirebrook, central England, meant that some were effectively paid less than the legal minimum wage.

The company, which denied the allegations, launched a review of working conditions at the site, where many staff are supplied by agencies.

Ashley, who owns English Premier League football club Newcastle United as well as 55 percent of Sports Direct's equity, would oversee the review, the company said in December.

A spokesman for Sports Direct said that Ashley had previously invited members of the Committee to attend Shirebrook to see for themselves the company's working practices.

""That invitation remains open,"" the spokesman said. ""Mike will respond to the committee's recent letter in due course.""

Wright acknowledged Ashley's offer to meet the committee at the Shirebrook site but said the request had been turned down because it did not comply with the MPs' commitment to transparency.

Parliament can in theory order a person's imprisonment for contempt, although its powers on contempt actions are untested in recent times, according to a government paper published in 2012.

Iranian state television showed footage of two Qadr missiles being launched from northern Iran, which the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said hit targets 1,400 km (870 miles) away.

Iranian agencies said the missiles were stamped with the Hebrew words, ""Israel should be wiped from the pages of history,"" though the inscription could not be seen on any photographs.

Clinton, a former secretary of state under President Barack Obama, said she was ""deeply concerned"" by the tests, the second round of Iranian missile launches in two days.

""Iran should face sanctions for these activities and the

international community must demonstrate that Iran's threats

toward Israel will not be tolerated,"" said Clinton, who is ahead in the race to be Democratic nominee at the Nov. 8 presidential elections.

Her call for sanctions reflected a tougher line against Iran's recent missile activity than that taken so far by the White House, which said it is aware of and reviewing reports of the Iranian tests, and would determine an appropriate response.

""We know that Iran is in a season of carrying out a number of military activities, and so it certainly would not be a surprise if there are additional launches over the next several days,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

The Iranian move on Wednesday came despite warning from the U.S. State Department after Tuesday's missile tests that Washington continues to ""aggressively apply our unilateral tools

to counter threats from Iran's missile programme,"" a possible reference to additional U.S. sanctions.

Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Wednesday with Iran's foreign minister about the test-firing of two ballistic missiles, a State Department spokesman said.

The missile tests underline a rift in Iran between hard-line factions opposed to normalizing relations with the West, and

President Hassan Rouhani's relatively moderate government, which is trying to attract foreign investors to Iran.

ISRAEL IN MIND

Iran's IRGC said the missiles tested on Wednesday were designed with Israel in mind.

""The reason we designed our missiles with a range of 2,000 km is to be able to hit our enemy the Zionist regime from a safe distance,"" Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by the ISNA agency. The nearest point in Iran is around 1,000 km (600 miles) from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon told Israel Radio the tests showed Iran's hostility had not changed since implementing a nuclear deal with world powers in January, despite Rouhani's overtures to the West.

""To my regret there are some in the West who are misled by the honeyed words of part of the Iranian leadership while the other part continues to procure equipment and weaponry, to arm terrorist groups,"" Yaalon said.

Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee, said: Iran is making a mockery of President Obamas vow to confront Irans dangerous and illicit acts.

He urged Obama to ""aggressively enforce all sanctions against Irans missile programs, support for terrorism and human rights abuses. No more looking the other way.

Washington imposed sanctions against businesses and individuals in January over another missile test in October 2015. But the IRGC said it would not bow to pressure.

""The more sanctions and pressure our enemies apply ... the more we will develop our missile programme,"" Hajizadeh said on state television.

The IRGC maintains dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles, the largest stock in the Middle East. It says they are solely for defensive use with conventional, non-nuclear warheads.

Tehran has denied U.S. accusations of acting ""provocatively,"" citing the long history of U.S. interventions in the Middle East and its own right to self-defence.

The swift response on the heels of Sharapova's announcement on Monday signaled a change in attitude among high-profile corporate backers following a series of doping and corruption scandals in world sports.

""We're now entering a zero tolerance era for sponsors,"" said Rupert Pratt, co-founder of sports sponsorship agency Generate. ""It is now seen as not acceptable to 'stand by your man' because of the amount of scrutiny corporates are now under.""

Sharapova's failed drug test at January's Australian Open, one of four annual Grand Slam events, will likely lead to a ban for the 28-year-old Russian. The International Tennis Federation's anti-doping program calls for a four-year suspension for a positive test. That ban can be reduced in various circumstances, such as if the player shows no significant fault or negligence.

Loss of sponsor income would be costly for Sharapova, a five-time Grand Slam winner who earned $29.7 million last year, according to Forbes magazine, most of it from endorsements, appearances and royalties rather than victories on court.

Sharapova, who lit up women's tennis when she won Wimbledon in 2004 as a 17-year-old, is still ranked among the top players. She was the world's highest-paid female athlete last year for the 11th consecutive year, and Forbes put her off-court career earnings at more than $200 million.

Fellow athletes had mixed reactions to Sharapova's announcement that she had tested positive for meldonium, a drug she said she had been taking for a decade to treat diabetes and low magnesium.

The substance, recently banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), boosts blood flow and can enhance athletic performance. Sharapova, who lives in the United States, is at least the seventh athlete in a month to test positive for meldonium. It is widely available in Eastern Europe but not approved for use in the United States.

""She's ready to take full responsibility and I think that showed a lot of courage and a lot of heart,"" Serena Williams, the top-ranked player in women's tennis, told reporters at a briefing ahead of a game in New York on Tuesday.

Others were not so sympathetic.

""I'm extremely angry and disappointed. I had to lose my career and never opted to cheat no matter what,"" tweeted former world No. 1 Jennifer Capriati, in a long series of posts attacking Sharapova.

Aries Merritt, a U.S. hurdler, said there was no excuse for Sharapova to be unaware that WADA added meldonium to its latest list of banned drugs effective Jan. 1, which it circulated to competitors.

""As an athlete it is your responsibility to always know what's being placed on the banned list. Period,"" said Merritt at the U.S. Olympic Committee summit in Los Angeles.

Former U.S. Olympic swimmer Aaron Peirsol told Reuters there was some confusion over meldonium. ""It wasn't even anything that was illegal until the beginning of this year,"" he said. ""You have a bunch of people taking stuff that the athletes probably don't even know (is illegal)... it becomes gray.""

Sharapova said she had not read an email informing her that meldonium was banned for use in sport.

She will be provisionally suspended from playing tennis from March 12 and could be prevented from competing for Russia at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics this year.

SOME SPONSORS ON THE FENCE

Sharapova's deal with Tag Heuer, owned by French luxury goods group LVMH (LVMH.PA), expired at the end of 2015, and the company said on Tuesday it had dropped renewal talks in view of her announcement.

Nike Inc (NKE.N), the world's biggest sportswear brand, and German luxury car maker Porsche, a unit of Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), have said they are suspending their relationship with Sharapova as they gather more information and wait for a decision on a ban.

A person close to Sharapova told Reuters her team was encouraged that none of the sponsors so far have said they were terminating contracts with the player, although they had the right to do so.

""Suspension means to put on hold,"" the source said, requesting anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the situation. ""Under the circumstances we're very pleased that everybody is willing to stand by and see what facts come out instead of terminating.""

Danone SA (DANO.PA), the maker of Evian water, a longtime Sharapova sponsor, said on Tuesday it would monitor developments. Avon Products Inc (AVP.N), another sponsor, declined to comment on its endorsements.

Brian Socolow, an expert in sports law and a partner at Loeb & Loeb LLP, said Nike's quick suspension was no surprise after its long support for now-disgraced U.S. cyclist Lance Armstrong.

But he said Sharapova may yet win back sponsors. ""She has the chance, like other athletes, to redeem herself and regain her leadership position as an endorser,"" said Socolow. ""She will have to demonstrate that it was an honest mistake and there are no other improper reasons she took the drug.""

There was some scepticism about the sponsors' motives from tennis fans on social media.

Ben Stanley (@BDStanley) tweeted on Tuesday, ""Nike is in the business of making money, not offering moral guidance. If it paid to keep Sharapova on, they'd do it.""

reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:54:04+00:00,Peru bars Fujimori's biggest rival from presidential race,['Mitra Taj'],"Peru's presidential candidate Julio Guzman attends a news conference after the Special Jury of Elections, which approves presidential tickets, accepted a citizen's petition to declare Guzman's candidacy 'inadmissible' for the upcoming April elections, in Lima March 4, 2016....

LIMA Peru's electoral board kicked the main rival to presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori out of the race on a technicality on Wednesday, removing the front-runner's biggest obstacle to winning the office once held by her jailed father.

Fujimori, a center-right career politician and daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori, looks all but certain to win the April 10 first round after the board's 3-2 decision against centrist technocrat Julio Guzman but she cannot be sure of securing the 50 percent needed to win outright.

The National Jury of Elections ruled Guzman cannot take part in the elections because his party failed to comply with electoral procedures when registering its presidential ticket.

Guzman had been the only candidate seen coming close to tying with Fujimori in a run-off vote, but voters could still punish her in the second round if they feel Guzman and another candidate, Cesar Acuna, were pushed unfairly from the race.

The election winner would replace President Ollanta Humala, whose five year term ends this year.

Guzman, little known just months ago, vowed to keep campaigning while exhausting all legal avenues to get reinstated. He also heaped pressure on the electoral board to bar four other candidates, including Fujimori, from the contest, citing similar questions over compliance with election rules.

""If their cases are not treated with the same criteria, the current election and potential elected authorities will be illegitimate,"" Guzman said in a statement.

Fujimori's opponents accuse her and her running mate of illegally dishing out gifts and prizes to voters while campaigning - accusations she called ""absurd.""

The electoral board also rejected wealthy former governor and center-left populist Acuna's appeal to stay in the race after he gave cash to poor voters while campaigning, in violation of a new law.

Acuna, who had sunk to fourth place amid allegations of plagiarism, said he accepted the decision even though he thought it was undemocratic. Unlike Guzman, Acuna's party can still take part in elections and win congressional seats.

Recent opinion polls indicated the quarter of votes that Guzman and Acuna expected to draw in the first round would be split among several candidates, with Fujimori and former prime minister Pedro Pablo Kuczynski benefiting most.

'HORRIBLE PRECEDENT'

Guzman said he would launch an ""extraordinary"" appeal before the electoral board, a move constitutional lawyers said was unlikely to succeed. Guzman said a delegation from the Organization of American States was traveling to Peru on Monday.

He said he would also seek the intervention of the local courts as well as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, processes that could take months.

Guzman's candidacy bounced between electoral boards for more than a month, exasperating many Peruvians and stoking suspicions of foul play. The electoral board chief, who voted in favor of admitting Guzman, said last month he had received death threats.

Peru's electoral board has not sparked so much controversy since 2000, when it let Alberto Fujimori run for a third term despite a constitutional ban. Fujimori is now serving a 25-year jail sentence for ordering death squads to conduct massacres in the fight to quash a leftist insurgency and for corruption.

""No modern democracy excludes major presidential candidates...for breaking minor rules,"" said Harvard University political scientist Steve Levitsky. ""It's a horrible precedent.""

On the streets of Lima, many voters said Guzman and Acuna deserved to be excluded for breaking rules, but their supporters said that they felt cheated and would spoil their ballots. Voting is mandatory in Peru.

""It's not fair. Supposedly this is a democracy and everyone can take part,"" said Carlos Ortega, a 39-year-old engineer who had intended to vote for Acuna. ""If this continues, the only one left will be Keiko.""

Soon after in the occupied West Bank, Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian who tried to stab them, the military said.

The attacks came a day after an American tourist was killed in Tel Aviv by a Palestinian who went on a stabbing spree on the beachfront while Biden met former Israeli President Shimon Peres blocks away.

On Twitter, Biden called it a ""tragic attack ... taking the life of an American"" and said ""there is no justification for such acts of terror"". There was no immediate comment from Palestinian authorities.

Since October, Palestinian stabbings, shootings and car rammings have killed 28 Israelis and two U.S. citizens. Israeli forces have killed at least 179 Palestinians, 121 of whom Israel says were assailants. Most others were shot dead during violent protests.

After several days in which the violence largely subsided, a series of attacks erupted after Biden arrived in Israel on Tuesday.

Israel's national police chief said he saw no direct connection between Biden's trip and the surge in attacks.

TALKS

Biden held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Wednesday and was due to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank later in the day.

U.S. officials said Biden would discuss with Netanyahu a new 10-year military aid package to Israel currently under negotiation, as well as the situation in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East. They warned against any expectations of a breakthrough on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, stalled since 2014, in Biden's meetings with Netanyahu and Abbas.

The incident in Jerusalem on Wednesday began when gunfire ran out near a commuter bus, though no one was hurt and the vehicle was not hit, a police spokesman said.

Several minutes later, two Palestinians in a car, believed by police to have tried to attack the bus, opened fire near the Damascus Gate entrance to Jerusalem's Old City, the scene of multiple attacks over the past five months.

One man, who was not immediately identified, was critically wounded by the Palestinian gunfire and police shot and killed the two assailants, the spokesman said.

The U.S. State Department identified the American killed on Tuesday as Taylor Force, a 28-year-old graduate student at Vanderbilt University's Owen School of Management who was on a trip to Israel organised by the school.

The past five months of bloodshed have been fuelled by various factors, including a dispute over Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque compound and the failure of several rounds of peace talks to secure the Palestinians an independent state in Israeli-occupied territory.

LOS ANGELES ""The Matrix"" filmmaker Lilly Wachowski, formerly known as Andy, came out as a transgender woman on Tuesday, four years after her sister Lana Wachowski revealed she was a transgender woman.

Lilly Wachowski, 48, said in a statement in Chicago's Windy City Times that she decided to make her gender reassignment public after a journalist from Britain's DailyMail asked her for an interview to tell her story. Wachowski said other reporters have approached her agents in the past to ask about her transition.

""I knew at some point I would have to come out publicly. You know, when you're living as an out transgender person it's ... kind of difficult to hide. I just wanted  needed some time to get my head right, to feel comfortable. But apparently I don't get to decide this,"" Wachowski wrote.

In an emailed statement on Wednesday, a spokesperson for the DailyMail.com said it did not try to pressure Wachowski into revealing her gender transition.

""As Ms Wachowski herself says, we were not the first media organization to approach her and we made absolutely clear at several points in the conversation that we were only interested in reporting the story if and when she was happy for us to do so and with her cooperation,"" the spokesperson said.

Lily Wachowski's sister Lana, 50, formerly known as Larry, came out publicly as a transgender woman in 2012.

In her statement, Lilly Wachowski touched on the struggles faced by the transgender community, and said that while progress has been made, ""we continue to be demonized and vilified in the media where attack ads portray us as potential predators to keep us from even using the goddamn bathroom.""

""So yeah, I'm transgender. And yeah, I've transitioned,"" she said, adding that she is out to her wife, family and friends.

The Wachowskis, who are private about their lives and rarely give interviews, have carved a reputation with ""The Matrix"" franchise, ""V for Vendetta"" and, most recently, Netflix's sci-fi series ""Sense8.""

Workers erect scaffolding to build a stage at the venue of World Culture Festival on the banks of the river Yamuna in New Delhi, March 8, 2016.

NEW DELHI Environmentalists are aghast that a huge cultural festival is to be held on the floodplain of Delhi's main river from Friday, warning that the event, and the 3.5 million visitors expected, will devastate the area's biodiversity.

The ""World Culture Festival"", organised by one of India's best-known spiritual gurus, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, spreads across 1,000 acres (400 hectares) on the banks of the Yamuna. It features a 7-acre stage for 35,000 musicians and dancers, newly built dirt tracks and 650 portable toilets.

Green groups accuse organisers of ripping up vegetation and ruining the river's fragile ecosystem by damaging its bed and disrupting water flows. They want authorities to cancel the event and avert further harm.

""This land is not meant for any of those things. The biodiversity of the land has been completely destroyed,"" said Anand Arya, one of several environmentalists who petitioned India's top green court.

""Where will the sewage and the excrement go? All across the floodplains!"" he said, adding that the waste left by visitors would endanger a nearby bird sanctuary.

The National Green Tribunal on Wednesday ruled that the event could go ahead but fined Ravi Shankar's Art of Living Foundation 50 million rupees ($744,000) to help restore the area, media reported.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a yoga devotee like Ravi Shankar, was due to attend Friday's opening, but it is not clear whether he will do so after the event sparked such uproar - and not just among environmentalists.

Delhi police have warned of ""utter chaos"" at the event unless safety lapses are tackled, the Indian Express said, citing a March 1 letter to the federal government saying the stage lacked a structural stability certificate.

Farmers who plough the banks of the river amid Delhi's urban sprawl also accused organisers of forcing them off the land.

Ravi Shankar, who enjoys a cult following, has rejected the criticism, saying he should be rewarded for hosting the event beside one of India's most polluted rivers.

Saraswati Akshama Nath, the lawyer for his organisation, said approvals, including safety certificates, had been given in December before construction began, and the structures would be removed after the three-day festival ends.

""Consent was given to us by all the authorities,"" she told Reuters. ""We have only used eco-friendly material.""

At the site, builders were scrambling to complete what they say is the world's biggest ever performing stage. It can accommodate a symphony orchestra of 8,500 and 20,000 performers, said Prasana Prabhu, a trustee of Ravi Shankar's foundation.

The 5,200-square-metre facility in Taizhou, China, is to be completed by mid-2016 and will produce complete seating systems for a small crossover utility vehicle, said Magna, which held an investor day in Toronto on Wednesday.

Ontario-based Magna, which earns about half its revenue outside North America, has a customer list that includes General Motors Co (GM.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Ford Motor Co (F.N).

Despite strong growth opportunities outside Canada, Magna Chief Executive Don Walker said he still sees great scope for the company to expand around its Ontario home base.

That is especially true if the provincial and federal governments make an effort to keep auto assembly plants in the province, while also providing incentives to attract new ones, he said.

""In my opinion, the governments should be focused on keeping the assembly plants here,"" said Walker, in an interview after the investor day in Toronto. ""A lot of jobs are tied to a geographic region around the assembly plants, so if the assembly plants are kept here, then hopefully the employment in the auto sector will stay.""

Walker said Magna has roughly 140,000 employees including about 20,000 in Ontario. It cut back like everybody else during the 2008-09 downturn, but has since restored employment to pre-crisis levels, he said.

If the government contributes $100 million to a $400 million investment in an assembly plant, it can pay out in a big way over the long run, said Walker.

""If you look at all the tax that goes to the government in payroll taxes and everything else, if they spend $100 million ... they can recoup all of that money in two or three years and they continue to keep that revenue for the long-term,"" he said.

""They are crazy not to do that, even if it may not be popular,"" he added.

Washington/Hamburg Volkswagen droht in den USA noch mehr Arger: Das US-Justizministerium weite seine Ermittlungen aus und gehe nun auch dem Verdacht des Bankbetrugs nach, sagte eine mit den Vorgangen vertraute Person der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters.

Das ""Wall Street Journal"" berichtete zudem unter Berufung auf Insider, in diesem Zusammenhang gehe es auch um mogliche Verstoe gegen Steuergesetze. Analysten rechnen nun mit zusatzlichen Strafzahlungen fur VW. Volkswagen auerte sich am Mittwoch dazu nicht. Ein Sprecher bekraftigte, man werde bei den Ermittlungen weiter mit allen zustandigen US-Behorden kooperieren.

Das 1989 fur Ermittlungen gegen groe Geldhauser konzipierte US-Gesetz gegen Bankbetrug erlaubt es, unter bestimmten Bedingungen einem Verdacht im Zeitraum der vergangenen zehn Jahre nachzugehen. Es wurde unter anderem in Fallen rund um Autokredit-Anbieter angewandt. Laut ""Wall Street Journal"" ermittelt das US-Justizministerium, ob Kreditgeber bei der Finanzierung von Fahrzeugen mit manipulierten Abgaswerten geschadigt wurden.

VW ist in den USA wegen Verstoen gegen Umweltgesetze bereits mit hohen Strafandrohungen konfrontiert. Es steht eine Strafe von bis zu 46 Milliarden Dollar im Raum. Die Summe durfte nach Einschatzung von Juristen allerdings deutlich niedriger ausfallen, wie fruhere Falle vermuten lassen. Experten schatzen, dass der Abgasskandal einschlielich Schadensersatzzahlungen VW am Ende mehr als 30 Milliarden Euro kosten konnte.

BISLANG 80.000 KLAGER IN EUROPA

In den USA sind bereits mehr als 500 Sammelklagen eingegangen. Auch immer mehr Autobesitzer in Europa schlieen sich offenbar einem geplanten Sammelverfahren gegen den Konzern an. Die Zahl sei seit Januar von rund 60.000 auf etwa 80.000 gestiegen, sagte Rechtsanwalt Julius Reiter, dessen Kanzlei die Klage gegen Volkswagen in Deutschland organisiert, die uber eine niederlandische Stiftung gefuhrt wird. Die meisten Klager seien osterreichische Fahrzeugbesitzer. Reiter betonte: ""Wir streben eine auergerichtliche Einigung mit VW an.""

Nach der Allianz zieht nun auch die Dekabank gegen Volkswagen vor Gericht. Finanzkreisen zufolge beteiligt sich das Wertpapierhaus der Sparkassen an der selben Sammelklage wie die Allianz-Tochter Allianz Global Investors (AGI). Die Deka ist nach Reuters-Daten elftgroter VW-Aktionar und halt einen Anteil von 0,6 Prozent. Damit bringen sich immer mehr Profi-Investoren in Deutschland gegen den Autobauer in Stellung. Sie werfen VW vor, uber die weit verbreitete Manipulation zu spat informiert zu haben. Beim Landgericht Braunschweig liegen bereits mehrere Klagen von Privatanlegern, die wegen des drastischen Kursverfalls der VW-Aktie Schadensersatz fur erlittene Kursverluste verlangen.

Die VW-Aktie verlor zeitweise mehr als vier Prozent, grenzte ihre Verluste spater aber ein. Am Nachmittag drehte das Papier ins Plus. Die negativen Nachrichten zum ""Dieselgate"" hatten in den vergangenen Tagen zugenommen, erklarte DZ Bank Analyst Michael Punzet. ""Mogliche weitere finanziellen Belastungen konnten zu einer starkeren Dividendenkurzung als vom Markt angenommen fuhren."" Er bekraftigte seine Verkaufsempfehlung fur die VW-Aktie. Seit Jahresbeginn hat das Papier rund 16 Prozent an Wert verloren, der Leitindex Dax kommt im gleichen Zeitraum auf ein Minus von knapp zehn Prozent. Frank Schwope von der NordLB monierte: ""Es wird sicher nicht billiger fur VW.""

Der Skandal um manipulierte Abgaswerte war in den USA durch die Umweltbehorde EPA offentlich gemacht worden. VW hatte daraufhin den Einsatz einer illegalen Software zugegeben, durch die Stickoxid-Werte von Dieselautos nur auf dem Prufstand eingehalten werden. Weltweit sind von dem Betrug rund elf Millionen Fahrzeuge betroffen.

Some 14,000 people are stranded there after new border restrictions were imposed along the Balkan migration route. Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia said on Tuesday (March 8) they would place new restrictions on the entry of migrants and Macedonia responded on Wednesday by closing its border completely to illegal migrants, a police official said. Ai walked around the makeshift camp speaking with the migrants - seeing for himself the difficult conditions they have to brave as they wait to cross over to Macedonia and continue their trek northwards to wealthier European states. Ai, known for his criticism of China's human rights record, said he was witnessing a ""huge, big violation of human rights"" in the middle of Europe. ""What we have seen here is almost unbelievable, you know. If you say this is in the middle of Europe, all the people stuck here, and there's no hope for them even to be transferred to anywhere else, you know. It's just in the rain, in the cold, and women, children, all the people waiting for some bread, or some dry clothes, and this is a very sad situation and people have no hope because the door is closed, totally shut off. I think this is a huge, big violation of human rights, right in front of us. I don't know what is going to come out from this, but in Lesbos people still come in thousands every day, and here nobody tells them what to do, and they stay here, still having hope to go to Germany or some other location, but I think, as the sky is getting darker and I don't think there's much hope for them,"" he said. People fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and beyond have flooded into the EU since early 2015, most making the perilous sea crossing from Turkey to Greece, then heading north through the Balkans to Germany. But a cascade of border shutdowns in the Balkans has caused the blocking of the so-called 'Balkans corridor' used by more than a million people since the migratory wave started a year ago. More than 34,0000 people are now trapped on Greece's islands and mainland. At an emergency EU-Turkey summit on Monday (March 7), aimed to stem the migrant influx to Europe, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told leaders of the bloc Ankara was willing to take back all migrants who enter Europe from Turkey in future in return for financial aid, faster EU entry talks and quicker visa-free travel for its citizens. EU leaders aim to work out key details with Turkey by the next scheduled summit on March 17-18.

While Americas financial technology industry has exploded in recent years, regulators have not kept pace. This is partly because of the countrys outdated patchwork of state rules. The UK and others are further ahead in addressing this emerging sector in a fresh way. Creating a modern, federal regime to oversee these firms is a priority for U.S. policymakers.

Many of the new so-called fintech firms fall under the categories of money transmitters or consumer lenders, businesses that require licenses from nearly 50 states, each of which has different standards, not to mention regulatory examiners with varying degrees of sophistication.

That means 165-year-old Western Union is regulated the same way that a bitcoin-based transfer startup with fewer than 50 employees might be. For freshly minted companies in the space, state compliance can be prohibitive, costing more than $1 million annually.

Marketplace lenders that directly provide loans are also under state jurisdiction. Take SoFi, a San Francisco startup, which makes loans. The company led by former Wells Fargo banker Mike Cagney, and which raised $1 billion, has 18 state licenses for consumer lending and nearly 20 more for mortgages.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was established after the 2008 financial crisis, is the federal watchdog now looking out for fintech customers, a critical role in a landscape where algorithms have replaced credit scores to determine borrowing.

But the agencys mandate is limited and doesnt address risks to the broader financial system. The sector is not large enough to spark those concerns, but it could in the future. Yet its not yet clear who at the federal level has jurisdiction. Regulators need to figure this out fast, and account for the different business models many of these firms have from traditional banks.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is looking at ways to evaluate some of the new products. The Federal Reserve could be ideal as it can see the interconnectivity between fintech and the banking sector to assess risks. Banks are partnering with some of these startups and purchasing their loans.

Other countries have already moved forward. This year Britain established a startup unit to help firms thinking of becoming banks, and later will accept proposals for their regulatory sandbox program in which companies can test products.

Eventually, an international framework will be needed since many of these enterprises encompass global, borderless businesses. The industry is quickly evolving and regulators need to innovate, too.",[]

Two hedge funds said on Tuesday they are gunning to install six new directors at the $20 billion United Continental, a week before the newish chief executive is due to return from several months sick leave. Despite heated rhetoric, a revamped boardroom could be a winning compromise for the third-biggest U.S. airline and its investors.

PAR Capital Management and Altimeter Capital Management, which together own just over 7 percent of United shares, say they want to shake up what they claim is an underqualified, ineffective and entrenched board. The language is sharp, but they have a point.

As of last week few of Uniteds directors, other than two union representatives and a former Boeing executive, looked equipped to challenge managers on the nuts and bolts of running a major airline. As an example, non-executive chairman Henry Meyer, who stepped in after Uniteds previous chairman and CEO Jeff Smisek departed in September amid a federal probe, used to run a regional bank.

While United has made progress tackling late arrivals and other operational problems, the board hasnt covered itself in glory lately. It paid Smisek lavishly despite mediocre performance, and failed to communicate clearly with shareholders when his replacement, Munoz, fell ill with heart trouble in October.

United added three new directors on Monday in what looks like an attempt to spike the activists guns. Even if thats part of the motivation, though, the new faces  including the former boss of Air Canadas parent and a onetime operating chief at Delta Air Lines  bring relevant expertise.

The hedge-fund nominees look solid, too. The slate is led by Gordon Bethune, who led a turnaround of Continental Airlines in the 1990s. The company grumbles that PAR and Altimeter refused to engage constructively, but it ought to be possible to settle on compromise candidates as well as agreeing whose services are no longer needed.

A deal would be preferable to a drawn-out proxy fight. After all, that would distract Munoz from improving United Continentals business and the tricky balancing act of making the company more shareholder-friendly while not paying out so much cash that its vulnerable to the next downturn.",[]

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said on Wednesday it had signed a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA.N) 767 widebody freighter aircraft to handle more of its own deliveries in the United States.

The deal comes at a time when the world's biggest online retailer is offering ever-faster, and increasingly free, deliveries for millions of online orders.

Amazon, which relies on carriers like United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) to deliver most of its packages, spent $11.5 billion on shipping last year.

In a bid to assume more control over its supply chain and reduce costs, Amazon has rolled out thousands of trailers and launched a program that uses contract drivers to deliver fast orders.

But analysts said the long-rumored plan to build its own air fleet posed little threat to the leading delivery companies.

""This is an incremental negative for FDX and UPS as it will likely remove some higher yielding express freight and parcel volume from each of the respective networks,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst John Barnes wrote in a client note.

UPS, the world's No. 1 package delivery company, operates about 240 large planes while FedEx has a fleet of about 370, Barnes noted. FedEx and UPS shares were down about 1.5 percent.

FedEx said on Wednesday the announcement was not a surprise and called Amazon a valuable customer.

""We work closely with Amazon and have been aware for some time about their need for supplemental air capacity related to inventory management,"" said Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications at FedEx.

The leased planes will start to go into operation on April 1, Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email.

Amazon has been testing deliveries by drones but has not said when they would be in service.

The duration of the leases will be five to seven years, lessor Air Transport Services Group Inc (ATSG.O) said.

As part of the agreement, Amazon has the right to buy up to 19.9 percent of ATSG's stock over five years at $9.73 per share.

ATSG's stock soared almost 27 percent to a record high of $14.90, before paring gains to about 16 percent.

The opinions expressed are his own.

The European Unions bold deal with Turkey to stop the disorderly flow of migrants to Europe offers a lot  if it sticks.

Not only would it help keep Britain in the EU and Greece in the euro. It would shore up German Chancellor Angela Merkels position, and so help stabilise the EU. It would also avoid the collapse of the Schengen Area, which allows border-free travel throughout most of the bloc.

The provisional deal, which emerged on March 8, is more extensive than originally envisaged. Turkey will take back any irregular migrants crossing to Greece, including Syrian refugees. In return, the EU will accept an equal number of Syrians to those who come to Greece but are then sent back to Turkey.

Critically, these will not be the same people who attempt the boat trip across the Aegean. Instead, refugees will be taken directly from Turkey in a more orderly process. This should cut the incentive for people to make the dangerous crossing, putting their lives in the hands of people-smugglers.

Turkey also will get a series of other goodies: visa-free travel for its citizens to come to the Schengen Area from the end of June; extra cash on top of the 3 billion euros so far promised so it can better look after the millions of refugees who will stay in Turkey; and the energisation of talks to admit the country to the EU.

A lot of detail needs to be filled in. In particular, it is unclear how Syrians who are brought to the EU in an orderly fashion will be divvied up between the different members of the bloc. Given that several countries wont want to take any  or at least not many  bitter wrangling could yet cause the deal to fall apart.

Meanwhile, right-wing nationalists wont be happy with either visa-free travel for 79 million Turks, many of whom are Muslim, or the possibility that the country will eventually join the EU  even though that still seems a remote prospect that may never materialise. Nevertheless, movements such as Frances Front National and Germanys Alternative fur Deutschland will have new sticks with which to beat their nationalist drums.

That said, if the deal is finalised, perhaps as soon as another summit on March 17, there will be important economic and financial benefits.

First, the perception that the EU is finally getting a grip on the migrant crisis will undermine one of the strongest arguments used by those campaigning for Britain to quit the EU in a referendum set for June 23. Insofar as the Brexit risk is cut, that will reduce one of the main current concerns in financial markets. The UK is a big winner from the mooted deal because it has opted out of most of the EUs migration policies and so wont be required to take a quota of refugees. And since it is not in the Schengen Area, the offer of visa-free travel to Turks wont impact it.

Another big winner would be Greece. It has been at risk of being turned into a giant refugee camp as other countries north of it have tightened border controls. The political fallout could in turn have exacerbated its economic crisis. Even with this deal, Greece will face multiple difficulties, but theres less risk of them spinning out of control and tipping the country out of the euro.

Merkel also would be a winner. She has taken a lot of heat at home in the past few months for her previous open-door approach to Syrian refugees. If she can now show things are coming under control, she may be able to restore her authority. That would be good for the stability of the EU in general, given that she is its most important leader.

The EU and its member states would, of course, face a financial cost. In addition to the money sent to Turkey, Greece would get cash to help manage the refugees on its territory. An even bigger cost would be looking after refugees settled in the EU as part of the orderly process.

Set against that, borders would no longer need to be erected in the Schengen Area. Such a scenario would gum up trade and tourism. The cost of that could be 100 billion euros a year by 2025, according to analysis by the French government. And, eventually, Syrian refugees could play a valuable role in the economies of the countries where they settle  although it remains to be seen how well those who come will integrate in their new homes.

There are of course many ifs and buts in this scenario. Some people also will rightly worry that the EU is turning a blind eye to Turkeys abuse of press freedom and rule of law in its desperation to cut a deal on migrants. Nevertheless, from an economic perspective, the provisional deal reached in the early hours of March 8 has much to offer.

For the 1930s, the Spanish Civil War, the three-year fight between Fascists (helped by Nazi German) and Republicans (armed by the Soviet Union) pointed to the far larger global disaster to come. For the 1980s, the Soviet battle to control Afghanistan, a bloody mess of occupation and insurgency, helped bring forward the collapse of the Soviet Union and set the stage for 9/11 and modern Islamist militancy.

For the 1990s, you can take your pick of the Balkans, Somalia, Rwanda or Democratic Republic of Congo. For the 2000s, it was Iraq  the ultimate demonstration of the unipolar moment and the limits, dangers and sheer short-livedness of Americas status as unchallenged global superpower.

We are, of course, little more than half way through the current decade. Already, however, it looks as though it has to be Syrias civil war.

In pure human terms, the war dwarfs any other recent conflict. Estimates of the number of Syrian dead range from 270,000 to 470,000 people. The United Nations estimates up to 7.6 million Syrians are displaced within their own country, with up to 4 million fleeing their homeland. From its relatively small beginnings as a largely unarmed revolt, the Syrian conflict has now dragged in more than a half-dozen countries.

Its broader implications continue to grow by the month. While not the sole cause of Europes migrant crisis, Syrians make up a significant proportion  perhaps even the majority  of new arrivals on the continent. The sheer numbers are producing political strains that have already torn up the ideal of a borderless Europe and may yet wreck the entire European Union project.

Syria has exemplified what Financial Times columnist Gideon Rachmann calls a zero-sum world. From the beginning, rival regional powers  particularly Shiite Iran and Sunni states led by Saudi Arabia  approached the conflict with the assumption that neither side could afford to back down or compromise without letting the other win.

From that perspective, Syria is part of a larger regional confrontation that encompasses the war in Yemen, the long-term sectarian battle for control of Iraq and, of course, attempts to rein in Iran, in general, and its nuclear program, in particular.

Increasingly, though, the war in Syria has become part of the wider, potentially more dangerous confrontation between Western powers and Russia. That confrontation also goes back years  through Kosovo and the Balkans to the Cold War.

It also goes well beyond geopolitics to a fundamental disagreement over the limits of state power, the acceptable tools to restore order and the sustainability of authoritarian government. As I wrote in September, Russian President Vladimir Putins entire domestic justification of his power comes down to the importance of maintaining a stable central government as a bulwark against instability and chaos, whatever brutality that might take.

In Syria, Russias military intervention has been a game changer. As in Ukraine in 2014, Moscow has proved itself willing to use a level of military force that the West never anticipated and, as yet, has no real strategy to counter. Nor, for now, has it shown the will or intent to do so.

If the invasion of Iraq showed a United States that saw few real restrictions to its power, Syria has demonstrated the opposite. Washington has continuously prevaricated over what to do about Syria and even now, with Russian action literally redrawing the battlefield, has little in the way of a coherent strategy.

Painting this simply as a tale of Western or U.S. presidential weakness misses the point, however. If Syria shows us anything, it is how complicated the 21st century has become and how few good choices it can leave Washington.

Of course, if the West had signaled more clearly in the Syrian uprisings early days that it would do nothing and let Syrian President Bashar al-Assad slaughter his way back to stability, it might have fatally undermined the rebellion before it started. But this would also have left many in the West feeling distinctly uncomfortable.

Launching massive military strikes against Damascus following its 2013 use of chemical weapons might have helped the credibility of any future Western red lines. But they would also have further undermined what was left of the central government, an outcome now widely seen to have been an error when tried in Iraq and Libya.

The situation on the ground, meanwhile, is ever messier. As in several other recent wars  Iraq, Ukraine, Libya and Yemen  the national armed forces of Syria have become ever less important. Most of the recent fighting is down to relatively disparate militias with increasingly complex loyalties. Already, we have seen U.S.-backed Kurdish forces fighting other U.S.-backed groups, as well as in the growing conflict with Turkey, a U.S. ally.

The one area where the United States and its European allies have been willing to take action has been the fight against Islamic State. That seems reasonable: Of all the elements in the Syrian civil war, Islamic State is by far the most direct threat to Western interests, states and populations. Taking it on is a battle possibly and even likely to be won. Islamic State has already lost significant territory and finances.

That doesnt, however, come close to providing clarity over what to do about the rest of Syria.

As international mediation and ceasefire talks stutter forward, global and regional powers have a choice.

For most of those involved, the truth is that there may still be much to be gained by fighting. Russia could keep up the pressure and win back more territory for Assad and possibly benefit closer to home if the war helped destabilize the European Union. The United States, for that matter, could finally step up and support opposition fighters, which could block any recovery for Assad and drag the Russian mission into a quagmire. Also, regional powers could throw more resources into the battle, something Saudi Arabia seemingly signaled with its talk of sending ground troops to fight Islamic State.

The alternative, though, is that all sides pull back and demonstrate a willingness to compromise. There are plenty of messy issues. The most obvious is the immediate future of Assad and those around him. What exactly the compromise turns out to be might probably be less important than whether or not there is one.

Based on the past few weeks, the signals are mixed, at best. Some local ceasefires have been brokered, though with limited but very real humanitarian benefits for those on the ground.

If ordinary Syrians come to believe the war might genuinely be over one day, they are more likely to stay in the region, which might spark a whole different collection of conflicts.

A deal over Syria would perhaps be the most positive sign that the world could overcome its myriad growing challenges and confrontations. Failing to do so, however, might point to even worse things to come.",[]

WASHINGTON The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation hinted on Wednesday that authorities in Iran had recently been trying to help locate Robert Levinson, a retired FBI agent who disappeared exactly nine years ago after traveling to an Iranian resort island to meet a fugitive from U.S. justice.

""We are encouraged by recent cooperation between the government of Iran and the United States, and believe that our ability to locate Bob and reunite him with his family requires a shared commitment by the Iranian government,"" the FBI's Washington Field Office said in a prepared statement.

The statement quoted FBI Director James Comey saying that his agency was ""doing everything in our power to investigate all leads.""

The FBI statement did not elaborate further.

The White House also said that finding Levinson ""remains a top priority for the United States,"" but added that the U.S. would ""continue to call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to provide assistance in his case, as agreed to as part of the prisoner exchange finalized earlier this year.""

Five Americans were released by Iran in January to coincide with the lifting of economic sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran's nuclear program. The White House offered clemency to seven Iranians who were convicted or facing trial in the United States.

Levinson's family continued to urge the U.S. government to press Iran for his release. In a statement, Levinson's wife, Christine, said: ""We need the United States government and the country of Iran to work together to resolve what happened to Bob and return him safely to his family.""

Levinson disappeared after flying from Dubai to Kish Island in the Gulf in March 2007. There he met with Daoud Salahuddin, an American Islamic militant who fled to Iran while facing charges in the murder of an Iranian embassy official based in Washington.

Levinson, working then as a private investigator, was seeking information on alleged corruption involving former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and his family, said sources familiar with his work.

Months after he disappeared, U.S. government sources acknowledged that Levinson also maintained an unorthodox contractual relationship with the analytical branch of the Central Intelligence Agency. A handful of CIA officials were forced out of the agency and several more were disciplined after an internal agency investigation.

The Iranian government has never publicly acknowledged any role in Levinson's abduction, though at the time of his disappearance a government-affiliated media outlet broadcast a story saying he was ""in the hands of Iranian security forces.""

Some FBI investigators strongly believe Levinson is still alive, while officials at other U.S. agencies believe he died some time ago.

Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports

Mildronate (Meldonium) medication capsules are pictured on the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, in this November 23, 2010 file photo.

A manufacturing operator works at the Mildronate (Meldonium) medication packaging process in the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, November 23, 2010. Picture taken November 23, 2010.

LONDON The medicine Maria Sharapova says she has taken for 10 years due to a family history of heart issues and diabetes is an old drug sold in just a few Eastern European countries that can also boost exercise tolerance.

The tennis star tested positive for the banned drug meldonium, or Mildronate, in a sample taken on January 26, the day of her Australian Open quarter finals defeat to Serena Williams.

She said her family doctor had first given her the drug 10 years ago after she frequently became sick, had irregular electrocardiogram results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.

The 28-year old Russian, a five-time grand slam champion and the highest paid woman in sports, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said.

For the health conditions Sharapova says she has, however, doctors say the scientific evidence for Mildronate is limited compared with many medicines widely available in Europe and the United States, where Sharapova trains, which have full regulatory backing and years of robust safety and efficacy data.

LATVIAN DRUG

Meldonium is cheap and available over the counter without a prescription in some eastern European countries, where it is marketed as Mildronate by the Latvian pharmaceutical firm Grindeks.

The drug, originally developed by scientists at the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, is not licensed by two of the world's biggest medicines regulators: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States where Sharapova trains, and the EU's European Medicines Agency.

A spokeswoman for Grindeks said the firm had not applied for a license for Mildronate from either the FDA or the EMA, but said the drug is registered in Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union.

She said it is designed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular diseases, including angina, chronic heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other cardiovascular disorders.

Grindeks' also promotes it for people with reduced working capacity from physical or psycho-emotional ""overload,"" and during recovery from cerebrovascular disorders, head injury and encephalitis. It is not indicated for diabetes.

Tim Chico, a consultant cardiologist at Britain's Sheffield University, said it was unlikely that such a young and extremely fit woman would be suffering from a serious heart condition like angina, or would be able to play top level tennis if she were.

Asked how long the drug should be given to a patient, the Grindeks spokeswoman said in an emailed statement: ""Depending on the patient health condition, treatment course of meldonium preparations may vary from 4 to 6 weeks."" Such courses could be repeated two or three times in a year.

In an emailed reply to questions from Reuters about her medical reasons for using the drug, Sharapova's lawyer John Haggerty said: ""While I cannot go into detail out of respect for the ITF process, I can confirm that Ms Sharapova had abnormal EKG tests in 2006 and was also diagnosed with asthenia (a lack of energy or strength), decreased immunity and diabetes indicators.""

""She also had a family history of heart conditions,"" Haggerty said. ""The Mildronate and the other medicines recommended by her doctor treated these conditions.""

Munir Pirmohamed, a professor of molecular and clinical pharmacology at Britain's University of Liverpool, said the crucial issue with Mildronate for him is its lack of approval from EU and U.S. regulators.

""As a physician, this is not something I have, or would ever, prescribe,"" he said.

Others noted it was rare for a doctor treating illness to prescribe a drug that is unavailable in the country where the patient lives.

""Sharapova has been a U.S. resident since early in her career, which does bring in a question of how or why she is using a drug that is not licensed there,"" said Tom Bassindale, a lecturer in forensic science at Sheffield Hallam University.

Sharapova's agent Max Eisenbud was not available at his Miami office and did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

HELPS MUSCLES COPE

Whatever its medical benefits, research suggests Mildronate may have potential as a performance-enhancing drug for sports.

It reduces the level of a metabolite called carnetine in muscles, and by doing that helps muscles cope better with high levels of stress and low oxygen levels.

""Because it affects the cellular metabolism, it would increase energy production within cells and therefore make oxygen utilisation more efficient,"" said Pirmohamed.

In a 2010 academic paper published in a review journal called Seminars in Cardiovascular Medicine and cited on the Grindeks company website, it has been shown to improve exercise tolerance in patients with heart problems.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:58:56+00:00,Myanmar on edge as long wait for new president ends,['Timothy Mclaughlin'],"Myanmar's National League for Democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi arrives for the opening of the new parliament in Naypyitaw February 1, 2016.

NAYPYITAW Four months after Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won a crushing electoral victory over a government made up of former generals, Myanmar's citizens should finally find out who their new president will be on Thursday.

It won't be Suu Kyi. The NLD leader and Nobel peace prize laureate is barred from holding the office under a junta-drafted 2008 constitution because her children are not Myanmar citizens.

The wildly popular Suu Kyi has said that she will run the country regardless through a proxy she would name as president. But she and the NLD leadership have kept the identity of their nominee a closely guarded secret even from rank-and-file MPs.

They have done so partly out of fear a rushed and overly enthusiastic reaction to the election victory could put the sensitive transition at risk. In 1990, the military tossed out results of an election that the NLD won and remained in power.

Suu Kyi has repeatedly said she hoped to reach a compromise with the armed forces that would allow her to assume the presidency.

But talks since the election to bridge the differences failed, sources in her camp said, leading to a deepening rift between Suu Kyi and the military.

The secrecy has fueled a presidential guessing game in a country keen to see the NLD, many of whose members were jailed during years of military rule, complete its transition from democracy movement to ruling party.

Lawmakers from the NLD-dominated parliament that sat for the first time on Feb. 1, said on Wednesday they were eager for the nomination process to get under way.

""It is a very big change, like the Magna Carta,"" said Myint Lwin, a lower house lawmaker from the NLD. ""I'm proud to be involved in this history.""

Speculation on the NLD presidential nominee has ranged from Suu Kyi's personal physician to her chief-of-staff. In recent days, it has focused on her close friend Htin Kyaw. He runs the Daw Khin Kyi Foundation, a charity to assist people in Myanmar's poorest areas founded by Suu Kyi and named after her mother.

RECONCILIATION GESTURE

Three presidential candidates will be nominated on Thursday - one by the lower house, one by the upper house, and one by the military bloc in parliament. The constitution gives the armed forces a quarter of seats in both houses.

""We will propose the vice presidential candidates tomorrow in both Pyithu and Amyotha Hluttaw,"" said NLD spokesman Dr Zaw Myint Maung referring to Myanmar parliament's lower and upper house chambers.

Because the NLD has a comfortable majority in both chambers it will effectively control two of the nominations, with the party's second pick widely expected to be a representative of one of Myanmar's ethnic minorities.

The two losing nominees become vice presidents, meaning that a nominee from an ethnic party would be proposed with that role in mind in line with Suu Kyi's goal of forming a government for national reconciliation.

Local media have named Thet Swe, a former navy chief who stepped down last year to run in the election representing the far flung Coco Islands, as one of the possible nominees for the military.

The three nominees do not need to be lawmakers, but they will be vetted by a parliamentary commission.

After that, both houses of parliament will come together for a joint session to vote on the presidency.

The NLD's huge majority means that whichever candidate it backs as president will win.

The president picks the cabinet that will take over from President Thein Sein's outgoing government on April 1, with the exception of the heads of the home, defense and border security ministries who will be appointed by the armed forces chief.

There was confusion among members of parliament on Wednesday over how soon the presidential vote would take place.

A director from the parliament told Reuters that the vote would not be held until at least Monday.

New NLD members of parliament said they remained in the dark over who would be nominated.

""We only have the news from Facebook,"" said Sein Mya Aye, a lower house NLD lawmaker.

BRASILIA O ministro da Fazenda, Nelson Barbosa, mantem o cronograma preparado por ele para envio das propostas de reformas Fiscal e da Previdencia ao Congresso, apesar de reconhecer uma deterioracao do cenario politico da semana passada para ca.

Segundo ele, as duas reformas serao encaminhadas para o Legislativo entre este mes e o fim de abril.

Barbosa espera que medidas relacionadas a area economica que ja estao no Congresso possam ter a tramitacao retomada o mais rapido possivel.

Em entrevista a Reuters nesta quarta-feira, o ministro rebateu a avaliacao de agentes do mercado financeiro de que eventual impeachment da presidente Dilma Rousseff faria a economia do pais melhorar.

Na semana passada, noticias de delacao premiada do senador Delcidio do Amaral (PT-MS), ex-lider do governo no Senado, e fase da operacao da Lava Jato que teve como alvo o ex-presidente Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva fizeram o dolar cair ante o real e a Bovespa registrar alta.

""A melhor solucao para o momento atual e fazer uma combinacao de medidas que de espaco para o governo estabilizar a economia no curto prazo"", afirmou Barbosa, citando maior espaco fiscal, ""normalizacao da oferta de credito"" e reformas estruturais.

""O governo atual e o mais qualificado, o mais apto a promover essas reformas"", disse o ministro.

Ele reconheceu, no entanto, que a piora do ambiente politico atrasa o andamento de medidas importantes que ja foram enviadas ao Legislativo, como a recriacao da CPMF.

Barbosa afirmou ainda que a meta de superavit primario deste ano dos governos regionais, de 6,6 bilhoes de reais, pode ser reduzida dependendo do acordo que esta sendo costurado com a Fazenda para alongar a divida dos Estados.

Assim, a meta de economia para pagamento de juros do setor publico consolidado --governo central, Estados, municipios e estatais-- pode ser ainda menor em 2016.

O governo esta negociando o alongamento da divida dos Estados junto a Uniao em 20 anos e, na terca-feira, abriu espaco para que o pagamento das parcelas nos dois primeiros anos tenha um desconto em troca de mais austeridade fiscal dos entes.

RECUPERACAO

Na visao de Barbosa, a economia brasileira devera ser estabilizada no terceiro trimestre, voltando a crescer a partir dos ultimos tres meses deste ano.

""Estamos trabalhando para recuperar o nivel de atividade o mais rapido possivel, estabilizando renda e emprego e reducao da inflacao. Isso vai contribuir para reduzir nao so a incerteza macroeconomica, mas tambem para a reducao da incerteza politica"", afirmou.

Em 2015, o Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) sofreu a maior queda em 25 anos, de 3,8 por cento, afetado pela contracao recorde nos investimentos e na industria.

Pesquisa Focus do Banco Central, que ouve semanalmente uma centena de economias, mostra projecoes de queda de 3,5 por cento do PIB neste ano, com crescimento de apenas 0,5 por cento em 2017.

Questionado sobre as perspectivas para o ingresso de receitas extraordinarias no caixa da Uniao este ano, Barbosa citou as aberturas de capital da Caixa Seguridade e da IRB-Brasil Resseguros, que devem ocorrer no segundo semestre, quando as condicoes de mercado estiverem mais favoraveis.

Em fevereiro, a IRB-Brasil desistiu da oferta publica inicial de acoes (IPO, na sigla em ingles), citando condicoes adversas de mercado. A Caixa Seguridade suspendeu em outubro passado seu pedido para uma oferta de acoes.

CREDITO

Barbosa afirmou que o governo trabalha para reaquecer o mercado de credito num momento em que as empresas sofrem com falta de liquidez. Ele argumentou que isso ocorre dentro do espaco fiscal existente, e indicou que o esforco nao sera estendido para o credito voltado ao consumo.

O ministro mostrou-se ainda contrario a taxacao, voltada para a Previdencia, sobre exportadores agricolas, mesmo no cenario de baixa arrecadacao.

Tambem disse que o governo nao tem planos para injetar capital na Petrobras, tampouco usar as reservas internacionais.

""Nos achamos importante manter reservas internacionais no nivel atual, principalmente neste nivel de turbulencia"", afirmou.

ASMARA In an often forgotten corner of the Horn of Africa, Eritrea's capital boasts one of the worlds finest collections of early 20th century architecture and the authorities want it declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

When Italy's colonial experiment in Eritrea ended in 1941, it left behind an array of Rationalist, Futurist, Art Deco and other Modernist styles in Asmara, a city whose historic heart has changed little since the Italians lived and worked there.

In following decades, conflict ravaged Eritrea, leaving the nation isolated and stifling development. But the violence by-passed the city, and the capital has never been swamped by the kind of construction that raced ahead elsewhere in Africa.

A Reuters photo essay at reut.rs/1UQi38U shows elegant avenues still flanked by the Art Deco Cinema Impero, the imposing lines of the Education Ministry that once housed the Fascist party headquarters and the Futurist Fiat Tagliero garage with gravity-defying concrete cantilevered wings, extending 15 meters either side without the support of pillars.

Italian architects used what had been an amalgamation of highland villages centuries earlier as ""an ideal blank canvas"", according to UNESCO's description, to practice what were, at the time, some of the world's most avant garde designs.

Italians nicknamed it ""La Piccola Roma"" or ""Little Rome"".

""The city is very intact and maintains its original character,"" said Medhanie Teklemariam, coordinator for the Asmara Heritage Project, which has drawn up an inventory of about 4,300 buildings in Asmara's historic perimeter.

The nomination dossier for World Heritage Site status was submitted to UNESCO this year, with a decision expected in 2017.

If approved, Asmara would benefit from technical assistance, helping renovate and preserve the historic buildings, which include offices, government buildings and homes.

World Heritage Site status could also draw visitors to a barely trodden tourist trail. Eritrea has soaring mountains and a long Red Sea coast, but no international hotel chains.

The authorities have also carefully protected the architectural assets, adhering to 1938 building regulations. New planning regulations are being drawn up but some rules, such as limiting buildings to 60 meters high, are likely to remain.

""If we are going to exceed above this height, I think we are going to destroy the skyline of Asmara,"" said Medhanie.

The Italians left their mark in other ways. Pizza and pasta are almost national dishes - and expertly cooked.

Italians also brought cycle racing to Eritrea and it has become a national passion - images of Eritrean cyclist Daniel Teklehaimanot who wore the King of the Mountains jersey in the 2015 Tour de France are plastered in hotels and shops.

Street-side cafes are filled with the grumble and hiss of polished coffee machines serving up espressos and macchiatos.

Seeking to mirror the bigger and older empires of Britain and France, Eritrea was Italy's route ""to enter the big business of imperialism,"" said Federico Niglia, a history professor at Luiss University in Rome.

Coinciding with a period when there was an ""explosion of art"" in Italy, Asmara's architecture was one way to show off Italy's approach to colonial management, he added.

But Italy's ambitions lay beyond Eritrea, which was seen as simply the starting point of a far grander empire in East Africa. It had long had its eyes on Ethiopia next door, a nation it briefly occupied from 1936 until it was ejected in 1941.

Unlike Asmara, a city Italians shaped during several decades there, Addis Ababa's soaring skyline and rapid expansion have overshadowed the few reminders of Ethiopia's brush with Italian rule.

WASHINGTON A U.S. general nominated to lead U.S. forces in the Middle East told lawmakers on Wednesday that he was concerned about the lack of a reliable partner in Syria in the fight against Islamic State and would look carefully at Washington's strategy if confirmed to the post.

Army General Joseph Votel told the Senate Armed Services Committee he would seek to ensure a coherent and well-resourced strategy to go after Islamic State strongholds.

""In Iraq we do have a partner, we do have a government, (but) in Syria we don't and so I am concerned about how we approach this moving forward in Syria without a political element to support that,"" Votel told the committee, which is considering his nomination to head the U.S. Central Command that oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East.

""I do have concerns about our broader strategy against ISIL,"" Votel said, using an acronym for Islamic State, ""about how we are applying resources, about how we are focusing our authorities.""

Votel said operations to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul and the Syrian city of Raqqa would take additional resources.

The committee also is considering the nomination of Army Lieutenant General Raymond Thomas to lead U.S. Special Operations Command. Thomas told the members that U.S.-backed rebels in northeastern Syria had suffered more than 75 casualties fighting Islamic State in the past month.

""They're losing a lot of people to carry the fight against ISIL, so I'm impressed with their tenacity,"" Thomas said.

In response to a comment from Republican Senator John McCain, Thomas said he would support the presence of U.S. special forces in Libya to combat a growing threat from Islamic State there.

The United States launched an air strike on an Islamic State training camp last month and France has conducted surveillance flights and sent military advisers. U.S., French and British special forces also are present in the country, officials and media have said.

""That particular part of ungoverned space requires potentially unique special operations solutions and we're attempting to provide those options to the chain of command,"" Thomas said. ""We've already identified some formative organizations that we hope to be able to work with in the future.""

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said on Wednesday it had signed a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA.N) 767 widebody freighter aircraft to handle more of its own deliveries in the United States.

The deal comes at a time when the world's biggest online retailer is offering ever-faster, and increasingly free, deliveries for millions of online orders.

Amazon, which relies on carriers like United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) to deliver most of its packages, spent $11.5 billion on shipping last year.

In a bid to assume more control over its supply chain and reduce costs, Amazon has rolled out thousands of trailers and launched a program that uses contract drivers to deliver fast orders.

But analysts said the long-rumored plan to build its own air fleet posed little threat to the leading delivery companies.

""This is an incremental negative for FDX and UPS as it will likely remove some higher yielding express freight and parcel volume from each of the respective networks,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst John Barnes wrote in a client note.

UPS, the world's No. 1 package delivery company, operates about 240 large planes while FedEx has a fleet of about 370, Barnes noted. FedEx and UPS shares were down about 1.5 percent.

FedEx said on Wednesday the announcement was not a surprise and called Amazon a valuable customer.

""We work closely with Amazon and have been aware for some time about their need for supplemental air capacity related to inventory management,"" said Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications at FedEx.

The leased planes will start to go into operation on April 1, Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email.

Amazon has been testing deliveries by drones but has not said when they would be in service.

The duration of the leases will be five to seven years, lessor Air Transport Services Group Inc (ATSG.O) said.

As part of the agreement, Amazon has the right to buy up to 19.9 percent of ATSG's stock over five years at $9.73 per share.

ATSG's stock soared almost 27 percent to a record high of $14.90, before paring gains to about 16 percent.

Trade between the United States and Canada and joint efforts to curb climate change will loom large on the agenda for the meeting between President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Washington on Thursday.

It will be followed by a star-studded state dinner meant to recognize the importance of the bilateral relationship, the first state dinner to honor Canada in 19 years.

Trudeau's Liberals came to power in November by ousting right-wing Conservative leader Stephen Harper, whose ties with Washington deteriorated as he hectored Obama over the Keystone XL pipeline.

President Barack Obama blocked the project last year, a victory for environmentalists who had campaigned against the pipeline.

The spat is in the past, Rice said.

""In any bilateral relationship, there are going to be issues of difference and occasional friction,"" she told Reuters in an interview.

""The complexity and the breadth and the depth of the U.S-Canada relationship is such that no single issue can overshadow the totality of the relationship,"" she said.

Obama and Trudeau will discuss the next steps for the ""Beyond the Border"" initiative, a plan to speed travel and trade, Rice said.

""With the longest peaceful border and $2 billion a day in trade in both directions, we have an enormous shared stake in a border that is open for business and open for travel - and safe,"" Rice said.

Trudeau campaigned to strengthen ties with the United States, but also promised he would pull out six fighter jets from the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

Rice said the White House is satisfied with steps that Trudeau took to beef up training, surveillance and other support to the coalition.

""Taken as a whole, we view the Canadian stepped-up contribution to the counter-ISIL campaign as being very, very valuable and welcome,"" Rice said, using an acronym for Islamic State.

The White House has also watched closely as Trudeau welcomed 25,000 Syrian refugees to Canada in four months.

""We've seen thus far that Canada is taking very seriously its responsibility to its own citizens and to our common security to be vigilant as it welcomes these new refugees,"" Rice said.

Michael Horn, speaks at their media reception during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, January 10, 2016.

Michael Horn, President and CEO of Volkswagen America, reacts to being mobbed by the media after he apologized for the Volkswagen diesel scandal at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, United States in a November 18, 2015 file photo.

Michael Horn, President and CEO of Volkswagen America, introduces the new Beetle Dune at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, United States in a November 18, 2015 file photo.

WASHINGTON Volkswagen AG's top U.S. executive is stepping down nearly six months after the German automaker admitted to installing software to allow 580,000 diesel U.S. vehicles to emit excess emissions, the company said on Wednesday.

Michael Horn, who has been president and chief executive officer of Volkswagen of America since 2014, is leaving by mutual agreement ""to pursue other opportunities effective immediately,"" VW said.

Horn could not immediately be reached. A lawyer for Horn did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

The German automaker said on an interim basis, Hinrich J. Woebcken, who was recently named the new head of the North American Region and chairman of Volkswagen Group of America, will assume Horn's role.

Horn's departure comes as VW continues to negotiate with California, the Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency on possible fixes or buybacks for the diesel vehicles. It faces a March 24 deadline to tell a federal judge whether it has an acceptable fix.

A top California official told state lawmakers Tuesday that VW may only be able to mount a partial fix and may have to pay to mitigate the harm caused by allowing vehicles to remain on the road.

During the initial response to the crisis, Horn was VW's public face in the United States, apologizing days after the scandal became public and testifying before Congress.

""Lets be clear about this: our company was dishonest  with the EPA and the California Air Resources Board  and with all of you. And in my German words: We totally screwed up. We must fix those cars,"" Horn said in New York on Sept. 21.

In October, Horn told a U.S. House of Representatives panel that VWs supervisory board and top leadership did not intentionally order the cheating, but said it was the work of a few individuals. Asked by Rep. Joe Barton, a Republican from Texas, if it made sense that a company like VW could allow a fraud to go on for seven years without top leaders knowing, Horn was blunt.

""I agree it is very hard to believe, he said. ""Some people made the wrong decisions.""

Horn told Congress he had no knowledge of the cheating.

He became CEO based at VW's U.S. headquarters in Herndon, Virginia following the resignation of his predecessor, Jonathan Browning who abruptly resigned after VW brand sales fell in 2013. Sales fell despite an aggressive plan announced in 2008 by VW to triple sales in 10 years.

Airport officials became suspicious after they found fresh operation scars below the woman's breasts during a search on Feb. 24 and she complained of severe pain.

The woman admitted to carrying drugs, which had been inserted into her body during a hastily arranged operation.

She was sent to a local hospital where doctors removed two 500-gram lumps of cocaine wrapped in plastic from each of her breasts.

The drugs have a market value of 200,000 euros ($220,000) and were destined for Spain, a customs spokesman said.

""This is the first case in Germany in which drugs have been smuggled in this fashion,"" said spokesman Hans-Juergen Schmidt.

Customs agents were shocked by what they said was the amateurish surgery. Schmidt said it showed how drugs smugglers ""are completely indifferent to human life and the life-threatening conditions of their drug carriers.""

The woman, who said she has three children in Colombia where she worked in agriculture, will be charged with drug trafficking and faces jail time. ($1 = 0.9123 euros)

Model Alexia Palmer, who is suing Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump's Trump Model Management LLC of lying to the federal government, is shown is this undated handout photo released on March 8, 2016.

NEW YORK A judge will decide by the end of this month whether to proceed with a proposed class action lawsuit filed by a Jamaican fashion model against Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump's modeling agency, the judge's office said.

Alexia Palmer accuses Trump Model Management LLC of lying to the federal government in its work-visa application that said she would be paid a $75,000-a-year salary while living in the United States, according to court documents.

READ MORE: North Korea says it has missile-ready nukes

Instead, according to court papers, Palmer received a total of $3,880.75 during the three years she was under contract with the agency. The complaint alleges fraudulent misrepresentation and violations of U.S. immigration and labor laws. It asks for $225,000 in back pay.

The suit was originally filed in October 2014. A decision on a pending motion by Trump Model Management to dismiss is expected by the end of March, the clerk for Judge Analisa Torres, who is presiding over the case in the U.S District Court, Southern District, told Reuters.

If Torres rules the case can proceed, it could revive attention on Trumps foreign labor practices at a time when the celebrity billionaire's rise in American politics has riveted the worlds attention.

Trumps lawyers have called the case ""frivolous"" and ""without merit."" In court documents, they said Palmer wasnt an employee and was more than adequately compensated for a very brief stint as a fashion model, which they say amounted to less than 10 days of work over three years.

Reuters could not independently confirm that assertion.

RECOMMENDED: Iran tests more missiles, says capable of reaching Israel

At the end of the day, this model just didnt have a successful career, and we fully expect to win, said Lawrence Rosen, a lawyer for Trump Model Management.

Although Trump owns the modeling agency, the suit does not name him. Trump's campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said in a statement that Trump Model Management's treatment of Palmer was in line with ""standard practice in the modeling industry.""

Palmer's lawyer, Naresh Gehi, says his client was cheated of earnings and seduced by a life of glamour that never materialized. ""The visa application the company filed with the government requires that people are paid the full amount,"" Gehi said. ""Its a requirement.

Palmer, who was 17 when she came to New York in 2011, was not available to comment.

TOP JAMAICAN MODEL

Sylvia Ayass, a lawyer who has worked with models on visas like Palmer's, said agencies typically pay what they state on visa applications.

Trump has won Republican frontrunner status in the 2016 election in large part by positioning himself as a champion of the American worker who will deport illegal immigrants, build a wall with Mexico and do away with the off shoring of U.S. jobs.

This is not the first time Trump's labor practices have drawn criticism. A Reuters story published in August revealed that Trump's companies sought to import at least 1,100 workers on temporary visas since 2000. Of those, 250 were filed for foreign fashion models, according to the Reuters analysis of federal Department of Labor data.

Using a federal visa program called H-1B that allows U.S. employers to hire ""specialized"" foreign labor, Trump's modeling agency offered Palmer ""at least $75,000 per year"" for three years. It listed that salary on her H-1B visa application in 2011, according to the court documents reviewed by Reuters.

Rosen, the lawyer for Trump Model Management, said the $75,000 a year figure was simply a guess, not a guarantee.

Under that contract, Palmer agreed ""to promptly reimburse"" Trump Model Management ""for any and all costs and expenses"" that the agency incurred relating to her modeling.

According to the suit, the agreement stipulated that Trump Model Management would take a 20 percent cut of Palmers earnings but instead took 80 percent by deducting charges for everything from postage to walking lessons to mobile phone costs and limousine rides, as well as $4,000 in ""administrative fees,"" according to court documents.

The suit said it was seeking class-action status to represent other models who believe they were misled and underpaid after coming to the United States with sponsorship from Trumps modeling agency.

Frankfurt Die Aussicht auf neue Geldgeschenke von EZB-Chef Mario Draghi hat Anleger am Mittwoch in Kauflaune versetzt.

Gegen Handelsschluss machten einige von ihnen allerdings Kasse, um nicht auf dem falschen Fu erwischt zu werden. Der Dax schloss 0,3 Prozent fester bei 9723,09 Punkten und der EuroStoxx50 gewann 0,6 Prozent auf 3019,10 Zahler. An der Wall Street ging es ebenfalls leicht bergauf. Dow Jones, Nasdaq und S&P 500 gewannen bis zu 0,5 Prozent.

Am Markt werde fest damit gerechnet, dass die Europaische Zentralbank (EZB) am Donnerstag die Ausweitung ihrer Wertpapierkaufe auf 75 Milliarden Euro monatlich ankundigt, schrieben die Analysten der Essener National-Bank in einem Kommentar. Auerdem sei eine Verlangerung der Laufzeit des Programms moglich. Bislang pumpen die Wahrungshuter ""mindestens bis Marz 2017"" monatlich 60 Milliarden Euro in die Finanzmarkte, um die Konjunktur anzukurbeln und die drohende Deflation, eine Spirale fallender Preise und rucklaufiger Investitionen, abzuwenden.

""Da die Erwartungen an die EZB aber so hoch gesteckt sind, besteht das Risiko, dass sie dahinter zuruckbleibt"", warnte Devisenstratege Niels Christensen von der Nordea Bank. In diesem Fall musse mit einer kraftigen Aufwertung des Euro gerechnet werden. Einige Borsianer sehen die Wahrung in diesem Fall wieder bei 1,11 Dollar. Am Mittwoch kostete sie 1,1024 Dollar.

HOFFNUNG AUF ABEBBENDE OLSCHWEMME TREIBT PREISE

Am Rohstoffmarkt sorgte die Aussicht auf ein geringeres Uberangebot fur gute Stimmung. Die groen Exportstaaten wollen ab dem 20. Marz uber eine Deckelung der Fordermengen beraten. Sollte es zu einer Einigung kommen, ware dies ein Schritt auf dem Weg, Angebot und Nachfrage wieder ins Gleichgewicht zu bekommen, sagte Analyst Olivier Jakob vom Research-Haus Petromatrix. Aktuell werden taglich ein bis zwei Millionen Barrel Rohol mehr gefordert als benotigt.

Mit Erleichterung reagierten Investoren zudem auf den im Rahmen der Erwartungen ausgefallenen Anstieg der US-Lagerbestande. Die richtungsweisende Rohol-Sorte Brent aus der Nordsee verteuerte sich um bis zu 3,7 Prozent auf 41,11 Dollar je Barrel (159 Liter).

Gleichzeitig trennten sich Anleger von Gold. Das als sicher geltende Edelmetall verbilligte sich um 0,5 Prozent auf 1254,16 Dollar je Feinunze (31,1 Gramm). Der Bund-Future, der auf der zehnjahrigen Bundesanleihe basiert, gab 100 Ticks auf 162,17 Punkte nach.

BMW TROTZ REKORDERGEBNIS UNTER DRUCK - E.ON AUCH TIEFER

Bei den deutschen Aktienwerten ruckte am Mittag BMW ins Rampenlicht. Der Autobauer konnte mit einem Rekordergebnis und der Anhebung seiner Dividende auf 3,20 Euro je Stammaktie Investoren nicht uberzeugen. Borsianer hatten mit 3,38 Euro gerechnet. Die Papiere schlossen 1,8 Prozent tiefer bei 78,54 Euro.

Nach unten ging es auch fur E.ON, die sich nach Vorlage der Bilanz um 3,1 Prozent verbilligten. ""Der Ausblick macht die Musik"", sagte ein Handler. ""Und da dieser nicht besonders optimistisch ausgefallen ist, furchten Anleger, dass es auch bei der Dividende kunftig Abstriche geben konnte."" Auerdem gab Vorstandschef Johannes Teyssen fur 2015 einen Rekordverlust von sieben Milliarden Euro bekannt.

An der Wall Street sorgte Air Transport mit einem Kurssprung von zeitweise knapp 27 Prozent fur Aufsehen. Der Flugzeugvermieter liefert 20 Boeing-Frachtmaschinen an Amazon, der die Auslieferung von Paketen zunehmend in Eigenregie ubernehmen will. Der Online-Handler sicherte sich gleichzeitig das Recht, bis zu 19,9 Prozent an Air Transport zu ubernehmen. Dies hievte deren Aktien auf ein Rekordhoch von 14,90 Dollar.

Speaking at a news conference with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Kerry said ""I want to be clear that the United States considers the refugee crisis to be global. The impact first was felt, obviously, by Jordan and Lebanon and Turkey, and they've borne an unbelievable burden in the course of these four and a half, four-plus years of war."" On Monday a senior official from the Saudi-backed opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC) said the cessation of hostilities faced ""complete nullification"" because Syrian government attacks were violating the agreement. The cessation of hostilities agreement, the first of its kind since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, is a less formal arrangement than a ceasefire. It is meant to allow peace talks to resume and aid to reach besieged communities.

WASHINGTON Technology companies could face civil penalties for refusing to comply with court orders to help investigators access encrypted data under draft legislation nearing completion in the U.S. Senate, sources familiar with continuing discussions told Reuters on Wednesday.

The long-awaited legislation from Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, may be introduced as soon as next week, one of the sources said.

It would expose companies like Apple Inc, which is fighting a magistrate judge's order to unlock an iPhone connected to the mass-shooting in San Bernardino, California, to contempt of court proceedings and related penalties, the source said.

Senators are expected to circulate the draft bill among interested parties next week and hope to introduce it soon after, though a timetable is not final, the source said.

The Senators' proposal would not seek criminal penalties, as some media reports have stated, the sources said.

The controversial proposal faces an uphill climb in a gridlocked Congress during an election year and would likely be opposed by Silicon Valley.

Tech companies have largely supported Apple in its legal fight against the Justice Department, which is seeking access to a phone used by Rizwan Farook, one of two shooters in the San Bernardino attack last December in which 14 were killed and 22 wounded.

It is particularly unlikely the proposal will gain traction in the U.S. House of Representatives, which staked out positions strongly supporting digital privacy in the wake of revelations about government-sanctioned surveillance of communications by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.

Last year, amid stiff private sector opposition, the White House backed away from pushing for legislation to require U.S. technology firms to provide investigators with mechanisms to overcome encryption protections.

But the issue found renewed life after the shootings in San Bernardino and Paris. An August email from Robert Litt, the top U.S. intelligence community lawyer, obtained by the Washington Post, noted that momentum on the issue ""could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement.""

Separately, Democratic Senator Mark Warner and Republican Representative Michael McCaul last week introduced legislation to create a national commission to further explore solutions to the so-called going dark problem, where strong encryption has made it more difficult for law enforcement to access communications belonging to criminal suspects.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:03:18+00:00,Brazil prosecutors methods questioned after Lula detained,['Anthony Boadle'],"Brazil's former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva leaves a meeting with senators of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) in Brasilia, Brazil March 9, 2016.

BRASILIA An investigation into a massive corruption scheme centered on Brazilian state oil company Petrobras enjoys overwhelming public support but concern is growing that prosecutors may be over-reaching as they pursue politicians and executives.

The high-profile detention for questioning last week of former president Luis Inacio Lula da Silva drew criticism from the government and federal judges, reigniting debate over the methods used in ""Operation Car Wash"".

Critics say prosecutors trying to unravel the vast network of bribery and political kickbacks and Judge Sergio Moro, who presides over the case, are unfairly leaking evidence to the media and have left defendants in prison for months without charges as part of a strategy to win plea bargain deals.

Those allegations have intensified in the last few days.

""The detention of Lula has put a lot of stress on the whole investigation,"" said Rafael Mafei, a law professor at the University of Sao Paulo. ""It was a very public incident broadcast live on television and involved an ex-president.""

Mafei said Moro's methods test the limits of the law but are warranted by the scale of the graft scheme, a situation he compared to Colombia's war on drug cartels in the 1990s.

""Many Brazilians believe that our existing legal system is poorly equipped to handle such massive illegality that is larger than the justice system itself,"" he said.

Crucially, Moro's tactics have won the backing of higher courts in dealing with Brazil's biggest ever corruption scandal, in which a cartel of builders overcharged Petrobras for contracts, paying bribes to company directors and kickbacks to politicians.

Prosecutors have struck more than a dozen plea bargain deals and none of them have been denied by the Supreme Court, which has to approve testimony before it can be accepted as evidence.

While some Supreme Court justices questioned the way police arrived unannounced to pick up Lula, they publicly backed the investigation.

Moro has used questioning in custody and lengthy pre-trial detentions to garner information leading to dozens of arrests and the recovery of billions of dollars in bribes and political kickbacks.

Backed by an elite police unit in commando gear, officers arrived at Lula's Sao Paulo apartment last Friday at dawn and took the 70-year-old into custody for over three hours of questioning on suspicion he took bribes paid by engineering firms with graft money.

Lula's lawyer said the measure was based on scant evidence and illegal because the former union leader should have been served a subpoena asking him to make a statement before a warrant was issued to bring him in.

""They arrived by surprise with a disproportionate show of force, intent on making a public spectacle of his detention,"" his lawyer, Cristiano Martins, told Reuters. ""You cannot resort to illegal methods under the pretext of fighting corruption, just by saying the ends justify the means.""

COURTS BACK UP PROSECUTORS

Lula, popular leftist leader who was president from 2003 to 2010, went straight to the headquarters of the ruling Workers' Party after his questioning and rallied his followers to take to the streets to defend him.

His protege President Dilma Rousseff, fighting to survive the scandal amid a severe recession, said Lula's detention was ""unnecessary"" because he would have answered questions voluntarily.

The Workers' Party said the move was aimed at destroying Lula's legacy as defender of the poor so he cannot run again for president in 2018.

Federal prosecutors insist that they will push ahead with the probe regardless of the consequences.

""The storm will pass. Our only concern is that our investigations not be used politically by one side or the other,"" said a senior official in the federal prosecutor's office, known as the PGR.

Prosecutors are confident the Supreme Court will accept a plea bargain testimony of Workers' Party senator Delcidio do Amaral, reports of which sent shockwaves through Brazil's political establishment last week.

According to the IstoE news magazine, which had access to the document, Amaral accused Rousseff of trying to interfere in the Petrobras investigation, an impeachable offense, and said her 2014 re-election campaign was funded by graft money.

ODEBRECHT PUT AWAY

Lawyers for Marcelo Odebrecht, former CEO of Latin America's largest engineering group, criticized judicial overreach in arguing for his release after six months of pre-trial detention, but Brazil's second-highest court voted against the appeal.

Odebrecht was sentenced on Tuesday to 19 years in prison for bribery, money laundering and organized crime.

Prosecutors hope the stiff sentence will lead one of Brazil's richest men to seek a plea bargain.

Last month, the Supreme Court ruled convicted criminals should start their prison sentence as soon as it is confirmed by the circuit court and not after a lengthy appeals process.

The decision will reinforce Moro's strategy, Mafei said.

The Supreme Court ruling prompted Workers' Party lawmaker Wadih Damous to proposed a bill banning plea bargains by anyone in jail.

""Anyone behind bars will do anything to get out, even lie,"" the congressman said.

Damous echoed Rousseff's criticism of frequent leaks of plea bargain testimony to Brazilian media before courts rule on whether the evidence is valid.

""Every time a defendant's plea bargain is leaked, it becomes truth the very next day,"" he said.

BRUXELLES L'Italia, unitamente a Belgio, Croazia, Finlandia e Romania, ha ricevuto un 'early warning' dalla Commissione europea sui conti pubblici.

Bruxelles e preoccupata per il rispetto delle regole europee di bilancio e chiede per questo misure di aggiustamento entro meta aprile.

E quanto emerge da un comunicato della Commissione e dalla lettera che la stessa Commissione ha inviato al governo italiano.

In base alle stime macroeconomiche invernali la Commissione evidenzia nella lettera inviata all'Italia il rischio di significativa deviazione rispetto agli obiettivi 2016. Questo giudizio vale anche nel caso non venissero considerate le spese eccezionali sostenute dall'Italia per i migranti.

Prima del giudizio finale di maggio, che potrebbe contenere nuove raccomandazioni, la Commissione valutera per l'Italia e per gli altri quattro paesi i nuovi documenti economici per il 2016 e i loro programmi di convergenza, incluse le nuove misure dopo il giudizio di oggi.

Piu grave la situazione della Spagna alla quale la Commissione riserva una raccomandazione specifica (ACR) sulla ncesssita di procedere a misure correttive per riportare in tempo utile il deficit entro i limiti previsti da Bruxelles.

""Abbiamo identificato sei paesi le cui strategie di bilancio possono comportare rischi circa il rispetto dei loro impegni per il Patto di Stabilita e crescita. C'e ancora tempo per prendere le misure necessarie e per questo oggi stiamo mandando un primo early warning"" ha detto il vice-presidente della Commissione Valdis Dombrovskis in una nota.

I moniti arrivano un mese prima del 15 aprile, scadenza per presentare a Bruxelles i loro piani di bilancio pluriennali.

Lunedi 7 marzo l'Eurogruppo, nella sua nota finale, aveva sottolineato che l'Italia rischia di non rispettare i vincoli di bilancio anche nel caso di ottenimento dell'intera flessibilita aggiuntiva richiesta. Si tratta dello 0,6% del Pil, poco meno di 10 miliardi di euro. La stessa nota sottolineava le preoccupazioni sul livello del debito/pil nonostante la stabilizzazione del rapporto nel 2015 e la stima governativa di un calo nel 2016.

""Abbiamo fatto tutto il possibile per allertare le autorita nazionali sui rischi di rispetto dei vincoli. Adesso e in capo ai paesi fare tesoro di questo quando presenteranno i loro programmi di medio-termine ad aprile"" ha detto il commissario agli Affari eocnomici e monatari Pierre Moscovici.

Nei giorni scorsi il ministro dell'Economia Pier Carlo Padoan si e detto non preoccupato del richiamo della Commissione in arrivo.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 00:24:56+00:00,Exclusive: Bank of America hiring bankers for new middle-market push - sources,"['Dan Freed', 'Olivia Oran']","Bank of America Corp is hiring a new team of investment bankers who cater to midsized companies, four years after dismantling a similar business, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The precise number of middle-market bankers it plans to add could not be determined, but one person said it would be fewer than 10.

The hiring comes as Bank of America is reducing staff more broadly, while also trying to grow in areas where it believes it can gain market share. As the second-biggest U.S. lender with a large commercial banking business, executives believe Bank of America can make inroads in advising midsized companies on mergers and stock and bond offerings, the sources said. Bank of America defines middle-market as companies with $50 million to $2 billion in revenue.

The bank also hopes the push will lead to additional business such as managing money for executives at midsized companies.

Sources asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media about matters that have not been made public.

Bank of America announced internally last year that Vice Chairman Mark Stephanz would create a group that provides investment banking services to midsized companies. The hiring is part of that effort. His team will work together with counterparts in the commercial bank who provide traditional loans and cash management services, sources said.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender previously launched a middle-market business in 2007, with more than 30 investment bankers who focused on mergers and acquisitions. It abandoned the effort in 2012 to focus on larger clients and bigger deals, sources said. In 2015, Bank of America ranked fourth in global M&A league tables, according to Thomson Reuters data. It ranked 23rd globally in deals worth $500 million or less. Bank of America generated around 17 percent of its M&A fees from middle market deals, the lowest percentage of any big Wall Street bank except Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Last year, M&A hit a record volume of nearly $5 trillion, due to mega deals like Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA's $106 billion acquisition of SABMiller Plc and oil company Royal Dutch Shell Plc's $70 billion purchase of BG Group Plc. But some Wall Street executives predict blockbuster deals will slow down this year. In January, JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said she expects to see fewer massive mergers and more mid-sized deals.

Bank of America has been hiring salespeople to drum up business, even as it has cut support staff and underperformers as part of a multiyear cost-cutting initiative. Last year alone, it cut more than 10,000 jobs.

The bank laid off a number of investment bankers on Tuesday because of weak markets, one of the sources said.

Traders expect the ECB on Thursday to cut its deposit rate by at least 10 basis points and expand its asset-buying program. More ECB stimulus would put downward pressure on the euro but analysts have said ECB policymakers may not deliver the levels of easing traders expect.

The single currency was little changed at $1.1008, erasing an earlier 0.6 percent fall against the dollar EUR=. The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against the euro, yen and four other currencies, dipped 0.1 percent.

In the bond market, yields of U.S. safe-haven government bonds rose as some investors bet the recent decline in yields due to global growth concerns was overdone.

Yields extended their climb as weak demand for $20 billion worth of 10-year government debt stoked a wave of selling.

The benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RR was last down 17/32 in price to yield 1.891 percent, up from 1.834 percent late on Tuesday.

Copper, zinc and other base metals rose as speculators piled back into the market on hopes more production cuts would lead to shortages. Three-month copper in London CMCU3 closed up 1.4 percent at $4,935 a tonne.

Industrial output rose by a weaker-than-expected 0.3 percent month-on-month in January after a 1.1 percent drop in December, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected it to rise 0.5 percent.

Output in manufacturing rose 0.7 percent on the month following a 0.3 percent dip, the first increase for four months and easily topping expectations for a 0.2 percent uptick.

The monthly Markit/CIPS survey of British manufacturers also showed the sector enjoyed an unexpectedly strong January, but it then suggested factory activity barely grew last month.

Britain has been one of the fastest-growing major advanced economies in the world for the last couple of years. But it has relied heavily on domestically focused services for growth, frustrating hopes for a better-balanced recovery.

Economic growth slowed in the second half of last year and economists say it could lose more momentum in early 2016.

Industrial output was still 10.2 percent below its peak in early 2008 during the three months to January 2016, while manufacturing output was 6.4 percent smaller.

The manufacturing sector failed to contribute to British economic growth last year.

Finance minister George Osborne has warned that the economy was facing a ""dangerous cocktail"" of risks from overseas in 2016, as growth slows in major emerging markets, stock markets tumble and oil prices slump amid fading global demand.

Economists say that the Britain's planned referendum on its European Union membership could also drag on growth.

North Sea oil and gas extraction fell 6.3 percent on the month, the biggest drop since June 2014, which the ONS said could be linked to bad weather.

Brent crude oil prices slid almost 7 percent in January following a 35 percent drop for 2015 as a whole.

Compared with a year ago, industrial output was 0.2 percent higher in January.

reuters.com,,The Worlds Most Influential Scientific Minds,"['Using Citation Analysis To Identify Authors Whose Scientific Scholarly Papers Wield Outsized Influence', 'Julia Laurin', 'Vp Head Of Product Management Government Academia']","Every year upwards of 9 million scientists and scholars publish their findings in academic journals producing papers that, according to some estimates, likely number in excess of 2 million.

With such prodigious output, the task of qualifying the value of each piece of work is challenging. Nevertheless, the research community, publishers, academic administrators and others seek such designation, beyond who has the highest salaries, biggest laboratories or office shelves with the most awards.

One strategy is to concentrate on the research papers themselvesspecifically, the extent to which they have assisted, inspired or challenged other researchers. Papers meeting this standard earn a clear distinction when other authors explicitly footnote, or cite, the reports in their subsequent work. A paper that other authors have frequently cited has quantifiably proved itself to be significant.

Extending this logic provides a clear avenue: to seek out authors who have consistently produced papers which have, in turn, won peer approval in the form of high citation counts.

This approach is embodied in the latest Thomson Reuters report on The Worlds Most Influential Scientific Minds, covering the main areas of science and the social sciences, presenting the researchers who, in their respective fields, have contributed markedly high numbers of top-cited papers over a recent ten-year period. The report also includes a section on the worlds hottest scientists, whose work within the last two years has been cited at a notably rapid clip.

The Top 1%

Compiled annually, the Most Influential Scientific Minds report reflects data from the Thomson Reuters Highly Cited Researchers website, with publication and citation figures drawn from Essential Science Indicators (ESI), a component of the Web of Science. Among its assorted features and metrics, ESI tracks papers published in the last decade that rank in the top 1% most cited for their respective years of publication in each of 22 main subject fields. These reports, officially designated as Highly Cited Papers, numbered more than 120,000 in a recent analysis covering the years 2003 to 2013.

Thomson Reuters analysts identified author names listed on multiple reports within each ESI field. (Each paper is assigned to only one field, depending on the journal in which it appeared. Any paper published in a multidisciplinary journal, such as Science or Nature, is assigned based on algorithmic analysis of the literature predominantly cited by the paper, as well as of the journals which subsequently cited the report. For example, a Science paper that mostly cites immunology reports, and is in turn cited by papers published in immunology journals, would be assigned to the field of Immunology.)

Once the papers have been accurately attributed, the authors are listed within each ESI field according to the number of Highly Cited Papers to their credit. In all, the current listing of Highly Cited Researchers features more than 3,100 names.

Size Matters

The specialty areas covered by ESI differ drastically in size. That is, some fields are characterized by greater numbers of journals, in which larger populations of authors publish more papers, and therefore greater quantities of Highly Cited Papers. For example, the field of Clinical Medicine is the largest in ESI, accounting for about 12% of the databases total content. Economics & Business, meanwhile, contributes just over 2%.

The relative size of each ESI field, in terms of the overall number of Highly Cited Papers, was factored into the thresholds that determined how many authors to feature in each field. Varying thresholds are also included in determining how many Highly Cited Papers were required to qualify a given author.

Figure 1 reflects the variance in the size and the corresponding yield of Highly Cited Researchers for the top 10 of the 21 ESI fields, showing the number of authors within each area. Clinical Medicine, as noted earlier, is unmistakably predominant.",[]
reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:46:41+00:00,Signs of life for Apple's stock as Wall St. eyes new iPhone,['Noel Randewich'],"SAN FRANCISCO After months of declines in Apple's (AAPL.O) stock, sentiment appears to be mending as investors focus on steady earnings expectations and bet that the expected launch of a new iPhone will add badly-needed fuel to sputtering sales.

Battered by nearly a year of off-and-on declines from record highs because of fears of a slowdown in iPhone sales, Apple's stock now is valued closer to IBM, which has disappointed Wall Street for the past four years with declining revenue, than to Silicon Valley technology pioneers Alphabet and Tesla Motors.

Apple shares have increased 5 percent in the past two weeks as Wall Street bets the company this month will launch a less expensive iPhone to boost sales in developing countries like China. With U.S. consumers upgrading their smartphones less often, manufacturers have been relying on China for growth.

Shareholders this week pointed to Apple's reliable cash generation, beaten down valuation and its wild card potential for future game-changing products as key reasons for owning it.

""This company has a history of doing better than expectations and surprising people,"" said Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust Company, which holds over 1 million shares of Apple. ""Where else can I go and find a company trading at 10 or 11 times earnings that has had such a great history?""

At $100.97 a share on Wednesday, Apple is selling at 10.7 times its expected earnings per share over the next 12 months. Its average forward price-earnings-ratio has been 13 over the past two years.

By comparison, Internet behemoth Alphabet (GOOGL.O), whose Android mobile platform competes against Apple's iOS, trades at 20 times expected earnings and 13-year old Tesla Motors (TSLA.O) trades at 132 times earnings. International Business Machines (IBM.N), which is struggling to expand into a high-growth business like cloud computing, has a P/E of 10.2, according to Thomson Reuters data.

""Unless something big happens, (Apple) doesn't deserve to trade at 20 to 25 times earnings anymore. It's just too big,"" said David Meier, a portfolio manager at Motley Fool Funds. ""But as a high-quality company, could it trade at 15 times earnings? Certainly.""

A target of 15 times its next 12 months' expected earnings would put Apple at around $138.

In another hint of improving sentiment, Apple's stock has recently moved above its 50-day moving average for the first time since December.

The stock's selloff in recent months has boosted Apple's dividend yield to 2.2 percent from 1.5 percent a year ago.

Analysts' covering Apple have been little help to investors. Ahead of the stock's 20-percent drop that started in December, 41 analysts recommended buying Apple shares while just one recommended selling, according to Thomson Reuters data. Currently, no analysts recommend selling, while 38 recommend buying.

A new iPhone with a smaller 4-inch screen will likely boost volumes by about 5 percent this year, an increase not yet incorporated into Wall Street's expectations, Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski wrote in a report on Monday.

Apple chip supplier Dialog Semiconductor (DLGS.DE) on Tuesday forecast March-quarter revenue below analysts' expectations, but said it still expects single-digit growth for the year. That suggests the March quarter could mark the low-point in iPhone shipments, with demand for new models building later in the year, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a research note.

Jeffrey Carbone, Senior Partner at Cornerstone Financial Partners, said Apple remains a staple holding at his firm but that he has recently turned his attention to Apple suppliers including Skyworks Solutions (SWKS.O), which he believes is undervalued.

""We have a normal weighting on Apple, we like the company, but we think the supply chain could have greater potential,"" Carbone said.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Why America could (probably) survive a President Trump,"['Peter Apps Is Reuters Global Affairs Columnist Writing On International Affairs Globalization Conflict Other Issues He Is Also Founder Executive Director Of The Project For Study Of The Century A Non-national Non-partisan Non-ideological Think Tank Operating In London New York Washington Prior To That He Spent Years As A Reporter For Reuters Covering Defense Political Risk Emerging Markets', 'Peter Apps', 'Posted Cheeze', 'Posted Moriganti', ""Any Opinions Expressed Here Are The Author's Own"", 'Posted Mottjr', 'Posted Uaus']","One of the more fascinating things this election has been watching it dawn far too late on many pundits and the political establishment that Donald Trump might actually win the Republican nomination. Now, of course, the question is rather starker  could he win the presidency, and what happens if he does?

The conclusion, in my experience talking to many Washington policy types of both political persuasions, frequently includes a swear word. Foreign diplomats, officials and policy experts often take a similar view.

For sure, Trump is like no politician in recent American history. For now, I dont necessarily expect him to win  his supporters might be enthusiastic, but he could be even more effective at getting his opponents out to vote against him.

Still, there are routes by which he could win, particularly if Democrats fail to come out for Hillary Clinton as expected.

Even if that doesnt happen, the Trump phenomenon is part of a much wider  perhaps even global  political trend. That could have implications well beyond the United States.

Indeed, America is one of the few countries in the world that could actually withstand a Trump-type presidency.

For all his rhetoric, a President Trump would, like all other occupants of the Oval Office, find himself constrained by the Constitution, judiciary and Congress. Even if the Republicans do retain control of the House and Senate, many members of Congress are already voicing their opposition. And if a Trump presidency proves as contentious as many expect, it could easily deliver the Democrats control of Congress in 2018.

Earlier this month, I took a shot at imagining in more detail what future historians might make of a Trump presidency. My conclusion was that he might last one term, achieve much less than he initially expected and quite possibly exert considerable energy on minor changes to real estate laws.

That doesnt mean he wouldnt have an effect, particularly on perceptions of the United States in the rest of the world. The optics of his rhetoric on Islam is already playing badly in the Middle East. As president, that  particularly if tied to more indiscriminate military action  could prove disastrous.

Still, overall he would be restrained. And, just like the current incumbent of the White House, would probably leave largely frustrated by what he had failed to do.

While Trump is a unique political creature, the forces he is riding go much deeper and wider  and have been growing for a while. Ultimately, what he is really taking on is much deeper societal frustration  particularly with political elites on both sides. His strength is that he looks authentic, and he has successfully used both social and traditional media to persuade huge swathes of supporters that he is the candidate most like them and most in tune with their  not always politically correct  instincts.

On the left in the United States, we have simultaneously seen Bernie Sanders harnessing some of the same frustrations to mount a credible challenge to Hillary Clinton. In Europe, weve seen the rise of both non-traditional left and right parties.

Weve also seen unexpectedly left-wing leaders in particular  for example, Britains opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn  seize control of what had been much more moderate mainstream political parties.

In most cases, those elected so far have remained relatively committed to operating within established political systems. Some of the more radical groups  such as Marine Le Pens far right in France  have performed worse than many expected. (France is, after all, a country that endured Nazi occupation in relatively recent history.)

That may not always be the case, though  none of these frustrations are going away and in Europe, the migrant crisis may yet fuel a further move either to the extremes or to more generic authoritarianism. The chaos of the 1990s in Russia, after all, helped set the scene for the rise of Vladimir Putin.

Already, some Europe experts talk of a rise in authoritarianism, particularly in the communist states of the former Eastern Bloc. Hungary has seen the rise of Viktor Orban and his far-right Jobbik party. Poland has seen something similar, while this months elections in Slovakia saw a much-better-than-expected performance by the very far right.

Like Trump, these leaders are invariably nationalist, more isolationist, anti-globalization in general and anti-migrant in particular.

Thats when political systems become really important. In the United Kingdom, the parliamentary system usually keeps the fringe parties  such as the anti-EU UK Independence Party  almost entirely sidelined from elected office. (Although the rise of the Scottish National Party, which now controls most parliamentary seats in Scotland, is probably another sign of this trend.)

In Germany, however, a much more proportional representation-based system means that a radical Trump-type figure could make himself a kingmaker in German politics with a small share of votes, say 25 percent. In the 1930s, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis were able to use that kind of platform to take control of the entire country.

The United States isnt Weimar Germany, and Donald Trump isnt Hitler (despite the words of comedian Louis C.K.) But it says a lot about the United States founders and system of government that it could likely survive a politician worse than The Donald.",[]

reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:12:59+00:00,Virginia auto dealer group sues Tesla to stop second store in state,['Reuters Editorial'],"A Tesla logo is pictured on the hub of a car during the second media day of the 86th International Motor Show in Geneva, Switzerland, March 2, 2016.

DETROIT The Virginia Automobile Dealers Association (VADA) on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and Virginia state officials to keep the electric car maker from opening a second dealership in the state.

The VADA claims in the suit filed in circuit court in Fairfax County, Virginia, that Tesla and the state's Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner, Richard D. Holcomb, are violating a 2013 agreement that Tesla could not consider owning and operating a second dealership in Virginia until at least August 2017.

Tesla has a dealership in Tysons Corner in the relatively affluent area of northern Virginia near Washington, D.C., which opened in February 2015.

Don Hall, president of the VADA, said in an interview with Reuters that Tesla and the Virginia DMV tried to keep the VADA in the dark about Tesla's efforts to open a second dealership.

The suit claims that Holcomb named a hearing officer for a DMV hearing of the Tesla request and that a hearing is set for March 31.

""They tried to get this done very quickly, in the dark of the night, in hopes that no one could know about it,"" Hall said.

A member of his organization learned of a real estate deal for property in Richmond for a Tesla store, alerting him to the request and, eventually, the lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Hall said.

Calls to Tesla and to the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles were not immediately returned on Wednesday afternoon.

Tesla has been fighting for the right to own and operate its own dealerships, and has sought to open its own stores in several states despite franchise laws that do not allow, in most cases, a manufacturer to own and operate an auto dealership.

ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: And welcome to The Whiting Auditorium on the campus of the Flint Cultural Center in Flint, Michigan for a special CNN democratic presidential debate.

COOPER: Im Anderson Cooper. I want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. Tonights debate will be seen on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Espanol, by American soldiers, sailors, and airmen on the American Forces Network, and nationwide on the Westwood One Radio Network.

And now we want to welcome the Democratic candidates for president of the United States, please welcome Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Please welcome former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Ladies and gentlemen, the Democratic candidates for president of the United States!

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Before we begin tonight, we want to take a moment to remember former first lady Nancy Reagan. As probably know she passed away this morning at the age of 94. Her grace and elegance in the White House, her deep love for President Reagan, and her strength and advocacy in the fight against Alzheimers and drug abuse will always be remembered. We would like to pause of a moment of silence in honor of Mrs. Reagan.

And now will you please rise for our national anthem performed by the Flint City Wide Choir, conducted by Darnell Ishmel. (MUSIC PLAYING, THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER)

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Our thanks to the Flint City Wide Choir.

Candidates take your positions behind the podium. Before we begin as the candidates take their positions, I just want to set out some ground rules as moderators, Ill ask questions, Ill ask follow- ups and guide the discussion. The candidates will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions. Theyll have 30 seconds for follow- ups. CNNs Don Lemon will join me in the questioning, as will members of our audience here tonight. The members of our audience are Democrats and independents from Flint and elsewhere in Michigan. Weve reviewed their questions just so they dont overlap.

Now weve come to Flint because this is a city in crisis, a city where, as you probably know, the tap water is toxic. Public servants, public institutions not only failed to prevent the crisis, their decisions created this crisis. The state of Michigan, in an effort to save money, switched Flints water source to a cheaper, but riskier alternative, the Flint River. Safeguards were ignored. That river water corroded residential pipes, and for nearly two years, lead leaked into the water used in peoples homes. Now, for much of that time, the state downplayed the danger, even in the face of growing complaints and physical evidence.

For 100 days, the federal government knew about it, and yet in all that time nobody told the people of Flint. They bathed in the water, they drank it, and so did their kids. Even today, lead is still present in some of the water.

Tonight the Democratic candidates are here to answer questions about what they would do for Flint, as well as about other issues facing their country right now.

Each candidate has one minute for an opening statement, Senator Sanders is first. We begin with him. Senator Sanders?

SEN. BERNARD SANDERS, I-VT.: Anderson, thank you very much.

Over the last several weeks I had the opportunity to meet with a number of residents of Flint at a town meeting in Flint, and I have to tell you what I heard, and what I saw literally shattered me. And, it was beyond belief that children in Flint, Michigan in the United States of America in the year 2016 are being poisoned.

That is clearly not what this country should be about.

As Anderson indicated, theres a lot of blame to go around, and one of the points that I have made is that I believe the Governor of this state should understand that his dereliction of duty was irresponsible. He should resign.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: But more importantly, what is happening in Flint to a lesser degree is happening throughout this country. In recent years we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires, and increase in income and wealth inequality, and all over this country middle class families are struggling. Cities and towns are struggling, in order to provide basic services. Among many other things, we need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our water systems, our waste water plants, our roads and our bridges. The wealthiest country in the history of the world has got to get its priorities right, take care of the people, no more tax breaks for billionaires.

COOPER: Thank you, Senator.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, Ill start by saying amen to that.

(APPLAUSE)

We are here in Flint, Im very grateful that my request that we hold this debate be held here so we can continue to shine a very bright spotlight on what has happened in this city.

I agree, the Governor should resign, or be recalled...

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: ... support the efforts of citizens attempting to achieve that. But, that is not enough. We have to focus on what must be done to help the people of Flint.

I support a hundred percent the efforts by your senators and members of congress to get the money from the federal government in order to begin the work that must occur to fix the infrastructure. The state should also be sending money immediately to help this city.

(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)

CLINTON: I know the state of Michigan has a rainy day fund for emergencies, what is more important than the health and wellbeing of the people, particularly children? It is raining lead in Flint, and the state is derelict in not coming forward with the money that is required.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: And, well get to what we need to do to help the children and the people when I have a little more time because thats just as important as fixing the pipes.

COOPER: Were going to have a lot of time for that. We want to begin tonight with the people of Flint themselves. This is Mikki Wade, shes a public housing program manager, and the mother of two kids. She says shes currently undecided, and has a question that both of you will be able to weigh in on. Ms. Wade?

QUESTION: The water has impacted our lives in such a way that living comfortably in our home isnt the same anymore. The constant drives to pick up water just so my children can wash their hair, to wash our fruits and vegetables, and to brush our teeth is incredibly difficult. Once the pipes are replaced, Im not so sure I would be comfortable ever drinking the water.

QUESTION: If elected president, what course will you take to regain my trust in the government?

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, well begin with you.

CLINTON: Well Nikki, its a very fair question.

Your government at all levels have let you and your children and the people of Flint down. So I think that there are there several things. All the repair work that is being done  and Mayor Weaver program that we support to begin to help train people in Flint to be able to do this work to distribute the water. Everything that is done has to be triple checked to regain your trust and to hold those who are responsible for fixing the pipes and delivering the clean water which has you said, you bathe in it and drink it and wash food in it. You do everything with it.

Every one of us should have to run through in our minds how we use water every single day to understand the pressures and the real pain that families are going through. So I will make sure as President that I double and triple check. I will work with elected officials who I trust like your mayor and like your senators and member of Congress so that we can assure you that when its fixed, you can trust it. You deserve nothing less.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me follow-up with that, he people here still wasnt drink the water in their homes as you well know. They cant bathe their kids in the water and they are desperate for accountability and specifics. As president can you give a specific about what you can do if you were president that would make Ms. Wades life better and life better for people here?

CLINTON: Well, I support what President Obama is doing. He called for and got accountability from the officials at the EPA to make sure the state is doing its job. He expanded Medicaid for helping kids particularly to get the health care they need. He is also ordered that there be a Head Start program. I support that.

When it comes to the water itself, we are supporting a program that Mayor Waver announced through Flint Waterworks to pay people in Flint, not outsiders, but people here to deliver the water while we are fixing the pipes. I would do even more of that. As president, what we were able to put together was a beginning. As president, I would concentrate resources on the city for economic development for more jobs as we fix the water and provide the health and education, interventions that children need. COOPER: Senator Sanders for Ms. Wade specifically?

SANDERS: What is going is a disgrace beyond belief. As the president of the United States, this is what I would do is if local government does not have the resources  if state government for whatever reason America shouldnt be poisoned, federal government comes in, federal government acts.

(APPLAUSE)

What is absolute incredible to me is that water rates have soared in Flint. You are paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vermont for clean water.

First thing is you say, people are not paying a water bill for poison and that is retroactive.

(APPLAUSE)

Second of all, to ease anxiety, CDC has to come in and examine every child and adult in this community in terms of the amount of lead they may have. Thirdly, the wealthiest country has to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure, our water systems. I have a bill for a trillion dollars, it creates 13 million jobs rebuilding flint, Michigan and communities all over the country.

COOPER: Thank you, senator.

(APPLAUSE)

We will have more on the infrastructure shortly but I want to follow up with you.

This crisis in flint as you know, as everybody in the room knows was created by the government. Your policies are about expanding government. Why should people from flint trust that more government is the answer?

SANDERS: Thats a good point, Anderson.

Listen, I suppose they can trust the corporations who have destroyed Flint by a disastrous trade policy which have allowed them to shut down plants in flint and move to China or Mexico. We could trust them Im sure.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Or maybe  you know, maybe, Anderson, tell you what  we should  maybe we should let Wall Street come in and run the city of Flint...

(APPLAUSE)

... because we know their honesty and integrity has done so much for the American people. Look, we live in a democracy, and Im not in (ph) the last person to deny that government is failing in many respects.

But at the end of the day, I will trust the people to create a government that works for them, rather than Wall Street or corporate America.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton  Secretary Clinton, you  youve now both called for the governor to resign. I believe thats  thats new for you. Previously, you had not called for that, but youre calling for that tonight.

Its easy to blame the Republican governor, Rick Snyder. But the federal government also dropped the ball here. According to Section 1414 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA has to step in and take action when a state is informed at (ph)  about water problems and doesnt do anything for 30 days, as the state here didnt do.

The EPA knew for months and months, never warned the people of Flint not to drink the water. As president, would you fire the head of the EPA?

CLINTON: Well, I think that the people here in the region, who knew about this and failed to follow what you just said, rightly, the law required, have been eliminated from the EPA.

COOPER: So far, one person has resigned.

CLINTON: I dont  well, I dont know how high it goes. I would certainly be launching an investigation. I think there is one. I was told that  you know, some of the higher-ups were pushing to get changes that were not happening.

So I would have a full investigation, determine who knew what, when. And yes, people should be fired. How far up it went, I dont know. But as far as it goes, they should be relieved, because they failed this city.

But let me just add this, Anderson. This is not the only place where this kind of action is needed. We have a lot of communities right now in our country where the level of toxins in the water, including lead, are way above what anybody should tolerate.

(APPLAUSE)

We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint. So Im not satisfied with just doing everything we must do for Flint. I want to tackle this problem across the board. And if people know about it and theyre not acting, and theyre in the government at any level, they should be forced to resign.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, would a President Sanders fire the head of the EPA?

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: President Sanders would fire anybody who knew about what was happening and did not act appropriately.

(APPLAUSE)

And President Sanders would make the point that, how does it happen, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world? What are our priorities when, among others, Republicans today are fighting for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest people?

How did we have so much money available to go to war in Iraq and spend trillions of dollars...

(APPLAUSE)

... but somehow not have enough money  not just for Flint, the secretary is right. There are communities all over this country  its not just infrastructure, it is education. Detroits public school system is collapsing.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Thank you  thank you, Senator.

SANDERS: Anderson, the bottom line is, and what my campaign is, is changing our national priorities. We need a government that works for all of us...

COOPER: Thank you, Senator.

SANDERS: ... not just wealthy campaign contributors.

COOPER: I want to go to Lee-Anne Walters. This is Lee-Anne Walters. She was one of the first people to report problems with the water in Flint. One of her twin boys stopped growing. Her daughter lost her hair.

She says shes undecided, and has a question for both of you to answer, but well start with Senator Sanders. Ms. Walters?

QUESTION: After my family, the city of Flint and the children in D.C. were poisoned by lead, will you make a personal promise to me right now that, as president, in your first 100 days in office, you will make it a requirement that all public water systems must remove all lead service lines throughout the entire United States, and notification made to the  the citizens that have said service lines.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: I will make a personal promise to you that the EPA and the EPA director that I appoint will make sure that every water system in the United States of America is tested, and that the people of those communities know the quality of the water that they are drinking, and that we are gonna have a plan to rebuild water systems in this country that are unsafe for drinking.

COOPER: Let me just point out for accuracys sake, there is 10 million lead service pipes delivering water to people all across this country tonight. Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: Well, I agree completely. I want to go further though. I want us to have an absolute commitment to getting rid of lead wherever it is because its not only in water systems, its also in soil, and its in lead paint that is found mostly in older homes. Thats why 500,000 children today have lead  lead in their bodies.

So, I want to do exactly what you said. We will commit to a priority to change the water systems, and we will commit within five years to remove lead from everywhere.

We were making progress on this in the 1990s. I worked with then Senator Obama to get more money, more support to do more to remove lead.

COOPER: Thank you.

CLINTON: That has, unfortunately, been in many ways, moved to a lower priority. I will elevate it, and I will do everything I can. Water, soil, and paint...

COOPER: ... Thank you...

CLINTON: ... Were going to get rid of it.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Thank you, Secretary. I want to go to my colleague, Don Lemon.

LEMON: Anderson, thank you very much. Secretary Clinton, tonight you call for the resignation, or for Governor Snyder to be recalled. There are residents of this city who want to see criminal charges brought against those who are responsible. Do you think people should go to jail?

CLINTON: Well, thats going to be up to the legal system, Don. I mean, I cant standing here  I dont have all the facts, but people should be held accountable wherever that leads. If it leads to resignation, or recall if youre in political office.

If it leads to civil penalties, if it leads to criminal responsibility. There has to be an absolute accountability, and I will support whatever the outcome of those investigations are.

LEMON: Senator Sanders, do you think people should go to jail?

SANDERS: Well, I agree, you know? We cant sit up here  I cant sit up here and make judgment over whether or not somebody committed a criminal act. But, I will tell you this that after an investigation, if people, in fact, were found to have committed a criminal act  I talked to a mother.

Imagine this for a second, imagine a mother who had a bright seven-year-old gregarious girl doing well in school. Two years later, that child is now in special education, intellectual capabilities significantly deteriorated. That is a crime against that child, and the people of Flint. And, clearly, people are going to have to be held accountable.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Secretary.

I want to turn now to Bryn Mickle, the editor of the Flint Journal, hes our local partner in this debate. He has our next question.

Bryn?

QUESTION: Secretary Clinton, it took this water crisis for politicians like yourself to notice we are a city in trouble. Youve only both recently started talking about Flint, holding campaign events here in just the past few weeks. Secretary Clinton, youve even made the crisis a centerpiece of a new campaign ad. Why should the people of Flint believe that you arent just using this crisis to secure political points?

CLINTON: Well, I think because throughout my public career I have been evening the odds for people in every way that I could. I started out with the Childrens Defense Fund, I worked throughout my time as a young lawyer as a person, an activist. Certainly, in Arkansas, then in the White House, to try to fix problems wherever I saw them.

And, this problem is one that is particularly outrageous and painful at the same time.

So, when I heard about it I immediately sent people here to find out what was going on. It was almost unbelievable. We have this problem in other places, but we dont say that it was actually caused by decisions made by public officials in positions of authority, as this one was.

Then, when I talked to the mayor I basically said, What can I do to help?

Then, when I came here, and I met with some of the mothers, and met their children, and heard their stories  Im just determined to do whatever I can. So, I have put together resources from the private and philanthropic communities to help provide a bridge because youve got to get the federal money, youve got to get the state money, but Im going to do everything I can. And, I will be with Flint all the way through this crisis in whatever capacity I am.

And, if Im president, it will always be a priority for action from me.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Bryn has a follow up.

QUESTION: Senator Sanders, how about you? Your first visit to Flint as a presidential candidate was just over a week ago. Thats almost five months after the people here were told to stop drinking the water. What took you so long?

SANDERS: Well, first of all, thats not quite accurate. I was here long before that. I will you what I did. What I did was meet very quietly in Detroit with parents and others who were impacted by this disaster.

And the second thing I did is hold a town meeting, which was as nonpolitical as I could make it for hundreds of people to tell me and the world through the media exactly what was happening here in Flint. I think the fear and the legitimate fear of the people of Flint is that a certain point the TV cameras and CNN will disappear.

(APPLAUSE)

And people are going to be left struggling in order to live in a safe and healthy community. All I can say is if you check my record going back a long time, I have stood with those who are hurting. I have stood with those who have no money, and I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in the United States of America. Thats my record and Im proud of it.

COOPER: Thank you, Senator.

This city is also facing a jobs crisis, 75 percent of Flints manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last 25 years and about the same amount of time, Michigan lost 230,000 manufacturing jobs.

I want to go to Tanisha Motron, she grew up in flint and now works in Detroit at the Shinola watch factory which as you know, is often held up as the blueprint for how to save American industry jobs. She says shes leaning towards secretary Clinton and has a question for her.

QUESTION: A lot of members work in the auto industry here in Flint. Thats ultimately what I wanted to do when I got out of school unfortunately, I was unable to get any one of the big three and thats why I now reside at Shinola. If you are elected president, what are you going to do to in the United States instead of sending them overseas to other countries?

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: Im going to do what I think will work which is both carrots and sticks. Let me talk about the carrots. Were going to have a very clear set of proposals and incentives for manufacturing so that we change the way that companies think about making investments again in America. I have a comprehensive manufacturing plan that I will be implementing.

Were also going to invest more on infrastructure as we both have said, its woefully under resourced. That will put a lot of people to work. I want to do more to help small businesses, they are the source of two thirds of our jobs and we have to help them start and grow, particularly minority and women-owned small businesses.

We need to do more to help create clean energy as a source of good jobs but I am also going to go after companies. You know, when a company decides to leave like Nabisco is leaving and they have gotten tax benefits from Chicago and Illinois to stay there, I will claw back the benefits. They will have to pay them back if they are leaving a place that actually invested in them.

I am also going to go after companies like Johnson Controls in Wisconsin. They came and got part of the bailout because they were an auto parts supplier and now they want to move headquarters to Europe. They are going to have to pay an exit fee. We are going to stop this kind of job exporting and we are going to start importing and growing jobs again in our country.

COOPER: Senator sanders, I will let you...

SANDERS: I am very glad, Anderson, that secretary Clinton discovered religion on this issue but its a little bit too late.

Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America.

(APPLAUSE)

NAFTA, supported by the Secretary cost, us 800,000 jobs nationwide, tens of thousands of jobs in the Midwest. Permanent normal trade relations with China cost us millions of jobs. Look, I was on a picket line in early 1990s against NFATA because you didnt need a PhD in economics to understand that American workers should not be forced to compete against people in Mexico making 25 cents an hour........

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: And the reason that I was one of the first, not one of the last to be in opposition to the TPP is that American workers...

(APPLAUSE)

... should not be forced to compete against people in Vietnam today making a minimum wage of $0.65 an hour. Look, what we have got to do is tell corporate America that they cannot continue to shut down. Weve lost 60,000 factories since 2001. Theyre going to start having to, if Im president, invest in this country  not in China, not in Mexico.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Well  well, Ill tell you something else that Senator Sanders was against. He was against the auto bailout. In January of 2009, President-Elect Obama asked everybody in the Congress to vote for the bailout.

The money was there, and had to be released in order to save the American auto industry and four million jobs, and to begin the restructuring. We had the best year that the auto industry has had in a long time. I voted to save the auto industry.

(APPLAUSE)

He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry. I think that is a pretty big difference.

SANDERS: Well, I  If you are talking about the Wall Street bailout, where some of your friends destroyed this economy...

CLINTON: You know...

SANDERS: ... through  excuse me, Im talking.

COOPER: Let him (ph) (inaudible).

(APPLAUSE)

(CROSSTALK)

CLINTON: If youre gonna talk, tell the whole story, Senator Sanders.

SANDERS: Let me tell my story. You tell yours.

CLINTON: I will.

SANDERS: Your story is for  voting for every disastrous trade agreement, and voting for corporate America. Did I vote against the Wall Street bailout?

When billionaires on Wall Street destroyed this economy, they went to Congress and they said, please, well be good boys, bail us out. You know what I said? I said, let the billionaires themselves bail out Wall Street. It shouldnt be the middle class of this country.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: OK, so...

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

SANDERS: Wait a minute. Wait. Could I finish? Youll have your turn, all right?

But ultimately, if you look at our records, I stood up to corporate America time and time again. I went to Mexico. I saw the lives of people who were working in American factories and making $0.25 an hour.

I understood that these trade agreements were going to destroy the middle class of this country. I led the fight against us (sic). That is one of the major differences that we have.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton.

CLINTON: Well, if I  if I could...

(APPLAUSE)

... to set the record straight, I voted against the only multinational trade agreement that came before me when I was in the Senate. It was called CAFTA. I came out against the TPP after it was finished. I thought it was reasonable to actually know what was in it before I opposed it. I oppose it.

(APPLAUSE)

Now let me get back to what happened in January of 2009. The Bush administration negotiated the deal. Were there things in it that I didnt like? Would I have done it differently? Absolutely.

But was the auto bailout money in it  the $350 billion that was needed to begin the restructuring of the auto industry? Yes, it was. So when I talk about Senator Sanders being a one-issue candidate, I mean very clearly  you have to make hard choices when youre in positions of responsibility. The two senators from Michigan stood on the floor and said, we have to get this money released. I went with them, and I went with Barack Obama. You did not. If everybody had voted the way he did, I believe the auto industry would have collapsed, taking four million jobs with it.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Senator Sanders?

SANDERS: I believe that the recklessness, the greed, and the illegal behavior of Wall Street drove this country into the worst economic downturn in the history of the United  modern history of the United States of America. And I will be damned if it was the working people of this country who had to bail out the crooks on Wall Street.

(APPLAUSE)

And what I proposed  and I had an amendment that was defeated  it was defeated by a voice vote on the floor of the Senate  that said to those people on the top who benefited from Wall Street greed  I said, you pay for the bailout. Dont go to my constituents, who are struggling to make ends meet.

In terms of the auto bailout, of course that made sense. In terms of the stimulus package, of course that made sense, and I strongly supported President Obamas position on that.

SANDERS: But let us be clear, one of the major issues Secretary Clinton says Im a one-issue person, well, I guess so. My one issue is trying to rebuild a disappearing middle class. Thats my one issue.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Senator Sanders...

CLINTON: Well, all I can say is that given the terrible pressures that the auto industry was under and that the middle class of this state and Ohio and Indiana and Illinois and Wisconsin and Missouri and other places in the Midwest were facing, I think it was the right decision to heed what President-elect Obama asked us to do.

He sent a letter, an authorized letter, asking us to support that to save the auto industry. Yes, were there things in it that you and I would not have necessarily wanted? Thats true. But when it came down to it, you were either for saving the auto industry or you were against it. I voted to save the auto industry. And I am very glad that I did.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Let me just say this, while we are on Wall Street, one of us has a super PAC. One of us has raised $15 million from Wall Street for that super PAC. One of us has given speeches on Wall Street for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now, I kind of think if you get paid a couple hundred thousand dollars for a speech, it must be a great speech. I think we should release it and let the American people see what that transcript was.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: And I have said and I will say again, I will be happy to release anything I have as long as everybody else does too, because what really is behind that question, Republicans and Democrats, is where I can stand up to Wall Street.

Well, lets have some facts instead of some rhetoric for a change. I went to Wall Street when I was a United States senator. I told them they were wrecking the economy. I asked for a moratorium on foreclosures. I asked that we do more to try to prevent what I worried was going to happen. I also called for closing loopholes including the carried interest loophole. I also called for changes in CEO pay. I have a record. And you know what, if you were going to be in some way distrusted or dismissed about whether you can take on Wall Street if you ever took money, President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had.

And when it came time to stand up to Wall Street, he passed and signed the toughest regulation since the Great Depression with the Dodd-Frank regulations.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, just yesterday, in fact, you said just  I believe it was yesterday you said not only her speech must have been a fantastic speech, it must have been a Shakespearean speech for that amount of money. Is her answer enough for you that she will release it when all the Republicans and Democrats do? SANDERS: All right, look, Secretary Clinton wants everybody else to release it, well, Im your Democratic opponent, I release it, here it is. There aint nothing. I dont give speeches to Wall Street for hundreds of thousands of dollars, you got it.

Second of all, when we talk about being tough on Wall Street, and this galls me and the American people. Recently Goldman Sachs, among many other major financial institutions on Wall Street, as you know, reached a settlement with the federal government for $5 billion because they were selling worthless packages of subprime mortgages, $5 billion settlement.

You know how many people, executives on Wall Street have gone to jail? If you are a kid caught with marijuana in Michigan, you get a police record. If you are an executive on Wall Street that destroys the American economy, you pay a $5 billion fine, no police record.

If I am elected president, we are going to bring justice back to a broken criminal justice system.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: Well, I think we are in vigorous agreement on this. I have said repeatedly no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail. And I have said that I would use the tools in the Dodd-Frank regulations, that if any bank posed a systemic risk to the economy, they would be broken up.

Because we now have tools, laws that we didnt have before. And I am very happy we did. Because there does need to be accountability, including criminal accountability if it is called for.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, I just want to show the audience, you sent a tweet, I want to return to trade.

You sent a tweet on Thursday, this is the tweet, Im showing it to viewers. It says the people of Detroit know the real costs of Hillary Clintons free trade policies. It shows pictures of crumbling buildings. It seems like youre blaming her for the situation in Detroit.

SANDERS: Well, Im blaming the trade policies. You know what? This is an amazing thing which I didnt know until recently, and I wonder how many people did know this.

COOPER: But, youre calling them Hillary Clintons failed trade policies.

SANDERS: Well, Hillary Clinton, and everybody else who supported these disastrous trade policies. She wasnt alone. We have many, many Republicans and far too many Democrats who supported these disastrous trade policies.

Do you know...

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: ... Do you know that in 1960 Detroit Michigan was one of the wealthiest cities in America? Flint, Michigan was a prosperous city, but then what happened is corporate America said why do I want to pay somebody in Michigan a living wage when I can pay slave wages in Mexico or China? Were going to shut down, were going to move abroad, were going to bring those products back into this country.

Those trade policies, as much as any other set of policies, has resulted in the shrinking of the American middle class. And, Ill tell you what else it did. Its not only job loss by the millions, it is the race to the bottom so that new jobs in manufacturing, in some cases today, pay 50 percent less than they did 20 years ago. How stupid is that trade policy?

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: You know, if were going to argue about the 1990s instead of talking about the future, which Id much prefer because I think every election is about the future, and you all deserve to know what we will do to help you have a brighter future  but, if we are going to talk about the 1990s I think its only fair to say that at the end of the 1990s, after two terms of my husbands presidency, the unemployment rate in Michigan was 4.4 percent.

There had been a net increase of 54,000 manufacturing jobs. There had been a net increase of 653,000 jobs overall.

And, one of the ways jobs were brought to, and grown here in Michigan was through something called the Export-Import Bank which helped a lot of businesses, particularly small businesses, be able to export around the world.

Senator Sanders opposes that. I think were in a race for exports. I think China, Germany, everybody else supports their businesses. Here in Michigan theres been $11 billion dollars in recent years used to support exports, primarily from small businesses.

I favor that, hes opposed it. I want to do everything I can for us to compete and win in the global economy...

COOPER: ... Senator Sanders...

CLINTON: ... and thats what I will do as president...

COOPER: ... I just want to explain to viewers what the Export- Import Bank is, in case everybody is not quite as wonkish as everybody on this stage here.

The Export-Import Bank, its a federal agency, it gives loans to companies that export American products. Senator Sanders, you do oppose it. The vast majority of the banks customers are small businesses, 176 right here in Michigan. What do you say to small business owners....

SANDERS: ... Ill tell you what I say...

COOPER: ... Who rely on the banks to make their company profitable...

SANDERS: ... Ill tell you what I say. Do you know what the other name of the Export-Import Bank is? What its called in Washington? Its called the bank of Boeing because Boeing itself gets 40 percent of the money discharged by the Export-Import Bank.

Seventy-Five percent of the funds going from the federal government, the Export-Import Bank, goes to large, profitable corporations. Many of these corporations have shut down in America, and have gone abroad to exploit poor people.

You know what? I dont think its a great idea for the American taxpayer to have to subsidize through corporate welfare profitable corporations who downsize in the United States of America.

COOPER: Senator...

SANDERS: ... Seventy-Five percent of that money goes to large profitable corporations.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, you are the only member of the Democratic caucus to vote against it. Youre agreeing with Senator Ted Cruz on this, why is he right and the Democrats wrong?

SANDERS: Well, let me tell you, I dont want to break the bad news.

(LAUGHTER)

SANDERS: Democrats are not always right. Democrats have often supported corporate welfare...

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Democrats have supported disastrous trade agreements, but on this issue I do not believe in corporate welfare, and in fact, secretary Clinton may know or not know, but as a member of the Financial Services Committee, I worked hard and successfully to make sure that at least 20 percent of the money went to small businesses which is where it should go and not to profitable corporations and downsizing in our country.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: When I traveled around the world on you behalf as Secretary of State and went to 112 countries, one thing I saw everywhere was how European and Asian countries were supporting their companies back in their countries, to be able to make sales and contracts in a lot of the rest of the world. In fact, without the export-import bank, supporting businesses of all sizes  I believe more jobs would be lost here at home and more jobs literally would be exported. Instead of exporting products, we would be exporting jobs.

I just believe that Senator Sanders took that lonely position because most of us who saw the results  I saw it as a senator from New York. Your Senators saw it here in Michigan. They can give you the names of 240 companies in Michigan that have been helped.

There is a company in Levonia being helped, there are companies all over this state. I know, if we are going to compete and win in the global economy, we cant let every other country support their companies and we take a hands off approach. I will not agree with that.

COOPER: Im going to let you respond but I just want to push back on this. Senator Sanders is correct, the majority of the money does go Boeing, does go to companies like Caterpillar. Do they need this money?

CLINTON: I will tell you what, Anderson, after I investigated it, I concluded they did and heres why. There two big plane manufacturers in the world, theres Airbus and Boeing. Airbus does everything it can to get contracts to sell planes everywhere in the world. We dont have as quite an aggressive outreach from our government.

I did go in many places around the world to sell American products because the alternatives were usually European, Asian, primarily Chinese products. That to me was an unacceptable concession. So yes, Boeing and other big companies get support just like their competitors do from the companies that they are from in the countries that provide the support.

COOPER: Thank you.

Senator sanders?

SANDERS: Isnt it tragic that the large multinational corporations making billions of dollars a year, shutting down in America, going to China, going to Mexico? Absolutely they need a handout from the American middle class  I dont think so.

Second of all.

(APPLAUSE)

Second of all, secretary Clinton traveled the world, she has been to Europe. And lets talk about Europe versus the United States. Im sure that when you were in Europe, and France, and Germany and the U.K., and all of the other countries; you noticed something and that is every one of those countries guarantees health care to all of their people as a right.

(APPLAUSE)

And I am sure you know as you know you do that in countries like the U.K. compared to America, we are spending almost three times as much as they spend in the U.K. for health care for our people. We are spending 50 percent more than the French. When we talk about Europe and their pluses and minuses, one thing they have done well that we should emulate and that is guaranteed health care for all people for a better care for all.

COOPER: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton, 30 seconds and we have to take a break. So 30 seconds if you can.

CLINTON: We are on the path to doing that thanks to President Obama and the Affordable Care Act, we have 90 percent coverage. We are lacking 10 percent. We are going to stay on that and get to 100 percent universal coverage.

COOPER: We have to take a break. We will continue this discussion. We have a lot more to talk about. We will take a short break.

We have more of the Presidential Democratic Debate from Flint, Michigan when we come back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

COOPER: And welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate, live here in Flint, Michigan. We want to continue the discussion now  were gonna turn to the subject of crime.

As most of you know, two weeks ago, an Uber driver in Kalamazoo, which is two hours from where we are tonight, went on a shooting rampage, killing six people, injuring two people.

One of the injured was a 14-year-old girl. Her name is Abigail Kopf. She was shot in the head, her heart stopped, she was on life support  looked like she might  might not make it. But amazingly, Abigail pulled through. Her father...

(APPLAUSE)

... her father Gene Kopf is here tonight. And I know, Gene, you have a question. But before you ask your question, I just want to ask, how is Abigail doing tonight?

QUESTION: She is now laughing and giggling, but she has a long road of physical recovery.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: I should point out you are leaning toward Senator Sanders, but I know you have a question that applies to both candidates. Well first toss it to Secretary Clinton. Whats your question?

QUESTION: The United States has had a rash of mass shootings over the years  42 shootings in the United States this year alone. The man who shot everyone, including my daughter, in Kalamazoo, had no mental health issues recorded, and had a clear background.

What do you plan to do to address this serious epidemic? I dont want to hear anything about tougher laws for mental health or criminal backgrounds, because that doesnt work....(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: Well, first of all I am looking at your daughter and Im very grateful that she is laughing and she is on a road to recovery. But it never should have happened. You know, on average, 90 people a day are killed by gun violence in our country.

I think we have to try everything that works to try to limit the numbers of people and the kinds of people who are given access to firearms. The Brady Bill, which has been in effect now for about 23 years, has kept more than two million purchases from going forward. So we do have to continue to try to work on that because not every killer will have the same profile.

But the comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online loophole, closing whats called the Charleston loophole, where you get a gun at the end of three days, even if the background check is not completed which is what the killer in Charleston did. And then they found out later, he shouldnt have gotten the gun when he killed nine people at Mother Emmanuel Church.

I also believe, so strongly Gene (ph), that giving immunity to gunmakers and sellers was a terrible mistake.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Because it removed any accountability from the makers and the sellers. And it also disrupted what was a very promising legal theory, to try to get makers to do more to make guns safer for example. To try to give sellers more accountability for selling guns when they shouldnt have. So that is an issue that Senator Sanders and I differ on, I voted against giving them immunity, but I think we should very seriously move to repeal that and go back to making sure gun makers and sellers are like any other business. They can be held accountable.

And then I do think we have got to have a public...

QUESTION: Thank you.

CLINTON: Well, weve got to have a public discussion, because we have created a culture in which people grab for guns all the time.

COOPER: Thank you. CLINTON: And there has got to be a way to have more warning signals and more efforts to try to stop that from happening like with the man who shot your daughter.

COOPER: I want to go to Senator Sanders.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Senator Sanders?

SANDERS: I remember President Obama being on television maybe three months ago. Showed the secretary members as well. She knows the president, I know the president. And he is generally speaking in public and hes not a very emotional guy. And he  after the mass killing in Oregon if my memory is correct, he said look. There  to be honest with you, lets be honest. Nobody has a magic solution to this problem.

Any lunatic tomorrow, any person can walk into a theater and do something horrific. And you know what? For us to tell you that that absolutely will not happen would be untrue. But what the president said, he said look, this is a tough issue. But we have got to do everything we possibly can to minimize the possibility of these mass killings.

You are looking at a guy who comes from a rural state with no gun control. I have a D minus voting record from the NRA. You are looking at a guy who in 1988 lost a statewide election for Congress because I was the only candidate who said you know what, I dont think its a great idea in this country to be selling military-style assault weapons which are designed to kill people.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: I lost that election by three votes. I agree with what the secretary said. We need to expand and improve the instant background checks. Bottom line is people who should not have guns in America should not be able to buy guns in America.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton mentioned the so- called Charleston loophole. What she is calling the Charleston loophole. Is that something, if you were president, you would you work to extend that three day?

SANDERS: Absolutely, I agree. Look, that bill had some sensible provisions in it. It had the banning of bullets that pierce policemens armor. Is that a good thing? I think we would want to get rid of that. particular legislation had safety locks on guns so the kids do not pick them up and shoot them. That bill had bad things in it. What I have said...

COOPER: So you would want a longer than three days waiting period?

SANDERS: Absolutely. That was a very arbitrary decision. What that real debate was about, as you may or may not know, was about how long it would take for the instant background check to go into effect. I wanted that instant background check to go into effect as soon as possible. That was the most important part of that bill.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton  actually, Senator Sanders, let me continue to follow-up, because Secretary Clinton mentioned the liability.

Right now, families of Sandy Hook victims announced that they are going to sue Remington, who made the AR-15 which was used in the Newtown massacre.

(APPLAUSE)

Now, they believe  those families believe that  that Remington, the distributors, the sellers  should be held legally responsible for how that gun  how their product is used.

Now, the lawsuit may not go anywhere because of the bill you voted for  legislation that prevents gun makers from being sued. Tonight, what do you say to those families?

SANDERS: Well, this is what I say, if I understand it  and correct me if Im wrong. If you go to a gun store and you legally purchase a gun, and then, three days later, if you go out and start killing people, is the point of this lawsuit to hold the gun shop owner or the manufacturer of that gun liable?

If that is the point, I have to tell you I disagree. I disagree because you hold people  in terms of this liability thing, where you hold manufacturers liability is if they understand that theyre selling guns into an area that  its getting into the hands of criminals, of course they should be held liable.

But if they are selling a product to a person who buys it legally, what youre really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in America. I dont agree with that.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Well, that  that is not  that is not what happened, and I think its important for people to understand.

Because of the proliferation of guns, because of the epidemic of gun violence in our country, there were a group of cities, states, and other concerned people who, in the late 90s and in the early 2000s, were working on legal theories that they thought would force gun makers to do more to make guns safer and force sellers to be much more responsible.

The NRA saw this happening, and they said, weve got to stop it. Last thing in the world we want is to have guns that you can only shoot with your fingerprint, or to have guns with such strong safety locks on them that they may not be sellable.

So the NRA went to the Congress, and the head of the NRA has said this was the most important NRA legislation in more than 20 years...

COOPER: Secretary...

CLINTON: ... and they basically went to the Congress  I was there.

COOPER: ... Secretary...

CLINTON: I was in the Senate. And they said, give us absolute immunity. No other industry in America has absolute immunity...

(CROSSTALK)

CLINTON: ...and they sell products all the time that cause harm...

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: So lets say this. Lets say this.

CLINTON: ... and theyre held responsible.

COOPER: Senator Sanders.

SANDERS: If I understand  and  you know, as I understand it, what youre really talking about is not what Secretary Clinton is responding to.

As I understand it  and maybe Im wrong on this, but what you were essentially saying, and what people are saying, is that, if somebody who is crazy or a criminal or a horrible person goes around shooting people, the manufacturer of that gun should be held liable.

And if that is your position, then what you are saying, essentially  if that is the case, as I understand it  its not what Secretary Clinton is talking about. I agree with what she said.

But if that is the case, then essentially, your position is there should not be any guns in America, period.

(CROSSTALK)

CLINTON: That is like the NRA position. No.

SANDERS: Can I  can I finish, please? All right?

And you can  there are people who hold that view. And thats fine, if you hold it. I think what you do is you hold those people who have used the gun accountable. You try to make...

COOPER: Were gonna move on.

SANDERS: ... guns as safe as possible, but I would disagree on that.

COOPER: Were gonna move on. Dawn (ph)...

CLINTON: Anderson, I just want to finish, because this  I know some of the parents from Sandy Hook. I want people in this audience to think about what it must feel like to send off your first grader, little backpack, maybe, on his or her back, and then the next thing you hear is that somebody has come to that school using an automatic weapon, an AR-15, and murdered those children.

Now, they are trying to prevent that from happening to any other family.

SANDERS: Hold...

CLINTON: And the best way to do that is to go right at the people...

COOPER: Senator Sanders...

CLINTON: ... you talk about corporate greed?

SANDERS: Hold it.

CLINTON: The gun manufacturers sell guns to make as much money as they can make.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Senator Sanders.

SANDERS: You know, I think it is a little bit  it is a little bit  look, what happened at Sandy Hook, what happened in Michigan, what has happened far too often all over this country is a terrible, terrible tragedy, and we have got to do everything we can, as I mentioned a moment ago, to end these mass killings.

But, as I understand what your question is  and, youre not the only person whose heart was broken. I know, I was there in the Senate when we learned about this killing. It is almost unspeakable to talk about some lunatic walking into a  I mean; it is hard to even talk about it.

We all feel that way. But it, as I understand it, Anderson, and maybe Im wrong, what youre really talking about is people saying lets end gun manufacturing in America. Thats the implications of that, and I dont agree with that.

COOPER: Were going to move on. Don Lemon?

LEMON: Alright, thank you very much, Anderson.

As a black man in America, if I were born today Id have a one in three chance of ending up in prison in my life. Secretary Clinton, on the campaign trail, you are calling for an end to the era of mass incarceration, but a lot of folks in the black community blame the 1994 Crime Bill, a bill you supported for locking up a generation of black men.

Given whats happened since 1994, why should black people trust you to get it right this time?

CLINTON: Well, Dont, let me say this, Senator Sanders voted for that bill, we both supported it. And, I think its fair to say we did because back then there was an outcry over the rising crime rate, and people from all communities were asking that action be taken.

Now, my husband said at the NAACP last summer that it solved some problems, but it created other problems, and I agree. And, one of those problems was, unfortunately, a move to expand the reasons why people would be incarcerated, not just at the federal level which is what this bill about, but in states and localities as well. And, thats why the very first speech that I gave in this campaign was about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration because I believe absolutely that too many families were broken up, too many communities were adversely affected. So, weve got to do a bunch of things.

On the criminal justice side, look, weve got to have better policing. That means body cameras, that means ending profiling, that means doing everything we can to make sure theres respect between the community and the police.

And, when it comes to incarceration...

LEMON: But, Secretary...

CLINTON: ... That means we have to limit mandatory minimums, we have to end disparities and treatment at last through (ph) incarceration...

LEMON: The question is why should black people trust you this time to get it right? Thats the question.

CLINTON: Well, Senator Sanders voted for it as well. Are you going to ask him the same question?

SANDERS: Probably will.

LEMON: Do you think your support  your husband has said that this bill was a mistake. Do you think it was a mistake?

CLINTON: I just said that. He said at the NAACP that there were some aspects that worked well. The violence against women provisions have worked well, for example. But, other aspects of it were a mistake and I agree. Thats why Im focused, and have a very comprehensive approach toward fixing the criminal justice system, going after systemic racism that stalks the criminal justice system, ending private prisons, ending the incarceration of low-level offenders, and I am committed to doing that.

(APPLAUSE)

LEMON: And, Senator Sanders, before you respond, I want to ask you this. Back in 1994, heres what you warned, we are dooming tens of millions of young people to a future of bitterness, mystery, hopelessness, drugs, crime, and violence, but you voted for the bill anyway. Was your vote a mistake?

SANDERS: You know, as I think Secretary Clinton knows, as we all know, there are bills in congress that have bad stuff, there are bills in congress that have good stuff. Good stuff and bad stuff in the same bill.

Now, if I have voted against that bill, Secretary Clinton would be here tonight and shed say, Bernie Sanders voted against the ban on assault weapons. Bernie Sanders voted against the violence against women act. Those were provisions in the bill, as the Secretary just indicated. So, in that bill there was some good provisions, I have been a fierce fighter against domestic violence ever since I was mayor in Burlington.

Violence against women act has protected millions of women in this country, it was in that bill. The ban on assault weapons, thats what I have fought for my whole life. It was in that bill.

Now, what you are reading though is I went to the floor, as I recall, and thats what I said. I tried to get the death penalty aspects in that bill out. Secretary Clinton have a disagreement. I was then, and I am now opposed to the death penalty.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: So, to answer your question, what you read was a congressman who was torn, who said there are good things in that bill, there are bad things overall. I voted for it.

But where we are right now is having more than 2.2 million people in jail  more than any other country on earth. This is a campaign promise, at the end of my first term, we will not have more people in jail than any other country.

COOPER: Thank you very much. I want to go to David Mcghee. David Mcghee runs a youth development program director and he is undecided, but his question is for Senator Sanders. David?

QUESTION: We live in a diverse nation. Opportunities to lead however to be frank, are often at the feet at older Caucasian men and women.

SANDERS: You are not talking about me, are you?

(LAUGHTER)

QUESTION: Men more so than women. However, what experiences do you have that have helped you deeply understand the mind sets and values of other cultures?

SANDERS: Well, I think the best answer  I dont know that I can give you a definitive answer here, but I will give you this answer. When I was a young man at the University of Chicago, I worked with fellow black and white students trying to desegregate the University of Chicago owned housing. Most candidates for president, dont put this on their resume, but I was arrested by the Chicago police for trying to desegregate the Chicago school system.

(APPLAUSE)

In 1963, and an important day for me, I went to the march on Washington led by Dr. King for jobs and freedom. Dr. King has been an important inspiration for me. In this campaign, if you go to berniesanders.com and read our position on criminal justice, it is I believe the strongest position of any candidate. What it says among other things, 51 percent of African-American kids today are unemployed  you know were going to do? Were going to provide education and jobs for those kids, not jails or incarceration. COOPER: In a speech about policing, the FBI director borrowed a phrase from Avenue Q saying, everybody is a little racist. So on a personal front, what racial blind spots do you have?

CLINTON: Let me go answer Mr. Mcghees question because I think its a profound one.

I think the most important that happened to me was a combination of my church and youth minister when I was a teenager, insisting that we go in to inner-city Chicago because I lived in a suburb and have exchanges with kids in black and hispanic churches. It was also important for me to be a baby-sitter for the children of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives, and to hear Dr. King speak in Chicago when I was about 14 years old. That got me thinking about what I needed to do to try to fulfill my faith.

When I was in law school, I had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman, named Mary Right Adelman, who worked with Dr. King who was the first African-American woman who passed the Mississippi bar. I asked her for a job and she said she didnt have any money. I was working my way through law school and she said if I could get a job and get myself paid, she would give me a job. So I got law students a Civil Rights Research Council Grant.

The first thing she did was send me to look at South Carolina, to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails. The second thing she did was to send me to Alabama to investigate segregated academies. So from that moment until today, I am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the Childrens Defense Fund which have given me some insight and have lit a fire inside me to do everything I can to address systemic racism.

LEMON: I want to ask both of you this question. I appreciate you responding to that question, but I want to ask both of you again. In a speech about policing, the FBI director James Comey borrowed a phrase saying, everyone is a little bit racist. What racial blind spot do you have? Secretary, you first.

CLINTON: Well, Don, if I could, I think being a white person in the United States of America, I know that I have never had the experience that so many people, the people in this audience have had. And I think its incumbent upon me and what I have been trying to talk about during this campaign is to urge white people to think about what it is like to have the talk with your kids, scared that your sons or daughters, even, could get in trouble for no good reason whatsoever like Sandra Bland and end up dead in a jail in Texas.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: And I have spent a lot of time with the mothers of African-American children who have lost them, Trayvon Martins mother. And Ive gotten to know them. Ive listened to them. And it has been incredibly humbling because I cant pretend to have the experience that you have had and others have had. But I will do everything that I possibly can to not only do the best to understand and to empathize, but to tear down the barriers of systemic racism that are in the criminal justice system, in the employment system, in the education and health care system.

That is what I will try to do to deal with what I know is the racism that still stalks our country.

(APPLAUSE)

LEMON: Thank you, Secretary.

Senator Sanders, on a personal front, what racial blind spots do you have?

SANDERS: Well, let me just very briefly tell you a story. When I was in one of my first years in Congress, I went to a meeting downtown in Washington, D.C. And I went there with another congressman, an African-American congressman. And then we kind of separated during the meeting. And then I saw him out later on. And he was sitting there waiting and I said, well, lets go out and get a cab. How come you didnt go out and get a cab?

He said, no, I dont get cabs in Washington, D.C. This was 20 years ago. Because he was humiliated by the fact that cabdrivers would go past him because he was black. I couldnt believe, you know, you just sit there and you say, this man did not take a cab 20 years ago in Washington, D.C. Tell you another story, I was with young people active in the Black Lives Matter movement. A young lady comes up to me and she says, you dont understand what police do in certain black communities. You dont understand the degree to which we are terrorized, and Im not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and weve got to hold police officers accountable, Im just talking about every day activities where police officers are bullying people.

So to answer your question, I would say, and I think its similar to what the secretary said, when youre white, you dont know what its like to be living in a ghetto. You dont know what its like to be poor. You dont know what its like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car.

And I believe that as a nation in the year 2016, we must be firm in making it clear. We will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal justice system.

(APPLAUSE)

LEMON: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Senator Sanders, a CNN poll found that 64 percent of Americans felt like race relations got worse over the last decade. You have said they would absolutely be better under a Sanders presidency.

So how would you be more effective in tackling racial issues than President Barack Obama?

SANDERS: Its not a question of being better than President Obama, it is a question of building on the work that President Obama has done, the very important work.

(APPLAUSE)

LEMON: You said absolutely, though, in an answer.

SANDERS: No, well, he has given us a good, good basis and foundation. We have got to do better than that. And of course we should.

But heres what I would do. I would end  I would make sure that the Department of Justice investigated every killing of a citizen of this country when they are under apprehension from a police officer or when they are killed in police custody.

I would end the militarization of local police departments.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: I would develop model programs to make police departments look like the communities that they serve. I would end minimal sentencing and give judges more discretion. I would recognize that substance abuse and drug addiction is a health issue, not a criminal issue.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: And I would make sure that those people who left jail had the education and job training so they dont go back into the same environment which got them in jail in the first place.

(APPLAUSE)

LEMON: Senator, thank you very much.

Secretary Clinton, in 1996, you used the term super predators to describe some young kids. Some feel like it was racial code. Was it and were you wrong to use that term?

CLINTON: Well, I was speaking about drug cartels and criminal activity that was very concerning to folks across the country. I think it was a poor choice of words, I never used it before, I havent used it since, I would not use it again.

Because my whole life, to go back to what I was saying to Mr. Mcgee (ph), is, you know, really, ever since I went to work for the Childrens Defense Fund, is to try to figure out ways to even the odds for people that are left out and left behind.

And I know very well that we have too many kids in our country right now who are living in poverty, who are going to schools like the ones in Detroit that have mold and rodents in them. I saw that in South Carolina. Its unfortunately across America. So what we have got to do is provide more opportunities earlier in the lives of every child.

Thats why I believe in supporting families, early childhood education, universal pre-kindergarten, help kids be successful. And here is Flint, weve got to do more to mitigate against the effects of lead, because too many kids are having the experiences Ive been told about, where theyre falling back in school, where they are having headaches because of the lead exposure.

LEMON: Thank you.

CLINTON: So were going to have to do even more here than we would do in most other counties.

LEMON: Were going to talk about education in just a moment.

SANDERS: But can I respond to that briefly?

COOPER: Were...

SANDERS: Just in this. I am not sure which legislation that was. But I think it may have been the Welfare Reform, so-called...

CLINTON: No, it was the crime bill.

SANDERS: Oh, it was the crime bill.

CLINTON: Crime bill.

SANDERS: But during that same period, 96. There was a bill called  so-called, it had a long title to it, Welfare Reform Bill. And this bill really was a bill that scapegoated the poorest people in this country. I strongly opposed that legislation. Secretary Clinton had a different position then.

And what that legislation ended up doing is increasing extreme poverty, the poorest people in this country have become much poorer as a result of that  really a bill that was written by Republicans. Bad bill.

LEMON: Thank you. Secretary Clinton, you were in, so 30 seconds.

CLINTON: Well, once again, if were going to argue about the 90s, lets try to get the facts straight. That bill had a lot of provisions that unfortunately were stripped out by George W. Bush, by Republican governors. And I disagreed with the way it was applied. And I have a very clear set of ideas about what should be done to try to provide more support, including trying to cut poverty in half in the next years.

But if we are going to talk about the 90s, lets talk about 23 million new jobs, incomes went up for everybody. The median African- American income went up 33 percent at the end of the 90s and we lifted more people out of poverty than at any other time in recent history.

So we were on the right path. More jobs, rising incomes.

LEMON: Senator Sanders.

CLINTON: Along came George W. Bush and trickle down economics and brought us the Great Recession, which thank goodness President Obama has been digging us out of ever since.

LEMON: Senator Sanders.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Secretary Clinton is right. In the 1990s, we created a whole lot of jobs. Good. And I supported many of your husbands initiatives. But in the 1990s, you know what we also did? We deregulated Wall Street, which allowed Wall Street to end up destroying our economy.

(APPLAUSE)

We passed NAFTA and other disastrous trade agreements which had a horrendous impact on African-Americans in particular, in Flint, in Detroit and all across this country. So when we talk about the 90s, youre right. A lot of good things happened, but a lot of bad things happened.

LEMON: Thank you Senator.

SANDERS: I voted against those trade agreements.

LEMON: Thank you Senator.

SANDERS: And I voted against Wall Street deregulation.

COOPER: Thank you Senator. We have to take a short break. The Democratic presidential discussion and debate continues here from Flint in just a moment.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

COOPER: And welcome back. Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate, here live in Flint, Michigan. Lets  lets move on to the subject of education.

In nearby Detroit, the public schools have become a national symbol of neglect and failure. That school system is $3.5 billion in debt. Officials say they could run out of money by April.

I want to bring in Shoniqua Kemp. Shes right here  Ms. Kemp. Her 14-year-old daughter Imani is a student in Detroit. Shoniqua is one of ten parents suing Detroit public schools  not for money, she says, but to improve conditions.

She says shes currently leaning towards Senator Sanders. Her question will go to both of you, but well start with Senator Sanders. Ms. Kemp?

QUESTION: Thank you. Speaking of opportunities for success, in Detroit, schools open and close with no accountability to  or transparency to the communities that it  they service.

Not only that  in our schools, as youve stated, we have issues with rats, mold, no working water fountains, not to mention non- certified teachers, lack of accountability around transportation and special education, and so much more.

QUESTION:

With that said, our students can no longer suffer due to lack of these things, or having these dilapidated issues take place. So, my question is whos going to step up? Whos going to ensure that the policies procedures are put in place that will ensure, and bring forth a successful future for our students because my daughter cannot wait eight more years for success to take place at your hands. At the leaders hands.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, lets start with you.

SANDERS: Well, thank you very much for not being resigned to that horrendous situation, but being prepared to stand up and fight back...

QUESTION: ... Thank you...

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: ... Thats what we need all over this country.

And, let me be very honest with you, hard thing to say, but it is true. A great nation is judged not by how many millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how it treats the most vulnerable amongst us, and that is the children, and that is the elderly. And, do you know what?

We should be ashamed of how we treat our kids and our senior citizens.

QUESTION: Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: We have a Republican leadership in congress now fighting for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the top two-tenths of one percent, but somehow we cant come up with the money to fix Detroits crumbling public school system. Somehow we cannot make sure that Detroit has qualified, and good teachers.

Somehow we cant make sure that there are summer programs for your children, and after school programs for your children. Somehow we cannot do what other countries around the world, is provide quality childcare and pre-K. We have got to change our national priorities, no more tax breaks for billionaires, and large corporations.

We are going to invest in our children, and have the best public school system in the world.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, before we go to Secretary Clinton  Senator Sanders, let me just follow up with you. As president, you have to decide where to spend your political capital. Theres a lot of things you want to do, where does fixing Mrs. Kims daughters school and other schools, where does that lay in your list of things to do...

SANDERS: ... Anderson, not only do we have a crumbling school system in Detroit, and in many other areas, we have  and everybody in this room should be embarrassed by this, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth. That is a disgrace.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: So, when you ask me about my priorities, my priorities are that no, were not going to give tax breaks to the wealthy. Were going to ask them to start paying their fair share of taxes so we can raise the money to make sure that every child in this country, in Detroit, in Vermont, gets the quality education that he or she deserves.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: Mrs. Kim (ph), here is what I would do as president. Number one, I would reinstate a program we did have during the 1990s where the federal government provided funding to repair and modernize public schools because a lot of communities cant afford to do that on their own.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Secondly, I would use every legal means at my disposal to try to force the Governor and the state to return the schools to the people of Detroit  to end the emergency management...

(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)

CLINTON: ... which, I believe, if you look at the data, the situation has only gotten worse with these emergency managers that have put the system further in debt.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Number three, I want to set-up inside the Department of Education, for want of a better term, kind of an education SWAT team, if you will. Where weve got qualified people, teachers, principals, maybe folks who are retired, maybe folks who are active, but all of whom are willing to come and help. When Detroit gets back their schools, they should have all the help they can get to be able to get teachers in the classroom, to be able to find spaces while schools are being repaired. And, I also would look at how we could through the federal government support more teachers because were going to have a teacher shortage in some of the hardest to teach districts...

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: ... (inaudible)

CLINTON: ... including Detroit.

COOPER: Let me just follow up with the Secretary and then Ill come back to you.

Secretary Clinton, youve been endorsed by two of the biggest teachers unions. Theres an awful lot of great teachers in this country. Its an incredibly difficult job, one of the most difficult jobs there is but union rules often make it impossible fire bad teachers and that means disadvantaged kids are sometimes taught by the least qualified. Do you think unions protect bad teachers?

CLINTON: You know, I am proud to have been endorsed by the AFT and the NEA, and Ive had very good relationship with both unions, with their leadership. And weve really candid conversations because we are going to have to take a look at  what do we need in the 21st century to really involve families, to help kids who have more problems than just academic problems?

A lot of what has happened and honestly it really pains me, a lot of people have blaming and scape-goating teachers because they dont want to put the money into the schools system that deserve the support that comes from the government doing its job.

COOPER: So just to follow up, you dont believe unions protect bad teachers?

CLINTON: You know what  I have told my friends at the top of both unions, weve got take a look at this because it is one of the most common criticisms. We need to eliminate the criticism.

You know, teachers do so much good, they are often working under most difficult circumstances. So anything that could be changed, I want them to look at it. I will be a good partner to make sure that whatever I can do as president, I will do to support the teachers of our country.

COOPER: Senator Sanders?

SANDERS: What our campaign is about, is asking people to think big not small. And when we think big and we talk about education, weve got to ask ourselves a simple question, how is it  starting at college that hundreds of thousands of bright young people are today, unable to go to college because they cant afford it? How is it that maybe your kid  and when I was growing up, we didnt have any money  were not even dreaming about going to college because they knew it was another world.

So starting with the top, now I know some people think its a radical idea, I dont. I believe that every public college and university in this country should be tuition free.

(APPLAUSE)

So that your child regardless of the income of your family knows that if shes studies hard, she is going to be able to go to college. And you know what else we do? We invest in child care. Right now, youve got child-care workers making McDonalds wages, that is crazy.

COOPER: Thank you Senator.

SANDERS: I want well trained, well paid, child care workers to give our youngest kids advance opportunities.

COOPER: I want to go over to my colleague, Don Lemon.

LEMON: Anderson, thank you very much.

Secretary, I want to turn now from the state of our nations school to the state of our nations crumbling infrastructure, which you talked a little bit about in the beginning of this debate. But beyond the Detroit schools and Flint water crisis; pipes, roads, and bridges are in need of repair. It would take trillions of dollars to fix it all. Senator Sanders has proposed a one trillion dollar plan but yours is only a quarter of that, is your plan big enough to fix the crumbling infrastructure in this country?

CLINTON: Well, theres no doubt, we have an enormous backlog of infrastructure repairs. Heres what Id do  the congress finally got around to pass the Highway Transportation Bill, which should never have been partisan  it turned into be one partisan argument. I want to go further.

I want to put 250 billion dollars additional, on top of what Congress has done. That gets us to a half a billion. I want to start a National Infrastructure Bank. I want to capitalize it with 25 billion that I believe will leverage 10 times that, thats another 250 billion.

So Im trying to do this in a way that will gain support and be affordable but theres no doubt, we have to do more on our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports. And as weve talked in the beginning here, under our ground, our water systems, our sewer systems. We have pipelines that are leaking and that are dangerous. We have so much work to be done and if we can put millions of peoples to work, I think my plan is a very good way to begin doing that work and get people out there doing it.

LEMON: Thank you, Secretary. Senator Sanders, critics of the proposal say its yet another example of a costly plan that will never get through Congress and cant be paid for. The best deal is what the Secretary just mentioned, the deal President Obama could negotiate with Republicans, is a $305 billion dollar highway bill. If he couldnt do more, how can you?

SANDERS: Well, lets begin by discussing the problem. As youve indicated, the American Society of Civil Engineers say we need trillions of dollars  trillions of dollars  just to bring up our infrastructure to deal with  water systems like Flint, just to bring them up to decent levels.

We have suggested a trillion-dollar investment. Now, you know how were gonna pay for that? Ill tell you how were gonna pay for that. Right now, this country is losing $100 billion every single year because profitable corporations are stashing their profits in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and in other tax havens...

(APPLAUSE)

... and in some cases, not paying five cents in federal income tax. I will eliminate that outrageous loophole, and we will raise $1 trillion. And by the way, not only do we rebuild our crumbling infrastructure  $1 trillion over five years creates 13 million decent-paying jobs.

COOPER: Thank you  thank you, Senator Sanders.

(APPLAUSE)

The issue of climate change has been a major talking point for both of you. I wanted to bring in Sarah Bellaire, shes a student at the University of Michigan at Dearborn who says shes currently undecided.

Ms. Bellaire has a question on fracking, which, for viewers, is a process of oil and gas drilling thats led to a significant increase in American energy production and jobs, but also raises serious environmental concerns.

Sarah, your question is for Secretary Clinton, but youll both be able to weigh in. Sarah?

QUESTION: Fracking can lead to environmental pollution including, but not limited to, the contamination of water supply. Do you support fracking?

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: You know, I dont support it when any locality or any state is against it, number one. I dont support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I dont support it  number three  unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using.

So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place. And I think thats the best approach, because right now, there places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated.

So first, weve got to regulate everything that is currently underway, and we have to have a system in place that prevents further fracking unless conditions like the ones that I just mentioned are met.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, you...

SANDERS: My answer  my answer is a lot shorter. No, I do not support fracking.

(APPLAUSE)

And by the way  by the way, Anderson, Im glad you raised the issue of climate change, because the media doesnt talk enough about what the scientists are telling us, and that is, if we dont get our act together...

(APPLAUSE)

... the planet that were gonna leave our children may not be healthy and habitable. I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the Senate, which, among other things, calls for a tax on carbon, massive investments...

(APPLAUSE)

... in energy efficiency, wind, solar and other sustainable energy.

COOPER: Senator...

SANDERS: This is a crisis we have got to deal with now.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, though...

(APPLAUSE)

... to Secretary Clintons point, there are a number of Democratic governors in many states who say that fracking can be done safely, and that its helping their economies. Are they wrong?

SANDERS: Yes.

(APPLAUSE)

You know  you know, one of the differences  look, Secretary Clinton  and Ive said this before, and I admit it  she has the support of all the governors  Democratic  all the Senators, all the Congressmen. I dont. I am not part of that establishment. I plead guilty.

(APPLAUSE)

I happen to be a member of the Environmental Committee. I have talked to scientists all over the world. And what they are telling me  if we dont get our act together, this planet could be 5 to 10 degrees warmer by the end of this century  cataclysmic problems for this planet.

This is a national crisis. And I talk to scientists who tell me that fracking is doing terrible things to water systems all over this country. We have gotta be bold now. We gotta transform our energy system to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. Weve gotta do it yesterday.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, before we come to you...

CLINTON: Yeah. Yeah.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clintons gonna be able to respond. But, Senator Sanders, youve been very tough lately. Last week, you said this about Secretary Clinton.

Quote, just as I believe you cant take on Wall Street while taking their money, I dont believe you can take on climate change effectively while taking money from those who would profit off the destruction of the planet.

Are you suggesting that shes in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry?

SANDERS: No, what I am suggesting is that we have a corrupt campaign finance system. And instead of standing up to that finance system...

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: And instead of standing up to that finance system, Secretary Clinton has super PAC, which is raising huge amounts  well, I hate to say the word huge, every time I say huge it...

(LAUGHTER)

SANDERS: A lot of money from Wall Street and from the fossil fuel industry. I am doing it a different way. I have 5 million individual contributors who have gone to BernieSanders.com to make a $27 contribution. I dont take money from the fossil fuel industry.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Thank you, Senator.

Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I think I have the most comprehensive plan to combat climate change. It sets some very big goals, a half billion more solar panels deployed by the end of my first term, if Im so fortunate to be president. And enough clean energy to power every home by the end of my second term.

What I am looking at is how we make the transition from where we are today to where are today to where we must be. I worked with President Obama during the four years I was secretary of state to begin to put pressure on China and India and other countries to join with us to have a global agreement which we finally got in Paris.

So I am committed to and focused on how we make that transition. Ive already said we are taking away the subsidies for oil and gas, but it is important that people understand that a president cant go ordering folks around. Our system doesnt permit that. I am going to set the goals. I will push everybody as hard as I can to achieve those goals. We will make progress on clean renewable energy and create millions of jobs through that.

(APPLAUSE) COOPER: Senator Sanders, on the  on the campaign trail, Senator Sanders often refers to a fundraiser in January that was hosted by executives from a firm that has invested significantly in domestic fracking. Do you have any comment on that?

CLINTON: I dont have any comment. I dont know that. I dont believe that there is any reason to be concerned about it. I admire what Senator Sanders has accomplished in his campaign. I have more than 850,000 donors, most of them give less than $100. I am very proud of that.

And I just want to make one point. You know, we have our differences. And we get into vigorous debate about issues, but compare the substance of this debate with what you saw on the Republican stage last week.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Senator Sanders.

SANDERS: Well, let me make a couple of responses. Let me pick up on the last point the secretary made. You know, we are, if elected president, going to invest a lot of money into mental health. And when you watch these Republican debates, you know why we need to invest in that.

(LAUGHTER)

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: But heres the difference. Here is the difference. Its not a personal difference. We just do things differently. All right. I honestly  look, we have a corrupt campaign finance system. And what Secretary Clinton is saying and what every candidate who receives from the fossil fuel industry or the drug companies or Wall Street say, not going to impact me.

The question the American people have to ask is, why are these people putting millions of dollars into candidates if its not going to make a difference?

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Thank you, Senator.

SANDERS: And that is why, by the way, that is why one of my top priorities, if elected president will be to overturn this outrageous Citizens United Supreme Court (INAUDIBLE).

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Thank you very much, Senator.

CLINTON: And...

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, no, we have to go.

CLINTON: And that is one of the many reasons we must all support President Obamas right to nominate a successor to Justice Scalia and demand that the Senate hold hearings and a vote on that successor because there are so many issues at stake. On the first day of my campaign, I said, we are going to reverse Citizens United. And if we cant get it done through the court, I will lead a constitutional amendment effort to reverse it that way.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: More questions coming up. Much more of the Democratic presidential debate here in Flint right after this.

(APPLAUSE)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

COOPER: Welcome back to the CNN Democratic Presidential Debate. Thanks very much for joining us.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, I want to ask you about something you talked about this morning. You said this morning, about your emails, that you expect the investigation to be wrapped up soon. The Republican front-runner, Donald Trump says, hes going to talk about your emails every single day if he is the nominee and out on the campaign trail.

Democrats want to know, your supporters want to know, if youre the nominee, how are you going to take him on?

CLINTON: Well, let me start by saying that the last time I checked as of last night, Donald Trump had received 3.6 million votes, which is a good number. And there is only one candidate in either party who has more votes than him and thats me.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: And, I am building a broad, diverse coalition across our country. Im very excited by the support were receiving. I have said, and Ill repeat here, I think that Donald Trumps bigotry, his bullying, his bluster, are not going to wear (oh) well on the American people.

(APPLAUSE)

So, I will look forward to engaging him because, you know, I dont think we need to make America great again. America didnt stop being great, we have to make it whole again. We have to knock down the barriers, we have to end the divisiveness, we have to unify the country.

And, if Im fortunate enough to be the nominee thats exactly what I will do.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, I want to ask you basically the same question. Hes called you a communist, how are you going to...

SANDERS: ... That was one of the nice things that he said about me.

(LAUGHTER)

SANDERS: Ill tell you something, this is my right arm. Im prepared to give  no, I shouldnt say that. I would love to run against Donald Trump, and Ill tell you why.

For a start, but almost  not all, but almost every poll has shown that Sanders versus Trump does a lot better than Clinton versus Trump.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Right here in Michigan there was a poll done, I think yesterday, or today, had me beating Trump in Michigan by 22 points.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Secretary Clinton beat him as well, but not by so much. And, thats true nationally, and in many other states. And, the other reason I think we can beat Trump is that our campaign is generating an enormous amount of excitement. Just in the last two days we have won the caucuses in Maine, we won that tonight with a very large turnout.

(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)

SANDERS: We won Nebraska, we won Kansas, and Kansas was the biggest turnout in their caucus history.

I think we are exciting working class people, young people who are prepared to stand up and demand that we have a government that represents all of us.

COOPER: Thank you.

SANDERS: And not just the few.

COOPER: Thank you. I want to  we have a question from Denise Ghattas, she grew up here in Flint, Michigan. She says shes undecided on a candidate, shes got a question for  actually shes got two questions. The first one if for Senator Sanders, then shell ask another question to Secretary Clinton. Denise?

QUESTION: Thank you. Senator Sanders, do you believe that God is relevant, why or why not?

SANDERS: Well, I think  well, the answer is yes, and I think when we talk about God whether it is Christianity, or Judaism, or Islam, or Buddhism, what we are talking about is what all religions hold dear. And, that is to do unto others as you would like them to do unto you.

(APPLAUSE)

I am here tonight, and Im running for president. Im a United States Senator from my great state of Vermont because I believe that, because I believe morally and ethically we do not have a right to turn our backs on children in Flint, Michigan who are being poisoned, or veterans who are sleeping out on the street.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: What I believe as the father of seven beautiful grandchildren, I want you to worry about my grandchildren, and I promise you I will worry about your family. We are in this together.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Senator Sanders, let me just follow up. Just this weekend there was an article I read in the Detroit News saying that you keep your Judaism in the background, and thats disappointing some Jewish leaders. Is that intentional?

SANDERS: No. I am very proud to be Jewish, and being Jewish is so much of what I am.

Look, my fathers family was wiped out by Hitler in the Holocaust. I know about what crazy and radical, and extremist politics mean. I learned that lesson as a tiny, tiny child when my mother would take me shopping, and we would see people working in stores who had numbers on their arms because they were in Hitlers concentration camp.

I am very proud of being Jewish, and that is an essential part of who I am as a human being.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Denise has a question for Secretary Clinton. Denise

QUESTION: Yes. Secretary Clinton, during our church services, we pray for the president of the United States, we pray for the armed forces, we pray for all civil authorities, three times during our liturgy. And we give thanks to them. We pray for our loved ones. We pray for our enemies. To whom and for whom do you pray?

CLINTON: Well, I have been several times in your services and have joined in those prayers and have also been privileged to lead them in some settings. I pray very specifically for people whom I know by name. People who either have gone through or are experiencing difficult times, illness, divorce, death, disappointment, all of the life experiences that confront most of us.

I pray for the will of God to be known that we can know it and to the best of our limited ability, try to follow it and fulfill it. I have said many times that, you know, I am a praying person, and if I havent been during the time I was in the White House, I would have become one. Because its very hard to imagine living under that kind of pressure without being able to fall back on prayer and on my faith.

So I do pray for people in authority. I try to think about what they are going through, even when I disagree with them. Trying to find some common ground, some common understanding that perhaps can make me more empathetic. I dont always succeed. I will tell you that.

So I pray on a pretty regular basis during the day, because I need that strength and I need that support. And especially when you are in the position that Im in and that Senator Sanders is in, where you are asking people to vote for you, to give you the most important job, not only in our country, but I would argue in the world.

I think humility is one of the most important attributes that you bring to both that seeking and then if youre fortunate enough, to that holding of office and thats what I will try to do.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Thank you, secretary. Its time for closing statements. Youll each have one minute for a closing statement. Senator Sanders, we begin with you. SANDERS: My father came to this country at the age of 17 without any money. Never made any money. We lived in a three and half room rent-controlled apartment. So I learned about economics, not just in college, but in living in a family that didnt have money that had to scrape by. We are here tonight in Flint, Michigan, because a horrendous tragedy is taking place.

But its not just in Flint, Michigan. We are have 29 million people who have no health insurance. Were the only major country on earth that doesnt provide paid family and medical leave. We have school systems around America that are collapsing. And yet we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. But most people dont know that because almost all of the new incoming wealth is going to the top one percent.

I believe, and with all due respect to my good friend, Secretary Clinton, that it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. It is too late for a corrupt campaign finance system and super-PACs that raise enormous amounts of money from special interests.

We need in this country a political revolution where ordinary people stand up and reclaim the government that men and women fought and died for. Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Thank you, Senator.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: Well, Im running for president to do my very best to knock down every barrier that stands in the way of America realizing its potential and every American having a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. We have a lot of work to do. We have economic barriers. Thats why Ive laid out plans for more good jobs with rising incomes. We have barriers that stand in the way of quality health care. Thats why I will build on the Affordable Care Act.

We have barriers to education. Thats why I want to start early and provide debt-free tuition, and deal with student debt so it is no longer the burden that weighs down so many young Americans. And I do want to take on the barriers of systemic racism. I may not have experienced them, but I see the results every single day.

So Im asking for your support in the primary here in Michigan on Tuesday. Im asking for it, and I will do whatever I can as the Democratic nominee to run a campaign youll be proud of.

I dont intend to get into the gutter with whoever they nominate, but instead to lift our sights, to set big goals, to make it clear that Americas best days can be and are ahead of us.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: I want to thank both the candidates. While weve been debating tonight, CNN has learned that a labor union fund has committed $25 million in low-interest loans to help replace lead- contaminated pipes.

I want to thank the candidates, the Democratic National Committee...

(APPLAUSE)

Jason Soll of Silicon Valley based Cape Productions says the future of capturing the perfect digital memory is with flying robots. (SOUNDBITE) (English) JASON SOLL, CEO OF CAPE PRODUCTIONS, SAYING: ""So the first time I saw a video shot with drones I knew this was the future of being able to capture incredible experiences."" That incredible experience comes with a big problem, figuring out how to make it safe for semi-autonomous drones to fly in close proximity to humans on the side of a mountain. (SOUNDBITE) (English) JASON SOLL, CEO OF CAPE PRODUCTIONS, SAYING: ""We build out these safe cinematic flight paths that we call rails that are like virtual wires that travel down the run and that ensures that the drone maintains a proper distance from the ground, proper distance from obstacles like trees, chair lifts, power lines, but also ensures that we get the perfect shot every time."" Currently the company, which offers its drone video service at three ski resorts in North America with several more in the pipeline, has a perfect safety record and according to Soll, it's the only one certified to fly around humans by the Federal Aviation Administration. Currently a pilot ensures the drone stays on its flight path and captures the best video angles. But in the not too distant future with more accurate GPS technology just around the corner, these drones may be operating completely on their own in the not too distant future, tracking wearable technology attached to the wrist of their designated human. (SOUNDBITE) (English) JASON SOLL, CEO OF CAPE PRODUCTIONS, SAYING: ""So we are working on the next generation of the wearable and will only introduce it once it met the quality level that our pilots currently maintain out in the field.""

reuters.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,Do you suffer from Russophobia? The Kremlin thinks you might.,"['Posted Smarynakurskaya', 'Posted Paulharper', 'Lucian Kim Is A Berlin-based Journalist Who Has Covered The Ukraine Conflict For Slate Newsweek Buzzfeed He Previously Worked As A Correspondent For Bloomberg News In Moscow The Christian Science Monitor In Berlin', 'Posted No_apartheid', 'Posted Radfo', 'Posted Laster', 'Lucian Kim', ""Any Opinions Expressed Here Are The Author's Own"", 'Posted Danram', 'Posted Jundi']","If Russian officials are to be believed, the reason people worry about what Russia might do next is because they suffer from Russophobia, an irrational fear of all things Russian.

In February, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov assailed the fashion of Russophobia in certain capitals during a visit to Germany. Then Russias defense ministry accused General Philip Breedlove of Russophobia. The commander of U.S. forces in Europe had testified that the United States and its allies were deterring Russia now and preparing to fight and win if necessary following the Kremlins military adventures in Ukraine and Syria.

Russophobe has become a convenient label for anyone who disagrees with Russian President Vladimir Putins aggressive behavior at home and abroad. You are not criticizing an authoritarian leader and his erratic policies; you are instead attacking the Russian nation.

Russias state media churns out reports on how enemies are tirelessly seeking to isolate the country  when in fact it is Putins own actions that are closing off Russia.

When I first visited Moscow as a college student 25 years ago, the Soviet Union was in its last year of existence. Kremlin reformer Mikhail Gorbachev was opening up the country after more than seven decades of communism, and Russians were hungry to rejoin the world. Goodwill, curiosity and hope were the overriding feelings among Russians and Americans alike. My host parents in Moscow even displayed a picture of then-President George H.W. Bush in their living room.

The Cold War was finally over. I was fascinated by the parallel world that had existed behind the Iron Curtain and shocked by the deprivations that people endured. Later, as a journalist based in Moscow, I would encounter dozens of Russians who welcomed me into their homes and hearts. It helped, of course, that I tried my damnedest to speak Russian. But it never hurt to be American. Often it was an advantage.

My initial interest in Russia led me to explore other countries that had belonged to the Soviet empire: Ukraine, Poland, the Baltic states, the Central Asian republics. Although anti-Russian rhetoric has cheapened the political discourse in those places, the Russian language is still widely understood, if not actively used. Given their difficult history with Russia, eastern European countries viewed membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a prudent defensive measure. Putins surprise attack on Ukraine proved them right.

To me, the folly of Russophobia became most obvious in Ukraine. Most of my Ukrainian friends speak Russian as their first language, and many have parents or grandparents from Russia. They arent afraid of Russia but of its revanchist, autocratic government.

The crux of the problem between Russia and its former satellites is that nationalism was the driving force behind the independence movements that split apart the Soviet Union. Estonians, Lithuanians and Georgians knew who they were and what they wanted: their own countries.

But from Russians perspective, it looked like their neighbors were abandoning them. Russians never had to liberate themselves from the Soviet Union: They just woke up one day in its ideological ruins. Not surprisingly, Russian nationalism today ties together a jumble of monarchist, Orthodox Christian and communist strands.

The appeal of Russophobia isnt just based on resentment about the breakup of an empire. Its also rooted in the frustration that the Western model of governance proved a more attractive way of running a country.

Putin, now in his 17th year of ruling Russia, is preoccupied with regime survival. Thats one reason the Kremlin is working so hard to discredit liberal democracy as a system of government. Telling Russians to fear the West because the West hates Russia is a way of distracting the population from the deficiencies of one-man rule.

Ever since my first visit to Russia in 1991, Russians have asked me why I decided to learn their language and travel to their country. People were incredulous that an American without any Russian roots could be so interested in their country.

My answer was simple: the mellifluous Russian language, the richness of Russian literature, the vastness of the countrys geography and the diversity of its peoples. It was all about what Russians themselves call the Russian soul  a generosity of spirit and a knack for improvisation amid adversity.

In their bluster about a brave new Russky Mir (Russian world) to redeem the perceived humiliations of the past, Russias current rulers are putting their own insecurities on full display. In the process, they have squandered the countrys greatest resource, which isnt oil and gas but Russias enormous soft power.

Ironically, the biggest Russophobes inhabit Russias highest political offices. They are the people who believe the essentialist argument that the Russian people are too immature for real democracy and can only be ruled by a strong leader.

Russophobia isnt an international problem. Its a domestic one.",[]

reuters.com,2015-09-15 21:58:56+00:00,Schools that sue: Why more universities file patent lawsuits,['Reuters Editorial'],"During Apple's most recent annual tech-fest, the company unveiled new iPhone features in front of a packed arena in San Francisco. Some of its lawyers, meanwhile, are preparing for a different stage: A courtroom in Madison, Wisconsin.

There Apple will defend itself before a federal jury against allegations that it used technology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the iPhone's microprocessors without permission.

It is the latest court action to date over patents involving universities, now-familiar players in suing over intellectual property.

The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF), the university's licensing arm, sued Apple in federal court last year alleging that Apple infringed its 1998 patent for greatly improving chip efficiency with the A7 processor, found in devices such as the iPhone 5S and iPad Air.

Apple declined to comment. In court papers it denied infringing the patent and claimed it is invalid.

Apple's sheer size, deep pockets and willingness to adopt and buy technologies from other companies make it a prime target for infringement litigation by patent owners, including universities, and the iPhone is one of the most commonly accused products.

But other tech giants have also faced such allegations from universities. For example, WARF sued Intel Corp over the same patent in 2008. The case settled on the eve of trial. Boston University sued about 40 tech companies in 2013 alleging infringement of a professor's patented technology for producing blue light-emitting diodes. Most of the defendants in that case, including Apple and Sony Corp, have settled.

In one of the most high profile cases pitting a university against a tech company, Carnegie Mellon University successfully sued semiconductor maker Marvell Technology Group in federal court in Pittsburgh for infringing two hard disk drive patents. An appeals court in August said Marvell must pay at least $278 million in damages.

According to unpublished numbers compiled by University of Alberta professor Tania Bubela using data from patent analytics firm Lex Machina, educational institutions file between 45 and 50 patent-related suits each year in the U.S.

""Almost every major university has a lawsuit or two in process,"" said Calvin Chu, former licensing officer of Columbia University's tech transfer office, Columbia Technology Ventures.

The litigation has led to debate over the role of universities, which receive government money for research that often leads to patents.

Critics say some universities have become too aggressive in suing or demanding license royalties for their patents, behaviors that they say are more akin to so-called patent trolls - companies that make money solely by enforcing patents, rather than making products.

""The question is, will the universities maintain their positions as good stewards (of taxpayer money), or are they going to be drawn towards behaving more like trolls? I think we're at a turning point,"" said Robin Feldman, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of Law.

Universities, like any patent owner, say they must protect their intellectual property rights. And legal experts note they are sometimes contractually obligated, in a joint venture, for instance, to litigate over patents.

They are also not solely after the money like trolls are, said Jason Schwent, an attorney at Thompson Coburn in St. Louis, Missouri.

""They do want to keep the white hat in the process,"" he said. ""They can't be ruthless.""

Universities are increasingly licensing their technologies or partnering with companies to bring ideas to market, according to a recent survey by the Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM), the umbrella group for intellectual property officials for more than 300 universities and other research institutions.

Just like a lawsuit, however, licensing can be used to enforce a patent. This comes in the form of demands that another company pay for a license to a patent, based on a product it has on the market. These demands are often made under the threat of litigation.

Researchers are casting doubt as to whether this leads to innovation.

A new study by UC prof Feldman and Stanford Law School's Mark Lemley surveying 181 in-house company lawyers found that when a patent owner, whether a troll or a university, demanded the company take a license to its patents, it rarely led to new products or other kinds of innovation, such as joint ventures.

The study, to be published later this year in the Iowa Law Review, acknowledged that universities generate a large number of new inventions, and strike deals with companies better able to bring ideas to market. But in most cases, it is the technology that is being sold, often before a patent is granted or an application for one is even filed.

""The more recent university practice of suing or demanding licenses from existing companies appears much less likely to be driving innovation,"" the authors said.

Michael Horn, speaks at their media reception during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, January 10, 2016.

Michael Horn, President and CEO of Volkswagen America, reacts to being mobbed by the media after he apologized for the Volkswagen diesel scandal at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, United States in a November 18, 2015 file photo.

Michael Horn, President and CEO of Volkswagen America, introduces the new Beetle Dune at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, United States in a November 18, 2015 file photo.

WASHINGTON Volkswagen AG's top U.S. executive is stepping down nearly six months after the German automaker admitted to installing software to allow 580,000 diesel U.S. vehicles to emit excess emissions, the company said on Wednesday.

Michael Horn, who has been president and chief executive officer of Volkswagen Group of America since 2014, is leaving by mutual agreement ""to pursue other opportunities effective immediately,"" VW said.

Horn, 54, could not immediately be reached. A lawyer for Horn did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

The German automaker said on an interim basis, Hinrich J. Woebcken, a former BMW executive who ran global purchasing among other jobs, is filling Horn's job. In January, VW named Woebcken as head of VW's North American region, effective April 1.

Horn sent an email to employees thanking them for supporting him and for pulling together during the crisis.

Horn's departure comes as VW continues to negotiate with California, the Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency on possible fixes or buybacks for the diesel vehicles that emit up to 40 times legally allowable pollution. It faces a March 24 deadline to tell a federal judge whether it has an acceptable fix.

A top California official told state lawmakers Tuesday that VW may only be able to mount a partial fix and may have to pay to mitigate the harm caused by allowing vehicles to remain on the road.

Volkswagen faces an ongoing Justice Department criminal investigation. The Justice Department sued VW in January seeking up to $46 billion for violating environmental regulations and sent VW a civil subpoena under a bank fraud law.

Alan Brown, general manager of Hendrick Volkswagen in Frisco, Texas who is president of the National Volkswagen Dealer Advisory Council, praised Horn's tenure at VW and said he had talked to Horn over the last three days about his departure. Brown told Reuters Horn had been offered other jobs at Volkswagen outside the United States, but declined to take them.

Brown said it was critical VW maintain the strategy of growing U.S. volume and noted dealers have strongly supported the automaker through the crisis.

""We are not working out of gas stations any more,"" Brown said, noting VW's about U.S. 650 dealers have invested $1 billion over the last decade in facilities.

Brown is flying to Germany on Sunday and staying through Wednesday for meetings with VW executives in the aftermath of Horn's departure.

VW brand U.S. sales are down 14 percent this year after falling 5 percent last year. VW still faces a stop sale on all new diesel vehicles.

Brown said it was important VW stick with the business plan it approved to expand U.S. sales by quickly refreshing and redesigning vehicles.

U.S. VW dealers ""don't want a handout. They want a chance to win,"" Brown said. He said VW should scrap the idea of positioning itself as a ""near premium brand"" and return to its roots in the 1960s of selling mass market vehicles like the iconic Beetle.

Dennis Gaudet, a New Hampshire VW dealer, said Brown was ""probably the most popular (head) we've had as long as I've been a dealer"" and added he knew the American market ""better than most.""

During the initial response to the crisis, Horn was VW's public face in the United States, apologizing days after the scandal became public and testifying before Congress.

""Lets be clear about this: our company was dishonest  with the EPA and the California Air Resources Board  and with all of you. And in my German words: We totally screwed up. We must fix those cars,"" Horn said on Sept. 21.

In October, Horn told a U.S. House of Representatives panel that VWs supervisory board and top leadership did not intentionally order the cheating, but said it was the work of a few individuals.

Horn told Congress he had no knowledge of the cheating.

Horn joined VW in 1990 and held a series of jobs, including VW sales for Europe, before he became CEO based at VW's U.S. headquarters in Herndon, Virginia following the resignation of his predecessor, Jonathan Browning who abruptly resigned after VW brand sales fell in 2013. Sales fell despite an aggressive plan announced in 2008 by VW to triple sales in 10 years.

Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) said on Wednesday it would buy U.S. options exchange operator International Securities Exchange for $1.1 billion from Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1Gn.DE), the latest announcement in a spate of merger talks in the exchange space.

ISE operates three electronic options exchanges which together account for more than 15 percent of U.S. volume, while Nasdaq operates another three. Combined, Nasdaq would have market share of more than 40 percent, extending its lead as the No. 1 U.S. options exchange operator.

""The ability to further that lead gives us advantages as to how we could serve our customers because you have a different volume versus scale arrangement,"" Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq's chief executive officer, said in an interview.

The deal would also free up capital for Deutsche Boerse, which has said it plans to merge with the London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE.L) to create a European trading powerhouse that could better compete against U.S. rivals.

Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) said it may make a rival bid for the LSE, raising the prospects of a takeover battle.

Nasdaq, which plans to move ISE's trading platforms onto Nasdaq technology, said it could strip out $40 million from the two businesses through the transaction.

The deal will also give Nasdaq an additional 20 percent stake in the Options Clearing Corporation, for a total of 40 percent ownership in the world's largest equity derivatives clearing corporation.

Greifeld said he had been looking at buying ISE for years, but that talks with Deutsche Boerse CEO Carsten Kengeter picked up over the past three months.

The deal does not include ISE's stake in No. 2 U.S. stock exchange operator BATS Global Markets, or blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings, which will continue to be owned by Deutsche Boerse, the German company said.

Nasdaq said the transaction was expected to be finalized in the second half of the year, pending regulatory approval, and it would likely add to Nasdaq's earnings within 12 months of closing.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:11:20+00:00,Clinton's surprise Michigan loss exposes risks for her on trade,['Andy Sullivan'],"Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks to supporters about the primary voting results in Michigan and other states at her campaign rally in Cleveland, Ohio, March 8, 2016.

WASHINGTON Democrat Hillary Clinton's unexpected defeat in Michigan has laid bare growing voter anger over international trade, raising warning flags for her ahead of a possible presidential election showdown against Republican front-runner Donald Trump.

Trump has built his campaign on pledges to scrap international trade deals and do more to protect American workers from foreign competition, tapping the same groundswell of discontent that propelled Clinton's rival Bernie Sanders to victory in the Midwestern state on Tuesday.

Clinton remains heavily favored to win the Democratic nomination. But the setback in Michigan could signal further troubles in upcoming primaries in other Rust Belt states such as Ohio, forcing her further to the left on economic issues and possibly influencing her choice for an eventual running mate, strategists said.

The backlash against 20 years of trade liberalization has stalled the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), a sweeping Pacific trade deal backed by President Barack Obama and threatens to stymie the trade agenda for years to come.

""It's politically radioactive to support free trade right now,"" said Greg Valliere, a Washington analyst for Horizon Investments, a financial firm.

Clinton's troubles with her party's left wing -- and with white, working class voters more generally -- may steer her toward a trade skeptic such as Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio as a vice presidential running mate, said Democratic strategist Steve Jarding. Political pundits had expected Clinton to pick someone to increase her appeal to Hispanic or other minority voters, such as U.S. Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro.

Sanders, 74, is unlikely to end up as Clintons running mate, partly due to his age, Democrats said.

Both Sanders, a democratic socialist, and billionaire Trump have harnessed anti-trade sentiment in their insurgent White House bids, criticizing deals like NAFTA as job killers that have depressed the living standards of working Americans.

Exit polls from Michigan, a hub of the U.S. auto industry, show widespread voter skepticism on trade that may have helped Sanders and Trump win their respective party primaries.

""She made a fundamental mistake early on in this campaign to try to stay in the center,"" Democratic strategist Steve Jarding said of Clinton. ""This cycle, there is no center.""

NUANCED TRADE STANCE

Sanders campaigned heavily against foreign trade in a state that has been hammered by overseas competition since the 1980s. Some 58 percent of his supporters in Michigan exit polls said that trade takes away U.S. jobs, while a slight majority - 53 percent - of Clinton backers said trade creates U.S. jobs.

The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, estimates that Michigan would lose 5 percent of its jobs if TPP were to take effect, the highest proportion of any state.

Gary Hunley, a substitute teacher in Dearborn, Michigan, said he believed Clinton was partially to blame for stagnant wages because NAFTA was enacted under her husband Bill Clinton's presidency in the 1990s.

""She was not a passive first lady,"" Hunley said.

Clinton's stance on trade is more nuanced than Trump's and Sanders'. After NAFTA was enacted, she voted against a free-trade deal with Central America while serving as a U.S. senator in the following decade.

As Obama's secretary of state, Clinton helped negotiate the TPP with Japan, Vietnam and other Pacific Rim countries.

As a presidential candidate, Clinton has said after reading the final language of the deal she would vote against it because it does not adequately protect U.S. workers.

Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters Wednesday there were no plans to adjust her stance and that he would ""put Secretary Clinton up against any candidate in this race on trade,"" including Trump.

Despite backing by the Obama administration, Republican lawmakers and many business groups, Republican leaders in Congress have shown no sign that they will bring TPP up for a vote this year.

The Obama administration says the deal has high labor and environmental standards that were not part of NAFTA. ""Im not sure that has fully been absorbed in the public mindset,"" U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice told Reuters. [L1N16H1VJ]

The deal may fare no better under the next president. Sanders and Trump oppose TPP, and Senator Ted Cruz, who is in second place in the Republican contest, has said he would not vote for it this year.

""They've listened to the public and politicians have caught up with the public on this,"" Brown, the Ohio Democratic senator, told Reuters.

The evidence that the TPP would help the U.S. economy much is less than conclusive.

The Peter G. Peterson Institute, a pro-trade think tank, estimates that it would boost economic growth by just 0.5 percent after 15 years.

The deal would not boost employment overall, but would result in a ""churn"" of 53,700 jobs lost and created each year, and it would boost incomes by 0.5 percent, the institute found.

Another estimate by the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University found the trade deal would slow growth by 0.54 percent after 10 years and cost 448,000 jobs in the United States.

ANKARA/ISTANBUL Turkey's prime minister applied to parliament on Wednesday to lift the immunity of senior pro-Kurdish opposition deputies to prosecute them on charges of belonging to an armed terrorist group.

Such a step could further inflame tensions in the mainly Kurdish southeast which has been hit by the worst violence in two decades since a two-year Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) ceasefire collapsed in July.

President Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly called for Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) deputies to face prosecution, accusing them of being an extension of the PKK. Lawmakers in Turkey are normally protected from prosecution.

Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu's office filed a submission requesting immunity from prosecution be lifted from HDP co-leaders Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdag and deputies Selma Irmak, Sirri Sureyya Onder and Ertugrul Kurkcu, parliament officials told Reuters.

They deny the accusation of belonging to an armed terrorist organisation and provoking hatred.

""The attitudes of those who exploit 'podium immunity' and offend the shared conscience cannot be assessed within (the framework of) immunity,"" Davutoglu told reporters.

The Kurdish conflict in NATO Turkey has been further complicated by the activity of armed Kurdish groups across the border in Syria. Syrian Kurds have been a close ally of the United States in fighting Islamic State but Ankara regards them as a partner of the PKK and a terrorist grouping

Demirtas alone is the subject some 60 dossiers in parliament calling for the lifting of his immunity, including some related to calls for protest marches. As yet, there have been no moves in the assembly to open the way for his prosecution.

""FEELINGS OF REVENGE""?

""Erdogan is personally angry with us, especially me and a few other friends. He is...driven by feelings of revenge,"" Demirtas told reporters this week, attributing this to HDP election successes last year that chipped at the power of the AK Party Erdogan founded.

The HDP exceeded the threshold of 10 percent of votes to become the first party with Kurdish roots to enter parliament on its own in a general election in June.

Demirtas says he opposes violence and wants a negotiated end to a three-decade conflict with the PKK, deemed a terrorist organisation by the United States and the EU as well as Turkey, that has cost some 40,000 lives.

The latest requests were prepared in response to calls for Kurdish self-rule by the lawamkers at a congress last December. If the parliamentary commission backs lifting immunity, the request will be debated and a vote held, requiring a simple majority.

In 1994, at the height of the conflict, lawmakers had their immunity revoked after speaking Kurdish in parliament. Four MPs spent a decade in prison, sparking condemnation from Turkey's Western partners.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 20:58:33+00:00,Clinton calls for sanctions on Iran after more missile tests,"['Bozorgmehr Sharafedin', 'Sam Wilkin']","DUBAI U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton on Wednesday called for sanctions against Iran after the Islamic Republic brushed off U.S. concerns and test-fired two ballistic missiles that it said were designed to be able to hit Israel.

Iranian state television showed footage of two Qadr missiles being launched from northern Iran, which the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said hit targets 1,400 km (870 miles) away.

Iranian agencies said the missiles were stamped with the Hebrew words, ""Israel should be wiped from the pages of history,"" though the inscription could not be seen on any photographs.

Clinton, a former secretary of state under President Barack Obama, said she was ""deeply concerned"" by the tests, the second round of Iranian missile launches in two days.

""Iran should face sanctions for these activities and the

international community must demonstrate that Iran's threats

toward Israel will not be tolerated,"" said Clinton, who is ahead in the race to be Democratic nominee at the Nov. 8 presidential elections.

Her call for sanctions reflected a tougher line against Iran's recent missile activity than that taken so far by the White House, which said it is aware of and reviewing reports of the Iranian tests, and would determine an appropriate response.

""We know that Iran is in a season of carrying out a number of military activities, and so it certainly would not be a surprise if there are additional launches over the next several days,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

The Iranian move on Wednesday came despite warning from the U.S. State Department after Tuesday's missile tests that Washington continues to ""aggressively apply our unilateral tools

to counter threats from Iran's missile program,"" a possible reference to additional U.S. sanctions.

Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Wednesday with Iran's foreign minister about the test-firing of two ballistic missiles, a State Department spokesman said.

The missile tests underline a rift in Iran between hard-line factions opposed to normalizing relations with the West, and

President Hassan Rouhani's relatively moderate government, which is trying to attract foreign investors to Iran.

ISRAEL IN MIND

Iran's IRGC said the missiles tested on Wednesday were designed with Israel in mind.

""The reason we designed our missiles with a range of 2,000 km is to be able to hit our enemy the Zionist regime from a safe distance,"" Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by the ISNA agency. The nearest point in Iran is around 1,000 km (600 miles) from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon told Israel Radio the tests showed Iran's hostility had not changed since implementing a nuclear deal with world powers in January, despite Rouhani's overtures to the West.

""To my regret there are some in the West who are misled by the honeyed words of part of the Iranian leadership while the other part continues to procure equipment and weaponry, to arm terrorist groups,"" Yaalon said.

Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee, said: Iran is making a mockery of President Obamas vow to confront Irans dangerous and illicit acts.

He urged Obama to ""aggressively enforce all sanctions against Irans missile programs, support for terrorism and human rights abuses. No more looking the other way.

Washington imposed sanctions against businesses and individuals in January over another missile test in October 2015. But the IRGC said it would not bow to pressure.

""The more sanctions and pressure our enemies apply ... the more we will develop our missile program,"" Hajizadeh said on state television.

The IRGC maintains dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles, the largest stock in the Middle East. It says they are solely for defensive use with conventional, non-nuclear warheads.

Tehran has denied U.S. accusations of acting ""provocatively,"" citing the long history of U.S. interventions in the Middle East and its own right to self-defense.

NASA plans to repair a Mars spacecraft that was grounded in December because of a leak in its primary science instrument, putting the mission back on track for another launch attempt in 2018, the U.S. space agency said on Wednesday.

The spacecraft, a satellite known as InSight, was designed to study the deep interior of Mars, information that will help scientists figure out how the planet, and other rocky planets such as Earth, formed and evolved.

The space agency said it was reviewing how much the repair would cost, but the projects lead scientist last week estimated the price tag would be about $150 million above the $675 million already budgeted.

InSight missed its launch opportunity in March after scientists in December discovered that a pesky leak in its main science instrument had re-appeared.

That setback raised questions about whether NASA would cancel the mission. But agency managers said on Wednesday that the science goals were compelling and the plans for repairing the leak were sound.

The next time Earth and Mars will be properly aligned for InSight to launch is in May 2018. The spacecraft would arrive at Mars in November 2018 to begin a two-year mission.

The primary instrument is a seismometer with sensors that need to be suspended in near vacuum conditions so that they can make measurements as small as the diameter of a hydrogen atom.

The nine-inch (22-cm) spherical chamber holding the sensors has a tiny leak, so small that if a car tire leaked at that rate it could go three centuries without needing additional air, project scientist Bruce Banerdt of NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said during a March 2 presentation to the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group.

But even that leak rate is too high for the seismometer to work properly, so NASA grounded the mission for review.

Spacecraft builder Lockheed Martin said InSight would be stored in a facility near Denver while the seismometer instrument was repaired.

WASHINGTON Technology companies could face civil penalties for refusing to comply with court orders to help investigators access encrypted data under draft legislation nearing completion in the U.S. Senate, sources familiar with continuing discussions told Reuters on Wednesday.

The long-awaited legislation from Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, may be introduced as soon as next week, one of the sources said.

It would expose companies like Apple Inc, which is fighting a magistrate judge's order to unlock an iPhone connected to the mass-shooting in San Bernardino, California, to contempt of court proceedings and related penalties, the source said.

Senators are expected to circulate the draft bill among interested parties next week and hope to introduce it soon after, though a timetable is not final, the source said.

The Senators' proposal would not seek criminal penalties, as some media reports have stated, the sources said.

The controversial proposal faces an uphill climb in a gridlocked Congress during an election year and would likely be opposed by Silicon Valley.

Tech companies have largely supported Apple in its legal fight against the Justice Department, which is seeking access to a phone used by Rizwan Farook, one of two shooters in the San Bernardino attack last December in which 14 were killed and 22 wounded.

It is particularly unlikely the proposal will gain traction in the U.S. House of Representatives, which staked out positions strongly supporting digital privacy in the wake of revelations about government-sanctioned surveillance of communications by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.

Last year, amid stiff private sector opposition, the White House backed away from pushing for legislation to require U.S. technology firms to provide investigators with mechanisms to overcome encryption protections.

But the issue found renewed life after the shootings in San Bernardino and Paris. An August email from Robert Litt, the top U.S. intelligence community lawyer, obtained by the Washington Post, noted that momentum on the issue ""could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement.""

Separately, Democratic Senator Mark Warner and Republican Representative Michael McCaul last week introduced legislation to create a national commission to further explore solutions to the so-called going dark problem, where strong encryption has made it more difficult for law enforcement to access communications belonging to criminal suspects.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:38:08+00:00,Fate of lawsuit brought by Trump model to be decided this month,['Michelle Conlin'],"NEW YORK A judge will decide by the end of this month whether to proceed with a proposed class action lawsuit filed by a Jamaican fashion model against Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump's modeling agency, the judge's office said.

Alexia Palmer accuses Trump Model Management LLC of lying to the federal government in its work-visa application that said she would be paid a $75,000-a-year salary while living in the United States, according to court documents.

READ MORE: North Korea says it has missile-ready nukes

Instead, according to court papers, Palmer received a total of $3,880.75 during the three years she was under contract with the agency. The complaint alleges fraudulent misrepresentation and violations of U.S. immigration and labor laws. It asks for $225,000 in back pay.

The suit was originally filed in October 2014. A decision on a pending motion by Trump Model Management to dismiss is expected by the end of March, the clerk for Judge Analisa Torres, who is presiding over the case in the U.S District Court, Southern District, told Reuters.

If Torres rules the case can proceed, it could revive attention on Trumps foreign labor practices at a time when the celebrity billionaire's rise in American politics has riveted the worlds attention.

Trumps lawyers have called the case ""frivolous"" and ""without merit."" In court documents, they said Palmer wasnt an employee and was more than adequately compensated for a very brief stint as a fashion model, which they say amounted to less than 10 days of work over three years.

Reuters could not independently confirm that assertion.

RECOMMENDED: Iran tests more missiles, says capable of reaching Israel

At the end of the day, this model just didnt have a successful career, and we fully expect to win, said Lawrence Rosen, a lawyer for Trump Model Management.

Although Trump owns the modeling agency, the suit does not name him. Trump's campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said in a statement that Trump Model Management's treatment of Palmer was in line with ""standard practice in the modeling industry.""

Palmer's lawyer, Naresh Gehi, says his client was cheated of earnings and seduced by a life of glamour that never materialized. ""The visa application the company filed with the government requires that people are paid the full amount,"" Gehi said. ""Its a requirement.

Palmer, who was 17 when she came to New York in 2011, was not available to comment.

TOP JAMAICAN MODEL

Sylvia Ayass, a lawyer who has worked with models on visas like Palmer's, said agencies typically pay what they state on visa applications.

Trump has won Republican frontrunner status in the 2016 election in large part by positioning himself as a champion of the American worker who will deport illegal immigrants, build a wall with Mexico and do away with the off shoring of U.S. jobs.

This is not the first time Trump's labor practices have drawn criticism. A Reuters story published in August revealed that Trump's companies sought to import at least 1,100 workers on temporary visas since 2000. Of those, 250 were filed for foreign fashion models, according to the Reuters analysis of federal Department of Labor data.

Using a federal visa program called H-1B that allows U.S. employers to hire ""specialized"" foreign labor, Trump's modeling agency offered Palmer ""at least $75,000 per year"" for three years. It listed that salary on her H-1B visa application in 2011, according to the court documents reviewed by Reuters.

Rosen, the lawyer for Trump Model Management, said the $75,000 a year figure was simply a guess, not a guarantee.

Under that contract, Palmer agreed ""to promptly reimburse"" Trump Model Management ""for any and all costs and expenses"" that the agency incurred relating to her modeling.

According to the suit, the agreement stipulated that Trump Model Management would take a 20 percent cut of Palmers earnings but instead took 80 percent by deducting charges for everything from postage to walking lessons to mobile phone costs and limousine rides, as well as $4,000 in ""administrative fees,"" according to court documents.

The suit said it was seeking class-action status to represent other models who believe they were misled and underpaid after coming to the United States with sponsorship from Trumps modeling agency.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has not changed its key interest rate since cutting by a surprise 50 basis points in September. Governor Raghuram Rajan has emphasised the need for fiscal reform and stable inflation before he takes any further action.

India unveiled a fire-fighting budget last week that seeks to win back support among rural voters for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government and sustain growth against a grim global backdrop, putting the onus for support back on Rajan.

Junior Finance Minister Jayant Sinha said the tight fiscal policy could allow for further monetary easing. Also giving Rajan room to act, the poll of 23 economists predicted retail prices INCPIY=ECI rose 5.60 percent in February, a touch slower than January's 5.69 percent.

""Food inflation eased in February...most likely due to the fact that temperatures have finally returned to normal, after unusually high temperatures earlier in winter led to delays in the sowing of rabi (summer) crops such as wheat and barley,"" said Shilan Shah, India economist at Capital Economics.

""The chances of there being perhaps one more rate cut in the near term have risen, but this is because the FY16/17 budget adopted a tighter fiscal stance than expected rather than any change in the outlook for inflation,"" he added.

Although inflation has been climbing since July, it has remained below the RBI's January 2016 target of 6 percent for nearly a year-and-a-half.

The RBI is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points at its April 5 meeting and follow up with a second cut in the last three months of 2016, a separate Reuters poll conducted last week found, as it tries to boost flagging growth.

Indian industrial production INIP=ECI was expected to contract for a third straight month in January, the latest poll also found.

Economists predicted Friday's data will show a fall of 0.5 percent in factory output, following a 1.3 percent and 3.4 percent decline in December and November respectively.

""Although auto sales are doing well and the manufacturing PMI recovered very recently, other indicators such as rail freight and production in 'core' industries remain weak,"" said Devika Mehndiratta, ANZ Research's chief Asia economist.

The slight rebound is likely due to a similar bounce back in infrastructure output, which rose 2.9 percent in January, up from December's 0.9 percent. Infrastructure output accounts for over one-third of the wider industrial measure.

A rocket is launched from a M270A1 multiple launch rocket system during a live-fire training exercise of the 6-37th Field Artillery Regiment at a training area near the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, in Cheorwon, South Korea, March 9, 2016.

CHEORWON, South Korea There's more to do in South Korea's heavily forested Rocket Valley, just a few miles from the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, than fire rockets. In quieter times, people tend vegetable patches along ice-cold streams.

But on Wednesday, a U.S. artillery brigade based in the South heated things up, launching a barrage of rockets close to the border town of Cheorwon.

The live-fire drills came hours after a report by reclusive North Korea that it had miniaturised nuclear warheads to be mounted on ballistic missiles and leader Kim Jong Un had ordered further improvements to its arsenal.

Tension in the region was already high as South Korean and U.S. troops began large-scale military exercises on Monday in a test of their defences against North Korea, which called the drills ""nuclear war moves"" and threatened to respond with an all-out offensive.

The U.N. Security Council imposed harsh new sanctions on North Korea last week for its Jan. 6 nuclear test. The North launched a long-range rocket a month later, drawing international criticism and sanctions from South Korea.

The drills in Rocket Valley were separate to the annual joint U.S.-South Korean manoeuvres which involve about 17,000 U.S. troops and more than 300,000 South Koreans.

They were a test of the U.S. Army M270A1 system, a multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) built by Lockheed Martin that can fire 12 rounds and re-load and move at 64 km (40 miles) per hour.

One unit was dug in at the foot of Rocket Valley, under the swaying firs. A sonic boom followed the rockets as they screamed over the tree line followed by trails of flame towards targets eight km (five miles) away, invisible over the ridge lines.

""If North Korea decides to use their long-range artillery, which they have so many pieces of, Seoul would be in direct range,"" Captain Harry Lu of the U.S. Army's 37th Field Artillery Regiment said.

""So our mission here is to make sure we destroy that artillery before they can cause any more damage to the greater Seoul metropolitan area.""

SHRILL THREATS OF WAR

In bellicose rhetoric, North Korea routinely threatens to turn Seoul into a ""sea of flames"" and the city was reduced to rubble in the 1950-53 Korean conflict, which ended in a truce, not a treaty, meaning the two sides are technically still at war.

Kim Jong Un's announcement of advances in North Korea's nuclear programme followed his order last week for the country to be prepared to mount pre-emptive attacks against the United States and South Korea and stand ready to use nuclear weapons.

He issued the command as the North showcased its own MLRS which is carried by a Chinese-made truck and may be able to operate outside the range of similar U.S. and South Korean weapons, according to an expert.

South Korea's defence ministry said the North's rockets flew up to 150 km (90 miles) off the east coast and into the sea, a display of power seen as a response to the U.N. sanctions.

The U.S. 210th Field Artillery Brigade, based in Dongducheon, north of Seoul, is one of the only U.S. battalions that will not move to a newly expanded military base south of the capital under an agreement between South Korean and U.S. defence chiefs.

That is because it is considered part of South Korea's ""counter-fire plan"" and contains MLRS, capable of firing a barrage of rockets at a target beyond the range of conventional artillery.

It is one of South Korea's first lines of defence in the event of war.

""Unless using guided munitions, (multiple-launch rockets) are less accurate than tube artillery but can put a lot of steel downrange with devastating effect,"" said Bruce Klinger, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation and former Korea specialist at the CIA.

On Wednesday, the devastating effect was being unleashed over an idyllic landscape which belies its name. In just a few weeks, holiday makers will return to the private cottages, camp sites and vegetable plots that dot the hills to get away from the summer heat of the city.

Last week in Mexico, the pontiff, who is usually calm and accommodating with his admirers, clearly lost his temper with a person who pulled on him so hard that he fell onto a child on a wheel chair. Video footage showed that while the pope was walking at the edge of a crowd in an stadium, he stopped to greet children who were sitting.

The pope said, however, he did not want to advise American Catholics on whether or not to vote for Trump.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 21:56:33+00:00,Florida lawmakers: Couples can move in without saying 'I do',['Bill Cotterell'],"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. Florida lawmakers on Wednesday gave the thumbs-up to living together without being married, sending to the governor a bill repealing the state's Reconstruction-era ban on cohabitation by unmarried couples.

The old law made it illegal to ""lewdly and lasciviously"" live together without being married to each other - language that presumably differentiated between romantic couples sharing a bed and non-romantic roommates splitting the rent.

In either case, sponsors said, it is a law that is impossible to enforce but dangerous to have on the books.

""You shouldn't have statutes that are not being enforced,"" said state Representative Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda, a Tallahassee Democrat and bill sponsor. ""You'd have to arrest a half-million people, if we enforced this.""

The repeal statute leaves in place a section of the 1868 law making it a misdemeanor to engage ""in open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior,"" regardless of marital status.

It is difficult to determine if anyone gets arrested for cohabitation, since the offense is combined in the state with public lewdness, said Rehwinkel Vasilinda, a law school instructor.

But the law ""could be used in a discriminatory manner"" if a jealous ex-spouse or prosecutor wanted to harass a person or unmarried couple, she said.

The cohabitation ban is the latest in a string of antiquated and rarely-if-ever-enforced sex laws being repealed across the country - either by new laws, referendum, or court action, the most notable being bans on same-sex intercourse struck down by the courts in recent years.

If Florida's repeal passes the governor's muster, only Mississippi and Michigan will be the holdouts on laws requiring couples to marry before sharing roof and bed, according to a staff analysis of the Florida bill.

The bill was also sponsored by state Senator Eleanor Sobel, a Hollywood Democrat.

The repeal earned the overwhelming support of the Florida lawmakers, with a unanimous vote in the state Senate and five dissenters in the House.

Among them was Representative Jennifer Sullivan, a Republican from Mount Dora, who said she ""ran on a pro-family platform"" and could not vote to legalize cohabitation.

""Based on my own faith and what I believe, I voted accordingly,"" she said. ""My faith affects everything I do and who I am, so I'm just being consistent with who I said I was as a candidate.""

reuters.com,2016-03-07 13:42:38+00:00,U.S. Commerce Department to place restrictions on China's ZTE,['Steve Stecklow'],"Visitors check out products at the ZTE stand at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, February 24, 2014.

LONDON The U.S. Commerce Department is set to place export restrictions on Chinese telecoms equipment maker ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) for alleged violations of U.S. export controls on Iran, according to documents seen by Reuters.

The restrictions will make it difficult for the company to acquire U.S. products by requiring ZTE's suppliers to apply for an export license before shipping any American-made equipment or parts to ZTE. According to a Commerce Department notice that will be published next week in the U.S. Federal Register, the license applications generally will be denied.

The restrictions will take effect Tuesday, Reuters has learned, and apply to any company worldwide that wants to ship American-made products to ZTE Corp in China. Those companies are not the target of the export curbs on ZTE.

""This is a significant new burden on trade with ZTE,"" a senior official at the Commerce Department told Reuters. The official declined to comment on whether the U.S. government might take further action against ZTE.

The company can appeal against the action.

ZTE, based in the southern Chinese boomtown of Shenzhen, said in a statement on Sunday that it was aware of media reports on U.S. export restrictions.

""ZTE is highly concerned about recent media reports relating to a U.S. Department of Commerce investigation,"" the company said. ""ZTE has been working with associated U.S. government departments on investigations since 2012 and maintains constant communication with associated departments and is committed to fully address and resolve any concerns.""

Trade in shares in ZTE, which also sells consumer electronic devices such as smartphones in the United States, was suspended on Monday in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The company did not offer an explanation.

""We believe the restrictions, if implemented, will cause significant supply problems to ZTE,"" Jefferies analyst Cynthia Meng wrote in a note, adding that ZTE has major trading relationships with several U.S. companies including Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and IBM (IBM.N).

Telecoms equipment and terminal businesses combined account for 80 percent of ZTE's total revenue of 2015, Meng said. The company's revenue for last year was expected to rise 23.8 percent to a record high of 100.8 billion yuan ($15.47 billion), preliminary results showed.

ALLEGED VIOLATIONS

The Commerce Department investigated ZTE for alleged export-control violations following reports by Reuters in 2012 that the company had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars worth of hardware and software from some of America's best-known technology companies to Iran's largest telecoms carrier, Telecommunication Co of Iran (TCI), and a unit of the consortium that controls it.

The U.S. companies, which included Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), IBM (IBM.N), Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and Dell Inc [DI.UL], have all said they were not aware of the Iranian contracts. It is not clear if any of the companies still do business with ZTE.

Washington has long banned the sale of United States-made technology products to Iran. The Commerce Department's investigation focused on whether ZTE had acquired American products through front companies and then shipped them to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.

Commerce Department investigators obtained internal ZTE documents - some of which had been marked by the company as ""Top Secret"" - outlining an alleged sanctions-busting scheme. Reuters reviewed some of the documents.

The senior Commerce Department official declined to comment on whether ZTE had implemented that scheme.

The ZTE statement did not provide comment relating to the documents.

The day after the first Reuters article was published in March 2012, a ZTE spokesman said the company would ""curtail"" its business in Iran. The company later issued a statement saying: ""ZTE no longer seeks new customers in Iran and limits business activities with existing customers.""

BUSINESS IMPACT

What effect the new export restrictions will have on ZTE's global business is not clear.

One undated internal ZTE document obtained by Commerce Department investigators and reviewed by Reuters states: ""Our company has many technologies and components that came from suppliers in the U.S ... Lots of chips or software used in the products of our company are from U.S. suppliers.""

One of ZTE's websites also states that several leading U.S. technology companies, including Microsoft, Intel Corp (INTC.O), IBM and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), are ""key strategic partners of ZTE"". The terms of the partnerships are not described.

A spokeswoman for Microsoft said the company had a licensing agreement with ZTE but could not confirm if the Chinese company purchases other products, such as software. The other U.S. companies did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

The undated internal ZTE document also describes a proposal overseen by the company's legal department that describes ways to export American products subject to U.S. sanctions by using shell companies to avoid getting caught.

""The biggest advantage"" of one method is that it will make it ""harder for the U.S. government to trace it or investigate the real flow of the controlled commodities"", the document states.

In its planned action against ZTE, the Commerce Department cites the proposal, stating that the company ""planned and organized a scheme to establish, control and use a series of 'detached' companies to illicitly re-export controlled items to Iran in violation of U.S. export control laws"". It is not clear if the alleged scheme was implemented.

'TOP SECRET'

Another internal ZTE document from August 2011 that discusses ""U.S. export control risks"" facing the company allegedly was signed by several top ZTE officials, including Shi Lirong, its president.

The document, marked by the company ""Top Secret"" and ""No spreading abroad without permission of ZTE"", begins ""Dear company leaders"".

It states that ZTE ""has ongoing projects in all five major embargoed countries - Iran, Sudan, North Korea, Syria and Cuba"", adding that ""all of these projects depend on U.S.-procured items to some extent, so export control obstacles have arisen"".

The document goes on to cite ""other risks"" to ZTE, including its operations in the United States.

""R&D employees at the U.S. Research Centers often travel between China and the U.S., carrying R&D data,"" it states, in an apparent reference to research and development. ""This already severely violates the law.""

The document does not specify what law may have been violated.

The company ""needs to take preventative measures immediately, otherwise will face the risk of being investigated anytime"", the document states.

The document also states that ZTE's Iran project ""can potentially put us at risk of being put on the Blacklist by the U.S.,"" and that such an eventuality could leave the company facing ""the risk of losing the supply chain of U.S. products"".

ZTE Corp is one of the world's largest telecoms equipment makers with operations in 160 countries, according to its website. It also is a major manufacturer of mobile handsets. Founded in 1985, its shares trade on both the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock markets.

Besides ZTE, the export curbs will apply to two of its Chinese affiliates, ZTE Kangxun Telecommunications Ltd and Beijing 8-Star, and an Iranian company, ZTE Parsian.

WASHINGTON Having twice failed to achieve Israeli-Palestinian peace, the Obama administration is discussing ways to help preserve the prospect of an increasingly threatened two-state solution, U.S. officials said.

One possibility under discussion is to issue an outline of a deal to end the nearly 70-year-old conflict on such matters as borders, security, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees.

Such an outline could range from a brief description of core tradeoffs the two sides might need to make to a detailed set of ""parameters"" like those that former U.S. President Bill Clinton laid out for the parties in late 2000.

Under one scenario, the outline could be enshrined in a U.N. Security Council resolution to give it greater international standing for a future U.S. president or the parties whenever they might resume peace talks that collapsed in April 2014.

""It's one of the ideas that they are talking about,"" said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Resorting to a U.N. resolution would require a major shift in long-standing U.S. policy, which has mostly opposed use of the United Nations as a forum for pressuring Israel. The United States has repeatedly insisted it is up to the two sides to directly negotiate over their differences.

Another possibility would be for U.S. President Barack Obama to make a speech laying out his principles for a settlement.

U.S. officials have no expectation peace talks will resume before the end of Obama's term in January 2017 and they played down the odds of any quick decision on how the White House might help preserve a two-state solution.

""People in the government are asking the question what can we do to keep the two-state solution alive, and theyre generating ideas,"" said a senior U.S. official.

The ideas had not yet risen to senior White House staff and Obama is focused on other issues including Islamic State, Iran and Cuba, the officials said.

Two separate peace efforts, by George Mitchell and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, have failed during Obama's seven years in office.

TWO-STATE SOLUTION DYING ON OBAMA'S WATCH?

A two-state solution long seen as the most internationally acceptable outcome envisages a Palestinian state on most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, lands Israel captured in a 1967 war, and an Israeli state that absorbs some of the settlements Israel built on occupied land in return for mutually agreed land swaps.

Such a solution appears remote because of ongoing Jewish settlement building; a split between the Palestinian Fatah and Hamas factions; preoccupation within the Palestinian Authority about who may succeed 81-year-old President Mahmoud Abbas; and a wave of Palestinian stabbings, shootings and car rammings of Israelis.

The Palestinian attacks have killed 28 Israelis and two U.S. citizens since October, while Israeli forces have killed at least 179 Palestinians, 121 of whom Israel says were assailants.

Current and former U.S. officials have warned that a failure to break the impasse could lead to greater conflict and that continued occupation of Palestinian land puts at risk Israels character as a Jewish and democratic state.

Former officials also cite a deepening cynicism on both sides regarding peace, making it ever harder to achieve.

""In the absence of negotiations, actions on the ground are making it more and more difficult to see how a two-state solution could be achieved,"" said Martin Indyk, Obama's former special envoy for the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.

""I think there is a real concern on the part of the president and the secretary of state,"" said Indyk, who is now executive vice president of the Brookings Institution think tank, ""that instead of achieving a breakthrough to a two-state solution, the two-state solution will die on their watch.""

Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports

Mildronate (Meldonium) medication capsules are pictured on the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, in this November 23, 2010 file photo.

A manufacturing operator works at the Mildronate (Meldonium) medication packaging process in the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, November 23, 2010. Picture taken November 23, 2010.

LONDON, March 9 The medicine Maria Sharapova says she has taken for 10 years due to a family history of heart issues and diabetes is an old drug sold in just a few Eastern European countries that can also boost exercise tolerance.

The tennis star tested positive for the banned drug meldonium, or Mildronate, in a sample taken on January 26, the day of her Australian Open quarter finals defeat to Serena Williams.

RECOMMENDED: Trump's foreign labor practices in the spotlight

She said her family doctor had first given her the drug 10 years ago after she frequently became sick, had irregular electrocardiogram results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.

The 28-year old Russian, a five-time grand slam champion and the highest paid woman in sports, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said.

For the health conditions Sharapova says she has, however, doctors say the scientific evidence for Mildronate is limited compared with many medicines widely available in Europe and the United States, where Sharapova trains, which have full regulatory backing and years of robust safety and efficacy data.

LATVIAN DRUG

Meldonium is cheap and available over the counter without a prescription in some eastern European countries, where it is marketed as Mildronate by the Latvian pharmaceutical firm Grindeks (GRD1R.RI).

The drug, originally developed by scientists at the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, is not licensed by two of the world's biggest medicines regulators: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States where Sharapova trains, and the EU's European Medicines Agency.

RECOMMENDED: Iran tests more missiles, says capable of reaching Israel

A spokeswoman for Grindeks said the firm had not applied for a license for Mildronate from either the FDA or the EMA, but said the drug is registered in Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union.

She said it is designed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular diseases, including angina, chronic heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other cardiovascular disorders.

Grindeks' also promotes it for people with reduced working capacity from physical or psycho-emotional ""overload"", and during recovery from cerebrovascular disorders, head injury and encephalitis. It is not indicated for diabetes.

Tim Chico, a consultant cardiologist at Britain's Sheffield University, said it was unlikely that such a young and extremely fit woman would be suffering from a serious heart condition like angina, or would be able to play top level tennis if she were.

Asked how long the drug should be given to a patient, the Grindeks spokeswoman said in an emailed statement: ""Depending on the patient health condition, treatment course of meldonium preparations may vary from 4 to 6 weeks"". Such courses could be repeated two or three times in a year.

In an emailed reply to questions from Reuters about her medical reasons for using the drug, Sharapova's lawyer John Haggerty said: ""While I cannot go into detail out of respect for the ITF process, I can confirm that Ms Sharapova had abnormal EKG tests in 2006 and was also diagnosed with asthenia (a lack of energy or strength), decreased immunity and diabetes indicators.""

""She also had a family history of heart conditions,"" Haggerty said. ""The Mildronate and the other medicines recommended by her doctor treated these conditions.""

Munir Pirmohamed, a professor of molecular and clinical pharmacology at Britain's University of Liverpool, said the crucial issue with Mildronate for him is its lack of approval from EU and U.S. regulators.

""As a physician, this is not something I have, or would ever, prescribe,"" he said.

Others noted it was rare for a doctor treating illness to prescribe a drug that is unavailable in the country where the patient lives.

""Sharapova has been a U.S. resident since early in her career, which does bring in a question of how or why she is using a drug that is not licensed there,"" said Tom Bassindale, a lecturer in forensic science at Sheffield Hallam University.

Sharapova's agent Max Eisenbud was not available at his Miami office and did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

HELPS MUSCLES COPE

Whatever its medical benefits, research suggests Mildronate may have potential as a performance-enhancing drug for sports.

It reduces the level of a metabolite called carnetine in muscles, and by doing that helps muscles cope better with high levels of stress and low oxygen levels.

""Because it effects the cellular metabolism, it would increase energy production within cells and therefore make oxygen utilization more efficient,"" said Pirmohamed.

In a 2010 academic paper published in a review journal called Seminars in Cardiovascular Medicine and cited on the Grindeks company website, it has been shown to improve exercise tolerance in patients with heart problems.

The World Anti-Doping Agency, which banned the drug in January after previously having it on a ""watch list"", ranks it as a prohibited metabolic modulator and cites ""evidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance.""

Grindeks says the drug could protect athletes from cell damage, but says it would be unlikely to improve their competitive performance.

It would be ""reasonable to recommend (sports people) to use meldonium as a cell protector to avoid heart failure or muscle damage in case of unwanted overload,"" the spokeswoman said.

Athletes ""should not expect increase of physical capacity, but, for sure, they will be protected against ischemic damages of cells in case of overload.""

The court, which said its full bench of judges will participate, did not set a date or elaborate on why it will hold the review of the law a three-judge panel from the court said in an August 2015 decision violated the U.S. Voting Rights Act through its ""discriminatory effects.""

The measure was signed into law in 2011 by then Texas Governor Rick Perry, a Republican, and has been in effect since even as the legal challenges have wound their way through the courts.

Plaintiffs have argued the law hits elderly and poorer voters, including minorities, hardest because they are less likely to have such identification. They contend the measure is used by Republicans as a way suppressing voters who typically align with Democrats.

The measure, which supporters say will prevent voter fraud, requires voters to present a photo identification such as a driver's license, passport or military ID card.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican welcomed the court's decision.

""Todays decision is a strong step forward in our efforts to defend the states Voter ID laws. Safeguarding the integrity of our elections is a primary function of state government and is essential to preserving our democratic process,"" he said in a statement.

Critics contend that voter fraud is a miniscule problem overblown by Republicans for political purposes. Republicans contend voter fraud erodes the fabric of the democratic process.

Civil rights groups have urged the court not to re-hear the case.

U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos ruled in October 2014 that the law, which was challenged by the administration of President Barack Obama and civil rights groups, was unlawful under the Voting Rights Act and U.S. Constitution in part because it discriminates against minority voters.

The Obama administration has been trying to counter a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June 2013 that overturned parts of the Voting Rights Act. That ruling freed several states, mostly in the South, from strict federal oversight.

BERLIN South-eastern Europe's ""Balkan route"", the main passage for migrants to reach more affluent countries to the north, will remain closed permanently, Austria's Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner told German newspaper ""Die Welt"" on Thursday.

On Wednesday, Macedonia sealed its border with Greece to illegal migrants after Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia, which are on the way to Austria, announced tight new restrictions on migrant entry.

""My position is clear: the Balkan route remains closed and that permanently, Mikl-Leitner told the newspaper.

She said only such a ""consistent signal"" will deter migrants, many of them fleeing war and conflict in the Middle East and beyond, from crossing the Mediterranean from Turkey to reach European shores.

As a result of the route's closure, thousands of migrants have built up on the Greek side of the Macedonian border and around 1,000 more are stranded in a refugee camp on the Macedonian side of the Serbian border.

""This alliance of reason has so far provided the decisive contribution to preserve stability and order for the people in Europe,"" Mikl-Leitner said in reference to the Balkan countries along the route.

In late February, Austria set off what it called a ""domino effect"" of national restrictions by imposing daily caps on the number of migrants to limit the flow of people toward it.

Last year, over 1.5 million migrants arrived in Europe, unleashing fierce political debates across the continent over how to handle the crisis.

A member of the media, wearing a protective suit and a mask, looks at the No. 3 reactor building at Tokyo Electric Power Co's (TEPCO) tsunami-crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Okuma town, Fukushima prefecture, Japan in this February 10, 2016 file photo.

The robots sent in to find highly radioactive fuel at Fukushima's nuclear reactors have died; a subterranean ""ice wall"" around the crippled plant meant to stop groundwater from becoming contaminated has yet to be finished. And authorities still dont how to dispose of highly radioactive water stored in an ever mounting number of tanks around the site.

Five years ago, one of the worst earthquakes in history triggered a 10-metre high tsunami that crashed into the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station causing multiple meltdowns. Nearly 19,000 people were killed or left missing and 160,000 lost their homes and livelihoods.

Today, the radiation at the Fukushima plant is still so powerful it has proven impossible to get into its bowels to find and remove the extremely dangerous blobs of melted fuel rods.

The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) 9501.t, has made some progress, such as removing hundreds of spent fuel roads in one damaged building. But the technology needed to establish the location of the melted fuel rods in the other three reactors at the plant has not been developed.

It is extremely difficult to access the inside of the nuclear plant,"" Naohero Masuda, Tepco's head of decommissioning said in an interview. ""The biggest obstacle is the radiation.

The fuel rods melted through their containment vessels in the reactors, and no one knows exactly where they are now. This part of the plant is so dangerous to humans, Tepco has been developing robots, which can swim under water and negotiate obstacles in damaged tunnels and piping to search for the melted fuel rods.

But as soon as they get close to the reactors, the radiation destroys their wiring and renders them useless, causing long delays, Masuda said.

Each robot has to be custom-built for each building.It takes two years to develop a single-function robot, Masuda said.

IRRADIATED WATER

Tepco, which was fiercely criticized for its handling of the disaster, says conditions at the Fukushima power station, site of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in Ukraine 30 years ago, have improved dramatically. Radiation levels in many places at the site are now as low as those in Tokyo.

More than 8,000 workers are at the plant at any one time, according to officials on a recent tour. Traffic is constant as they spread across the site, removing debris, building storage tanks, laying piping and preparing to dismantle parts of the plant.

Much of the work involves pumping a steady torrent of water into the wrecked and highly radiated reactors to cool them down. Afterward, the radiated water is then pumped out of the plant and stored in tanks that are proliferating around the site.

What to do with the nearly million tonnes of radioactive water is one of the biggest challenges, said Akiro Ono, the site manager. Ono said he is deeply worried the storage tanks will leak radioactive water in the sea - as they have done several times before - prompting strong criticism for the government.

The utility has so far failed to get the backing of local fishermen to release water it has treated into the ocean.

Ono estimates that Tepco has completed around 10 percent of the work to clear the site up - the decommissioning process could take 30 to 40 years. But until the company locates the fuel, it wont be able to assess progress and final costs, experts say.

The much touted use of X-ray like muon rays has yielded little information about the location of the melted fuel and the last robot inserted into one of the reactors sent only grainy images before breaking down.

ICE WALL

Tepco is building the worlds biggest ice wall to keep groundwater from flowing into the basements of the damaged reactors and getting contaminated.

First suggested in 2013 and strongly backed by the government, the wall was completed in February, after months of delays and questions surrounding its effectiveness. Later this year, Tepco plans to pump water into the wall - which looks a bit like the piping behind a refrigerator - to start the freezing process.

Stopping the ground water intrusion into the plant is critical, said Artie Gunderson, a former nuclear engineer.

The reactors continue to bleed radiation into the ground water and thence into the Pacific Ocean, Gunderson said. ""When Tepco finally stops the groundwater, that will be the end of the beginning.

While he would not rule out the possibility that small amounts of radiation are reaching the ocean, Masuda, the head of decommissioning, said the leaks have ended after the company built a wall along the shoreline near the reactors whose depth goes to below the seabed.

I am not about to say that it is absolutely zero, but because of this wall the amount of release has dramatically dropped, he said.

Law and Justice has been accused of waging a conservative revolution in Poland by tightening control over key public institutions. Walesa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize after he led the Solidarity union movement that defeated Polands communist regime in 1989, is an arch-nemesis of Law and Justice leader Jarosaw Kaczynski.

The former electrician from Gdansk faces renewed allegations that he cooperated with the communist secret police in the 1970s before he co-founded Solidarity. The widow of Polands last communist chief of secret services, General Czeslaw Kiszczak, offered to sell documents that she claimed prove Walesa was an informer. Because the sale of state documents is illegal, state prosecutors confiscated the files from the ex-strongmans apartment. Soon after, Polands Institute of National Remembrance made the documents public without verifying their authenticity.

The Walesa files have further polarized the countrys two political camps, which have long been divided over how to interpret Polands post-1989 history. The two sides emerged from the split between Solidarity activists-turned-politicians after the communist regime fell, which soon spread throughout Polish society. One side insists Warsaws transition from socialism to democracy was largely a success. The other maintains that the transition benefitted only a few, and that former communists continue to have a great deal of influence and control over the country.

The protesters accused the Law and Justice party of exploiting the Walesa files to install new national heroes that fit its historical narrative.

The way they are slandering the man  they didnt spit on the any of the communists like that, said 64-year-old Marek Gancarz, one of up to 80,000 people who took part in the Warsaw demonstration on Saturday. The next day, some 15,000 people demonstrated outside the gates of the Gdansk shipyards, where Solidaritys antigovernment strikes began. Walesas wife, Danuta, who accepted her husbands Nobel Prize in 1983, told protesters, I can guarantee he never hurt anyone.

Kaczynski was a member of Walesas presidential administration but was soon ousted for his increasingly radical views. Since then, he has often tried to discredit Walesas role in ending communism in Poland  even leading a crowd that burnt the former president in effigy outside the presidential residence in 1994.

Protesters last weekend accused Kaczynski of attempting to rewrite Polish history. In response, the party leader told the Financial Times that his actions are a reformation, not a revolution. But critics say he is trampling on Polands hard-earned democracy.

The chairman [Kaczynski] thinks he can do whatever he wants, said Maria, 53, who stood waving a flag of the European Union. Like many opponents of the government, she insists Kaczynski, who holds no official government office, is the real power. He is the one, they say, who is calling the shots behind President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Beata Szydlo.

Opposition leaders united for the antigovernment demonstrations, which were organized by the Committee for Defense of Democracy (KOD), a civic movement founded in November as a response to Polands continuing constitutional crisis. Since then, the group has been organizing street protests against controversial changes to the high court and public media.

Warsaw faced increased pressure this week to undo a law that has effectively paralyzed the high court. A leaked draft opinion by the Council of Europes Venice Commission says the law undermines the councils principles. But Warsaw officials have dismissed the report. Szydlo described it as not binding. Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski, who had invited the council delegation to Warsaw, said the commission was entering a dangerous path of political dispute with Poland.

Law and Justice politicians are just as dismissive of KODs street protests as of international criticism. Andrzej Zybertowicz, an advisor to Duda, suggested the antigovernment demonstrations could be part of a Kremlin attempt to destabilize Poland; he called Walesa an informant and a snitch. Jacek Zalek, a Law and Justice member of parliament, said the protesters were not the Polish nation. He accused demonstrators of having a shady history with the SB (Polands communist secret police).

The split in Poland seems increasingly generational. Few young people are taking part in the KOD protests. Many demonstrators are between 50 and 70 years old and were adults at the twilight of the communist era. Younger Poles, meanwhile, are increasingly focused on Polands low wages and hope that Law and Justices ambitious social policies will help narrow the gap between the countrys living standards and those in Western Europe.

The end of Polish communism 30 years ago is distant history to Poles who came of age in a free Poland. They often sympathize with the nationalistic version of the countrys history promoted by the ruling party.

Older Poles who witnessed the beginnings of Polish democracy are more skeptical. Even if Walesas hands are not completely clean, said one protester, he did what nobody else had the guts to do, and history will remember him.",[]

An ultra-Orthodox Jewish onlooker stands near Israeli mounted police near the scene where Israeli police said two Palestinian assailants carried out a drive-by shooting on a commuter bus before being shot dead by police opposite the Notre Dame Center just outside Jerusalem's...

WASHINGTON Having twice failed to achieve Israeli-Palestinian peace, the Obama administration is discussing ways to help preserve the prospect of an increasingly threatened two-state solution, U.S. officials said.

One possibility under discussion is to issue an outline of a deal to end the nearly 70-year-old conflict on such matters as borders, security, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees.

Such an outline could range from a brief description of core tradeoffs the two sides might need to make to a detailed set of ""parameters"" like those that former U.S. President Bill Clinton laid out for the parties in late 2000.

Under one scenario, the outline could be enshrined in a U.N. Security Council resolution to give it greater international standing for a future U.S. president or the parties whenever they might resume peace talks that collapsed in April 2014.

""It's one of the ideas that they are talking about,"" said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Resorting to a U.N. resolution would require a major shift in long-standing U.S. policy, which has mostly opposed use of the United Nations as a forum for pressuring Israel. The United States has repeatedly insisted it is up to the two sides to directly negotiate over their differences.

Another possibility would be for U.S. President Barack Obama to make a speech laying out his principles for a settlement.

U.S. officials have no expectation peace talks will resume before the end of Obama's term in January 2017 and they played down the odds of any quick decision on how the White House might help preserve a two-state solution.

""People in the government are asking the question what can we do to keep the two-state solution alive, and theyre generating ideas,"" said a senior U.S. official.

The ideas had not yet risen to senior White House staff and Obama is focused on other issues including Islamic State, Iran and Cuba, the officials said.

Two separate peace efforts, by George Mitchell and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, have failed during Obama's seven years in office.

TWO-STATE SOLUTION DYING ON OBAMA'S WATCH?

A two-state solution long seen as the most internationally acceptable outcome envisages a Palestinian state on most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, lands Israel captured in a 1967 war, and an Israeli state that absorbs some of the settlements Israel built on occupied land in return for mutually agreed land swaps.

Such a solution appears remote because of ongoing Jewish settlement building; a split between the Palestinian Fatah and Hamas factions; preoccupation within the Palestinian Authority about who may succeed 81-year-old President Mahmoud Abbas; and a wave of Palestinian stabbings, shootings and car rammings of Israelis.

The Palestinian attacks have killed 28 Israelis and two U.S. citizens since October, while Israeli forces have killed at least 179 Palestinians, 121 of whom Israel says were assailants.

Current and former U.S. officials have warned that a failure to break the impasse could lead to greater conflict and that continued occupation of Palestinian land puts at risk Israels character as a Jewish and democratic state.

Former officials also cite a deepening cynicism on both sides regarding peace, making it ever harder to achieve.

""In the absence of negotiations, actions on the ground are making it more and more difficult to see how a two-state solution could be achieved,"" said Martin Indyk, Obama's former special envoy for the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.

""I think there is a real concern on the part of the president and the secretary of state,"" said Indyk, who is now executive vice president of the Brookings Institution think tank, ""that instead of achieving a breakthrough to a two-state solution, the two-state solution will die on their watch.""

WELLINGTON A weak global outlook and tepid inflation expectations pushed New Zealand's central bank to cut interest rates to a record low 2.25 percent, a move that took markets by surprise.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) cut the Official Cash Rate by 25 basis points to 2.25 percent, citing a material decline in a range of inflation expectation measures.

Of 21 economists polled by Reuters, 17 had expected the bank to hold rates steady with only four predicting the quarter-percentage- point cut.

The New Zealand dollar NZD=D4 tumbled more than a cent after the decision and 2-year swap rates dropped to 2.25 percent from around 2.45 percent.

The central bank also signaled at least one more rate cut to come.

""Monetary policy will continue to be accommodative,"" RBNZ Governor Graeme Wheeler said in a statement. ""Further policy easing may be required to ensure that future average inflation settles near the middle of the target range.""

The RBNZ is mandated to keep annual inflation in a 1 percent to 3 percent target range. With annual inflation currently hovering around 0.1 percent and inflation expectations at a 22-year low, the central bank opted to cut.

""The RBNZ has clearly been spooked by the recent weakening in the outlook for the global economy, the strengthening in the New Zealand dollar and the fall in domestic inflation expectations,"" said Paul Dales, Chief Australia & NZ Economist for Capital Economics.

Dales said there is now a ""real possibility"" interest rates could fall blow 2.0 percent.

While long-term inflation expectations are well anchored at 2 percent, ""there has been a material decline in a range of inflation expectation measures,"" said RBNZ's Wheeler.

The central bank's assistant governor John McDermott told journalists Thursday's decision was ""really about trying to stabilize inflation expectations.""

The central bank now expects the headline inflation figure to return within the target band by late 2016, rather than in the current quarter.

The central bank's forecasts  reflected in its 90-day bank bill rates  also point to another rate cut.

The bank forecast a 90-day bank bill rate of 2.2 percent by December 2016, down from the 2.6 percent it predicted at its last meeting.

The New Zealand dollar is ""likely to remain under pressure"" as the market adjusts to the significant downward revision to the bank's 90-day bill projections, ANZ Bank said in a note.

The central bank cut rates four times between June and December last year, reversing four rate hikes in 2014. Further cuts were stalled by a housing boom in Auckland that has begun to spread across the country and strong economic data.

However, the outlook for global growth has deteriorated, the domestic dairy sector faces ""difficult challenges"" and the New Zealand dollar is more than 4 percent higher than projected in December on a trade-weighted basis, Wheeler added.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meets scientists and technicians in the field of researches into nuclear weapons in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang March 9, 2016.

SEOUL North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast city of Wonsan early on Thursday, flying approximately 500 km (300 miles), South Korea's military said.

North Korea has a large stockpile of short-range missiles and is developing long-range and intercontinental missiles.

Reports of the missiles being fired coincide with already heightened tension on the Korean peninsula after the North conducted its fourth nuclear test in January and launched a long-range rocket last month, leading to new U.N. Security Council and bilateral U.S. sanctions.

The North fired six rockets into the sea last week using a multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) from Wonsan, supervised by leader Kim Jong Un who ordered his military to be prepared to launch pre-emptive attacks against enemies.

Kim said on Wednesday his country has miniaturised nuclear warheads to mount on ballistic missiles and ordered improvements in the power and precision of its arsenal in his first direct comment about nuclear warhead miniaturisation.

State Department spokesman John Kirby declined to comment on Kim's claim to have miniaturised nuclear warheads and accused him of ""provocative rhetoric.""

""I'd say the young man needs to pay more attention to the North Korean people and taking care of them than in pursuing these sorts of reckless capabilities,"" Kirby said.

The Pentagon said this week it had not seen North Korea demonstrate a capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead. But Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the department was working on U.S. ballistic missile defences to be prepared.

North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 but its claim to have set off a miniaturised hydrogen bomb has been disputed by the U.S. and South Korean governments and many experts.

U.S. and South Korean troops began large-scale military drills this week, which the North called ""nuclear war moves"" and threatened to respond with an all-out offensive.

The court, which said its full bench of judges will participate, did not set a date or elaborate on why it will hold the review of the law a three-judge panel from the court said in an August 2015 decision violated the U.S. Voting Rights Act through its ""discriminatory effects.""

The measure was signed into law in 2011 by then Texas Governor Rick Perry, a Republican, and has been in effect since even as the legal challenges have wound their way through the courts.

Plaintiffs have argued the law hits elderly and poorer voters, including minorities, hardest because they are less likely to have such identification. They contend the measure is used by Republicans as a way suppressing voters who typically align with Democrats.

The measure, which supporters say will prevent voter fraud, requires voters to present a photo identification such as a driver's license, passport or military ID card.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican welcomed the court's decision.

""Todays decision is a strong step forward in our efforts to defend the states Voter ID laws. Safeguarding the integrity of our elections is a primary function of state government and is essential to preserving our democratic process,"" he said in a statement.

Critics contend that voter fraud is a miniscule problem overblown by Republicans for political purposes. Republicans contend voter fraud erodes the fabric of the democratic process.

Civil rights groups have urged the court not to re-hear the case.

U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos ruled in October 2014 that the law, which was challenged by the administration of President Barack Obama and civil rights groups, was unlawful under the Voting Rights Act and U.S. Constitution in part because it discriminates against minority voters.

The Obama administration has been trying to counter a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June 2013 that overturned parts of the Voting Rights Act. That ruling freed several states, mostly in the South, from strict federal oversight.

The widow of Polands last communist chief of secret services, General Czeslaw Kiszczak, offered to sell documents that she claimed prove Walesa was an informer. Because the sale of state documents is illegal, state prosecutors confiscated the files from the ex-strongmans apartment. Soon after, Polands Institute of National Remembrance made the documents public without verifying their authenticity.

The Walesa files have further polarized the countrys two political camps, which have long been divided over how to interpret Polands post-1989 history. The two sides emerged from the split between Solidarity activists-turned-politicians after the communist regime fell, which soon spread throughout Polish society. One side insists Warsaws transition from socialism to democracy was largely a success. The other maintains that the transition benefitted only a few, and that former communists continue to have a great deal of influence and control over the country.

The protesters accused the Law and Justice party of exploiting the Walesa files to install new national heroes that fit its historical narrative.

The way they are slandering the man  they didnt spit on the any of the communists like that, said 64-year-old Marek Gancarz, one of up to 80,000 people who took part in the Warsaw demonstration on Saturday. The next day, some 15,000 people demonstrated outside the gates of the Gdansk shipyards, where Solidaritys antigovernment strikes began. Walesas wife, Danuta, who accepted her husbands Nobel Prize in 1983, told protesters, I can guarantee he never hurt anyone.

Kaczynski was a member of Walesas presidential administration but was soon ousted for his increasingly radical views. Since then, he has often tried to discredit Walesas role in ending communism in Poland  even leading a crowd that burnt the former president in effigy outside the presidential residence in 1994.

Protesters last weekend accused Kaczynski of attempting to rewrite Polish history. In response, the party leader told the Financial Times that his actions are a reformation, not a revolution. But critics say he is trampling on Polands hard-earned democracy.

The chairman [Kaczynski] thinks he can do whatever he wants, said Maria, 53, who stood waving a flag of the European Union. Like many opponents of the government, she insists Kaczynski, who holds no official government office, is the real power. He is the one, they say, who is calling the shots behind President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Beata Szydlo.

Opposition leaders united for the antigovernment demonstrations, which were organized by the Committee for Defense of Democracy (KOD), a civic movement founded in November as a response to Polands continuing constitutional crisis. Since then, the group has been organizing street protests against controversial changes to the high court and public media.

Warsaw faced increased pressure this week to undo a law that has effectively paralyzed the high court. A leaked draft opinion by the Council of Europes Venice Commission says the law undermines the councils principles. But Warsaw officials have dismissed the report. Szydlo described it as not binding. Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski, who had invited the council delegation to Warsaw, said the commission was entering a dangerous path of political dispute with Poland.

Law and Justice politicians are just as dismissive of KODs street protests as of international criticism. Andrzej Zybertowicz, an advisor to Duda, suggested the antigovernment demonstrations could be part of a Kremlin attempt to destabilize Poland; he called Walesa an informant and a snitch. Jacek Zalek, a Law and Justice member of parliament, said the protesters were not the Polish nation. He accused demonstrators of having a shady history with the SB (Polands communist secret police).

The split in Poland seems increasingly generational. Few young people are taking part in the KOD protests. Many demonstrators are between 50 and 70 years old and were adults at the twilight of the communist era. Younger Poles, meanwhile, are increasingly focused on Polands low wages and hope that Law and Justices ambitious social policies will help narrow the gap between the countrys living standards and those in Western Europe.

The end of Polish communism 30 years ago is distant history to Poles who came of age in a free Poland. They often sympathize with the nationalistic version of the countrys history promoted by the ruling party.

Older Poles who witnessed the beginnings of Polish democracy are more skeptical. Even if Walesas hands are not completely clean, said one protester, he did what nobody else had the guts to do, and history will remember him.",[]

Annual consumer inflation edged up to 2.3 percent in February, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday, from January's 1.8 percent and above the 1.9 percent predicted by analysts.

That was the fastest increase pace since July 2014.

A seasonal jump in food prices drove February's inflation, with food prices climbing 7.3 percent and non-food inflation up 1.0 percent.

China aims to keep consumer inflation at around 3 percent in 2016 to reflect factors such as rising labor cost, price fluctuations of agricultural products and the impact of further price reform.

""A target of higher price increases will be conducive to reducing expectations of deflation,"" the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the country's top economic planner, said in a work report on Saturday.

China's consumer price index rose 1.4 percent in 2015 from a year ago, far short of Beijing's 3 percent target for 2015.

Reflecting sluggish demand at home and overseas and overcapacity in key sectors, China's producer prices remained stubbornly weak, with the producer price index sliding 4.9 percent in February from a year ago.

Premier Li Keqiang acknowledged in parliament on Saturday that leaders face ""a tough battle"" to keep the economy growing by at least 6.5 percent over the next five years, while pushing hard to create more jobs and restructuring state-owned enterprises.

China's trade data released on Tuesday also showed entrenched weakness in the economy as exports tumbled at their fastest pace in more than over six years and imports fell for 16th straight month.

Hiroshi Oe, Japan's deputy chief negotiator for the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, told an Asia Society forum in Washington that trying to alter one aspect of the pact for the United States would open the door for 11 other countries to ask for changes.

""TPP to me is something like a delicate, fragile glasswork, so if we want to cut one part of it, that will destroy everything,"" Oe said. ""About renegotiation of the substance, that's no possibility.""

Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton has said she does not support TPP in its current form and would seek to renegotiate it to include an enforceable provision to combat currency manipulation.

Some economists, along with Obama administration officials, argue that this would be unworkable because it is often too difficult to distinguish currency manipulation and normal monetary policy actions and could expose the Federal Reserve's decisions to trade retaliation.

Other U.S. lawmakers, including Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have expressed opposition to provisions on tobacco regulation and have said that the pact should not be considered for a vote in Congress before November's elections.

Oe said that he hoped that Japan's parliament would approve the trade deal by early June, prior to national elections in July.

""I think that's necessary, to pressure the United States"" to approve TPP as well.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said on Thursday that Boston-based Iron Mountain offered to make a court-enforcable promise to sell its existing Australian operations, which extend to all eight states and territories.

The ACCC added that it would invite feedback on the proposal for two weeks and decide whether to accept it by the end of this month.

The offering from Iron Mountain demonstrates the muscle being exerted by the ACCC as it adjudicates a host of mega-deals from offshore spurred by declines in the Australian dollar and the sharemarket over the past year.

In October, it warned that Halliburton Co's (HAL.N) proposed $35 billion buyout of rival Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) may result in price fixing locally, and it has forced Canada's Brookfield Asset Management Inc (BAMa.TO) to pare its $6.4 billion takeover of port and rail giant Asciano ltd (AIO.AX) for similar reasons.

In November, the regulator indicated that it may block Iron Mountain's move on Recall, warning that it would give one company 71 percent marketshare and leave customers ""vulnerable to price increases or reduced service levels"".

Recall shares rose 1.6 percent to A$7.15 in mid-session trading on Thursday, while the broader market was flat. But the shares are below Iron Mountain's A$8.50 offer amid concerns the deal may not progress.

LONDON The new Formula One season starts with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on March 20. The following details the major changes for 2O16:

QUALIFYING

Formula One's governing body has accepted a new format under which the slowest drivers are eliminated as the three sessions progress, rather than at the end of each phase, as was the case last season.

The first session lasts 16 minutes with the slowest driver eliminated after seven minutes. Another six will follow at 90-second intervals with 15 going through to the second phase.

The second session lasts 15 minutes with the slowest driver eliminated after six. The same 90-second sequence follows until eight drivers are left.

The final 14 minutes sees one driver eliminated after five minutes and then one every 90 seconds until two are left fighting for pole position with 1-1/2 minutes remaining.

NEW RACE

Azerbaijan makes its Formula One debut with the European Grand Prix in Baku on June 19. The calendar has a record 21 races, with Germany returning after a year's absence.

NEW TEAM

Ferrari-powered Haas make their F1 debut as the first U.S.-owned team in 30 years. There are now 11 teams and 22 drivers on the starting grid.

FIRST INDONESIAN

Rio Haryanto makes his debut with the Manor Racing team as Indonesia's first Formula One driver. He is also the only Asian on the starting grid.

TYRES

A new ultra-soft tyre has been added to the range of compounds. There are now five in total.

Under new regulations, supplier Pirelli will bring three, rather than two, compounds to a grand prix weekend and two will be mandatory for the race.

The teams then choose 10 more sets of tyres from the three available compounds, making a weekend allocation of 13.

In Melbourne, triple world champion Lewis Hamilton has opted for one set of mediums and six each of the soft and supersoft. Team mate Nico Rosberg will have two mediums, five soft and six supersoft.

For long-haul events, the tyre nomination has to be made 14 weeks in advance. For European races, the deadline is eight weeks before the grand prix.

EXHAUST LAYOUT

Cars now have two exhausts, compared to one tail pipe last year. This should make them slightly louder and go some way to addressing one of the biggest grievances about the quieter V6 turbo hybrid power units introduced in 2014.

POWER UNIT ALLOWANCE

With the expanded calendar, drivers can use five power units this season rather than four.

CAMERAS

For crash and accident analysis, cars are now fitted with high speed cameras.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said on Thursday that Boston-based Iron Mountain offered to make a court-enforcable promise to sell its existing Australian operations, which extend to all eight states and territories.

The ACCC added that it would invite feedback on the proposal for two weeks and decide whether to accept it by the end of this month.

The offering from Iron Mountain demonstrates the muscle being exerted by the ACCC as it adjudicates a host of mega-deals from offshore spurred by declines in the Australian dollar and the sharemarket over the past year.

In October, it warned that Halliburton Co's (HAL.N) proposed $35 billion buyout of rival Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) may result in price fixing locally, and it has forced Canada's Brookfield Asset Management Inc (BAMa.TO) to pare its $6.4 billion takeover of port and rail giant Asciano ltd (AIO.AX) for similar reasons.

In November, the regulator indicated that it may block Iron Mountain's move on Recall, warning that it would give one company 71 percent marketshare and leave customers ""vulnerable to price increases or reduced service levels"".

Recall shares rose 1.6 percent to A$7.15 in mid-session trading on Thursday, while the broader market was flat. But the shares are below Iron Mountain's A$8.50 offer amid concerns the deal may not progress.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 18:27:08+00:00,BoE policymakers wrestle over when banks need more capital,['Huw Jones'],"People pass the Bank of England in the City of London January 16, 2014.

LONDON Bank of England policymakers on Wednesday highlighted intense behind-the-scenes debate over when British banks should set aside more capital to protect them from future economic downturns.

The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee in December agreed that the amount of extra capital the banks should set aside for this purpose should be 1 percent of their risk-weighted assets, compared with zero percent at present.

But no decision has been taken as to when the banks should start to put aside this capital. For this reason, banks will be watching for the outcome of the next Financial Policy Committee meeting later this month.

Clara Furse, a member of the Financial Policy Committee, said December's discussion on the extra capital almost came to a vote, which would be unusual as the committee typically takes decisions by consensus.

She said she found herself in a ""small minority"" against raising the extra amount of capital - the so-called counter-cyclical buffer - because it could choke off credit growth.

Credit growth was ""hardly ringing alarm bells"", she said.

Furse made her comments in response to questions from parliament's Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday. Furse and another Financial Policy Committee member Richard Sharp were being questioned in relation to their reappointment to the Bank of England's committee.

Sharp, a former Goldman Sachs banker (GS.N), said he had wanted banks to have a leverage ratio - another measure of how much capital a bank holds - of 4 percent.

The ratio has been set at a lower level, but Sharp said he had been persuaded that the extra capital provision would compensate for this. Sharp said among the major issues under discussion was a need to ensure that raising the extra capital was not damaging.

Members of the Treasury committee raised the question of risks from Britain possibly leaving the European Union if people vote in favor of Brexit in a referendum in June.

BoE Governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday that possible Brexit was the single biggest domestic risk to Britain's financial stability.

Furse said a vote on potentially coming out of the EU was clearly a risk. Sharp said it posed short-term risks such as market swings, but being in or out of the EU did not pose medium or long-term risks to UK stability.

During his first term on the Bank's committee, Sharp said he'd been ""startled"" by the amount of time spent going through every single word in its Financial Stability Report and other announcements before publication.

He had also been disappointed by the ""postal cheque"" pace of decision-making involving cross-border cooperation.

The FPC holds a quarterly meeting on March 23 and makes a public statement on March 29.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 02:45:55+00:00,North Korea fires two short-range missiles into sea: South Korea,['Reuters Editorial'],"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meets scientists and technicians in the field of researches into nuclear weapons in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang March 9, 2016.

SEOUL North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast city of Wonsan early on Thursday, flying approximately 500 km (300 miles), South Korea's military said.

North Korea has a large stockpile of short-range missiles and is developing long-range and intercontinental missiles.

Reports of the missiles being fired coincide with already heightened tension on the Korean peninsula after the North conducted its fourth nuclear test in January and launched a long-range rocket last month, leading to new U.N. Security Council and bilateral U.S. sanctions.

The North fired six rockets into the sea last week using a multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) from Wonsan, supervised by leader Kim Jong Un who ordered his military to be prepared to launch pre-emptive attacks against enemies.

Kim said on Wednesday his country has miniaturized nuclear warheads to mount on ballistic missiles and ordered improvements in the power and precision of its arsenal in his first direct comment about nuclear warhead miniaturization.

State Department spokesman John Kirby declined to comment on Kim's claim to have miniaturized nuclear warheads and accused him of ""provocative rhetoric.""

""I'd say the young man needs to pay more attention to the North Korean people and taking care of them than in pursuing these sorts of reckless capabilities,"" Kirby said.

The Pentagon said this week it had not seen North Korea demonstrate a capability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead. But Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the department was working on U.S. ballistic missile defenses to be prepared.

North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 but its claim to have set off a miniaturized hydrogen bomb has been disputed by the U.S. and South Korean governments and many experts.

U.S. and South Korean troops began large-scale military drills this week, which the North called ""nuclear war moves"" and threatened to respond with an all-out offensive.

A BPI certified 100% compostable single-serve pod is seen in an undated photo supplied by Club Coffee in Toronto March 9, 2016.

TORONTO A long-awaited rebound in Canadian manufacturing is finally taking hold as currency hedges and contracts priced when the country's dollar was stronger expire, giving exporters a competitive edge, executives in the sector say.

The nation's C$2-trillion-dollar economy has been sluggish because of plunging commodity prices that have ravaged energy and mineral companies, forcing them to layoff workers and delay or abandon investment plans.

Some economists had expressed doubt that Canadian factories could overcome the lower labor costs of foreign competitors to make inroads in new markets.

But on the ground, manufacturing executives say the currency's two-year decline took time to feed through because many companies hedge their currency rates and sign fixed-price contracts months or years in advance.

With the currency dropping 38 percent at its January nadir from its 2007 peak - driven by falling oil prices and the resulting Canadian interest rate cuts - manufacturers say they are now reaping the benefit of lower costs, and pricing new contracts below global competitors.

""Every penny movement in the dollar adds about C$200,000 ($151,000) of profit to my bottom line,"" said Brad Bourne, chief executive of Toronto-based Firan Technology Group Corp, which makes circuit boards and cockpit panels for aerospace and defense equipment.

The Bank of Canada, which has been watching export trends closely, held interest rates steady on Wednesday, noting that while the economy is still struggling, ""non-energy exports are gathering momentum, particularly in sectors that are sensitive to exchange rate movements.""

Bourne said his 2015 sales were up 18 percent from the prior year, with almost half of that attributable to currency depreciation.

At Laval Tool and Mould, which exports 90 percent of its products, mostly to Mexico and the United States, President Jonathon Azzopardi said business is booming.

""There have been companies we've been trying to break into for five years in Europe who look at the Canadian dollar and say 'This is a good opportunity',"" he said. ""Now we're kind of like the low-cost country.""

Canadian exports reached a record C$46 billion in January when the currency hit a 12-year low, with volumes up 8.8 percent from a year earlier. Consumer goods and motor vehicles and auto parts were the standouts, each jumping roughly 40 percent on the year.

Michael Dolega, senior economist at TD Bank Group, noted it takes several quarters for firms to ramp up production and gain market share based on currency moves.

The expectation that the factory sector would have turned on a dime when the dollar dropped annoys John Pigott, chief executive of Toronto-based coffee pod maker Club Coffee, which exports about 40 percent of its product.

""It's not as simple as everybody thinks it is ... we had to let hedges and futures run. As well, you have to wait for contracts, they don't happen overnight,"" he said. ""I honestly think the Bank (of Canada) is sometimes lagging what is going on in reality in the marketplace.""

LOCKING IN THE WIN

Canadian manufacturers say they want policymakers to do more to support the sector now that the oil patch - seen as the favorite son under the former Conservative government - has slumped.

To keep the momentum, the government and central bank need to understand the value of a weak Canadian dollar and help companies reinvest in innovation, said Azzopardi, who has almost doubled his Canadian workforce since 2013 to 74.

Government support for education and the training of more skilled workers is also key, he said.

Having been on the wrong side of a strong Canadian dollar just a few years ago, FTG's Bourne is trying to extend as much of the benefit as he can, expanding the bank facility he uses to hedge his U.S. surplus for three years rather than just one.

But Azzopardi said the currency game can be as risky as it is beneficial. If Laval Tool and Mould drops prices today to win a contract, it could get burned if the Canadian dollar is back at par with the U.S. dollar when the delivery time arrives.

""If it is a project I know is close, I can offer more - I might offer 10 percent (price cut),"" he said. ""But I have some projects that take 2 or 3 years to become a reality, and you saw what the exchange rate can do in two or three years.""

He added that all the money raised this week would go to refinancing part of its debt that matures this year. He said that the company hopes to cut its debt by at least $3 billion this year.

TORONTO A long-awaited rebound in Canadian manufacturing is finally taking hold as currency hedges and contracts priced when the country's dollar was stronger expire, giving exporters a competitive edge, executives in the sector say.

The nation's C$2-trillion-dollar economy has been sluggish because of plunging commodity prices that have ravaged energy and mineral companies, forcing them to layoff workers and delay or abandon investment plans.

Some economists had expressed doubt that Canadian factories could overcome the lower labor costs of foreign competitors to make inroads in new markets.

But on the ground, manufacturing executives say the currency's two-year decline took time to feed through because many companies hedge their currency rates and sign fixed-price contracts months or years in advance.

With the currency dropping 38 percent at its January nadir from its 2007 peak - driven by falling oil prices and the resulting Canadian interest rate cuts - manufacturers say they are now reaping the benefit of lower costs, and pricing new contracts below global competitors.

""Every penny movement in the dollar adds about C$200,000 ($151,000) of profit to my bottom line,"" said Brad Bourne, chief executive of Toronto-based Firan Technology Group Corp, which makes circuit boards and cockpit panels for aerospace and defense equipment.

The Bank of Canada, which has been watching export trends closely, held interest rates steady on Wednesday, noting that while the economy is still struggling, ""non-energy exports are gathering momentum, particularly in sectors that are sensitive to exchange rate movements.""

Bourne said his 2015 sales were up 18 percent from the prior year, with almost half of that attributable to currency depreciation.

At Laval Tool and Mould, which exports 90 percent of its products, mostly to Mexico and the United States, President Jonathon Azzopardi said business is booming.

""There have been companies we've been trying to break into for five years in Europe who look at the Canadian dollar and say 'This is a good opportunity',"" he said. ""Now we're kind of like the low-cost country.""

Canadian exports reached a record C$46 billion in January when the currency hit a 12-year low, with volumes up 8.8 percent from a year earlier. Consumer goods and motor vehicles and auto parts were the standouts, each jumping roughly 40 percent on the year.

Michael Dolega, senior economist at TD Bank Group, noted it takes several quarters for firms to ramp up production and gain market share based on currency moves.

The expectation that the factory sector would have turned on a dime when the dollar dropped annoys John Pigott, chief executive of Toronto-based coffee pod maker Club Coffee, which exports about 40 percent of its product.

""It's not as simple as everybody thinks it is ... we had to let hedges and futures run. As well, you have to wait for contracts, they don't happen overnight,"" he said. ""I honestly think the Bank (of Canada) is sometimes lagging what is going on in reality in the marketplace.""

LOCKING IN THE WIN

Canadian manufacturers say they want policymakers to do more to support the sector now that the oil patch - seen as the favorite son under the former Conservative government - has slumped.

To keep the momentum, the government and central bank need to understand the value of a weak Canadian dollar and help companies reinvest in innovation, said Azzopardi, who has almost doubled his Canadian workforce since 2013 to 74.

Government support for education and the training of more skilled workers is also key, he said.

Having been on the wrong side of a strong Canadian dollar just a few years ago, FTG's Bourne is trying to extend as much of the benefit as he can, expanding the bank facility he uses to hedge his U.S. surplus for three years rather than just one.

But Azzopardi said the currency game can be as risky as it is beneficial. If Laval Tool and Mould drops prices today to win a contract, it could get burned if the Canadian dollar is back at par with the U.S. dollar when the delivery time arrives.

""If it is a project I know is close, I can offer more - I might offer 10 percent (price cut),"" he said. ""But I have some projects that take 2 or 3 years to become a reality, and you saw what the exchange rate can do in two or three years.""

reuters.com,2016-03-10 07:16:44+00:00,South Africa's Gordhan charms on roadshow but investors still wary,['Sujata Rao'],"LONDON South African finance minister Pravin Gordhan won applause for an impromptu London roadshow this week but left many global investors sceptical he could defend his country's investment grade rating - or even stay in office.

Appointed after a predecessor's sudden sacking, Gordhan is trying to woo back UK and U.S.-based investors and repair the damage from ""9-12"", the December day when President Jacob Zuma suddenly switched finance minister. It took the subsequent appointment of Gordhan, respected for a previous stint at the ministry, to calm markets.

But ""9-12"" was seen to have seriously dented South Africa's institutional credibility, adding to investor worries about an economy growing at less than one percent, high inflation, a balance of payments hole, weak commodity prices, frequent labour unrest and power shortages.

Hanging over all that is the very real risk South Africa will lose its investment-grade rating by mid-year, potentially raising borrowing costs for government and firms alike.

Investors who attended the London roadshow told Reuters they were open to being convinced by Gordhan.

""I left the place thinking the minister has good intentions, hopefully he stays in his job,"" said Claudia Calich, head of emerging debt at M&G Investments. ""But I wasn't thinking 'Wow, I should rush out and buy South Africa.'""

With Treasury officials, heads of companies such as Investec and Barclays Africa, and representatives of powerful trade unions all wearing scarves depicting South Africa's multi-hued flag, ""it was clearly a show of strength and to some extent it worked,"" said one bond investor who asked not to be named.

""But I didn't hear anything that made me believe there would be long-term reforms.""

Gordhan told Reuters the gathering reflected a ""new process of dialogue"" in an economy sapped by labour unrest.

But on Tuesday Moody's moved a step closer to cutting South Africa's rating to junk while data showed the current account deficit widening further and more South African firms heading overseas to invest.

POLITICS LARGER THAN GORDHAN

With two major agencies rating South Africa just a notch above junk, Gordhan's recent budget sharply cut deficit projections.

But sovereign bonds and credit default swaps (CDS) continue to price South Africa as if it were rated BB-plus, the highest junk category. Investors also questioned Gordhan's revenue targets and the absence of privatisation plans.

Then there are doubts over Zuma's backing for Gordhan after a public spat with revenue service chief Tom Moyane.

""People seemed too frightened to ask outright (about Gordhan) during the presentation,"" another attendee said.

But Nomura strategist Peter Attard Montalto said Gordhan had been quite open during the presentation and one-on-one meetings.

""Investors remain very worried on the politics, and their views are not really shifting on the inevitability of downgrade,"" he said.

Gordhan dismissed the fears, telling Reuters that Moyane was ""merely the administrative head of an entity"".

Kevin Daly, a portfolio manager at Aberdeen Asset Management said he came away from the meetings ""cautiously optimistic"", adding: ""They did their best to allay concerns about the reputational damage of '9-12'."".

Foreigners have sold stocks worth a net 14 billion rand ($910 million) already this year, an acceleration from last year's 765 million rand net outflow, stock exchange data shows.

Local bonds, which yield 8-9 percent are however still attracting money after a net 6.5 billion rand in 2015.

The bond investor said his allocation was smaller than South Africa's weight in indexes. Asked if the roadshow changed his view, he said: ""I am not going to put more money in, but maybe I won't take more out.""

The roadshow moves on to Boston and New York.

Republican U.S. presidential candidate Marco Rubio and rival candidate Donald Trump (R) speak simultaneously at the U.S. Republican presidential candidates debate in Detroit, Michigan, March 3, 2016.

Republican U.S. presidential candidate Marco Rubio talks with Fox News Channel anchor Megyn Kelly during an interview at a campaign rally in Miami, Florida, March 9, 2016.

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio voiced regret on Wednesday about making personal attacks against front-runner Donald Trump, a strategy that has failed to slow the New York billionaire's momentum.Rubio, Trump, Ohio Governor John Kasich and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the four remaining Republican presidential candidates, participated in a round of Fox News-sponsored town hall events a day before they meet for another debate on Thursday in Miami.

Rubio, whose campaign is fighting for survival after a series of disappointing performances in nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election, has drawn fire for a line of attack in recent weeks in which he got personal with Trump.

He called him a con artist and said among other things that he had small hands, a charge that Trump took to mean as questioning the size of his manhood.

Until Rubio got personal, the U.S. senator from Florida had largely stayed above the fray and had focused his assault on Trump from a policy standpoint.

He told Fox News' ""The Kelly File"" that if he had to do it over again, he would handle the issue differently.

""My kids were embarrassed by it. My wife didnt like it. I dont think it reflects good. Thats not who I am. Thats not what my campaign is going to be about or will ever be about again,"" Rubio said.

""Id do it differently  on the personal stuff. Im not telling you he didnt deserve it, but thats not who I am and thats not what I want to be,"" he added.

Rubio, 44, fared poorly when Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho and Hawaii voted on Tuesday. He needs to win his home state of Florida next Tuesday or face calls for him to exit the race.

He said opinion polls showing him lagging far behind Trump in Florida were not accurate.

""The fact of the matter is the only poll that counts is the one theyll take on Tuesday when they count the votes that these people are going to cast and were going to win in Florida, he said.

Cruz, 45, looking to emerge as the main Trump alternative should Rubio and Kasich falter, said he would keep the focus of the campaign on substantive issues.

""I don't have any views on Donald Trump's anatomy,"" Cruz said at his Fox News town hall.

BROKERED CONVENTION?

Kasich, at his Fox News town hall, said he believed he had a path forward if he wins his home state of Ohio on Tuesday, but that it involved a convention fight when Republicans gather to officially pick their nominee in Cleveland in July.

A contested convention would result if Trump, 69, does not win the required 1,237 delegates, forcing delegates to decide whether to back him at the convention or find a consensus candidate such as Kasich, 63.

President Gerald Ford and challenger Ronald Reagan staged a spirited nomination fight at the 1976 Republican National Convention, but no Republican convention has gone beyond a single ballot since Thomas Dewey's third-ballot win in 1948.

Trump, who has come under withering attack by mainstream Republicans for his statements on Muslims, illegal immigrants and trade policy, said at his Fox News town hall he had attracted many new voters to the Republican Party with his crossover appeal.

He said establishment Republicans would be risking the energy he had brought to the race by trying to prevent him from winning.

""They would be so foolish to throw it away,"" he told host Sean Hannity.

MANILA/MUMBAI Physical gold demand was slow in top consumer China, as the metal clung to this year's strong gains, while a strike by jewellers protesting against the imposition of a tax curbed demand in No. 2 market India.

Asian buyers have mostly skipped gold this year, anticipating a big retreat in prices that has yet to unfold.

Potential delays in U.S. interest rate hikes and a wobbly global economy have combined to lift gold to a 13-month high of $1,279.60 an ounce by March 4, following bullion's best rally in four years in February.

The metal was trading at around $1,250 on Thursday.

""I can't see any physical demand here,"" said William Wong, assistant head of dealing at Wing Fung Precious Metals in Hong Kong, who monitors gold demand in China.

Gold on the Shanghai Gold Exchange, the world's largest physical gold exchange, was either at parity to global prices or at a discount of up to $3 an ounce this week, said Wong.

There is no big reason for Chinese consumers to snap up gold at this time, with no long holiday or festival ahead, he said. ""And the price is too high,"" Wong added.

In Hong Kong, gold is being sold at a premium of 70 cents to $1 an ounce, unchanged from the prior week, said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers Ltd.

""People are still trying to digest whether it's really a boom market for gold,"" said Leung.

Gold demand in India was sluggish as jewellers were on strike to protest against a government decision to impose an excise duty of 1 percent on jewellery sales.

Dealers were offering a discount of up to $45 an ounce to the global spot benchmark, the same as last week. The discount hit a record $53 in late February.

Indian jewellers have been on an indefinite strike since the beginning of March to protest against the reintroduction of an excise duty on gold jewellery after four years.

The strike will continue until the government rolls back the tax, said G.V. Sreedhar, chairman of industry body the All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation.

The government was forced to roll back an excise duty it imposed in 2012 after a strike by jewellers that lasted 21 days. ""Due to the strike, business has come to a standstill. Jewellers are not making purchases as they have closed their shops,"" said Daman Prakash Rathod, a director at MNC Bullion, a wholesaler in India's southern city of Chennai. ""Gold imports will be negligible in March. Only refiners are importing dore to run refineries,"" Rathod said. Dore is an alloy of gold and silver that is refined to get pure gold.

Indian jewellery sales have fallen since the start of the year, hit by higher gold prices and delayed purchase decisions by consumers, who had hoped the national budget would cut an import duty of 10 percent.

But Finance Minister Arun Jaitley surprised the market by maintaining the level and imposing an excise duty on jewellery sales from March 1.

The new directors are former Morgan Stanley (MS.N) healthcare and biotech banker Catherine Friedman and former Broadcom Corp Chief Financial Officer Eric Brandt, the company said on Thursday.

The appointments come after Max Levchin and Charles Schwab resigned from the board late last year.

John Lewis and Waitrose employees wait for the announcement of their 2016 results linked bonus, at their flagship store in central London, Britain March 10, 2016.

John Lewis and Waitrose employees react as their 2016 bonus is announced in central London, Britain March 10, 2016.

LONDON Britain's John Lewis Partnership reported a full-year profit fall of nearly 11 percent and is paying a reduced staff bonus, hurt by higher pension charges, lower property profit and a tough trading environment.

The 151-year-old employee-owned group, which runs Britain's biggest department store chain and its sixth-largest supermarket business, Waitrose, said on Thursday that it would pay its 91,500 staff, known as partners, an annual bonus of 10 percent of salary, down from to 11 percent last year.

John Lewis made a profit before partnership bonus, tax and one-off items of 306 million pounds for the year to Jan. 30. That was within guidance of between 270 million pounds and 320 million pounds, but down 10.9 percent on the previous year's outcome.

Operating profit at the department store division fell 0.1 percent and was down 2 percent at Waitrose.

On a sales basis the Partnership has outperformed rivals for half a decade, helped by its strong online offer, modern stores and a bias to the more prosperous southeast of England.

However, 2015-16 profit was dented by pension charges that rose by 48.2 million pounds from the previous year.

John Lewis said that trading conditions would remain difficult, especially in food retailing but it expects to perform comparatively well against its rivals.

Sales after the first five weeks of its current financial year were up 4.2 percent on last year, but its upmarket Waitrose supermarkets recorded only a 0.4 percent rise on a like-for-like basis. Like-for-like sales at John Lewis department stores rose by 3.6 percent.

Some 14,000 people are stranded there after new border restrictions were imposed along the Balkan migration route. Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia said on Tuesday (March 8) they would place new restrictions on the entry of migrants and Macedonia responded on Wednesday by closing its border completely to illegal migrants, a police official said. Ai walked around the makeshift camp speaking with the migrants - seeing for himself the difficult conditions they have to brave as they wait to cross over to Macedonia and continue their trek northwards to wealthier European states. Ai, known for his criticism of China's human rights record, said he was witnessing a ""huge, big violation of human rights"" in the middle of Europe. ""What we have seen here is almost unbelievable, you know. If you say this is in the middle of Europe, all the people stuck here, and there's no hope for them even to be transferred to anywhere else, you know. It's just in the rain, in the cold, and women, children, all the people waiting for some bread, or some dry clothes, and this is a very sad situation and people have no hope because the door is closed, totally shut off. I think this is a huge, big violation of human rights, right in front of us. I don't know what is going to come out from this, but in Lesbos people still come in thousands every day, and here nobody tells them what to do, and they stay here, still having hope to go to Germany or some other location, but I think, as the sky is getting darker and I don't think there's much hope for them,"" he said. People fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and beyond have flooded into the EU since early 2015, most making the perilous sea crossing from Turkey to Greece, then heading north through the Balkans to Germany. But a cascade of border shutdowns in the Balkans has caused the blocking of the so-called 'Balkans corridor' used by more than a million people since the migratory wave started a year ago. More than 34,0000 people are now trapped on Greece's islands and mainland. At an emergency EU-Turkey summit on Monday (March 7), aimed to stem the migrant influx to Europe, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told leaders of the bloc Ankara was willing to take back all migrants who enter Europe from Turkey in future in return for financial aid, faster EU entry talks and quicker visa-free travel for its citizens. EU leaders aim to work out key details with Turkey by the next scheduled summit on March 17-18. European Council President Donald Tusk said the outcome would show migrants that there was no longer a path into Europe for people seeking a better life.",[]
reuters.com,2016-03-10 13:58:33+00:00,"Five Afghans, including baby, drown trying to reach Greece from Turkey","['Ayla Jean Yackley', 'Melih Aslan']","ISTANBUL Five Afghans, including two children and a six-month old baby, drowned in the Aegean overnight trying to reach Greece as Turkey starts to implement an EU agreement to curb illegal migration.

The stream of migrants risking perilous sea crossings has so far shown little sign of abating after Turkey reached the draft deal with the EU on Monday, under which it will try to stem the flow in return for funding and political rewards.

Turkey's EU Minister Volkan Bozkir said the deal, under which Ankara agreed to take back all irregular migrants, does not apply to those who have already reached the Greek islands and that the number returned was ultimately expected to be in the thousands or tens of thousands.

The top U.N. rights official voiced concern the tentative deal may lead to ""collective and arbitrary expulsions"" illegal under international law, and urged the EU to adopt a more humane set of measures at a summit on March 17.

One of the victims from Wednesday night's capsize, in which their boat hit rough weather as it traveled toward the Greek island of Lesbos, managed to swim ashore but died during attempts to revive him, a coastguard official told Reuters.

Of the four bodies found at sea, one was that of a six-month-old baby, rescuers said. Nine other people were pulled from the water alive.

""The rescue operation for the two others is continuing,"" the coastguard official said. Initial reports suggested Iranians were also among the group, but the coastguard later confirmed this was not the case.

The European Union has offered Turkey billions of euros in aid to curb illegal migration. Under the draft deal struck on Monday, Turkey also received promises of faster visa liberalization for Turks traveling to Europe, and a speeding up of Ankara's long-stalled EU membership talks.

The aim is to discourage illegal migrants and break the grip of human smugglers who have sent them on treacherous journeys across the Aegean. But migrants have continued to try to cross from Turkey's coast in recent days.

""Forming the mindset that 'You cant go there anymore, theres no hope there' is the basis of preventing (illegal migration),"" Bozkir told the state-run Anadolu agency.

He also said Turkey would meet by May 1 the EU's conditions for visa-free travel to Europe, seen by many Turks as the main benefit of the deal. EU leaders set requirements including changing Turkey's visa policy toward Islamic states and introducing harder-to-fake biometric passports.

Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said Turkey was already making progress fighting people smuggling networks, telling broadcaster NTV that 2,000 people had been arrested. He did not give a timeframe.

""Turkey is conducting a very effective fight. As you know, we will make illegal migration a terrorism crime. Every day and everywhere our security forces are apprehending organizers of illegal migration,"" he told NTV.

More than 130,000 people this year have reached Europe from Turkey, which borders Iran and conflict zones in Syria and Iraq, while 350 people have died on the perilous journey, according to the International Organisation for Migration.

More than 35,000 people are trapped at the Greek-Macedonian border at Idomeni as Europe tries to close the Balkan route to foreigners fleeing violence and economic upheaval.

Lo dice una nota della Corte di Giustizia Ue ricordando che tra le societa interessate al procedimento figurano in particolare le tedesche HeidelbergCement, Schwenk Zement e le italiane Buzzi Unicem e Italmobiliare.

Queste societa si erano rivolte alla Corte di Giustizia contestando in particolare alla Commissione Ue di non avere sufficientemente descritto le presunte infrazioni e di aver imposto un carico di lavoro sproporzionato per il volume delle informazioni richieste, la cui legittimita era stata confermata dal Tribunale.

Con le sentenza di oggi ""la Corte constata che il Tribunale e incorso in un errore di diritto nel ritenere che le decisioni della Commissione fossero sufficientemente motivate"".

Per la Corte, infatti, la motivazione sulla richiesta di informazioni e stata ""eccessivamente succinta, vaga e generica, alla luce, in particolare, dell'ampiezza considerevole delle domande poste"" e le domande poste non lasciano emergere in modo chiaro ed inequivocabile i sospetti d'infrazione.

Inoltre, a giudizio della Corte, visto che le informazioni sono state chieste vari mesi dopo l'avvvio del procedimento (la decisione sull'invio del questionario e stata presa a marzo del 2011) e piu di due anni dopo i primi accertamenti, la Commissione avrebbe potuto esporre con maggiore precisione i sospetti di infrazione in capo alle imprese.

""Di conseguenza, la Corte giunge alla conclusione che le decisioni della Commissione non sono sufficientemente motivate sul piano giuridico e decide di annullare le sentenze del Tribunale nonche le decisioni della Commissione"", dice la nota.

DHAKA A spelling mistake in an online bank transfer instruction helped prevent a nearly $1 billion heist last month involving the Bangladesh central bank and the New York Fed, banking officials said.

Unknown hackers still managed to get away with about $80 million, one of the largest known bank thefts in history.

The hackers breached Bangladesh Bank's systems and stole its credentials for payment transfers, two senior officials at the bank said. They then bombarded the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with nearly three dozen requests to move money from the Bangladesh Bank's account there to entities in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, the officials said.

Four requests to transfer a total of about $81 million to the Philippines went through, but a fifth, for $20 million, to a Sri Lankan non-profit organisation was held up because the hackers misspelled the name of the NGO, Shalika Foundation.

Hackers misspelled ""foundation"" in the NGO's name as ""fandation"", prompting a routing bank, Deutsche Bank, to seek clarification from the Bangladesh central bank, which stopped the transaction, one of the officials said.

There is no NGO under the name of Shalika Foundation in the list of registered Sri Lankan non-profits. Reuters could not immediately find contact information for the organization.

Deutsche Bank declined to comment.

At the same time, the unusually high number of payment instructions and the transfer requests to private entities - as opposed to other banks - raised suspicions at the Fed, which also alerted the Bangladeshis, the officials said.

The details of how the hacking came to light and was stopped before it did more damage have not been previously reported. Bangladesh Bank has billions of dollars in a current account with the Fed, which it uses for international settlements.

The transactions that were stopped totalled $850-$870 million, one of the officials said.

Last year, Russian computer security company Kaspersky Lab said a multinational gang of cyber criminals had stolen as much as $1 billion from as many as 100 financial institutions around the world in about two years.

Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's son Qusay took $1 billion from Iraq's central bank on the orders of his father on the day before coalition forces began bombing the country in 2003, American and Iraqi officials have said. In 2007, guards at the Dar Es Salaam bank in Baghdad made off with $282 million.

MONEY RECOVERED

Bangladesh Bank has said it has recovered some of the money that was stolen, and is working with anti-money laundering authorities in the Philippines to try to recover the rest.

A bank spokesman could not be reached for comment late on Thursday.

The recovered funds refer to the Sri Lanka transfer, which was stopped, one of the officials said.

Initially, the Sri Lankan transaction reached Pan Asia Banking Corp, which went back to Deutsche Bank for more verification because of the unusually large size of the payment, a Pan Asia official said. ""The transaction was too large for a country like us,"" the official said. ""Then (Deutsche) came back and said it was a suspect transaction."" A Pan Asia spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.

The dizzying, global reach of the heist underscores the growing threat of cyber crime and how hackers can find weak links in even the most secure computer networks.

More than a month after the attack, Bangladeshi officials are scrambling to trace the money, shore up security and identify weaknesses in their systems. They said there is little hope of ever catching the hackers, and it could take months before the money is recovered, if at all.

Security experts said the perpetrators had deep knowledge of the Bangladeshi institution's internal workings, likely gained by spying on bank workers.

The Bangladesh government, meanwhile, is blaming the Fed for not stopping the transactions earlier. Finance Minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith told reporters on Tuesday that the country may resort to suing the Fed to recover the money.

""The Fed must take responsibility,"" he said.

The New York Fed has said its systems were not breached, and it has been working with the Bangladesh central bank since the incident occurred.

The hacking of Bangladesh Bank happened sometime between Feb. 4-5, over the Bangladeshi weekend, which falls on a Friday, the officials said. The bank's offices were shut.

Initially, the central bank was not sure if its system had been breached, but cyber security experts brought in to investigate found hacker ""footprints"" that suggested the system had been compromised, the officials said.

These experts could also tell that the attack originated from outside Bangladesh, they said, adding the bank is looking into how they got into the system and an internal investigation is ongoing.

The bank suspects money sent to the Philippines was further diverted to casinos there, the officials said.

The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp, which oversees the gaming industry, said it has launched an investigation. The country's anti-money laundering authority is also working on the case.

LONDON Aviva chief executive Mark Wilson said on Thursday the insurer could give cash back to shareholders, after it beat forecasts with a 20 percent 2015 operating profit rise.

Aviva reported a solvency capital ratio under new European rules of 180 percent, at the top of its 150-180 percent target range. A ratio of 100 percent shows insurers have sufficient capital to cover underwriting, investment and operational risks.

Wilson said the company's strong capital position meant it could grow businesses organically, and reiterated it could also make ""bolt-on"" acquisitions in markets such as Poland.

""Capital returns to shareholders are also on our radar,"" he said on a media call following the results.

Aviva's shares rose 4 percent to 478 pence at 0825 GMT, the top performer in the FTSE 100 index.

Aviva bought rival Friends Life last year in a 5.6 billion pound deal, creating a market leader in life insurance.

The life and general insurer said it would achieve its target of 225 million pounds in integration synergies in 2016, a year ahead of schedule, and that it expected 1.2 billion pounds in capital synergies.

""The key question now is what will Aviva do with the additional cash - we think it will in part be used to hike future dividends,"" said Barrie Cornes, analyst at Panmure Gordon, in a note.

Aviva's operating profit of 2.7 billion pounds came in above expectations of 2.49 billion pounds from a forecast compiled by the insurer.

Its combined operating ratio, a key measure of performance in its general insurance business, strengthened to 94.6 percent, against a forecast of 96 percent. A level below 100 percent indicates an underwriting profit.

Aviva said floods in Britain in December had cost it 132 million pounds.

The company said it would pay a final dividend of 14.05 pence per share and total dividend of 20.8 pence, up 15 percent from 2014 but below a forecast of 21.2 pence.

Then leftist Egyptian presidential candidate Hamdeen Sabahy (C) gestures before a rally in Banha, northwest of Cairo, in this May 7, 2014 file photo.

CAIRO A prominent opponent of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said Egypt's fragmented pro-democracy opposition parties had ""failed"" the country and he vowed to forge a new movement able to provide a genuine alternative to the current government.

Hamdeen Sabahy, like many other leftists and nationalists, backed Sisi's 2013 overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the subsequent ban on the group.

Sabahy then became the only candidate to run against Sisi in the 2014 presidential election but won only 3 percent of the vote. He has since criticized Sisi's crackdown on democratic freedoms including the right to protest.

Sabahy told Reuters in an interview this week that Egypt's non-Islamist opposition groupings needed to bury their differences and forge a new united force that could offer a more democratic alternative to Sisi's government.

""We failed the Egyptian people. We were unable to form a serious organized body to represent them,"" he said, lamenting the lack of democracy and civic freedoms in Egypt five years after a 2011 uprising ended the 30-year rule of Hosni Mubarak.

""Egypt needs alternatives. When Egyptians realize that five years after the revolution the answers they are offered are the same ones they have always been offered then our job isn't just to point that out but to provide alternatives.""

This week the center-left Popular Current and some independent politicians merged with the Arab Nationalist Karama Party founded by Sabahy in a revived push to attract ordinary Egyptians disenchanted with Sisi's economic policies and crackdown on freedoms.

RESENTMENT

Sisi, who initially enjoyed strong support from Egyptians opposed to the Muslim Brotherhood, has seen his popularity begin to wane in recent months as the economy teeters on the verge of crisis and resentment builds over a series of police abuses.

Sabahy said the political environment was not conducive to organized protests or strikes, though he added this might change. The movement is considering running in local elections as a first step.

Several leftist and liberal parties initially planned to run in Egypt's parliamentary election late last year, but most dropped out as alliances crumbled and under-funded parties imploded. The result is a parliament dominated by Sisi supporters, Mubarak-era faces and big business.

Many opposition groups and activists snubbed the parliamentary poll, calling it a sham.

Sabahy himself has lost credibility among both loyalist and opposition Egyptians since he ran against Sisi. Dissidents said his candidacy gave political legitimacy to the poll, while Sisi supporters scorned what they saw as his failed act of defiance.

Sabahy said the new initiative, which has come under fierce attack from both sides, was not aimed at removing Sisi.

""The core of what we are offering is alternatives to how Egypt is governed, not who governs Egypt,"" he said.

Security Council resolutions, as South Korean and U.S. forces conducted massive war games.

The North also announced it had scrapped all agreements with the South on commercial exchange projects and would ""liquidate"" South Korean assets left behind in its territory.

North Korea has a large stockpile of short-range missiles and is developing long-range and intercontinental missiles as well. Thursday's missiles flew about 500 km (300 miles) into the sea, off the east coast city of Wonsan and probably were part of the Soviet-developed Scud series, South Korea's defense ministry said.

Japan, within range of the longer-range variant of Scud missiles or the upgraded Rodong missiles, lodged a protest through the North Korean embassy in Beijing, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported.

A Pentagon spokesman, Commander Bill Urban, said on Thursday the U.S. Defense Department was aware of the reports of the missile launches. ""We are monitoring the situation closely,"" he said.

North Korea often fires short-range missiles when tensions rise on the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang gets particularly upset about the annual U.S.-South Korea drills, which it says are preparations for an invasion.

The U.S. and South Korea remain technically at war with the North because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armed truce instead of a peace agreement.

Around 17,000 U.S. military personnel are participating alongside some 300,000 South Korean troops in what South Korea's Defense Ministry has called the ""largest-ever"" joint military exercises.

North Korea on Sunday warned it would make a ""pre-emptive and offensive nuclear strike"" in response to the exercises.

After Thursday's missile launches, North Korea announced it would ""liquidate"" South Korean assets left behind in the Kaesong industrial zone and in the Mount Kumgang tourist zone.

South Korea protested the move as ""totally unacceptable"" but did not say what it could do to recover the assets that it valued in excess of 1.4 trillion won ($1.17 billion).

Seoul suspended operations in the jointly run zone last month as punishment for the North's rocket launch and nuclear test.

Mount Kumgang was the first major inter-Korean cooperation project. Thousands of South Koreans visited the resort between 1998 and 2008. Seoul ended the tours in 2008 after a North Korean soldier shot dead a South Korean tourist who wandered into a restricted area.

North Korea is also livid about stepped-up United Nations sanctions adopted last week following its recent nuclear test and long-range missile launch.

South Korea's foreign ministry said Thursday's missile launches again violated a series of U.N. Security Council resolutions and it would refer the matter to the Council's sanctions committee mandated to enforce the resolutions.

Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Hong Lei described the situation on the Korean peninsula as ""complex and sensitive.""

""All sides should stop their provocative words and deeds to avoid a further rise in tensions,"" he said.

MINIATURIZED WARHEADS

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country has miniaturized nuclear warheads to mount on ballistic missiles, state media reported on Wednesday, and called on his military to be prepared to mount pre-emptive attacks against the United States and South Korea.

It was his first direct comment on the technology needed to deploy nuclear missiles. North Korean state media released photographs they said showed Kim Jong Un inspecting a spherical miniaturized warhead. State media have previously made that claim, which has been widely questioned and never independently verified.

South Korea's defense ministry said it did not believe the North had successfully miniaturized a nuclear warhead or deployed a functioning intercontinental ballistic missile.

U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby declined on Wednesday to comment on Kim's claim to have miniaturized nuclear warheads and accused him of ""provocative rhetoric.""

""I'd say the young man needs to pay more attention to the North Korean people and taking care of them, than in pursuing these sorts of reckless capabilities,"" Kirby said.

The Pentagon said this week it had not seen North Korea demonstrate a capability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead. But Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said on Wednesday the department was working on U.S. ballistic missile defenses to be prepared.

North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 but its claim to have set off a miniaturized hydrogen bomb last month has been disputed by the U.S. and South Korean governments and many experts, who said the blast was too small to back it up.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has not changed its key interest rate since cutting by a surprise 50 basis points in September. Governor Raghuram Rajan has emphasised the need for fiscal reform and stable inflation before he takes any further action.

India unveiled a fire-fighting budget last week that seeks to win back support among rural voters for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government and sustain growth against a grim global backdrop, putting the onus for support back on Rajan.

Junior Finance Minister Jayant Sinha said the tight fiscal policy could allow for further monetary easing. Also giving Rajan room to act, the poll of 23 economists predicted retail prices rose 5.60 percent in February, a touch slower than January's 5.69 percent.

""Food inflation eased in February...most likely due to the fact that temperatures have finally returned to normal, after unusually high temperatures earlier in winter led to delays in the sowing of rabi (summer) crops such as wheat and barley,"" said Shilan Shah, India economist at Capital Economics.

""The chances of there being perhaps one more rate cut in the near term have risen, but this is because the FY16/17 budget adopted a tighter fiscal stance than expected rather than any change in the outlook for inflation,"" he added.

Although inflation has been climbing since July, it has remained below the RBI's January 2016 target of 6 percent for nearly a year-and-a-half.

The RBI is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points at its April 5 meeting and follow up with a second cut in the last three months of 2016, a separate Reuters poll conducted last week found, as it tries to boost flagging growth.

Indian industrial production was expected to contract for a third straight month in January, the latest poll also found.

Economists predicted Friday's data will show a fall of 0.5 percent in factory output, following a 1.3 percent and 3.4 percent decline in December and November respectively.

""Although auto sales are doing well and the manufacturing PMI recovered very recently, other indicators such as rail freight and production in 'core' industries remain weak,"" said Devika Mehndiratta, ANZ Research's chief Asia economist.

The slight rebound is likely due to a similar bounce back in infrastructure output, which rose 2.9 percent in January, up from December's 0.9 percent. Infrastructure output accounts for over one-third of the wider industrial measure.

LONDON Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored the winner as Paris St Germain beat Chelsea 2-1 to knock them out of the Champions League for the second successive season at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.

PSG's victory after their 2-1 first-leg win in Paris put Laurent Blanc's team into the last eight for the fourth successive season 4-2 on aggregate.

A composed display built on superb passing outclassed the English champions and confirmed the runaway Ligue 1 leaders as one of the favourites to win this season's premier European club competition.

PSG went ahead in the 16th minute when Angel Di Maria found Ibrahimovic, sent off when the sides clashed at the same stage a year ago, wide on the right.

The 34-year-old Swedish striker's cross eluded the defence for Adrian Rabiot to tap in, giving Thibaut Courtois no chance.

But Chelsea, without injured skipper John Terry at the back, recovered with neat moves of their own and equalised with a superbly constructed goal when Diego Costa checked past Thiago Silva to fire wide of Kevin Trapp after 27 minutes.

The hosts, however, lost their cutting edge when Costa went off injured and Ibrahimovic turned in Di Maria's cross from close range after 67 minutes, meaning Chelsea needed to score three times to win the tie.

""It was a difficult game for us but we never change our philosophy, we try to play with the ball and create gaps to score,"" PSG's former Chelsea defender David Luiz told BT Sport.

""It was a collective victory. Everyone knows how hard it is to play here. We kept calm and we scored at key moments.""

Chelsea's interim manager Guus Hiddink bemoaned the gulf in quality between the sides.

""You saw the difference between the squads when we had to bring young guys on and they have Edinson Cavani to come in,"" the Dutchman said.

""We gave too much respect in the first 10 minutes, they were dominating. They are a good side but once we stepped up we had some chances.""

PSG, who have only lost twice in 44 matches in all competitions this season and are set to win the French League for the fourth successive year, took an early grip on the game with Ibrahimovic linking superbly with Di Maria and Lucas.

They deserved their opening goal, but Chelsea, who have improved after a poor start to the season, began to impose themselves with Willian central to most of their best moves and Costa a constant threat.

Costa went off with a calf injury and the visitors wrapped up the match and the tie through Ibrahimovic's goal.

Chelsea, languishing 10th in the domestic standings, now have the FA Cup as their only hope of a trophy this season as PSG eye bigger prizes.

According to Markit data, 'short interest' - which measures the number of shares lent to speculators betting on a fall in the stock - in Ocado has climbed to a life-time high of 23.1 percent of the shares out on loan.

In order to profit from a stock falling, short sellers borrow the stock and sell it, expecting it to drop in value so they can buy it back at a lower price and pocket the difference.

Ocado shares have fallen about 7 percent since last week when Amazon and British supermarket Morrisons agreed to offer fresh and frozen goods to customers, in some places as quickly as under one hour.

Enabling the U.S. online retail giant to compete with Britain's biggest supermarket stores and smallest local shops, the deal opened another front on Amazon's assault on the 178 billion pounds British grocery market, already hammered by a brutal price war and changing shopping habits.

Since 2013, Morrisons has outsourced logistics for its own online food business to Ocado, whose range includes products supplied by upmarket grocer Waitrose.

""We continue to struggle to see the Ocado brand being a sustainable retail label as the business fundamentally depends upon its relationships with Morrisons and Waitrose for its commercial survival,"" Clive Black, head of research at Shore Capital, said.

""The significance of this (Amazon-Morrisons deal) for Ocado is that the commercial heat is rising in the pure-play grocery arena in metropolitan areas where Ocado is particularly active.""

Ocado missed out on its own target of securing a first overseas technology deal in 2015. Also, Amazons deal with Morrisons has diminished Ocados own chances of being taken over by Amazon, which has been periodically speculated on.

The UK grocery market has been convulsed in recent years by shoppers turning to discounter retailers such as Aldi and Lidl, which has put pressure on the ""Big Four"" of Tesco, Sainsbury, Wal-Mart's Asda and Morrisons.

The British Retail Consortium predicts that 900,000 retail jobs could go by 2025 as the industry moves online.

It slashed its inflation expectations for this year but also suggested that interest rates would go no lower.

In moves that briefly pushed the euro 1 percent down against the dollar, the ECB cut its deposit rate deeper into negative territory and increased monthly asset buys to 80 billion euros from 60 billion euros, above expectations of a hike to 70-billion.

While the deposit rate was cut 10 basis points to -0.4 percent, the main refinancing rate was shaved to zero from 0.05 percent and its marginal lending rate -- used by banks to borrow from the ECB overnight -- fell to 0.25 percent from 0.3 percent.

""Rates will stay low, very low, for a long period of time and well past the horizon of our purchases,"" ECB President Mario Draghi, judged to have disappointed markets in December with measures below expectations, told a news conference.

Purchases are due to end in March next year.

He added, ""From today's perspective and taking into account the support of our measures to growth and inflation, we don't anticipate that it will be necessary to reduce rates further,""

The ECB said it would also start buying corporate debt and launch four new rounds of cheap loan packages, to be extended by banks to the real economy.

Slashing its 2016 inflation forecast from one percent to just 0.1 percent, the Bank said further rounds of ultra-cheap four-year loans to banks could include extra financial sweeteners for them to take up the offer to pass on to others.

""A bank that is very active in granting loans to the real economy can borrow more than a bank that concentrates on other activities,"" Draghi noted.

REACTION

""Good news for Europe: Having delivered less than expected in December, the ECB returned to its usual form today and eased policy by a bit more than projected,"" said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg bank.

But others were more critical, warning that such loose monetary policy risked creating asset price bubbles and removed any incentive for governments to reform their economies.

""What will happen if the global economic situation deteriorates sharply once more, requiring a strong monetary policy response? I do not anticipate this happening, but if it did, the ECB would have already shot most of its powder, said Michael Menhart, chief economist at German reinsurer Munich Re.

Draghi answered such criticisms partly in German, arguing: ""Suppose we had embraced the 'nein zu allem' ('no to everything') policy strategy? We deem that the counterfactual would have been a disastrous deflation.""

But he acknowledged the limitations of negative rates and said any future moves would likely have to focus on other, non-conventional measures.

""Does it mean that we can go as negative as we want without having any consequences on the banking system? The answer is no,"" he said.

The ECB has little to show for the 700 billion euros it has spent buying government bonds and other assets in the past year, as tumbling raw materials prices blunt the impact of its quantitative easing.

That raises the risk that people will lose faith in the bank's commitment to its mandate. Inflation has been below the ECB's nearly 2 percent target for three years and is likely to remain so for many more.

The ECB's move came after the G20 group of the world's major economies last month agreed they need to look beyond ultra-low interest rates and printing money to shake the global economy out of its torpor.

The U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, Bank of England and Swiss National Bank are all set to meet next week.

While Europe's growth prospects have held up relatively well on resilient domestic consumption, weak business and industrial sentiment indicators suggest it is facing increasing headwinds, particularly from slowing growth in China.

The government of Africa's leading copper producer started a review of the 2002 mining code in 2012, aiming to increase state revenues and tighten environmental and social regulations.

However, an official at the prime minister's office told Reuters last month the government had decided to freeze consideration of a draft code submitted to parliament last March until metal markets had recovered from their recent weakness.

Benchmark copper prices fell 25 percent last year and several mines in Congo's copper-producing southeast have cut their workforces.

A group of 42 Congolese non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that have participated in talks with the government and mining sector over the new code said on Thursday that difficult market conditions did not justify further delays.

""Not doing it now is prolonging the bleeding of revenues in the sector which are needed to support our young democracy,"" they said in a statement that urged the government to clarify its position.

Congo held its first free election in 2006. It is set to hold another election in November when President Joseph Kabila is due to step down. The country has never had a peaceful transition of power.

Mining companies, which have lobbied hard against the new code, say more onerous taxes and royalties would drive away investment.

However, the NGOs called the recent decline in minerals prices ""a temporary and random event"" and noted the existing code was passed when the average price of copper was about $1,500 per ton in 2002. Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange was trading at $4,915 a ton at 1215 GMT .

Congo produced 995,805 tonnes of copper in 2015, down slightly from 2014. It also mines significant quantities of gold, tin and cobalt.

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden (L) and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu look at each other as they deliver joint statements during their meeting in Jerusalem March 9, 2016.

JERUSALEM A hold-up over a new U.S. defense package for Israel was behind Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to forgo a meeting with President Barack Obama in Washington this month, a senior Israeli official said on Thursday.

Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely's remarks contrasted with a statement by Netanyahu that cited his reluctance to risk being drawn into the U.S. presidential campaign as the reason for declining a White House offer to host him on March 18.

Current U.S. military grants to Israel, worth about $3 billion annually, expire in 2018.

Israel, which last year requested $5 billion in future annual aid but whose officials have since set their sights on $4 billion to $4.5 billion, says it needs to expand its military, rather than just upgrade technologies, given spiraling arms procurement it anticipates by arch-foe Iran and Arab states.

U.S. officials have given lower target figures of around $3.7 billion. The dispute prompted Israeli officials to hint that Netanyahu may bank on Obama's successor for a better deal.

""There was a decision not to go to the president as long the agreement over the compensation package is not concluded,"" Hotovely told Israel Radio, using a term linking the future U.S. aid to last year's international nuclear deal with Iran, which brought sanctions relief that Tehran may use for arms purchases.

""The prime minister wants to honor the U.S. president by going when there is a basis, good news on the matter of the U.S. aid package,"" she said. ""This really has to be taken seriously.""

U.S. officials say they still hope for an agreement before Obama leaves office next January.

FRAUGHT RELATIONSHIP

The White House's announcement on Monday that Netanyahu had turned down the meeting with Obama was seen as the latest episode in a fraught relationship that has yet to recover from deep differences over the Iran nuclear deal.

Some U.S. sources assessed that Netanyahu wanted the MOU concluded before meeting Obama and that the lag was among the reasons for not coming to Washington, where he was to have addressed the annual conference of the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC.

Vice President Joe Biden, in Jerusalem on Wednesday for discussions with Netanyahu that included the ""Memorandum of Understanding"" (MOU) on defense aid between 2018 and 2028, appeared to acknowledge Israel's terms.

""We're committed to making sure that Israel can defend itself against all serious threats, maintain its qualitative edge with a quantity sufficient to maintain that,"" Biden said.

U.S. negotiators have made clear that, while they want Israel to maintain a technological advantage over its neighbors, they differ over the level of risk of increased quantities of less-advanced arms in the hands of Washington's Arab allies who seek to counter Iran.

British scientist and theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking attends a launch event for a new award for science communication, called the Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication, in London, Britain in this December 16, 2015 file photo.

LONDON Stephen Hawking has joined more than 150 top scientists in calling for Britain to stay in the European Union, saying that leaving would be ""a disaster for UK science and universities"".

The physicist and other members of the Royal Society, including three Nobel laureates, made the case against Brexit, as leaving is widely called, in a letter to The Times on Thursday. They argued that losing EU links would be devastating for research on two fronts.

""First, increased funding has raised greatly the level of European science as a whole and of the UK in particular because we have a competitive edge,"" they wrote.

""Second, we now recruit many of our best researchers from continental Europe, including younger ones who have obtained EU grants and have chosen to move with them here.

""Being able to attract and fund the most talented Europeans assures the future of British science and also encourages the best scientists elsewhere to come here.""

They said Switzerland, which pays into the EU, was now struggling to attract young talent after voting to restrict the free movement of workers.

Britons are to vote on the issue in a June referendum.

SAO PAULO O dolar recuava frente ao real nesta quinta-feira, reagindo a denuncia do Ministerio Publico paulista contra o ex-presidente Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, mas as perdas eram limitadas por especulacoes de que o Banco Central poderia aproveitar a queda recente para reduzir sua atuacao no cambio.

As 12:10, o dolar recuava 0,65 por cento, a 3,6731 reais na venda. A moeda norte-americana atingiu 3,6390 reais no menor nivel da sessao, renovando a minima intradia desde 1o de setembro de 2015 (3,6192 reais), e subiu a 3,7110 reais na maxima do dia.

A moeda norte-americana fechou em queda em seis das ultimas sete sessoes, acumulando baixa de 7,66 por cento no periodo. O dolar futuro avancava 0,1 por cento.

""O fator politico e o grande direcionador da moeda e assim sera por algum tempo"", disse o economista da corretora Lerosa Investimentos Carlos Vieira.

Na noite passada, o MP paulista denunciou Lula por suspeita de ser o proprietario oculto de um apartamento triplex no Garuja, no litoral paulista.

Muitos operadores vem vendendo dolares, em um movimento concentrado no mercado futuro, apostando que eventuais mudancas no governo poderiam ajudar a recuperacao da economia brasileira. Alguns analistas ponderam, porem, que as turbulencias politicas tendem a pressionar a confianca.

O movimento de queda da moeda norte-americana era limitado porque alguns operadores acreditam que o BC pode aproveitar a queda recente para reduzir o estoque de swaps cambiais, contratos equivalentes a venda futura de dolares.

Na sexta-feira passada, quando o dolar desabou apos Lula ser levado para questionamento pela Policia Federal, o BC vendeu apenas parcialmente a oferta de swaps para rolagem dos contratos para abril. No entanto, a autoridade monetaria nao reduziu a oferta nos leiloes seguintes e voltou a vender desde entao o lote integral.

""O mercado encheu de ruido sobre o BC. Algumas pessoas acham que ele pode ver espaco para diminuir a rolagem neste mes"", disse o operador de uma corretora nacional. O BC rolou integralmente os ultimos sete vencimentos de swaps.

Nesta sessao, continuou na mesma toada e vendeu a oferta total de 9,6 mil contratos no leilao de swaps para rolagem nesta sessao. Ao todo, a autoridade monetaria ja rolou 3,663 bilhoes de dolares, ou cerca de 36 por cento do lote total para abril, que equivale a 10,092 bilhoes de dolares.

A forte queda do dolar vista mais cedo neste pregao foi influenciada tambem pela decisao do Banco Central Europeu (BCE) de afrouxar a politica monetaria mais do que o esperado. Esse efeito perdeu forca ao longo da manha, porem, apos o presidente do BCE, Mario Draghi, afirmar que nao preve mais cortes de juros a frente.

MIAMI Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sparred over immigration at a debate on Wednesday night, days ahead of a crucial nominating contest in Florida, but directed their strongest fire on Republican front-runner Donald Trump.

Clinton and Sanders, competing for Hispanic votes next Tuesday in a state where about one-fourth of the population is Latino, promised to deport only illegal immigrants with criminal records and not to deport children.

In the event hosted by Spanish-language network Univision and carried on CNN, they took turns repeatedly ripping into Trump for his remarks about Mexicans and his pledge to deport all illegal immigrants living in the United States.

Look, in this country, immigration reform is a very hot debate,"" said Sanders. ""I would hope very much that as we have that debate, we do not, as Donald Trump and others have done, resort to racism and xenophobia and bigotry.

His idea of suddenly one day or maybe a night rounding up 11 million people and taking them outside of this country is a vulgar, absurd idea that I would hope very few people in America support, the U.S. senator from Vermont said.

Floridians will vote next week in Democratic and Republican primaries in a state rich in the delegates that candidates need to become their respective parties' nominees to run in the November presidential election.

Trump and his rivals for the Republican nomination - U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Ohio Governor John Kasich, and Florida's U.S. Senator Marco Rubio - will hold their pre-primary debate in Miami on Thursday night.

Florida, with its preponderance of Cuban-Americans and Latinos from other countries, has recently seen an influx of Puerto Ricans fleeing the U.S. island commonwealth's economic downturn.

Sanders and Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state and U.S. senator, spent much of their second debate this week currying the favor of Florida's Latinos, and that of the Hispanic audience watching nationwide.

Both promised to take a less aggressive approach than President Barack Obamas administration toward deportation.

Said Clinton, I think it's important that we move to our comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time stop the raids, stop the roundups, stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives, doing their jobs, and that's my priority.

Sanders and Clinton said they would carry forward Obamas executive actions granting relief from deportation for parents of children born in the United States and for children brought into the country illegally. Both said they supported creating a legal path to citizenship for those immigrants.

Last year, Trump enraged Hispanic activists by labeling Mexicans criminals and rapists when he announced his campaign, and continued making inflammatory comments, including proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country.

Asked by moderators point-blank if Trump is a racist, Clinton replied, His rhetoric, his demagoguery, his trafficking in prejudice and paranoia has no place in our political system.

For Sanders, it was his first clash with Clinton since his surprise win on Tuesday in Michigans primary. He crowed that some had called the victory one of the major political upsets in modern American history.

The 74-year-old senator won most of the delegates up for grabs in Michigan, but Clinton, who won Mississippi on Tuesday, still leads Sanders with 1,221 delegates to his 571.

While Florida is next Tuesday's biggest prize, contests will also be held in other states heavy in delegates: Illinois, North Carolina and Ohio.

In the two-hour debate, Clinton, 68, deflected an unusually large number of tough questions about her record as secretary of state under President Obama.

At one point, moderator Jorge Ramos asked her if she would drop out of the race if she is indicted in the Justice Department's investigation into her use of a private email server while running the State Department.

""Oh, for goodness,"" Clinton replied, visibly frustrated. ""That's not going to happen. I'm not even answering that question.""

During Modi's visit, the two countries signed a land boundary agreement, more than four decades after the neighbours first tried to resolve the complex territorial disputes.

BALTIMORE Michael Phelps has emerged from one of the darkest periods of his life as a happy man and immersed himself in a career revival, which is bad news for anyone looking to spoil his bid for a glorious Olympic farewell.

The American swimmer, who owns a record 18 Olympic gold medals, retired after winning four golds and two silver medals at the 2012 London Games.

Yet deep down, Phelps knew he did not give his best in 2012 and after hitting a personal low in 2014, rededicated himself, embracing life and working harder than ever in hopes of leaving the sport after the Rio Olympics on a high note at the ripe age of 31.

""I'm happy with who I am, Im happy where I am. I'm happy with what Im doing and I feel like a kid again,"" Phelps told Reuters at the Under Armour complex in Baltimore where he was promoting a TV commercial for the apparel maker.

""I feel more relaxed in my own skin than I've ever been, and I'm happier than I've ever been. It's the best spot I've ever been in my life.""

His impending marriage to former Miss California Nicole Johnson and eagerly awaited arrival of their baby boy have enriched the man, who despite all his triumphs had been sorely troubled in the past.

""I look back to 2012 and how I prepared for that and I can tell you it was a joke. It was,"" said Phelps. ""I had no passion and wasn't really too into it. I had no motivation. I think I needed time away from everything - from the sport, from my family, my friends, from every single part of my life.""

Phelps hit bottom in late 2014 with his second arrest on a drunken driving charge that resulted in a six-month ban by USA Swimming and 45 days in alcohol rehabilitation.

'REALLY BAD DOWNS'

It was a life-changing experience for Phelps, who has not had an alcoholic drink since.

""Its probably the most afraid Ive ever felt in my life, he told Sports Illustrated following his experience at the in-patient treatment program. ""I was in a really dark place, not wanting to be alive anymore.""

The most decorated Olympian dealt with other incidents over the years. In February 2009, a photograph of him using a water pipe on a college campus surfaced, bringing him a three-month suspension by USA Swimming.

In November 2004 at age 19, he was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and sentenced to 18 months' probation.

""If you asked me if I would change anything in my life I would say no,"" Phelps told Reuters. ""There were some good ups and Ive been through some really bad downs.

""But its what has come from those experiences both ways, I think, (that) has really made me who I am today and thats something that Im very proud of.""

A hard look at himself helped turn things around.

""To be able to sit down and just think about what I wanted to do, where I wanted to go. Who I am, really. And to be able to do that has allowed me to live more free, to be happy with who I am,"" he said.

COMPETITIVE FORM

Phelps has poured himself into his bubbly life and the quest to cap his legendary swim career in style.

""My sisters getting married, Im getting married, were having a kid, bought a house, were getting ready for Olympic trials, were getting ready for the Olympics,"" said Phelps, rattling off a to-do list.

""We just decided to do it all in one year. Why not?""

Phelps has been building back to competitive form ahead of June's U.S. championships in Omaha.

""I never wanted to look back 20 years down the road and say 'what if I did this differently, what if I did that differently,'"" said Phelps, who has a record 22 Olympic medals.

""This is me giving 100 percent. I dont really know besides 2000 the last time that I gave a hundred, hundred percent. I decided everything I do is going to be (aimed) to retire how I want.""

Looking superbly fit, Phelps gave a 20-minute glimpse of his rigorous out-of-pool workout at the sprawling Under Armour gym.

He squatted 315 pounds, exercised his core using a pulley, a rolling wheel and a ball, before finishing on the monkey bars, stopping at each rung to do pull-ups until he began tearing skin off his hands.

Phelps refused to specify his ""lofty goals"" for Rio, but believes his story is headed for a happy ending.

""My whole life has been a dream come true,"" said Phelps. ""It's time to put some icing on the cake this summer.""

The most anticipated match at the tournament between India and arch-rivals Pakistan was shifted to Kolkata on Wednesday over concerns about security at the original venue for the March 19 clash at Dharamsala.

""Until on a government level we are ... given a public guarantee (of safety), unfortunately we are not in a position to give the Pakistani team permission to go to India,"" Pakistani Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan told reporters.

Outside of international tournaments, cricket matches between India and Pakistan have been suspended since gunmen killed 166 people in Mumbai in a three-day rampage in 2008, which India blames on a Pakistani militant group.

Top cricket countries have also refused to tour Pakistan since 2009, when gunmen attacked a bus carrying a visiting Sri Lanka team near Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium.

The International Cricket Council said on Wednesday it had been given assurances on security from all the Indian state authorities that are hosting matches.

Republican U.S. presidential candidate Marco Rubio and rival candidate Donald Trump (R) speak simultaneously at the U.S. Republican presidential candidates debate in Detroit, Michigan, March 3, 2016.

Republican U.S. presidential candidate Marco Rubio talks with Fox News Channel anchor Megyn Kelly during an interview at a campaign rally in Miami, Florida, March 9, 2016.

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio voiced regret on Wednesday about making personal attacks against front-runner Donald Trump, a strategy that has failed to slow the New York billionaire's momentum.Rubio, Trump, Ohio Governor John Kasich and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the four remaining Republican presidential candidates, participated in a round of Fox News-sponsored town hall events a day before they meet for another debate on Thursday in Miami.

Rubio, whose campaign is fighting for survival after a series of disappointing performances in nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election, has drawn fire for a line of attack in recent weeks in which he got personal with Trump.

He called him a con artist and said among other things that he had small hands, a charge that Trump took to mean as questioning the size of his manhood.

Until Rubio got personal, the U.S. senator from Florida had largely stayed above the fray and had focused his assault on Trump from a policy standpoint.

He told Fox News' ""The Kelly File"" that if he had to do it over again, he would handle the issue differently.

""My kids were embarrassed by it. My wife didnt like it. I dont think it reflects good. Thats not who I am. Thats not what my campaign is going to be about or will ever be about again,"" Rubio said.

""Id do it differently  on the personal stuff. Im not telling you he didnt deserve it, but thats not who I am and thats not what I want to be,"" he added.

Rubio, 44, fared poorly when Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho and Hawaii voted on Tuesday. He needs to win his home state of Florida next Tuesday or face calls for him to exit the race.

He said opinion polls showing him lagging far behind Trump in Florida were not accurate.

""The fact of the matter is the only poll that counts is the one theyll take on Tuesday when they count the votes that these people are going to cast and were going to win in Florida, he said.

Cruz, 45, looking to emerge as the main Trump alternative should Rubio and Kasich falter, said he would keep the focus of the campaign on substantive issues.

""I don't have any views on Donald Trump's anatomy,"" Cruz said at his Fox News town hall.

BROKERED CONVENTION?

Kasich, at his Fox News town hall, said he believed he had a path forward if he wins his home state of Ohio on Tuesday, but that it involved a convention fight when Republicans gather to officially pick their nominee in Cleveland in July.

A contested convention would result if Trump, 69, does not win the required 1,237 delegates, forcing delegates to decide whether to back him at the convention or find a consensus candidate such as Kasich, 63.

President Gerald Ford and challenger Ronald Reagan staged a spirited nomination fight at the 1976 Republican National Convention, but no Republican convention has gone beyond a single ballot since Thomas Dewey's third-ballot win in 1948.

Trump, who has come under withering attack by mainstream Republicans for his statements on Muslims, illegal immigrants and trade policy, said at his Fox News town hall he had attracted many new voters to the Republican Party with his crossover appeal.

He said establishment Republicans would be risking the energy he had brought to the race by trying to prevent him from winning.

""They would be so foolish to throw it away,"" he told host Sean Hannity.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 15:04:18+00:00,Oil meeting on output freeze unlikely without Iran progress: sources,['Rania El Gamal Alex Lawler'],"The logo of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is pictured at its headquarters in Vienna, Austria, August 21, 2015.

DUBAI/LONDON A meeting between oil producers to discuss a global pact on freezing production is unlikely to take place in Russia on March 20, sources familiar with the matter say, as OPEC member Iran is yet to say whether it would participate in such a deal.

OPEC officials including Nigeria's oil minister have said a meeting would take place in Moscow on that date, potentially as the next step in widening an agreement to freeze output at January levels struck by OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Qatar plus non-member Russia last month.

But the biggest roadblock to a wider deal, OPEC delegates say, is Iran. Tehran feels it should be exempt from the agreement as it wants to recover market share it lost under Western sanctions. Kuwait said on Tuesday it will commit to the deal - if all major producers including Iran do so.

""They are not agreeing on the meeting. Why would the ministers meet again now? Iran says they will not do anything,"" said an OPEC source from a major producer. ""Only if Iran agrees, things will change.""

The pact on freezing output has helped support oil prices, which started a slide in mid-2014 due to oversupply. Brent crude LCOc1 was trading above $40 a barrel on Thursday, up 50 percent from a 12-year low of $27.10 reached in January.

Some delegates are wary that if many oil producers met too soon before getting the nod from everyone, prices could weaken again if the talks ended in disarray.

""Our view is not to go there with the possibility of no agreement so as not to affect prices negatively,"" said another source from a major OPEC member, referring to the proposed March 20 meeting.

OPEC's Gulf members favor meeting in the first half of April, in Doha or another Gulf city, a Gulf delegate said last week.

Another OPEC delegate was more pessimistic, saying he expected no major progress until OPEC's next scheduled meeting in June.

IRAN COMPROMISE?

Tehran has rejected freezing its output at January levels, put by OPEC secondary sources at 2.93 million barrels per day (bpd), and wants to return to much higher pre-sanctions production.

""Tehran wanted a freeze ... for them to be based on 4 million barrels per day, their pre-sanctions production figure,"" said one source familiar with the discussions. A source familiar with Iranian thinking agreed.

The issue is set to be discussed when Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak meets Iranian counterpart Bijan Zanganeh. Novak is visiting Tehran on Monday, RIA news agency reported, citing the Russian embassy in Iran.

Some OPEC sources hinted that there could be a workable agreement on the table to get Tehran on board.

""If they are willing to find a solution, they should offer a fair deal to Iran,"" one said.

There are precedents for OPEC members to be exempt from agreements on output restraint. Iraq, for example, was not included for many years due to sanctions and war.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI India said on Thursday it hoped to unlock gas and oil resources worth almost $40 billion by simplifying licensing rules and offering price incentives to recover gas from difficult offshore fields.

Energy demand in India far outstrips consumption, but regulated low prices for gas from prolific but challenging deepwater fields have deterred investment in the sector.

Under the reforms, companies will have more freedom to set the price of gas from new discoveries and existing finds not yet in production. But they will be subject to a ceiling price set according to the landed price of alternatives such as fuel oil, naphtha, coal and liquefied natural gas, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told a news conference. The ceiling price would be reviewed every six months. (bit.ly/1SBTo7v)

This will help boost gas output by at least 35 million cubic meters a day (mmscmd) for 15 years, equivalent to a total of 6.75 trillion cubic feet over that period, Pradhan said. India's current gas production is about 90 mmscmd.

The move will benefit companies like Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, the country's top explorer, and Gujarat State Petroleum Corp, a government-run firm in the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ONGC said last month it wanted higher gas prices before it starts production from its east coast deepwater block.

Reliance Industries, currently in a legal battle with the government over gas pricing, will have to either withdraw its case or wait for it to conclude before it can benefit from the new rules.

An oil ministry official said there would be no immediate output increase as production from these difficult fields would take at least three years to come on stream.

India, which imports two-third of its oil needs, will also offer a common exploration license for different hydrocarbons like oil, natural gas, shale oil and gas and coal bed methane, in order to more quickly tap its vast resources.(bit.ly/1TNXyuq)

Pradhan said the new proposal would help reduce government intervention and could boost foreign investment in Indian oil and gas when global oil prices recover.

India has also decided to extend the exploration licenses of 28 discovered oil and gas fields, awarded mainly to ONGC and Oil India, without bidding.

The cabinet granted control of the western offshore Ratna and R-Series oil and gas fields to ONGC. The fields stopped production in 1996, when they were awarded to the Essar Group controlled by India's billionaire Ruia brothers.

""Resource worth 2.61 trillion rupees ($38.92 billion) will be brought to production as a result of today's decision,"" Pradhan said.

Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports

INDIAN WELLS, California The shock of Maria Sharapova's failed drug test has cast a spotlight on the attention to detail her fellow players apply to medications and supplements, and most say they take as little as possible.

With Russian Sharapova now facing a ban of up to four years pending an investigation by the International Tennis Federation, the tennis world has been served a timely reminder that playing safe when it comes to drugs is always the best strategy.

""You can get pretty generic stuff now that makes you feel better if you're sick and it's got to be a very special case for me to take something specific,"" big-serving American Sam Querrey told Reuters on Wednesday.

""You've just got to be responsible for everything you take. You have to check everything in this day and age with USADA (United States Anti-Doping Agency). I don't take caffeine. I just drink water and Gatorade.

""I don't even take any shakes or mixed drinks or anything like that. If I have flu, I take an aspirin or a Tylenol (paracetamol). I keep it very basic.""

Spanish left-hander Rafa Nadal, a 14-times grand slam champion, adopts a similar strategy.

""I am not taking many things,"" Nadal told reporters at Indian Wells ahead of the BNP Paribas Open. ""I am just taking the things when I am on the tennis court, in the orange bottles.

""I use two bottles - one has water and one has only mineral salts, and that's it. Anti-inflammatories sometimes - Ibuprofen or Voltaren.

""The other things I sometimes take are natural things, just medicine if I have need to overcome something when I feel not good.""

Sharapova stunned the tennis world with her announcement on Monday that she had tested positive for meldonium, which some researchers have linked to increased athletic performance and endurance.

MADE 'A HUGE MISTAKE'

Though she had been taking the Latvia-pioneered drug for a decade on the advice of her family doctor, it has been outlawed by the World Anti-Doping Agency since Jan. 1 but the Russian said she made ""a huge mistake"" and continued using it.

That error by one of the most experienced players on the WTA circuit shocked her peers and has refocused their attention to their own medical needs.

""If any of my friends or I go to a doctor, we bring our banned list and that's how we go if we are getting medications or supplements,"" American doubles specialist Bethanie Mattek-Sands, 30, told Reuters.

""You go on the USADA website and look up pretty much any supplement, any ingredient, any medication. And it's due diligence, it's a part of being a pro athlete.

""The lists change when new medications come out, and you always have to be aware of that. From my first day as a professional, they tell you that you are responsible for everything that's in your body.""

While Nadal does not check for himself the email notifications sent to players before the start of each year about substances and medications on the banned list, he has implicit trust in his medical team.

""My doctor is the doctor of the Spanish Federation with a lot of years experience,"" said the Spaniard. ""He is the doctor for all the Spanish tennis players so I have full confidence in him and I never take nothing that he doesn't know.

""I am a completely clean guy. I have worked so much during my career and if I get an injury, I get injured. I never take nothing to come back quicker.

""I believe in sport, the values of sport. If I am doing something that goes against that, I will be lying to myself, not lying to my opponents, and that will be something really bad for me. I never had the temptation of doing negative things.""

Sky said the timing and size of the initial public offering were not clear, but cited market sources as saying it would likely happen this year. (bit.ly/1QOrZdT)

Krispy Kreme UK owner Alcuin Capital Partners did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and Krispy Kreme UK declined to comment.

The UK IPO market has been subdued so far this year amid worries about a global economic slowdown and uncertainty about Britain's future in the European Union.

As of the end of February, eight companies had listed in London, raising 385 million pounds ($545 million). That compared with 468 million pounds raised by 11 companies in the same period last year, according to the London Stock Exchange.

Alcuin bought Krispy Kreme UK from an investment group led by three American entrepreneurs in 2011. The Telegraph reported then that the deal was worth 25 million pounds.

Krispy Kreme UK, the largest maker of premium branded doughnuts in the country, has a franchise agreement with U.S.-based Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc (KKD.N).

Brussel Eine Woche vor dem nachsten EU-Gipfel herrscht Uneinigkeit in der Union uber die Rolle der Turkei in der Fluchtlingskrise und den Umgang mit Tausenden an der griechisch-mazedonischen Grenze gestrandeten Migranten.

Osterreichs Innenministerin Johanna Mikl-Leitner machte am Donnerstag deutlich, dass die Balkanroute fur Fluchtlinge geschlossen bleibe und ihr Land so lange wie notig an nationalen Grenzkontrollen festhalte. Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel kritisierte dagegen nationale Alleingange und forderte die EU auf, die Verantwortung fur die in Griechenland festsitzenden Fluchtlinge zu ubernehmen. EU-Migrationskommissar Dimitris Avramopoulos warnte vor einer Katastrophe fur die Menschen im griechischen Grenzort Idomeni.

Die EU-Innenminister berieten in Brussel auch uber das geplante Abkommen mit der Turkei zum Stopp der Migrationsstrome, das am kommenden Donnerstag beim EU-Gipfel beschlossen werden soll. Mikl-Leitner nannte es auerst fragwurdig, wenn die Turkei die EU mit einer Wunschliste konfrontiere und Visa-Befreiungen in Aussicht gestellt bekomme, nachdem kurz zuvor eine regierungskritische Zeitung unter Zwangsverwaltung gestellt worden sei. ""Da stelle ich mir schon die Frage, ob wir unsere Werte letztendlich uber Bord werfen."" Auch aus dem EU-Parlament hatte es am Mittwoch Kritik an den Planen gehagelt, die eine Visa-Befreiung fur Turken ab Juni, eine Aufstockung der EU-Finanzhilfen und die direkte Ubernahme von Syrern aus den turkischen Fluchtlingslagern vorsehen.

Bundesinnenminister Thomas de Maiziere forderte vor den Beratungen mit seinen EU-Kollegen, die Kritikpunkte losungsorientiert und nicht destruktiv abzuarbeiten. In Deutschland kamen immer weniger Fluchtlinge an und die Vereinbarungen mit der Turkei leisteten einiges dafur, dass das auch so bleibe. Am Mittwoch reisten nach Angaben der Bundespolizei nur 125 Migranten in Deutschland ein, der zweitniedrigste Tageswert in diesem Jahr.

Kanzlerin Merkel kritisierte in einem MDR-Radio-Interview, dass die einseitigen Grenzschlieungen Osterreichs und der Balkanlander Deutschland zwar weniger Fluchtlinge bringe, zugleich aber den EU-Partner Griechenland in eine schwierige Situation bringe. Dagegen hatte EU-Ratsprasident Donald Tusk den Balkanstaaten am Mittwoch dafur gedankt, die Route fur Migranten geschlossen zu haben.

EU-KOMMISSAR WARNT VOR KATASTROPHE IN IDOMENI

Zugleich blieb die Zukunft fur mehr als 35.000 Fluchtlinge unklar, die infolge der Grenzschlieungen in Idomeni gestrandet sind. Das dortige Fluchtlingslager versinkt nach heftigen Regenfallen im Schlamm. Der luxemburgische Auenminister Jean Asselborn nannte die Bilder von dort scheulich und forderte, die Lage zu verbessern. De Maiziere sagte, er habe gehort, dass die griechischen Behorden vor Ort mittlerweile neue Unterkunfte angeboten hatten. ""Es ist nicht zuviel verlangt von den Fluchtlingen, dass sie in bessere Unterkunfte gehen als in die schlechten, in denen sie bisher sind."" Die EU hat Griechenland bis zu 700 Millionen Euro an Nothilfe zur Versorgung der Fluchtlinge im eigenen Land zur Verfugung gestellt.

GENEVA China has written to diplomats and U.N. officials urging them not to attend a Geneva event on Friday where the Dalai Lama will speak, reasserting that it opposes his appearance at all venues due to his ""separatist activities"".

Reuters reported in October that China is waging a campaign of intimidation, obstruction and harassment that Western diplomats and activists say is aimed at silencing criticism of its human rights record at the United Nations.

In a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday, China's diplomatic mission in Geneva raised objections about the presence of Tibet's exiled spiritual leader on the panel of Nobel laureates, being held at the Geneva Graduate Institute.

""Inviting the 14th Dalai Lama to the aforementioned event violates the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China, in contravention of the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter. China resolutely opposes the 14th Dalai Lama's separatist activities in whatever capacity and in whatever name in any country, organisation or event,"" it said.

The letter was dated March 8, the day that the event - being sponsored by the United States and Canada - was announced.

""The Permanent Mission of China kindly requests the Permanent Missions of all Member States, U.N. agencies and relevant International Organizations not to attend the above-mentioned event, nor meet the 14th Dalai Lama and his clique.""

The Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Price in 1989, fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Communist rule. China views him as a separatist, but the monk says he only wants genuine autonomy for his Himalayan homeland.

No delegation is making a formal complaint about China at the four-week session but there has been criticism recently of its mass arrests of lawyers, including from the United States.

A joint statement critical of China, sponsored by about a dozen countries including the United States, is to be read out at the forum on Thursday around midday (1200 GMT), the U.S. mission's spokesman in Geneva said.

He declined to comment on China's request for a boycott, saying: ""I refer you to Chinese authorities for their views. We do not comment on the substance of our diplomatic exchanges.""

Philippe Burrin, director of the Geneva institute, said that ""pressures are being applied from various sides"" but the event would not be cancelled.

""This is a question of freedom of expression and academic freedom to organise an event,"" he told Reuters.

""It is not an event on Tibet, it is not on a politically sensitive subject, i.e. territorial issues, but on the role of civil society in promoting human rights,"" he said.

U.N. Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, Kate Gilmore, the panel's moderator, is believed to be one of the first senior U.N. officials to meet the Dalai Lama.

The event, which also features Nobel laureates from Iran and Yemen, is taking place on the sidelines of the annual session of the U.N. Human Rights Council, which monitors and examines violations worldwide.

Thursday is the fifty-seventh anniversary of the beginning of the Tibetan peoples peaceful uprising against Chinas invasion and occupation of Tibet.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 10:42:02+00:00,Opera becomes first big browser maker with built-in ad-blocker,['Eric Auchard'],"FRANKFURT Norwegian company Opera is introducing a new version of its desktop computer browser that promises to load web pages faster by incorporating ad-blocking, a move that makes reining in advertising a basic feature instead of an afterthought.

Faster loading, increased privacy and security and a desire for fewer distractions are behind the growing demand for ad-blockers.

However, their popularity is cutting into the growth of online marketing for site publishers and corporate brands, who rely on reaching web and mobile users to pay for their content rather than restricting access to paid subscribers.

Opera has a history of introducing innovations that later become common in major browsers such as tabbed browsing and pop-up blocking, which helped users control an earlier generation of in-your-face ads and malware disguised as advertising.

""Ad-blocking technology is an opportunity and a wake-up call to the advertising industry to pay attention to what consumers are actually saying,"" an Opera spokeswoman said.

Opera said it can cut page-loading times by as much as 90 percent by eliminating the complex dance that occurs behind the scenes in a user's browser as various third-party ad networks deliver promotional messages to users.

The Norwegian company, which has agreed to a takeover by a group of Chinese firms led by Beijing Kunlun Tech in a cash deal valued at $1.23 billion, introduced its first computer web browser in 1995.

With the rise of the smartphone, it shifted to focus on the mobile browser and advertising market, where it now derives most of its revenue and counts 281 million users.

Opera said on Thursday it was introducing a version of its browser aimed at software developers and early adopters, but will eventually offer the feature for both computers and phones.

The Oslo-based firm ranks a distant fifth behind more mainstream desktop computers browsers from Microsoft, Google, Firefox and Apple. The company counts 60 million active monthly desktop users worldwide.

Opera sees no contradiction in the fact that it relies on advertising for a big chunk of its own revenue but is introducing ad-blocking control features in its products. Demand for ad-blocking should abate when messages became less disruptive and more relevant, an Opera spokeswoman said.

Because it is building the features directly into its browser, page delivery times are 40 percent faster than existing ad-blocker plug-ins, or browser extensions, it said. Top plug-in providers include AdBlock, AdMuncher and Ghostery that run on top of existing browsers.

A study published by PageFair and Adobe estimated online ad revenue lost to blockers in 2015 would amount to $21.8 billion and those losses could almost double to $41.4 billion in 2016. Ad-placement firm Carat forecasts global digital and mobile advertising will near $150 billion this year.

Picture taken February 29, 2016.

Berlin Ein Sieger der Landtagswahlen in Baden-Wurttemberg, Rheinland-Pfalz und Sachsen-Anhalt steht nach Umfragen schon fest: In allen drei Landern wird die rechtspopulistische AfD voraussichtlich erstmals in die Landesparlamente einziehen und ihren Siegszug fortsetzen.

Damit hatte die Partei erstmals den Sprung in die Parlamente westdeutscher Flachenlander geschafft. In Sachsen-Anhalt werden ihr sogar 19 Prozent vorhergesagt - damit ware die AfD aus dem Stand drittstarkste Kraft.

Ob sich die Partei mit den erwarteten Wahlerfolgen in der politischen Landschaft aber etablieren wird konnen, ist aus Sicht von Politologen fraglich. ""Die AfD hat sich noch nicht konsolidiert, das ist noch eine Koalition von verschiedenen Stromungen"", sagt der Politologe Jurgen Falter. Ahnlich sieht es auch der Politikwissenschaftler Oskar Niedermayer, der die Starke der Rechtspopulisten auf Protestwahler zuruckfuhrt, die vor allem den etablierten Parteien einen Denkzettel verpassen wollten.

Noch im vergangenen Sommer, als sich der wirtschaftsliberale Flugel um den AfD-Mitbegrunder Bernd Lucke abspaltete und nationalkonservative Krafte um Parteichefin Frauke Petry das Kommando ubernahmen, sahen viele Politologen die Partei auf dem Weg in die Bedeutungslosigkeit. Erst mit dem Anwachsen der Fluchtlingskrise kehrte sich der Abwartstrend in Umfragen um.

EXPERTE: AFD PROFITIERT VON MERKELS FLUCHTLINGSPOLITIK

Viele Wahler fuhlen sich von dem islamkritischen Kurs der AfD-Spitze und der kaum kaschierten Fremdenfeindlichkeit vieler Parteifunktionare angezogen. ""Wer gegen Angela Merkels Fluchtlingspolitik ist, der kann ja auerhalb Bayerns eigentlich nur AfD wahlen oder zu Hause bleiben"", urteilt Falter. ""Das starkt die AfD ganz enorm."" Auch der Chef des Meinungsforschungsinstituts Forsa, Manfred Gullner, geht von einem ""groeren Mobilisierungseffekt"" der massenhaften Fluchtlingsbewegungen fur die AfD aus.

Allerdings agiert die AfD in der Fluchtlingsfrage nicht einheitlich. Das bekam auch Partei-Chefin Petry zu spuren, als sie sich in einem Interview dafur aussprach, zur Not Fluchtlinge auch mit Waffengewalt am Grenzubertritt zu hindern. Anschlieend musste sie sich nach Angaben aus Parteikreisen massive Kritik wegen der negativen Schlagzeilen anhoren. Ahnlich umstritten ist der Thuringer AfD-Landeschef Bjorn Hocke, der etwa den etablierten Parteien vorwirft, Deutschland abschaffen zu wollen. Bislang haben diese parteiinternen Streitigkeiten jedoch nicht zu einem Einbruch in den Umfragewerten gefuhrt.

MEUTHEN SIEHT KEINE GEFAHR DER RADIKALISIERUNG

Co-Parteichef Jorg Meuthen, der sich in Baden-Wurttemberg zur Wahl stellt, vermeidet Auerungen an der Grenze zum Rechtsradikalismus. Die von AfD-Gegnern beschworene Gefahr, die Rechtspopulisten ruckten immer mehr in die Nahe von Rechtsradikalen, weist er zuruck. ""Es gibt verschiedene Flugel in der Partei, das ist unstrittig"", sagt er. ""Aber ich furchte weder ein Nach-Links-Rucken noch ein Nach-Rechts-Rucken. Das ist alles nicht das, woruber wir nachdenken.""

Der 54 Jahre alte Meuthen ist eine Art Uberbleibsel der alten Lucke-AfD, die als Professoren-Partei galt. Der Wirtschaftswissenschaftler hat eine Professur an der Hochschule Kehl inne und gibt sich betont burgerlich. Mit seiner Wahl in den baden-wurttembergischen Landtag durfte auch sein Einfluss in der Bundesspitze wachsen. Zumal die noch vor Monaten unangefochtene Co-Chefin Petry nach diversen Alleingangen als angeschlagen gilt. Aus Sicht Meuthens ist jedenfalls noch nicht entschieden, wer die AfD in den Bundestagswahlkampf 2017 fuhren wird. ""Wer in welcher Form bei der Bundestagswahl in welcher Funktion antritt, ist derzeit in unserer Partei uberhaupt noch kein Thema. Das wird sich dann spater zeigen.""

Moglicherweise ist die AfD bis dahin auch wieder in den Sinkflug ubergegangen. Aus Sicht von Niedermayer steht und fallt das Schicksal der Partei mit dem Losen der Fluchtlingskrise. Auch Falter sagt: ""Die AfD kann noch sehr einbrechen, wenn die eigentlichen Anlasse fur den Protest vorbei sein sollten.""",[]

reuters.com,2016-03-10 14:25:42+00:00,Revolutionary Guards commander says Iran's missile work will not stop: state TV,['Parisa Hafezi'],"ANKARA A senior Revolutionary Guards commander has said that Iran's ballistic missile program will not stop under any circumstances and that Tehran has missiles ready to be fired, according to Iranian state television.

Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh made his comments after a series of ballistic missile tests conducted by guard units that drew international concern, including a call by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for new sanctions against Iran.

The tests, which state television said ended on Wednesday night, were seen as a challenge to a United Nations resolution and last year's nuclear accord with world powers under which Tehran agreed to curb its atomic program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions.

""Iran's missile program will not stop under any circumstances,"" Hajizadeh said. ""The IRGC has never accepted the U.N. Security Council resolutions on Iran's missile work.

""We are always ready to defend the country against any aggressor. Iran will not turn into Yemen, Iraq or Syria,"" he was quoted as saying by state television.

The Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) maintains an arsenal of dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles - the largest in the Middle East, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.

Tehran says its missile program is solely for defensive use with conventional, non-nuclear warheads.

Iran's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that the tests were not in violation of the nuclear agreement, which led to lifting of sanctions in January.

The Guards said the tests were aimed at displaying Iran's ""deterrent power and its ability to confront any threat"".

""Some of the missiles carried 24 warheads and one tonne of TNT,"" said Hajizadeh, who heads the Guard's aerospace division.

Hajizadeh said Iran had no intention of starting a war, ""but the Zionist regime (Israel) is our enemy and we don't trust American officials.""

""We have underground tunnels around the country and under mountains, where we store our missiles... These tunnels cannot be destroyed even if targeted by atomic bombs,"" he said.

State TV in October aired footage of long tunnels with ready-to-fire missiles on the back of trucks, saying the facility was one of hundreds of underground missile bases around the country.

The United States imposed sanctions against businesses and individuals in January over another missile test in October 2015. But Iranian officials have repeatedly expressed Tehran's determination to develop what it called Iran's defense capabilities.

The United States said on Wednesday it was aware of and reviewing reports of an additional Iranian ballistic missile test and that the administration would determine an appropriate response.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif about the missile tests, a State Department spokesman said.

But Iran's Students News Agency ISNA said on Thursday that Zarif and Kerry had not discussed the issue.

""John Kerry has sent emails to Zarif asking for a telephone call to discuss issues, including Iran's missile tests, but it did not happen because Zarif is on an official visit,"" ISNA quoted a source as saying.

Geoffrey Mwamba, vice-president of the United Party for National Development (UPND), who was arrested on March 3, appeared in court together with 21 party members alleged to have been undergoing militia training.

""My lady, I deny the charge,"" Mwamba told the magistrate after being asked to plead. The trial is due to start on May 3.

Mwamba was last week arrested on separate charges of inciting violence against President Edgar Lungu, after threatening to ""go for his throat"".

Political tensions are mounting in the southern African nation before presidential, parliamentary and local elections in Aug. 11. Analysts say Lungu faces a serious challenge from UPND leader Hakainde Hichilema.

Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) said it appointed two independent directors, returning the size of its board to nine people as it explores the sale of its core business amid pressure from activist investors.

The new directors are former Morgan Stanley (MS.N) healthcare and biotech banker Catherine Friedman and former Broadcom Corp Chief Financial Officer Eric Brandt, the company said on Thursday.

The appointments come after Max Levchin and Charles Schwab resigned from the board late last year.

Reuters reported on March 4 that Yahoo executives would meet this week with Starboard Value, an activist hedge fund that has led the push for the company to sell its core business. The two sides will discuss whether they can come to an agreement in order to avoid a proxy fight for control of Yahoo..

Shareholders have until March 26 to submit nominations for board members to be elected at Yahoo's annual meeting this spring. Starboard has said it is willing to launch a proxy fight with its own nominations.

Telecommunications company Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and publisher Time Inc (TIME.N) are among the companies expected to bid for Yahoo's core business, while some private equity firms are expected to team up to make offers.

The private-equity owner of Krispy Kreme's UK business has hired investment bank Investec to oversee a flotation of the doughnut and coffee chain, Sky News reported without citing sources.

Sky said the timing and size of the initial public offering were not clear, but cited market sources as saying it would likely happen this year. (bit.ly/1QOrZdT)

Krispy Kreme UK owner Alcuin Capital Partners did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and Krispy Kreme UK declined to comment.

The UK IPO market has been subdued so far this year amid worries about a global economic slowdown and uncertainty about Britain's future in the European Union.

As of the end of February, eight companies had listed in London, raising 385 million pounds ($545 million). That compared with 468 million pounds raised by 11 companies in the same period last year, according to the London Stock Exchange.

Alcuin bought Krispy Kreme UK from an investment group led by three American entrepreneurs in 2011. The Telegraph reported then that the deal was worth 25 million pounds.

Krispy Kreme UK, the largest maker of premium branded doughnuts in the country, has a franchise agreement with U.S.-based Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc (KKD.N).

News of the share sale follows chocolate maker and retailer Hotel Chocolat's announcement on Wednesday that it planned to raise 50 million pounds through a listing on London's junior AIM market.

The Krispy Kreme brand started in the United States in 1937. The UK business opened for business in 2003 at Harrods department store in London.

It slashed its inflation expectations for this year but also suggested that interest rates would go no lower.

In moves that briefly pushed the euro 1 percent down against the dollar, the ECB cut its deposit rate deeper into negative territory and increased monthly asset buys to 80 billion euros from 60 billion euros, above expectations of a hike to 70-billion.

While the deposit rate was cut 10 basis points to -0.4 percent, the main refinancing rate was shaved to zero from 0.05 percent and its marginal lending rate -- used by banks to borrow from the ECB overnight -- fell to 0.25 percent from 0.3 percent.

""Rates will stay low, very low, for a long period of time and well past the horizon of our purchases,"" ECB President Mario Draghi, judged to have disappointed markets in December with measures below expectations, told a news conference.

Purchases are due to end in March next year.

He added, ""From today's perspective and taking into account the support of our measures to growth and inflation, we don't anticipate that it will be necessary to reduce rates further,""

The ECB said it would also start buying corporate debt and launch four new rounds of cheap loan packages, to be extended by banks to the real economy.

Slashing its 2016 inflation forecast from one percent to just 0.1 percent, the Bank said further rounds of ultra-cheap four-year loans to banks could include extra financial sweeteners for them to take up the offer to pass on to others.

""A bank that is very active in granting loans to the real economy can borrow more than a bank that concentrates on other activities,"" Draghi noted.

REACTION

""Good news for Europe: Having delivered less than expected in December, the ECB returned to its usual form today and eased policy by a bit more than projected,"" said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg bank.

But others were more critical, warning that such loose monetary policy risked creating asset price bubbles and removed any incentive for governments to reform their economies.

""What will happen if the global economic situation deteriorates sharply once more, requiring a strong monetary policy response? I do not anticipate this happening, but if it did, the ECB would have already shot most of its powder, said Michael Menhart, chief economist at German reinsurer Munich Re.

Draghi answered such criticisms partly in German, arguing: ""Suppose we had embraced the 'nein zu allem' ('no to everything') policy strategy? We deem that the counterfactual would have been a disastrous deflation.""

But he acknowledged the limitations of negative rates and said any future moves would likely have to focus on other, non-conventional measures.

""Does it mean that we can go as negative as we want without having any consequences on the banking system? The answer is no,"" he said.

The ECB has little to show for the 700 billion euros it has spent buying government bonds and other assets in the past year, as tumbling raw materials prices blunt the impact of its quantitative easing.

That raises the risk that people will lose faith in the bank's commitment to its mandate. Inflation has been below the ECB's nearly 2 percent target for three years and is likely to remain so for many more.

The ECB's move came after the G20 group of the world's major economies last month agreed they need to look beyond ultra-low interest rates and printing money to shake the global economy out of its torpor.

The U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, Bank of England and Swiss National Bank are all set to meet next week.

While Europe's growth prospects have held up relatively well on resilient domestic consumption, weak business and industrial sentiment indicators suggest it is facing increasing headwinds, particularly from slowing growth in China.

Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks during the Univision News and Washington Post Democratic U.S. presidential candidates debate in Kendall, Florida March 9, 2016.

WASHINGTON Major U.S. hedge fund managers are on pace this year to more than double the amount they gave in the 2012 election campaign, with independent fundraising groups backing Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Ted Cruz receiving the most so far.

About $47 million has been lavished on presidential candidates and lawmakers and the political action committees that support them by two dozen of the industry's top managers in the first 13 months of this election season, according to a Reuters review of Federal Election Commission filings. (For a list of the top givers see tmsnrt.rs/1nlPYZv)

Most of the hedge fund support going to Cruz and Clinton has come from a handful of people out of the two dozen managers studied.

Robert Mercer, co-chief executive of Renaissance Technologies, for example, has given $11 million to Keep the Promise I, a Super PAC that supports Cruz. Mercer is an enigmatic computer programmer who is a powerful financial force in conservative politics.

Cruz wants to abolish the tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service, slash income and payroll taxes and impose a new ""business transfer tax."" Cruz's wife, Heidi Cruz, is a Goldman Sachs executive in Houston.

Clintons main benefactor is billionaire George Soros, a long-time patron of Democratic and humanitarian causes and chairman of Soros Fund Management. Soros alone is responsible for $7.3 million of the $11.7 million that has gone to Super PACs and other committees supporting Clinton.

The hedge fund managers' spokespersons either declined to comment or did not respond to queries from Reuters.

But Whitney Tilson, a hedge fund manager who runs Kase Capital, said one reason fellow managers are spending more this election is Donald Trump, the front-runner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.

""There are some pretty heated emotions about Donald Trump,"" said Tilson, who plans to support the Democratic Party nominee.

Trump, who says he is self-funding his campaign, supports closing a loophole that lets some hedge fund managers pay less than the usual income tax rate on performance fees they get known as ""carried interest."" Clinton supports this, too.

The Managed Funds Association, an industry lobbying group, declined to comment on policy aims under the next president.

BIG MONEY, LITTLE IMPACT

There are other worries, too, about a Trump presidency.After months of campaigning and debates, Trump's economic and financial policy positions are still sketchy or unknown.

A Trump presidency could bring ""tremendous uncertainty and instability,"" said Gregory Wawro, a political science professor at Columbia University.

Wawro speculated that Trumps popularity with blue-collar and middle-class voters could prompt the Republican Party to reassess an approach to taxes and economic issues that has favored top earners and major corporations in recent years.

The surge of hedge fund donations has had little effect on the Republican race so far.

Cruz is running well behind Trump while U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is seen by establishment Republicans as their best hope to stop Trump winning the nomination, is a distant third.

Conservative Solutions, a Super PAC that backs Rubio, received $2.5 million from Paul Singer, the long-time Republican fundraiser who runs Elliott Management, and another $2.6 million in contributions from hedge fund manager Kenneth Griffin of Citadel Investment Group.

Two other Republican candidates with major hedge fund backing, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, have dropped out of the race.

Christie's Super PAC, America Leads, received about $3 million from Steve Cohen of Point72 Asset Management, while Right to Rise, a PAC that supports Bush, drew $450,000 in donations from managers including Citadel's Griffin, David Tepper of Appaloosa Management and Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management.

In the Democratic race, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders has eschewed donations from Wall Street. He has racked up a string of wins in early state nominating contests with attacks on Wall Street and calls for a more equitable distribution of the country's wealth.

Overall, hedge fund contributions to 2016 presidential candidates and lawmakers and the PACs supporting them favored Republicans over Democrats by about 3 to 2.

TOKYO A Japanese court on Wednesday ordered Kansai Electric Power (9503.T) to halt operations at two nuclear reactors at its Takahama plant, disrupting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to restore atomic power five years after the Fukushima crisis.

The move could potentially throw government energy policy into disarray, with the nuclear industry only recently starting to get reactors back online amid widespread public scepticism after the meltdowns at Fukushima in 2011.

The order by the Otsu District Court, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, demands the halt of the No. 3 and No. 4 nuclear reactors at Takahama and takes immediate effect. This is the first injunction issued in Japan to halt a nuclear plant that is under operation.

Kansai said it will shut the No. 3 reactor, which restarted in January, on Thursday.

Kansai Electric had been working to restart the Takahama No. 4 reactor this month after an unplanned shutdown due to a technical problem last week.

Japanese lower courts sometimes hand down contentious verdicts that are then overturned by higher courts, where judges tend to be more attuned to political implications, judicial experts say.

Kansai Electric said it would not accept the verdict and would quickly appeal the injunction, but it could mean months or possibly a year of delays and extra costs for oil, gas or coal to replace the nuclear generation.

""This is a wake up call for nuclear industry and the government. They can no longer take for granted that the judiciary will follow the old ways,"" said Mutsuyoshi Nishimura, a former Japanese government official and chief climate change negotiator.

Japan's chief government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said that there was no change in Tokyo's stance on safety at the Takahama reactors or in its policy of promoting the restart of reactors that meet new safety standards.

A Kansai Electric spokesman said it has now become extremely difficult to enact a reduction in the power fees that it charges customers planned for May that would have passed on the fuel cost savings from the Takahama restart.

Kansai, which in January projected its first profits in five years for this business year as a result of the Takahama plant restart and lower energy prices, said it cannot estimate the impact on earnings.

Kansai is aiming to restart two reactors at its Ohi nuclear plant, which is close to clearing the regulator's safety checks, after a separate court decision in December paved the way for the restart of the Takahama and Ohi plants.

And authorities still dont know how to dispose of highly radioactive water stored in an ever mounting number of tanks around the site.

Five years ago, one of the worst earthquakes in history triggered a 10-metre high tsunami that crashed into the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station causing multiple meltdowns. Nearly 19,000 people were killed or left missing and 160,000 lost their homes and livelihoods.

Today, the radiation at the Fukushima plant is still so powerful it has proven impossible to get into its bowels to find and remove the extremely dangerous blobs of melted fuel rods.

RECOMMENDED: Five years on, closure has yet to come to Fukushima parents

The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco), has made some progress, such as removing hundreds of spent fuel roads in one damaged building. But the technology needed to establish the location of the melted fuel rods in the other three reactors at the plant has not been developed.

It is extremely difficult to access the inside of the nuclear plant,"" Naohiro Masuda, Tepco's head of decommissioning said in an interview. ""The biggest obstacle is the radiation.

The fuel rods melted through their containment vessels in the reactors, and no one knows exactly where they are now. This part of the plant is so dangerous to humans, Tepco has been developing robots, which can swim under water and negotiate obstacles in damaged tunnels and piping to search for the melted fuel rods.

But as soon as they get close to the reactors, the radiation destroys their wiring and renders them useless, causing long delays, Masuda said.

Each robot has to be custom-built for each building.It takes two years to develop a single-function robot, Masuda said.

Tepco, which was fiercely criticised for its handling of the disaster, says conditions at the Fukushima power station, site of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in Ukraine 30 years ago, have improved dramatically. Radiation levels in many places at the site are now as low as those in Tokyo.

More than 8,000 workers are at the plant at any one time, according to officials on a recent tour. Traffic is constant as they spread across the site, removing debris, building storage tanks, laying piping and preparing to dismantle parts of the plant.

Much of the work involves pumping a steady torrent of water into the wrecked and highly radiated reactors to cool them down. Afterward, the radiated water is then pumped out of the plant and stored in tanks that are proliferating around the site.

What to do with the nearly million tonnes of radioactive water is one of the biggest challenges, said Akira Ono, the site manager. Ono said he is deeply worried the storage tanks will leak radioactive water in the sea - as they have done several times before - prompting strong criticism for the government.

The utility has so far failed to get the backing of local fishermen to release water it has treated into the ocean.

Ono estimates that Tepco has completed around 10 percent of the work to clear the site up - the decommissioning process could take 30 to 40 years. But until the company locates the fuel, it wont be able to assess progress and final costs, experts say.

The much touted use of X-ray like muon rays has yielded little information about the location of the melted fuel and the last robot inserted into one of the reactors sent only grainy images before breaking down.

ICE WALL

Tepco is building the worlds biggest ice wall to keep groundwater from flowing into the basements of the damaged reactors and getting contaminated.

First suggested in 2013 and strongly backed by the government, the wall was completed in February, after months of delays and questions surrounding its effectiveness. Later this year, Tepco plans to pump water into the wall - which looks a bit like the piping behind a refrigerator - to start the freezing process.

Stopping the ground water intrusion into the plant is critical, said Arnie Gunderson, a former nuclear engineer.

The reactors continue to bleed radiation into the ground water and thence into the Pacific Ocean, Gunderson said. ""When Tepco finally stops the groundwater, that will be the end of the beginning.

While he would not rule out the possibility that small amounts of radiation are reaching the ocean, Masuda, the head of decommissioning, said the leaks have ended after the company built a wall along the shoreline near the reactors whose depth goes to below the seabed.

I am not about to say that it is absolutely zero, but because of this wall the amount of release has dramatically dropped, he said.

LONDON Morrisons, the smallest of Britain's four main supermarket groups, raised its profit outlook on Thursday after identifying ways to broaden its business including a deal to supply food to online giant Amazon.

The group, based in the northern English city of Bradford, said it expected 50-100 million pounds of additional profit in the medium term from areas such as online business, wholesale, manufacturing and lower interest costs.

Last week Morrisons surprised the market by announcing a wholesale supply deal with Amazon and agreeing the outline of a new deal with online grocer Ocado to grow Morrisons.com.

There are signs 2016 could be a better year for Britain's big supermarkets who have been hammered by a price war and lost ground to German discounters Aldi and Lidl.

The ""big four"", headed by market leader Tesco, are narrowing the price gap with the discounters, improving product availability and customer service and doing a better job at highlighting their larger product ranges and online services.

Shares in Morrisons have risen 41 percent over the last three months, buoyed by improving trading and the Amazon deal. Last week the company re-entered Britain's FTSE 100 index of blue chip companies after a three month absence.

They slipped 2.9 percent to 196 pence by 1045 GMT.

UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT

Over the coming months hundreds of Morrisons' fresh and frozen products will be made available to Amazon's UK customers. Some analysts expect that over time the project will be extended to Morrisons' entire range.

""In terms of whether it can grow to be a bigger business, I think in the end that's down to customers and down to the execution in the broader supply chain on both sides,"" Chief Executive David Potts told reporters.

""Our belief is it will be advantageous to stakeholders in Morrisons,"" he said.

Potts, a former Tesco executive who joined Morrisions a year ago, was speaking after the firm reported an expected 27 percent slump in full-year profit.

RECOMMENDED: Retailers invite rival brands to fill their empty spaces

Morrisons and bigger rivals Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda, are cutting prices to stem the loss of shoppers to the discounters.

Morrisons made an underlying pretax profit before one off items of 302 million pounds in the year to Jan. 31, at the mid-point of previous guidance but down from the 413 million pounds made in 2014-15. It represents a fourth straight year of decline and a nine year low.

Though turnover for the year fell 4.1 percent to 16.1 billion pounds, sales at stores open over a year showed an improving trend and were up 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter - a first quarterly rise in four years.

""We've got our tails up a bit on trade,"" said Potts, who also upgraded guidance on working capital, property disposal proceeds, and the dividend.

Morrisons was now more competitive and receiving positive customer feedback from moves to tailor offers to local tastes and improved store standards, he said.

""The notable improvement in sales trends towards the end of the year is a sign that the back-to-basics strategy may be starting to bear fruit,"" said Tristan Chapple, head of research at Phoenix Asset Management, which owns 1 percent of Morrisons.

The Lagos state government said the house collapsed on Tuesday after the owners had added floors despite lacking a permit from authorities, which had sealed off the site -- a common problem in the West African nation where law enforcement is weak.

Aid officials had initially put the death toll at four but relief workers pulled out more bodies from the rubble by Wednesday afternoon. Thirteen people were rescued, officials said.

The building site located in the popular Lekki district on the Lagos peninsula had been inhabited by workers and their families.

""After they (the owners) finished building the house, rain fell and the house shifted a bit. They put iron in front of the house (but) the iron couldn't hold the house,"" said Victor Suru, a brick layer working on the site. ""They left it like that and continued building.""

The Lagos state government told the management of the builder to report to police or face arrest.

""It has also been discovered that in a brazen act of defiance and impunity, the owners of the building ... criminally unsealed the property and continued building beyond the approved floors,"" the state government said in a statement.

Four top executives left the company in January, the biggest leadership exodus since co-founder Jack Dorsey returned as chief executive last year.

The departures added to concerns about the company's ability to make its product more engaging and generate more money from advertising.

Twitter has been offering cash bonuses to some employees, ranging from $50,000 to $200,000 as an incentive to keep them around for another six months to a year, the Journal reported on Wednesday. (on.wsj.com/2219IVi)

The company has also granted varying amounts of restricted stock depending on when the employees started working, intending to make up for the value lost since they joined the company, the newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Twitter's shares have lost more than 60 percent of their value over the past 12 months.

""Competitive compensation, strong leadership and a confidence in the direction of the company are all key elements to having top talent,"" a Twitter spokeswoman said in an email.

""We are investing in all three areas to ensure we maintain these employees,"" she said, without providing further details.

Dorsey said in October he would give a third of his stock in the company, a stake of about 1 percent, to the employee equity pool.

Later that month, he spoke about ""hiring and investing in talent"" and the need for ""bold rethinking.""

Twitter showed no growth in users in the fourth quarter. That was the first time that had happened since the company went public in 2013.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 15:46:17+00:00,"ECB pulls out all stops with rate cuts, stimulus boost","['Francesco Canepa', 'Balazs Koranyi']","FRANKFURT The European Central Bank unleashed some of it last remaining stimulus weapons on Thursday, cutting all three of its interest rates and expanding asset-buying to boost the economy and prevent ultra-low inflation becoming entrenched.

It slashed its inflation expectations for this year but also suggested that interest rates would go no lower.

In moves that briefly pushed the euro 1 percent down against the dollar, the ECB cut its deposit rate deeper into negative territory and increased monthly asset buys to 80 billion euros from 60 billion euros, above expectations of a hike to 70-billion.

While the deposit rate was cut 10 basis points to -0.4 percent, the main refinancing rate was shaved to zero from 0.05 percent and its marginal lending rate -- used by banks to borrow from the ECB overnight -- fell to 0.25 percent from 0.3 percent.

""Rates will stay low, very low, for a long period of time and well past the horizon of our purchases,"" ECB President Mario Draghi, judged to have disappointed markets in December with measures below expectations, told a news conference.

Purchases are due to end in March next year.

He added, ""From today's perspective and taking into account the support of our measures to growth and inflation, we don't anticipate that it will be necessary to reduce rates further,""

The ECB said it would also start buying corporate debt and launch four new rounds of cheap loan packages, to be extended by banks to the real economy.

Slashing its 2016 inflation forecast from one percent to just 0.1 percent, the Bank said further rounds of ultra-cheap four-year loans to banks could include extra financial sweeteners for them to take up the offer to pass on to others.

""A bank that is very active in granting loans to the real economy can borrow more than a bank that concentrates on other activities,"" Draghi noted.

REACTION

""Good news for Europe: Having delivered less than expected in December, the ECB returned to its usual form today and eased policy by a bit more than projected,"" said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg bank.

But others were more critical, warning that such loose monetary policy risked creating asset price bubbles and removed any incentive for governments to reform their economies.

""What will happen if the global economic situation deteriorates sharply once more, requiring a strong monetary policy response? I do not anticipate this happening, but if it did, the ECB would have already shot most of its powder, said Michael Menhart, chief economist at German reinsurer Munich Re.

Draghi answered such criticisms partly in German, arguing: ""Suppose we had embraced the 'nein zu allem' ('no to everything') policy strategy? We deem that the counterfactual would have been a disastrous deflation.""

But he acknowledged the limitations of negative rates and said any future moves would likely have to focus on other, non-conventional measures.

""Does it mean that we can go as negative as we want without having any consequences on the banking system? The answer is no,"" he said.

The ECB has little to show for the 700 billion euros it has spent buying government bonds and other assets in the past year, as tumbling raw materials prices blunt the impact of its quantitative easing.

That raises the risk that people will lose faith in the bank's commitment to its mandate. Inflation has been below the ECB's nearly 2 percent target for three years and is likely to remain so for many more.

The ECB's move came after the G20 group of the world's major economies last month agreed they need to look beyond ultra-low interest rates and printing money to shake the global economy out of its torpor.

The U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, Bank of England and Swiss National Bank are all set to meet next week.

While Europe's growth prospects have held up relatively well on resilient domestic consumption, weak business and industrial sentiment indicators suggest it is facing increasing headwinds, particularly from slowing growth in China.

DHAKA A spelling mistake in an online bank transfer instruction helped prevent a nearly $1 billion heist last month involving the Bangladesh central bank and the New York Fed, banking officials said.

Unknown hackers still managed to get away with about $80 million, one of the largest known bank thefts in history.

The hackers breached Bangladesh Bank's systems and stole its credentials for payment transfers, two senior officials at the bank said. They then bombarded the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with nearly three dozen requests to move money from the Bangladesh Bank's account there to entities in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, the officials said.

Four requests to transfer a total of about $81 million to the Philippines went through, but a fifth, for $20 million, to a Sri Lankan non-profit organisation was held up because the hackers misspelled the name of the NGO, Shalika Foundation.

Hackers misspelled ""foundation"" in the NGO's name as ""fandation"", prompting a routing bank, Deutsche Bank, to seek clarification from the Bangladesh central bank, which stopped the transaction, one of the officials said.

There is no NGO under the name of Shalika Foundation in the list of registered Sri Lankan non-profits. Reuters could not immediately find contact information for the organization.

Deutsche Bank declined to comment.

At the same time, the unusually high number of payment instructions and the transfer requests to private entities - as opposed to other banks - raised suspicions at the Fed, which also alerted the Bangladeshis, the officials said.

The details of how the hacking came to light and was stopped before it did more damage have not been previously reported. Bangladesh Bank has billions of dollars in a current account with the Fed, which it uses for international settlements.

The transactions that were stopped totalled $850-$870 million, one of the officials said.

Last year, Russian computer security company Kaspersky Lab said a multinational gang of cyber criminals had stolen as much as $1 billion from as many as 100 financial institutions around the world in about two years.

Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's son Qusay took $1 billion from Iraq's central bank on the orders of his father on the day before coalition forces began bombing the country in 2003, American and Iraqi officials have said. In 2007, guards at the Dar Es Salaam bank in Baghdad made off with $282 million.

MONEY RECOVERED

Bangladesh Bank has said it has recovered some of the money that was stolen, and is working with anti-money laundering authorities in the Philippines to try to recover the rest.

A bank spokesman could not be reached for comment late on Thursday.

The recovered funds refer to the Sri Lanka transfer, which was stopped, one of the officials said.

Initially, the Sri Lankan transaction reached Pan Asia Banking Corp, which went back to Deutsche Bank for more verification because of the unusually large size of the payment, a Pan Asia official said. ""The transaction was too large for a country like us,"" the official said. ""Then (Deutsche) came back and said it was a suspect transaction."" A Pan Asia spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.

The dizzying, global reach of the heist underscores the growing threat of cyber crime and how hackers can find weak links in even the most secure computer networks.

More than a month after the attack, Bangladeshi officials are scrambling to trace the money, shore up security and identify weaknesses in their systems. They said there is little hope of ever catching the hackers, and it could take months before the money is recovered, if at all.

Security experts said the perpetrators had deep knowledge of the Bangladeshi institution's internal workings, likely gained by spying on bank workers.

The Bangladesh government, meanwhile, is blaming the Fed for not stopping the transactions earlier. Finance Minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith told reporters on Tuesday that the country may resort to suing the Fed to recover the money.

""The Fed must take responsibility,"" he said.

The New York Fed has said its systems were not breached, and it has been working with the Bangladesh central bank since the incident occurred.

The hacking of Bangladesh Bank happened sometime between Feb. 4-5, over the Bangladeshi weekend, which falls on a Friday, the officials said. The bank's offices were shut.

Initially, the central bank was not sure if its system had been breached, but cyber security experts brought in to investigate found hacker ""footprints"" that suggested the system had been compromised, the officials said.

These experts could also tell that the attack originated from outside Bangladesh, they said, adding the bank is looking into how they got into the system and an internal investigation is ongoing.

The bank suspects money sent to the Philippines was further diverted to casinos there, the officials said.

The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp, which oversees the gaming industry, said it has launched an investigation. The country's anti-money laundering authority is also working on the case.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 11:18:59+00:00,"In Houston, oil workers may face the ax but employment still grows",['Howard Schneider'],"BAYTOWN, Texas Plunging energy prices robbed the Texas economy of an estimated 60,000 jobs last year, as oil and gas companies put the brakes on production and slashed investment, throwing engineers and geologists out of work.

But the forest of construction cranes sprouting around this petrochemical hub tell the flip side of the story, as some of the same forces that drove down those prices sparked tens of billions of dollars in investment in new processing plants to take advantage of cheap and plentiful supplies of oil and gas.

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) are building mammoth chemical crackers to process polyethylene from natural gas, and logistics firms have created millions of new square feet of warehouse space as they plan to ship the output to the global plastics industry.

Rising chemicals output has contributed to record traffic at the Houston Port Authority, and officials say the trend is expected to continue. Throughout the Baytown area, which is on the outskirts of Houston, an estimated $8 billion worth of projects is expected to be finished this year and another $22 billion completed in 2017.

This has all propped up employment in Texas at an otherwise difficult time. The positive impact on the overall U.S. economy from the chemicals industry that this illustrates is also one of the reasons the U.S. should avoid a downturn despite troubles elsewhere in the world. That in turn should create the conditions for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again this year.

""They are shedding jobs upstream. That's the nature of the business,"" said B.J. Simon, associate executive director of the Baytown-West Chambers County Economic Development Foundation. But ""the opportunity to build these crackers just could not be passed up...access to cheap feedstocks changed the whole equation downstream.""

Construction workers have jobs, new schools are being built to handle a growing local population, a new Kroger Marketplace store is being completed, and a partially vacant shopping mall is being overhauled.

JOBS:THE FED'S NORTH STAR

The global economy may be sputtering, with weak demand one of the reasons that oil prices have cratered. But the U.S. keeps adding jobs, and at a rate consistent with the outlook from Fed policymakers who expect growing U.S. payrolls will mean enough domestic spending to keep the economy expanding overall.

Texas ""lost a lot of energy jobs,"" said Dallas Fed research head Mine Yucel, but the state ""has been very resilient. I was surprised.""

Across the oil patch, there's a similar pattern of positive trends offsetting bad news. Though low prices have crippled investment in exploration and cut drilling rigs, overall employment in Oklahoma continues to rise in a state that has built large logistics and defense contracting industries.

In North Dakota, ground zero for the fracking boom, overall employment has dropped, but the unemployment rate remains a super-low 2.7 percent compared to the national average of 4.9 percent. The number is held down by an expected adjustment: just as workers flocked to the state when vacancies were plentiful, the labor force has declined as the jobs disappeared and workers returned home.

These states represent a drop in the bucket compared to Texas's $1.6 trillion, 12.5 million-job economy, a size approaching that of Canada. Despite the oil downturn, the unemployment rate is only 4.7 percent as non-energy companies like fiber-optic manufacturer Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI.O) expand in the state.

In a rough year for the oil business, the state as a whole added 144,000 jobs in 2015, according to the Texas Workforce Commission, with strong gains across the trade and hospitality sectors, as well as professional services, health and education.

ROCKY START

The Fed meets next week to take stock of the U.S. economy after a rocky beginning to the year.

A rate hike is not expected at the March meeting but the central banks post-meeting statement and fresh economic projections from policymakers will provide important insight into how worried the Fed is about the combined impact of cheap oil and weak global demand on prospects for U.S. jobs, growth and investment.

In an organization that prizes consensus under Chair Janet Yellen, clear cracks have emerged: between Vice Chair Stanley Fischer's recent statement that inflation is ""stirring,"" for example, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard's continued caution about how the rest of the world may inhibit the U.S.

The Fed raised rates in December for the first time in a decade and projections by its policymakers at the time showed they expected four hikes this year. However, many investors and analysts now feel the Fed may be stuck where it is for much of the rest of the year.

The jobs growth figures provide a counterweight to that view. The labor recovery has been going on for seven years now, and whenever hiring has slowed in one sector of the economy another has picked up the slack.

The early strength in commodity-based jobs that spread across the fracking fields of North Dakota and Oklahoma gave way over the past two years to a surge in construction, education and health-related positions. Even in government, where belt-tightening by local, state and federal agencies trimmed payrolls coming out of the recession, employment is growing again.

U.S. non-farm jobs growth has held at an average of 190,000 per month during the recovery. That's faster than anticipated and strong enough to both accommodate new entrants to the labor force and bring sidelined workers back into jobs.

There have been concerns that many of the jobs being created were at the low end of the wage spectrum, in restaurants, hotels and retail stores. But more recent analysis of occupation and wage trends by Goldman Sachs showed that over the past two years in particular job gains have been strongest in higher-paying positions.

In its most recent Beige Book release of anecdotal economic information, Fed officials noted that former oilfield workers were shifting into jobs as auto mechanics, while construction and petrochemical companies had shortages in fields considered complementary to the skills of frontline oil and gas workers.

""It's easier to place a welder right now than someone with a four-year degree,"" said Jim Hanna, a vice president for human resources and industrial relations with Fluor, (FLR.N) the engineering and construction giant working on the Chevron project in Baytown.

Fluor's workforce at the Chevron site is already up to 3,000, with 600 more to be hired over the summer.

FEWER BMWS

In the Houston metropolitan area, which compared to the rest of Texas has traditionally been most dependent on the energy sector, the oil crash did not prevent a net gain of 23,000 jobs last year. That was well short of the above-average 100,000 positions that the city had been adding in recent years as oil production surged, said Patrick Jankowski, vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership. But it is also more in line with the city's long-run average and likely more sustainable.

While there may be some impact on wages from the loss of higher paying positions for geologists and engineers, said Jankowski, some of the skilled construction trade and health jobs that will replace them also pay above average.

Fluor's Hanna said it was typical for construction workers to put in 50-hour weeks or more, with annual wages running upwards of $100,000.

""I would not describe Houston's economy as strong, but I would never use the word recession,"" Jankowski said. ""We will have a year or two of slower growth, rather than a boom...We will be selling fewer BMWs.""

LONDON Racket firm Head has extended its contract with five-times grand slam champion Maria Sharapova despite her failed drugs test at this year's Australian Open, CEO Johan Eliasch said on Thursday.

The 28-year-old Russian will be provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) from this weekend after she admitted at a news conference on Monday taking the banned substance meldonium.

Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer cut ties with Sharapova this week, while Nike and Porsche have distanced themselves from her.

However, Eliasch said Sharapova, under contract with Head since 2011, had 'earned the benefit of the doubt' after making an 'honest' mistake.

""For a decade Maria Sharapova has been a role model and woman of integrity who has inspired millions of fans around the world to play and watch tennis,"" he said in a statement.

""The honesty and courage she displayed in announcing and acknowledging her mistake was admirable. HEAD is proud to stand behind Maria, now and into the future and we intend to extend her contract.

""We look forward to working with her and to announcing new sponsorships in the weeks and months ahead.""

A statement issued later confimed that the contract had been signed and extended.

In Los Angeles on Monday, Sharapova said she had been taking meldonium, also known as mildronate, for 10 years because of health problems and regular bouts of flu.

The drug, produced in Latvia but unavailable for purchase in the United States where Sharapova is based, was only added to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list of banned substances in January, shortly before her positive test in Melbourne.

Manufactured for people suffering from heart problems, it can also increase blood flow and improve exercise capacity.

Head said they were convinced Sharapova had not taken the drug to gain any competitive advantage.

""It is common ground within the scientific community that in order for meldonium to have any relevant performance enhancing effect it has to be taken in daily dosages in excess of 1,000 to 2,000mg,"" the statement said.

""According to the attorney for Maria, her dosage was significantly less than that.""

While underlining Head's commitment to clean sport, Eliasch said he trusted Sharapova's explanation that she had not realised meldonium had been banned by WADA.

""In the absence of any evidence of any intent by Maria of enhancing her performance or trying to gain an unfair advantage through the use of mildronate, we further conclude this falls into the category of 'honest' mistakes,"" he said.

Russian biathlete Eduard Latypov was suspended from competition on Thursday after testing positive for meldonium, the latest in a flurry of athletes to fall foul of the drug since it was prohibited.

Keith Strobelt, political director of the United Steelworkers local union, poses for a picture in Canton, Ohio, March 4, 2016. Picture taken March 4, 2016.

CANTON, Ohio If Donald Trump wins the Republican Party nomination, his path to the White House will run through this working-class city with a knack for picking presidents.

No Republican has ever won the White House without Ohio. And nowhere better reflects the challenges and opportunities Trump faces in his 2016 presidential quest than Canton, a once-booming industrial city that, like Ohio and the rest of Americas rust belt, is going through profound economic and demographic change.

Canton, a gritty northeastern Ohio city where the once-dominant steel industry has been in decline for 20 years, is the heart of Stark County, a political bellwether that, save twice, has picked every winning presidential candidate since 1964.

The real-estate moguls primary wins in Michigan and in Mississippi on Tuesday, in the face of blistering attacks from the party's establishment, expanded his lead in the White House nominating race and demonstrated his broad appeal across many demographic groups in the Republican Party.

But here, in predominately white Canton, the birthplace of professional American football, he will need to show cross-over appeal in the general election and win over not just Republicans but working-class Democrats and some independents, to beat a Democrat, illustrating the challenge he will face in Ohio and potentially other Midwestern rust belt states.

A more immediate test looms next week in the states Republican primary, where polls show Trump narrowly leads Ohio Governor John Kasich, who casts himself as a pragmatic, statesman-like alternative to Trump. If Trump wins Ohio and Florida  states rich in the delegates who select their party's nominee at July's Republican National Convention - he would almost certainly lock up his partys nomination.

Sitting in a steel workers' meeting at their Canton union hall, Curtis Green, the chapter's vice president, described Trump's support among a growing number of members as their ""dirty little secret.""

""I view him as a radical and a racist and I don't want to be affiliated with that,"" Green said. ""But if you say what you mean, a lot of guys see that in Trump and they respect that. He doesn't dance around the issues, he takes them head on. There are a fair amount of our members who do support Donald Trump.""

OHIO PICKS WINNERS

If Trump just wins the states that Republican nominee Mitt Romney won in 2012, he would have only 206 electoral college votes, short of the 270 needed to win the White House. The fight over electoral college votes has turned recent elections into pitched battles over a dozen or so states.

Ohio is often at the center.

The state, which has not voted for the loser in a presidential election since 1960, is seen as a microcosm of American swing voters  from culturally conservative Reagan Democrats who defected from their party to support Republican Ronald Reagan in the 1980s to suburban soccer moms and upwardly mobile Hispanics.

To offset the growing proportion of blacks and Hispanics in the voting age population, Trump must turn white voters out in greater numbers than Romney in cities such as Canton. His performance in primary states where Democrats and independent can vote, as well as Republicans, suggests Trump could attract large numbers of these voters in a general election.

Reuters interviews here with more than two dozen voters show why.

In this city of 72,500 people, Trump's denunciation of free trade, political correctness and illegal immigrants is resonating among some traditionally Democratic blue-collar steel workers.

""The labor unions, who usually support the Democrats, a lot of our members, and a lot of their families, are supporting Trump,"" said Keith Strobelt, a political director for the United Steelworkers local union in Canton. Strobelt does not support Trump.

Canton's local United Steelworkers union has 1,800 members - down from 6,700 at its peak 30 years ago. Its leadership has not officially endorsed a candidate, thought it has praised Democrat Senator Bernie Sanders. Some rank-and-file members, however, say they better identify with Trumps broadsides against illegal immigration and tirades against trade with China and Mexico.

""It could be that several hundred of our members will back Trump,"" Strobelt said. ""A lot find him refreshing. He says a lot of things they say around their dinner tables.""

WRINGING THEIR HANDS

But in a general election, Trump faces formidable odds in Canton, as he does across Ohio and the Midwest. Canton and the region is changing in ways that favor Democrats, reflecting the Republican Party's broader problems with a U.S. electorate that is becoming less white and less culturally conservative.

In 2000, Canton was nearly 75 percent white, with an African American population of 20 percent, and an Hispanic population of just over 1 percent. Its biggest employer was the Timken Company, a giant ball bearing and high custom steel manufacturer that was the dominant economic force in Canton for much of the 20th century.

By 2010, according to Census data, Canton was 69 percent white. Its black population had increased by 3 percent, its Hispanic residents to nearly 3 percent.

Tuesdays primary in neighboring Michigan showed how volatile this election has become, with Trumps potent appeal among disaffected whites stretching beyond the South. In the Democratic race, Sanders won most of the states white working-class countryside and small towns in an upset over front-runner Hillary Clinton.

In Canton, like elsewhere in the rust belt heartlands stretching from the Midwest to the Great Lakes region and parts of the Northeast, manufacturing has been hollowed out since the 1970s, due in part to foreign competition. In 1990, Ohio had over 1 million manufacturing jobs; today, just 680,000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Ohio has shed nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs since the 2007-2009 Great Recession.

A different type of worker, more white collar and upscale, has moved into the Canton area.

The top two employers are now the Aultman Hospital and Mercy Medical Center, highly competitive health care providers.

While Trump might pick up blue collar Democrats, and older folks who are disillusioned with the political process, the flip side is he could lose more upper-status voters in Ohio,"" said John Green, a political science professor at the University of Akron, close to Canton. ""Republican Party leaders in Ohio are wringing their hands. There is a perception that Trump helps among blue collar voters - but could alienate white collar voters.""

Jane Timken, the vice-chair of the Stark County Republican Party and the wife of TimkenSteel's chief executive, said the local party was encountering people who had never voted Republican before but were supporting Trump.

But, she said, there was concern Trump might turn off other voters, especially independents who account for one fifth of Ohio's voters.

There is no polling to predict which way Canton and Stark County will vote in November's general election. But after a long era of mixed local government, the city council, after elections last year, is now made up of entirely Democratic Party members, although the current mayor, a former Democrat, won office as an independent.

In Canton, there are nearly 6,000 voters registered as Democrats, compared to just over 1,100 Republicans according to the Stark County Board of Elections. In 2006, there were 12,000 registered Democrats and 4,400 Republicans.

Democratic strategists say that despite the demographic changes, Trump could still prevail.

Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic strategist, cites Trump's dominant performance in the Republican primary in Massachusetts on March 1. Although not a rust belt state, Trump won big in heavily blue collar, union cities.

""Trump put together a coalition in Massachusetts that elects Democratic governors. He won among Catholics, a week after picking a fight with the Pope. I absolutely think he can put the rust belt into play,"" she said.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 04:41:52+00:00,China Feb consumer inflation rises at fastest pace since 2014,"['Xiaoyi Shao', 'Pete Sweeney']","BEIJING China's consumer inflation beat forecasts in February, accelerating at its fastest pace since July 2014, while producer prices slowed their slide for the second straight month, taking some pressure off policymakers to rush out more monetary easing.

While the food-driven consumer price increase is likely to be welcomed by regulators worried that China could fall into a deflationary trap, some economists expect upward price pressures in the months ahead to be modest.

Annual consumer inflation edged up to 2.3 percent in February, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday, from January's 1.8 percent and above the 1.9 percent predicted by analysts.

That was the fastest year-on-year increase since July 2014.

A 7.3 percent pick-up in food prices was mainly due to cold weather and the Chinese New Year seasonality effect, Yu Qiumei, a senior NBS statistician, said in a statement accompanying the data. Non-food inflation was 1.0 percent.

""Inflation is much higher than expectations,"" said Guo Lei, chief economist at Founder Securities, in Shanghai.

""The recent rebound in oil prices, recovery in food prices and surging home prices in big cities all contributed to higher inflation in February. We think inflation will not surpass the government target of 3 percent this year but the rising inflation will obviously restrict room for further policy easing.""

China aims to keep consumer inflation at around 3 percent in 2016 to reflect factors such as rising labor cost, price fluctuations of agricultural products and the impact of further price reform.

""A target of higher price increases will be conducive to reducing expectations of deflation,"" the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the country's top economic planner, said in a work report on Saturday.

China's consumer price index rose 1.4 percent in 2015 from a year ago, far short of Beijing's 3 percent target for 2015.

Despite February's encouraging headline numbers, ANZ economists say the rise in food prices is likely to be temporary and that consumer inflation will remain mild in coming months.

""Daily wholesale food prices show that prices have moderated slightly in early March,"" ANZ said in a research note.

""Non-food CPI edged down to 1.0 percent year-on-year in February, 0.2 percentage points lower than that in January, reflecting disinflation in the other components of the CPI.""

Reflecting sluggish demand at home and overseas and overcapacity in key sectors, China's producer prices remained stubbornly weak, with the producer price index sliding 4.9 percent in February from a year ago.

Premier Li Keqiang acknowledged in parliament on Saturday that leaders face ""a tough battle"" to keep the economy growing by at least 6.5 percent over the next five years, while pushing hard to create more jobs and restructuring state-owned enterprises.

China's trade data released on Tuesday also showed entrenched weakness in the economy as exports tumbled at their fastest pace in more than over six years and imports fell for 16th straight month.

BERLIM Isolada na Europa, a chanceler alema, Angela Merkel, enfrentara um grande teste no domingo, quando tres Estados da Alemanha votam em eleicoes que podem erodir sua base e minar a politica imigratoria na qual ela apostou seu legado.

Conhecida por sua cautela, Merkel tomou a decisao arriscada no ano passado de abrir as fronteiras do pais aos refugiados em fuga da guerra da Siria  medida que fez com a revista Time a elegesse Personalidade do Ano de 2015, mas que causou revolta nos alemaes no que diz respeito a integracao dos imigrantes.

Agora os eleitores de tres Estados dois no oeste e um na antiga Alemanha Oriental tem a chance de punir Merkel, de 61 anos, justamente quando ela tenta usar seu prestigio como maior lider europeia para obter a aprovacao de um acordo entre a Uniao Europeia e a Turquia para deter o fluxo imigratorio.

""Merkel ira continuar a ser chanceler, mas talvez com um olho roxo"", disse Matthias Kortmann, pesquisador de ciencia politica da Universidade de Munique.

Tal perda de capital politico iria abalar a posicao de Merkel em um momento crucial de seus esforcos para lidar com a crise de refugiados  mais de um milhao de imigrantes chegaram a Alemanha no ano passado.

Em uma cupula no inicio desta semana, ela deixou varios lideres europeus alarmados ao apostar em um rascunho de acordo de ultima hora com Ancara para frear a onda imigratoria e exigir que estes apoiassem a iniciativa.

Mas Merkel, cujas influencia e reputacao para fechar acordos so cresceu durante seus 10 anos no poder, ainda precisa selar o pacto entre UE e Turquia com os lideres do bloco na proxima cupula dos dias 17 e 18 de marco.

""Se ela nao conseguir impor sua abordagem entao, nao sera capaz de evitar uma correcao em sua visao sobre a politica para os refugiados"", afirmou

LONDON A UK decision to leave the European Union would deprive the EU of one of its best-rated members, leaving the bloc and its investment bank vulnerable to credit rating downgrade.

While ratings agencies have warned a vote to leave could hurt the UK's rating, a Brexit could also have consequences for institutions which Britain supports via its EU membership.

Britain accounts for some 16 percent of the EU's nominal gross domestic product, makes a net annual budget contribution of about 6.5 billion euros ($7.2 billion) and is among the highest-rated of the EU's 28 members.

It is rated AAA by S&P, Aa1 by Moody's and AA+ by Fitch.

""European entities which would be most affected in the case of Brexit are the European Union itself, with a risk of being downgraded, and the European Investment Bank (EIB),"" said Societe Generale strategist Cristina Costa in a note.

The EU, which has about 54 billion euros in outstanding bonds, is rated AAA by Fitch, Moody's and DBRS and AA+ with a negative outlook by Standard & Poor's.

Since the agencies have stressed the average weighted ratings in their approach to supranational borrowers, a British departure could weigh on the ratings of the EU and the EIB, analysts said.

No comment was immediately available from the EU.

There would be no immediate rating impact from Britain leaving the EU on any of the bloc's other members, Moody's said on Thursday.

WATCH OUT

Analysts say the EIB is especially at risk from a potential Brexit because while the EU and the EIB have similar memberships, they have different structures with regards to financing from its shareholders.

Unlike the EU, the EIB operates like a bank, so has its own capital base - about 243 billion euros, according to its latest financial report. The EIB is also able to tap additional funds known as callable capital, which is almost 222 billion euros.

Because ownership of the EIB is concentrated in the region's five largest economies, its profile would weaken if the UK left, analysts said.

The UK has a 16.1 percent share of the EIB's capital, similar to that of Germany, France and Italy, as this graphic shows tmsnrt.rs/1LT8zHX

While other member states would probably pick up a reduced UK share, the uncertainty could weigh on EIB bonds.

According to SocGen, the loss of Britain as a shareholder would lower the share of high-rated EIB backers to roughly 60 percent from 66 percent.

An EIB source told Reuters there was no automatic consequence of a Brexit on the EIB's AAA rating.

""If it were to materialise, the EIB would closely monitor any potential impact ... and would consider how best to address such a situation and reassure the markets in due course,"" the source said.

Commerzbank rates strategist Rainer Guntermann said any Brexit downgrade to the EIB's ratings could have implications for bond investors.

""Regulation-driven investors in the insurance sector, even if not forced to, prefer to hold triple A-rated paper such as from the German government, EIB or German agencies,"" he said. ""There would be a significant impact if the EIB rating were to slide just one notch.""

The gap between EIB bond yields and the European agency benchmark, KfW, has been tight with the five-year yield spread at about 6-8 basis points.

As the June 23 vote approaches, SocGen and Commerzbank anticipate wider spreads.

SocGen's Costa said spreads could widen by at least five to 10 bps even with support from the ECB's bond-buying programme.

Other institutions such as the European Stability Mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, were not expected to take a direct hit.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 14:25:42+00:00,Revolutionary Guards commander says Iran's missile work will not stop: state TV,['Parisa Hafezi'],"ANKARA A senior Revolutionary Guards commander has said that Iran's ballistic missile program will not stop under any circumstances and that Tehran has missiles ready to be fired, according to Iranian state television.

Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh made his comments after a series of ballistic missile tests conducted by guard units that drew international concern, including a call by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for new sanctions against Iran.

The tests, which state television said ended on Wednesday night, were seen as a challenge to a United Nations resolution and last year's nuclear accord with world powers under which Tehran agreed to curb its atomic program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions.

""Iran's missile program will not stop under any circumstances,"" Hajizadeh said. ""The IRGC has never accepted the U.N. Security Council resolutions on Iran's missile work.

""We are always ready to defend the country against any aggressor. Iran will not turn into Yemen, Iraq or Syria,"" he was quoted as saying by state television.

The Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) maintains an arsenal of dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles - the largest in the Middle East, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.

Tehran says its missile program is solely for defensive use with conventional, non-nuclear warheads.

Iran's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that the tests were not in violation of the nuclear agreement, which led to lifting of sanctions in January.

The Guards said the tests were aimed at displaying Iran's ""deterrent power and its ability to confront any threat"".

""Some of the missiles carried 24 warheads and one tonne of TNT,"" said Hajizadeh, who heads the Guard's aerospace division.

Hajizadeh said Iran had no intention of starting a war, ""but the Zionist regime (Israel) is our enemy and we don't trust American officials.""

""We have underground tunnels around the country and under mountains, where we store our missiles... These tunnels cannot be destroyed even if targeted by atomic bombs,"" he said.

State TV in October aired footage of long tunnels with ready-to-fire missiles on the back of trucks, saying the facility was one of hundreds of underground missile bases around the country.

The United States imposed sanctions against businesses and individuals in January over another missile test in October 2015. But Iranian officials have repeatedly expressed Tehran's determination to develop what it called Iran's defense capabilities.

The United States said on Wednesday it was aware of and reviewing reports of an additional Iranian ballistic missile test and that the administration would determine an appropriate response.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif about the missile tests, a State Department spokesman said.

But Iran's Students News Agency ISNA said on Thursday that Zarif and Kerry had not discussed the issue.

""John Kerry has sent emails to Zarif asking for a telephone call to discuss issues, including Iran's missile tests, but it did not happen because Zarif is on an official visit,"" ISNA quoted a source as saying.

LONDON Racket firm Head has extended its contract with five-times grand slam champion Maria Sharapova despite her failed drugs test at this year's Australian Open, CEO Johan Eliasch said on Thursday.

The 28-year-old Russian will be provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) from this weekend after she admitted at a news conference on Monday taking the banned substance meldonium.

Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer cut ties with Sharapova this week, while Nike and Porsche have distanced themselves from her.

However, Eliasch said Sharapova, under contract with Head since 2011, had 'earned the benefit of the doubt' after making an 'honest' mistake.

""For a decade Maria Sharapova has been a role model and woman of integrity who has inspired millions of fans around the world to play and watch tennis,"" he said in a statement.

""The honesty and courage she displayed in announcing and acknowledging her mistake was admirable. HEAD is proud to stand behind Maria, now and into the future and we intend to extend her contract.

""We look forward to working with her and to announcing new sponsorships in the weeks and months ahead.""

A statement issued later confirmed that the contract had been signed and extended.

In Los Angeles on Monday, Sharapova said she had been taking meldonium, also known as mildronate, for 10 years because of health problems and regular bouts of flu.

The drug, produced in Latvia but unavailable for purchase in the United States where Sharapova is based, was only added to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list of banned substances in January, shortly before her positive test in Melbourne.

Manufactured for people suffering from heart problems, it can also increase blood flow and improve exercise capacity.

Head said they were convinced Sharapova had not taken the drug to gain any competitive advantage.

""It is common ground within the scientific community that in order for meldonium to have any relevant performance enhancing effect it has to be taken in daily dosages in excess of 1,000 to 2,000mg,"" the statement said.

""According to the attorney for Maria, her dosage was significantly less than that.""

While underlining Head's commitment to clean sport, Eliasch said he trusted Sharapova's explanation that she had not realized meldonium had been banned by WADA.

""In the absence of any evidence of any intent by Maria of enhancing her performance or trying to gain an unfair advantage through the use of mildronate, we further conclude this falls into the category of 'honest' mistakes,"" he said.

Russian biathlete Eduard Latypov was suspended from competition on Thursday after testing positive for meldonium, the latest in a flurry of athletes to fall foul of the drug since it was prohibited.

Human Rights Council,"['Stephanie Nebehay', 'Tom Miles']","GENEVA China strongly rejected U.S.-led criticism of its human rights record at the U.N. Human Rights Council on Thursday, saying the United States was hypocritical and guilty of crimes including the rape and murder of civilians.

""The U.S. is notorious for prison abuse at Guantanamo prison, its gun violence is rampant, racism is its deep-rooted malaise,"" Chinese diplomat Fu Cong told the Council, using unusually blunt language.

""The United States conducts large-scale extra-territorial eavesdropping, uses drones to attack other countries' innocent civilians, its troops on foreign soil commit rape and murder of local people. It conducts kidnapping overseas and uses black prisons.""

Fu was responding to a joint statement by the United States and 11 other countries, who criticised China's crackdown on human rights and its detentions of lawyers and activists.

""These actions are in contravention of China's own laws and international commitments,"" said U.S. Ambassador Keith Harper, who read out the statement backed by Australia, Japan and nine northern European countries.

""These extra-territorial actions are unacceptable, out of step with the expectations of the international community, and a challenge to the rule-based international order.""

Harper read the statement straight after U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein gave his main annual speech to the council. He recalled his message to China in mid-February, when he cited a ""very worrying pattern"" of detentions.

Fu said Zeid should ""refrain from making subjective comments not backed up by real facts"".

He also criticised Japan's support for the joint statement, saying Japan had refused to take responsibility for conscripting 100,000 ""comfort women"" in Asian countries during World War Two.

In China's crackdown, police have detained about 250 human rights lawyers, legal assistants, and activists since a nationwide crackdown began last July, although many have subsequently been released.

Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, said the message delivered by Harper was the first collective joint statement on China in the 10 history of the council.

""The statement shows that while President Xi may think he can eradicate dissent at home, the world stands with embattled human rights defenders across China,"" she said in a statement.

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Barack Obama deliver remarks to reporters after their bilateral meeting alongside the APEC Summit in Manila, Philippines, in this November 19, 2015 file photo.

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama was preparing a red-carpet welcome for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the White House on Thursday, ending a frosty period in U.S.-Canada relations and celebrating their shared goals on climate and trade.

Obama will host Trudeau, the Liberal Party leader who took office in November, for an Oval Office meeting where they will talk about curbing climate emissions from oil and gas fields - a dramatic shift from years of debate over building the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a project Obama blocked last year.

Also on the agenda are plans to expedite travel and trade between the two countries, and shared areas of global concern ranging from Syria to Ukraine.

""We are two countries that are, in every sense of the word, inseparable,"" Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, told Reuters.

The leaders are slated to hold a news conference at 11:40 a.m. (1640 GMT) in the Rose Garden.

Later, they will toast each other at a lavish state dinner planned with a theme of ""Anticipation of Spring,"" a feeling close to the hearts of Canadians, who endure long and harsh winters.

The dinner will feature Colorado lamb, sidestepping what could have been the awkward optics of a beef dish.

Canada won a World Trade Organization case last year against a U.S. meat-labeling law for beef and pork. The law was repealed in December, and the White House hopes that Canada formally ends its lawsuit.

Trudeau, who is struggling at home with a soft economy and weak Canadian dollar, campaigned on repairing strained ties.

""Few relationships matter as much to Canada as a good relationship with the United States of America, for jobs, for economic growth, for trade purposes, and building the kinds of opportunities for Canadians right across the country that we truly need,"" he said on Wednesday before leaving for Washington.

Americans have been captivated by the photogenic Trudeau, 44, whose father, Pierre Trudeau, was prime minister from 1968 through 1979, and again from 1980 to 1984.

But his visit may be overshadowed by the raucous race to succeed Obama in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Candidates on both the left and the right have taken anti-trade positions.

Obama hopes to convince a reluctant U.S. Congress to ratify the sprawling Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact before he leaves office in January. Canada is also wrestling with the merits of the TPP.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 14:07:00+00:00,U.S. jobless claims hit five-month low as labor market strengthens,['Lucia Mutikani'],"WASHINGTON The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, hitting its lowest level since October, pointing to sustained strength in the labor market that should further dispel fears of a recession. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 259,000 for the week ended March 5, the lowest reading since mid-October, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The prior week's claims were revised to show 1,000 fewer applications received than previously reported.

Claims are being watched for any sign of labor market weakness following a recent massive stock market sell-off that caused financial market conditions to tighten amid fears the economy was heading into recession.

So far, the labor market remains on strong footing, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 242,000 jobs in February and the unemployment rate holding at an eight-year low of 4.9 percent.

The recession fears have also been soothed by strong consumer spending at the start of the year, as well as signs of some stabilization in the troubled manufacturing sector.

A tightening labor market and firming inflation could see the Federal Reserve gradually raising interest rates this year. The U.S. central bank hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.

The dollar rose against the euro following the European Central Bank's decision to lower key interest rates and expand its bond purchase program in an effort stimulate growth in the euro zone. U.S. Treasury debt prices were mixed, while U.S. stock index futures rallied.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims slipping to275,000 in the latest week. A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing last week's claims data and no states had been estimated.

Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with healthy labor market conditions, for a year - the longest run since the early 1970s. Last week's drop saw claims breaking outside their recent 262,000-294,000 range.

The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,500 to 267,500 last week, the lowest level since late October.

The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 32,000 to 2.23 million in the week ended Feb. 27. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims fell 4,500 to 2.25 million.

Chinas shadow banking sector is piling up risk at the heart of the financial system and keeping deadbeat firms alive. The sums invested in so-called wealth management products surged 57 percent last year to reach $3.2 trillion. The growth alone is good reason to worry, but new data also suggests much of the cash is propping up troubled borrowers.

In China, wealth management products are short-term investments, typically distributed through banks, backed by assets ranging from cash and government bonds to corporate debt and derivatives. They have long been popular with retail investors seeking better returns than they can get from bank savings.

A recent report from state-owned China Government Securities Depository Trust and Clearing shows just how big the products have become. The industrys assets under management have doubled in two years and are now equivalent to almost 17 percent of all Chinese bank deposits.

The boom poses several risks. For one, wealth management products tend to have a shorter life than the underlying assets. In 2015, the average product had a duration of just 3.5 months. Investments worth $1.58 trillion  almost half the total can be redeemed early. Second, many retail investors believe the products are guaranteed by the banks that sell them, even though they often sign waivers to the contrary. So far, that belief has proved correct, as the vast majority of investments have paid out in full.

This makes wealth management products highly vulnerable to a sudden loss of confidence. In that event, mid-size Chinese banks which have been responsible for much of the recent growth in the market could suffer a liquidity crunch. Outstanding wealth management products were equivalent to 40 percent of deposits for mid-tier banks at the end of 2015, versus 15 percent for the biggest state-backed lenders, Fitch Ratings reckons.

The case for Chinas shadow banking industry is that it is a source of funding for fast-growing private companies that would otherwise struggle for credit. But the data suggest otherwise. Property-related borrowers are the biggest recipients of funds from wealth management products. A hefty chunk also goes to heavy industry and to long-term projects such as roads and railways.

As the Chinese government boosts lending in an effort to meet its growth targets, wealth management products are likely to keep expanding. Given the risks, though they are unlikely to remain in the shadows for long.",[]

HARARE Zimbabwe needs an annual growth rate of up to 8 percent over the next 10 to 15 years to revamp its economy, Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa said on Thursday, in addition to other reforms agreed with an International Monetary Fund delegation.

On Wednesday, Chinamasa said President Robert Mugabe had agreed to major reforms, including compensation for evicted white farmers and a big reduction in public sector wages as the government tries to woo back international lenders.

Chinamasa said that new loans from international lenders will only come if the drought-stricken Southern African nation showed the capacity to introduce a raft of economic reforms.

""Any reform agenda is painful. The journey we have travelled has been difficult and will remain difficult,"" Chinamasa told a forum discussing Zimbabwe's future prospects.

Chinamasa and Reserve Bank governor John Mangudya are leading Zimbabwe's re-engagement with international lenders and the finance minister has previously said he has had to overcome divisions within Mugabe's cabinet to pursue that process.

Zimbabwe is trying to emerge from more than a decade of isolation that saw the IMF, World Bank and African Development Bank freeze lending in 1999. Western powers imposed sanctions on Mugabe's government over allegations of vote rigging and human rights abuses. Mugabe rejects the charges.

The IMF executive board will on May. 2 consider Harare's plan to repay $1.8 billion in arrears. Chinamasa said he was seeking clear commitments from the IMF that clearing the arrears would trigger new financial aid.

""As I stand before you I am in buoyant spirits because I know that the measures that we are taking will exploit and realize the full potential of this country. We just need an uninterrupted process of reform,"" said Chinamasa.

Por Marcela Ayres

BRASILIA O Banco Central informou que sua projecao da inflacao pelo cenario de referencia segue acima do centro da meta de 4,5 por cento em 2016 e em 2017, mas retirou a mencao de que para o ano que vem a inflacao estava ""ligeiramente"" superior, pavimentando o caminho para que a taxa basica de juros nao seja reduzida tao cedo apesar da fraqueza na economia.

A autoridade monetaria ressaltou ainda que continuam as incertezas associadas ao balanco de riscos, principalmente quanto ao processo de recuperacao dos resultados fiscais e sua composicao, ao comportamento da inflacao corrente e das expectativas de inflacao, segundo a ata do Comite de Politica Monetaria (Copom) divulgada nesta quinta-feira.

Na quarta-feira da semana passada, o BC manteve a Selic em 14,25 por cento ao ano, mesmo patamar desde julho de 2015, numa decisao dividida entre os membros do Copom.

Foi a terceira reuniao seguida em que o colegiado se dividiu, com os diretores Sidnei Correa Marques (Organizacao do Sistema Financeiro) e Tony Volpon (Assuntos Internacionais) votando pela elevacao dos juros em 0,5 ponto percentual.

Na ata, o BC ressaltou que a dinamica dos precos administrados e o hiato do produto ""mais desinflacionario que o inicialmente previsto"" sao fatores importantes do contexto em que decisoes futuras de politica monetaria serao tomadas, ressaltando a importancia da desaceleracao da economia.

""O BC, por um lado, mostra que a atividade economica esta mais fraca, mas por outro esta muito preocupado com as contas publicas. Isso sugere certa resistencia para reduzir os juros e cautela para na conducao da politica monetaria"", afirmou o economista-chefe da corretora Votorantim, Roberto Padovani, para quem a Selic sera reduzida somente no 4o trimestre deste ano.

INFLACAO

O BC diminuiu sua estimativa para a alta de precos administrados em 2016 a 5,9 por cento, contra 6,3 por cento na ata anterior, mantendo a expectativa de aumento de 5 por cento para o ano que vem. Ao mesmo tempo, passou a enxergar reducao de 3,5 por cento nos precos de energia eletrica este ano, contra alta de 3,7 por cento.

Por outro lado, o BC ressaltou que a inflacao mostra resistencia. Pesquisa Focus do proprio BC, que ouve semanalmente uma centena de economistas, mostra que a projecao de alta do IPCA e de 7,59 por cento em 2016, caindo a 6 por cento no ano que vem.

LONDON Sainsbury's (SBRY.L) was the only one of Britain's big four supermarkets to increase overall sales, industry data published monthly showed, helped by the popularity of its online and convenience businesses, though even its market share was flat.

Britain's second largest supermarket's sales rose 0.5 percent year-on-year in the 12 weeks to Feb. 28, market researcher Kantar Worldpanel said on Tuesday, an outcome that represents the longest run of growth for any of the big four since March 2013.

Its shares were down 0.5 percent by 1022 GMT, outperforming a 1 percent fall in the FTSE 100 .FTSE index.

Sainsbury's, considering raising its takeover proposal for Argos owner Home Retail (HOME.L) after South African group Steinhoff International (SNHG.DE) trumped its offer, will be keen to see its share price supported, given that part of its proposed offer is in shares.

Sainsbury's maintained its market share at 16.8 percent as Britain's overall grocery market also grew at 0.5 percent.

That market growth was the fastest rate since October 2015 but was still held back by an industry price war and falling grocery prices, which were down by 1.6 percent.

Falling prices reflect the impact of discounters Aldi [ALDIEI.UL] and Lidl [LIDUK.UL], and the markets competitive response, as well as deflation in items such as eggs, butter and crisps.

Market leader Tesco (TSCO.L), third largest group Asda and number four Morrisons (MRW.L) all lost market share to Aldi and Lidl, who recorded growth of 15.1 percent and 18.9 percent respectively.

Sales at Tesco fell 0.8 percent. That was, however, a continuation of an improving trend as sales had fallen 1.6 percent in last month's data. Its shares rose 2.7 percent.

""A renewed focus on price promotions has helped stem the flow of shoppers leaving (Tesco) despite the closure of around 50 stores in the last year,"" Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said.

Morrisons is also operating fewer stores than last year which continues to contribute to its falling sales, down 3.2 percent in the period.

The company, which last week announced a tie-up with online giant Amazon (AMZN.O), will report annual results on Thursday. Its shares fell 2.5 percent.

Asda, the British supermarket arm of Wal-Mart (WMT.N), remained the sector's laggard, with its sales falling 4.0 percent.

Number five player, the Co-operative [42TE.L], which announced more price cuts last week, grew sales by 1.9 percent, increasing its market share to 6.0 percent.

Janusz Walus testifies at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearing at Pretoria City Hall in this August 20, 1997 file photo.

Then newly elected Secretary General of the South African Communist Part (SACP) Chris Hani delivers his speech in Johannesburg in this December 8, 1991 file photo.

JOHANNESBURG The convicted killer of South African anti-apartheid leader Chris Hani will be freed on parole in two weeks after more than 20 years in prison, a Pretoria court ruled on Thursday.

Janusz Walus was serving a life sentence for the 1993 murder of Hani, a charismatic activist and politician who was both a senior member of the African National Congress (ANC) and the head of the South African Communist Party (SACP) when he was gunned down.

The decision to free him is likely to be contentious in a country still dealing with the legacy of the brutality meted out by the white-minority regime that prevailed from 1948 to 1994.

Hani's murder threatened to derail South Africa's transition to multi-racial democracy, leading to nationwide riots and triggering fears of a civil war.

Walus, a Polish immigrant, shot Hani dead outside his Johannesburg home.

""Yes, he got parole,"" his lawyer, Roelof du Plessis, told online service News24.

Walus was sentenced alongside Clive Derby-Lewis, a right-wing politician who provided the murder weapon.

Both men were originally sentenced to death, but that was commuted to life in prison after South Africa abolished the death penalty in 1995. Derby-Lewis was freed on medical parole last year.

Hani's wife, Limpho, criticized the decision to free Walus.

""It's very, very sad for South Africa. It's a very sad day,"" she told Talk Radio 702.

Justice Minister Michael Masutha had blocked a parole board decision to release Walus, leading to his legal challenge in the Pretoria court.

""We received the judgment with great disappointment,"" SACP spokesman Alex Mashilo said.

Apartheid death-squad leader Eugene de Kock, dubbed 'Prime Evil' for his role in the torture and murder of scores of black activists in the 1980s and early 1990s, was freed on parole last year after serving more than 20 years in prison.

His current whereabouts are unknown.

INDIAN WELLS, California While Maria Sharapova's fellow players were shocked by the Russian's announcement that she failed a drug test at the Australian Open, most of them felt the ""huge mistake"" could have been avoided.

World number three Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland described it as ""a very sad day for tennis"" but expressed the views of many by saying it was down to every player, via their doctor, to check whether prescribed medications were legal.

Five-times grand slam champion Sharapova tested positive for meldonium, which some researchers have linked to increased athletic performance and endurance, after failing by her own admission to realize that it had been outlawed since Jan. 1.

""I don't check those emails,"" Radwanska told reporters on Wednesday about receiving notification of which substances and medications were on the banned list before the start of every year. ""That is what my doctor is doing and my agent.

""I am scared because I know every pill can have something in it so when I am sick I am just taking aspirins 100 percent because I am always afraid that it is going to be something else. (To be safe) I had better play with the flu.""

Men's world number five Rafa Nadal pointed to Sharapova's negligence while also hoping that the Russian had made an innocent mistake.

""Everybody can have mistakes,"" the Spanish left-hander said at Indian Wells. ""I want to believe for sure that it is a mistake for Maria, she didn't want to do it.

""But it is obvious that it is negligence. The rules are like this. It is fair and now she must pay for it.""

SYMPATHY FOR SHARAPOVA

Eighth-ranked Czech Petra Kvitova, Wimbledon champion in 2011 and 2014, expressed sympathy for Sharapova but felt that the doping system was working well.

""Of course it's not great for her,"" the 26-year-old left-hander said. ""It's something which we all should know, what we are taking and what we are putting into the body.

""It's a huge mistake unfortunately and she has taken responsibility for it. We see that they (doping authorities) are trying to have a clean sport. The system is working, they are doing a good job on that.""

Sharapova, who faces a ban of up to four years pending an investigation by the International Tennis Federation, has got vocal support from fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova but other players have taken a less charitable view.

Three-time grand slam champion Jennifer Capriati tweeted earlier this week: ""I'm extremely angry and disappointed. I had to lose my career and never opted to cheat no matter what. I had to throw in the towel and suffer.

""I didn't have the high priced team of drs that found a way for me to cheat and get around the system and wait for science to catch up.""

In stark contrast, twice grand slam champion Kuznetsova tweeted on Wednesday: ""First of all, I want to say that Maria is a great athlete, and even this ""strange mistake"" will not be able to outshine all of what she has achieved in tennis.

""And most importantly, none of us, especially me, have no rights to comment this story - not to criticize or evaluate Maria. Doping agency has to see this case, not others.""

Sharapova also has been backed by both world number ones, Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams.

""I obviously wish her all the best,"" Djokovic told TMZ Sports. ""I've known her for a long time and I feel for her for what's happening. I just hope she gets out of this stronger.""

Williams said: ""It's just taking responsibility, which she admitted that she was willing to do and ready to do. She showed a lot of courage and a lot of heart. She's always shown courage and heart in everything she's done, and this is no different.""

reuters.com,2016-03-10 04:07:50+00:00,Rubio says he regrets getting personal with Donald Trump,['Steve Holland'],"Supporters of Republican U.S. presidential candidate Marco Rubio hold a sign against Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump during campaign rally in Miami, Florida, March 9, 2016.

Republican U.S. presidential candidate Marco Rubio and rival candidate Donald Trump (R) speak simultaneously at the U.S. Republican presidential candidates debate in Detroit, Michigan, March 3, 2016.

Republican U.S. presidential candidate Marco Rubio talks with Fox News Channel anchor Megyn Kelly during an interview at a campaign rally in Miami, Florida, March 9, 2016.

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio voiced regret on Wednesday about making personal attacks against front-runner Donald Trump, a strategy that has failed to slow the New York billionaire's momentum.Rubio, Trump, Ohio Governor John Kasich and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the four remaining Republican presidential candidates, participated in a round of Fox News-sponsored town hall events a day before they meet for another debate on Thursday in Miami.

Rubio, whose campaign is fighting for survival after a series of disappointing performances in nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election, has drawn fire for a line of attack in recent weeks in which he got personal with Trump.

He called him a con artist and said among other things that he had small hands, a charge that Trump took to mean as questioning the size of his manhood.

Until Rubio got personal, the U.S. senator from Florida had largely stayed above the fray and had focused his assault on Trump from a policy standpoint.

He told Fox News' ""The Kelly File"" that if he had to do it over again, he would handle the issue differently.

""My kids were embarrassed by it. My wife didnt like it. I dont think it reflects good. Thats not who I am. Thats not what my campaign is going to be about or will ever be about again,"" Rubio said.

""Id do it differently  on the personal stuff. Im not telling you he didnt deserve it, but thats not who I am and thats not what I want to be,"" he added.

Rubio, 44, fared poorly when Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho and Hawaii voted on Tuesday. He needs to win his home state of Florida next Tuesday or face calls for him to exit the race.

He said opinion polls showing him lagging far behind Trump in Florida were not accurate.

""The fact of the matter is the only poll that counts is the one theyll take on Tuesday when they count the votes that these people are going to cast and were going to win in Florida, he said.

Cruz, 45, looking to emerge as the main Trump alternative should Rubio and Kasich falter, said he would keep the focus of the campaign on substantive issues.

""I don't have any views on Donald Trump's anatomy,"" Cruz said at his Fox News town hall.

BROKERED CONVENTION?

Kasich, at his Fox News town hall, said he believed he had a path forward if he wins his home state of Ohio on Tuesday, but that it involved a convention fight when Republicans gather to officially pick their nominee in Cleveland in July.

A contested convention would result if Trump, 69, does not win the required 1,237 delegates, forcing delegates to decide whether to back him at the convention or find a consensus candidate such as Kasich, 63.

President Gerald Ford and challenger Ronald Reagan staged a spirited nomination fight at the 1976 Republican National Convention, but no Republican convention has gone beyond a single ballot since Thomas Dewey's third-ballot win in 1948.

Trump, who has come under withering attack by mainstream Republicans for his statements on Muslims, illegal immigrants and trade policy, said at his Fox News town hall he had attracted many new voters to the Republican Party with his crossover appeal.

He said establishment Republicans would be risking the energy he had brought to the race by trying to prevent him from winning.

""They would be so foolish to throw it away,"" he told host Sean Hannity.

The center-right government believes making it mandatory for Bulgarians to vote will curb electoral fraud and boost the legitimacy of the Balkan country's political institutions.

European Union member Bulgaria has had five governments in less than three years. The last national election in 2014 saw the lowest turnout in 25 years, of about 51 percent, and produced a particularly fractured parliament.

The bill passed on Thursday would allow non-voters to be sanctioned, either with a fine of about 50 levs ($27.75) or by having their social benefits withdrawn for three months.

The amendments, approved by 121 votes to 27, will have to be voted on again, probably in late March.

Bulgaria is due to hold a presiply to new and ongoing projects.

Over the years the sector has acquired a degree of notoriety which needs to be addressed to enable enhanced flow of investments, Venkaiah Naidu, minister of housing and urban poverty alleviation said in parliament when tabling the bill.

During recent years sluggish economic growth and delays in getting approvals stalled several projects, leaving buyers waiting for their homes and developers holding high debts. It has also put a strain on investors such as banks, private equity firms and non-banking financial companies.

The bill, designed to bring transparency and accountability to the sector that contributes about 9 percent of India's gross domestic product, is expected to revive investor and buyer confidence.

""It will help distinguish good real estate companies that conduct business by the book from those who have not ... It will make buyers more confident and will perk up market sentiments as well,"" said J.C. Sharma, managing director of Bengaluru-based developer, Sobha Ltd (SOBH.NS).

The new law is expected to benefit developers such as DLF Ltd (DLF.NS), Oberoi Realty (OEBO.NS), Prestige Estates Projects Ltd (PREG.NS) and Godrej Properties (GODR.NS) among others.

It is also likely to help Prime Minister Narendra Modi achieve his election promise of providing homes for all Indian families by 2022.

""Effective regulatory mechanism will lead to orderly growth of the sector and give a strong impetus to our vision of 'Housing for All',"" Modi tweeted after the bill was passed.

PROVISIONS AND PENALTIES

Several projects in India have been delayed in recent years after developers diverted funds raised for one project to another, leaving them unable to complete construction and resulting in buyers still waiting for their homes.

The bill seeks to stop this practice and impose penalties in case of a breach.

In a key provision, the bill makes it mandatory for developers to put aside 70 percent of money collected from buyers during the pre-sale of homes and use that solely for funding the construction of the project.

The bill also proposes that consumers and developers pay the same interest rate for any delays on their part. It also allows for developers to be arrested and jailed for up to three years for any violations.

""Even though some clauses are heavily stacked against the builders, we believe that this bill has the potential to transform our industry,"" said Rajeev Talwar, group executive director at Delhi-based developer, DLF.

The House Oversight Committee had sent a letter to Chief Executive Michael Pearson last August, seeking documents about steep hikes in prices of two of the company's heart drugs.

U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina March 9, 2016. Picture taken March 9, 2016.

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidates may find themselves in a more subdued debate than usual on Thursday night in Miami, since nothing Donald Trump's rivals have thrown at him has made a major dent in his front-running campaign.

After the histrionics of last week's gathering in Detroit, the four remaining candidates are likely to search for higher ground as they offer closing arguments to Republican voters, particularly those in Florida and Ohio, who vote next Tuesday in nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election.

The burden is particularly heavy on U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Governor John Kasich, who must do well in their home states or face pressure to exit the race.

While Kasich is holding his own against Trump in Ohio opinion polls, Rubio has lagged far behind Trump in Florida.

Trump's victories in Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii on Tuesday added to his momentum after a week of attacks by mainstream Republicans who are offended by his statements on Muslims, women and illegal immigrants and alarmed by his threats to international trade deals.

Trump defended his calls for a tougher U.S. stance on free trade on Thursday, saying the United States has been taken advantage of in negotiations with other countries. He also cited currency devaluations as a particular problem.

""I like free trade but you have to be represented by very, very good and smart and cunning people and we are not,"" Trump said in an interview on CNBC. ""Other countries are and that's why they're all taking advantage.""

The tough-talking billionaire businessman told CNN on Wednesday he expected the debate to be a ""nicer, softer, lighter debate, I hope."" But he added: ""I'll be ready. I'm the only one who can beat Hillary,"" a reference to Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton.

The tone could be set by Trump, 69, who forecast before several previous debates that he would take a more measured approach, only to quickly get into a verbal brawl with his rivals.

The CNN-hosted debate will be held at the University of Miami at 8:30 p.m. (0130 GMT on Friday).

""I would focus on a positive uplifting message that takes us back to why they're running for president and what's at stake in this election,"" said Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney.

In Detroit last Thursday, Trump came under sustained fire from Rubio, 44, over parts of his business empire such as Trump University, a now-defunct venture that critics said offered a flimsy education. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas piled on Trump over his past support for Democratic causes.

Trump blasted Rubio throughout the debate as a lightweight and Cruz as a liar.

'KIDS EMBARRASSED'

The Trump-Rubio debate clash in Detroit followed an abrupt change in Rubio's campaign to begin raising personal questions about Trump, such as saying he had small hands, a statement Trump saw as a reference to his penis size.

Rubio said he now regretted the personal insults.

""In terms of things that have to do with personal stuff, yeah, at the end of the day, it's not something I'm entirely proud of. My kids were embarrassed by it, and if I had to do it again, I wouldn't,"" Rubio told MSNBC on Wednesday.

Cruz, 45, who would like to knock Rubio and Kasich out of the race so he could draw more support from anti-Trump Republican voters, will seek to use the debate to position himself as the best Trump alternative.

""Trump is clearly trying to reach out and be a little more statesmanlike,"" said Cruz backer Saul Anuzis, a former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. ""Cruz is going to make the case as to why he can beat Trump and be the viable alternative. From our perspective, we think it's a two-man race, we're the only one with a path.""

Rubio is fighting for survival and is facing something of a last stand in Florida. Rival campaigns said Rubio may feel a need to return to the optimistic message he stuck to for months before getting sidetracked by Trump.

Rubio told Fox News on Wednesday the campaign was always going to come down to who wins Florida.

""The nominee has to win Florida. You cant be the Republican nominee if you dont win Florida,"" he said.

Kasich, Rubio and Cruz have one shot at denying Trump the nomination - preventing him from assembling the required 1,237 delegates to win the nomination outright, which would mean delegates would have to choose the nominee at their July 18-21 convention in Cleveland.

Trump said on CNN on Wednesday that 1,237 was an ""artificial number"" and that if he entered the convention with more delegates than his rivals, he should be the nominee.

While he has vowed to wage war against the party if he is denied the nomination at the convention, Kasich, 63, said it was possible for Republicans to have a contested convention and emerge united.

""Can you go to a convention and come out united? Absolutely,"" he told a Fox News town hall on Wednesday.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 15:46:17+00:00,"ECB pulls out all stops with rate cuts, stimulus boost","['Francesco Canepa', 'Balazs Koranyi']","FRANKFURT The European Central Bank unleashed some of it last remaining stimulus weapons on Thursday, cutting all three of its interest rates and expanding asset-buying to boost the economy and prevent ultra-low inflation becoming entrenched.

It slashed its inflation expectations for this year but also suggested that interest rates would go no lower.

In moves that briefly pushed the euro 1 percent down against the dollar, the ECB cut its deposit rate deeper into negative territory and increased monthly asset buys to 80 billion euros from 60 billion euros, above expectations of a hike to 70-billion.

While the deposit rate was cut 10 basis points to -0.4 percent, the main refinancing rate was shaved to zero from 0.05 percent and its marginal lending rate -- used by banks to borrow from the ECB overnight -- fell to 0.25 percent from 0.3 percent.

""Rates will stay low, very low, for a long period of time and well past the horizon of our purchases,"" ECB President Mario Draghi, judged to have disappointed markets in December with measures below expectations, told a news conference.

Purchases are due to end in March next year.

He added, ""From today's perspective and taking into account the support of our measures to growth and inflation, we don't anticipate that it will be necessary to reduce rates further,""

The ECB said it would also start buying corporate debt and launch four new rounds of cheap loan packages, to be extended by banks to the real economy.

Slashing its 2016 inflation forecast from one percent to just 0.1 percent, the Bank said further rounds of ultra-cheap four-year loans to banks could include extra financial sweeteners for them to take up the offer to pass on to others.

""A bank that is very active in granting loans to the real economy can borrow more than a bank that concentrates on other activities,"" Draghi noted.

REACTION

""Good news for Europe: Having delivered less than expected in December, the ECB returned to its usual form today and eased policy by a bit more than projected,"" said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg bank.

But others were more critical, warning that such loose monetary policy risked creating asset price bubbles and removed any incentive for governments to reform their economies.

""What will happen if the global economic situation deteriorates sharply once more, requiring a strong monetary policy response? I do not anticipate this happening, but if it did, the ECB would have already shot most of its powder, said Michael Menhart, chief economist at German reinsurer Munich Re.

Draghi answered such criticisms partly in German, arguing: ""Suppose we had embraced the 'nein zu allem' ('no to everything') policy strategy? We deem that the counterfactual would have been a disastrous deflation.""

But he acknowledged the limitations of negative rates and said any future moves would likely have to focus on other, non-conventional measures.

""Does it mean that we can go as negative as we want without having any consequences on the banking system? The answer is no,"" he said.

The ECB has little to show for the 700 billion euros it has spent buying government bonds and other assets in the past year, as tumbling raw materials prices blunt the impact of its quantitative easing.

That raises the risk that people will lose faith in the bank's commitment to its mandate. Inflation has been below the ECB's nearly 2 percent target for three years and is likely to remain so for many more.

The ECB's move came after the G20 group of the world's major kis has been named Reuters photographer of the year for his exceptional coverage of Europe's migrant crisis.,[]

Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) said it appointed two independent directors, returning the size of its board to nine people as it explores the sale of its core business amid pressure from activist investors.

The new directors are former Morgan Stanley (MS.N) healthcare and biotech banker Catherine Friedman and former Broadcom Corp Chief Financial Officer Eric Brandt, the company said on Thursday.

The appointments come after Max Levchin and Charles Schwab resigned from the board late last year.

Reuters reported on March 4 that Yahoo executives would meet this week with Starboard Value, an activist hedge fund that has led the push for the company to sell its core business. The two sides will discuss whether they can come to an agreement in order to avoid a proxy fight for control of Yahoo..

Shareholders have until March 26 to submit nominations for board members to be elected at Yahoo's annual meeting this spring. Starboard has said it is willing to launch a proxy fight with its own nominations.

Telecommunications company Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and publisher Time Inc (TIME.N) are among the companies expected to bid for Yahoo's core business, while some private equity firms are expected to team up to make offers.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 15:20:31+00:00,How a hacker's typo helped stop a billion dollar bank heist,['Serajul Quadir'],"Commuters pass by the front of the Bangladesh central bank building in Dhaka March 8, 2016.

DHAKA A spelling mistake in an online bank transfer instruction helped prevent a nearly $1 billion heist last month involving the Bangladesh central bank and the New York Fed, banking officials said.

Unknown hackers still managed to get away with about $80 million, one of the largest known bank thefts in history.

The hackers breached Bangladesh Bank's systems and stole its credentials for payment transfers, two senior officials at the bank said. They then bombarded the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with nearly three dozen requests to move money from the Bangladesh Bank's account there to entities in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, the officials said.

Four requests to transfer a total of about $81 million to the Philippines went through, but a fifth, for $20 million, to a Sri Lankan non-profit organisation was held up because the hackers misspelled the name of the NGO, Shalika Foundation.

Hackers misspelled ""foundation"" in the NGO's name as ""fandation"", prompting a routing bank, Deutsche Bank, to seek clarification from the Bangladesh central bank, which stopped the transaction, one of the officials said.

There is no NGO under the name of Shalika Foundation in the list of registered Sri Lankan non-profits. Reuters could not immediately find contact information for the organization.

Deutsche Bank declined to comment.

At the same time, the unusually high number of payment instructions and the transfer requests to private entities - as opposed to other banks - raised suspicions at the Fed, which also alerted the Bangladeshis, the officials said.

The details of how the hacking came to light and was stopped before it did more damage have not been previously reported. Bangladesh Bank has billions of dollars in a current account with the Fed, which it uses for international settlements.

The transactions that were stopped totalled $850-$870 million, one of the officials said.

Last year, Russian computer security company Kaspersky Lab said a multinational gang of cyber criminals had stolen as much as $1 billion from as many as 100 financial institutions around the world in about two years.

Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's son Qusay took $1 billion from Iraq's central bank on the orders of his father on the day before coalition forces began bombing the country in 2003, American and Iraqi officials have said. In 2007, guards at the Dar Es Salaam bank in Baghdad made off with $282 million.

MONEY RECOVERED

Bangladesh Bank has said it has recovered some of the money that was stolen, and is working with anti-money laundering authorities in the Philippines to try to recover the rest.

A bank spokesman could not be reached for comment late on Thursday.

The recovered funds refer to the Sri Lanka transfer, which was stopped, one of the officials said.

Initially, the Sri Lankan transaction reached Pan Asia Banking Corp, which went back to Deutsche Bank for more verification because of the unusually large size of the payment, a Pan Asia official said. ""The transaction was too large for a country like us,"" the official said. ""Then (Deutsche) came back and said it was a suspect transaction."" A Pan Asia spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.

The dizzying, global reach of the heist underscores the growing threat of cyber crime and how hackers can find weak links in even the most secure computer networks.

More than a month after the attack, Bangladeshi officials are scrambling to trace the money, shore up security and identify weaknesses in their systems. They said there is little hope of ever catching the hackers, and it could take months before the money is recovered, if at all.

Security experts said the perpetrators had deep knowledge of the Bangladeshi institution's internal workings, likely gained by spying on bank workers.

The Bangladesh government, meanwhile, is blaming the Fed for not stopping the transactions earlier. Finance Minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith told reporters on Tuesday that the country may resort to suing the Fed to recover the money.

""The Fed must take responsibility,"" he said.

The New York Fed has said its systems were not breached, and it has been working with the Bangladesh central bank since the incident occurred.

The hacking of Bangladesh Bank happened sometime between Feb. 4-5, over the Bangladeshi weekend, which falls on a Friday, the officials said. The bank's offices were shut.

Initially, the central bank was not sure if its system had been breached, but cyber security experts brought in to investigate found hacker ""foeconomies last month agreed they need to look beyond ultra-low interest rates and printing money to shake the global economy out of its torpor.

The U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, Bank of England and Swiss National Bank are all set to meet next week.

While Europe's growth prospects have held up relatively well on resilient domestic consumption, weak business and industrial sentiment indicators suggest it is facing increasing headwinds, particularly from slowing growth in China.

Many on social media noted the contentious nature of the debate, during which both candidates rushed to the left on the subject of undocumented immigrants, pledging not to deport any person inside the country illegally, so long as that person does not have a criminal record.

#DemDebate was pretty brutal. Many more debates like this and both candidates will be able to handle anything #DonaldTrump can serve up.  Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) March 10, 2016

But while Clinton and Sanders roughly split the total amount of Twitter traffic during the debate, according to data provided by the microblogging website, it was Sanders who generated the most viral moments from the Miami matchup.

Sanders had two largely quotable moments on social media during the debate. The Vermont senators assertion, I am dangerous for Wall Street, was the most-tweeted moment of the night, according to Twitter data. The comment sparked humorous comparisons to Walter White, the protagonist from the television series Breaking Bad.

A document identifying supporters of Islamic State is seen in this still image from video, released by Sky News to Reuters in London on March 10, 2016.

LONDON A disillusioned former member of Islamic State has passed a stolen memory stick of documents identifying 22,000 supporters in over 50 countries to a British journalist, a leak that could help the West target Islamist fighters planning attacks.

Leaks of such detailed information about Islamic State are rare and give Britain's spies a potential trove of data that could help unmask militants who have threatened more attacks like those that killed 130 people in Paris last November.

A man calling himself Abu Hamed, a former member of Islamic State who became disillusioned with its leaders, passed the files to Britain's Sky News on a memory stick he said he had stolen from the head of the group's internal security force.

On it were enrolment forms containing the names of Islamic State supporters and of their relatives, telephone numbers, and other details such as the subjects' areas of expertise and who had recommended them.

One of the files, marked ""Martyrs"", detailed a group of IS members who were willing and trained to carry out suicide attacks, Sky said.

Richard Barrett, a former head of global counter-terrorism at Britain's MI6 Secret Intelligence Service, said the cache was ""a fantastic coup"" in the fight against Islamic State.

""It will be an absolute goldmine of information of enormous significance and interest to very many people, particularly the security and intelligence services,"" Barrett told Sky News.

Sky said it had informed the British authorities about the documents which were passed to its correspondent, Stuart Ramsay, at an undisclosed location in Turkey.

Western security sources said that if genuine, the files could be gold dust as they could help identify potential attackers and the networks of sympathisers behind them, and give insight on the structure of the group.

Reuters was not able to independently verify the documents, given their provenance. A selection of them was published in Arabic.

Islamic State militants claimed responsibility for the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris and the Oct. 31 downing of a Russian passenger plane over Egypt's Sinai region that killed 224. They have promised more attacks on the West and Russia.

SUICIDE BOMBERS

Western leaders say Islamic State, which has proclaimed a caliphate in the parts of Syria and Iraq it controls, now poses a greater danger to the West than al Qaeda. It uses a militant interpretation of Islam to justify attacks on its foes and the use of extreme violence, including rape and beheadings, against those it sees as infidels.

The defector, a former Free Syrian Army fighter who switched to Islamic State, said the group had been taken over by former soldiers from the Iraqi Baath party of Saddam Hussein, who was ousted in 2003 after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.

Some of the defector's Arabic documents, posted on the Zaman Al Wasl Syrian news website, were forms issued by ""Islamic State in Iraq and Sham, the General Directorate of Borders"" and displayed personal details of each fighter, according to a review of some of the documents by Reuters.

The forms included answers to 23 questions such as assumed name, birthplace, education level, extent of Sharia learning and previous jobs, as well as details about the individuals' journey to Islamic State and whether they were potential suicide bombers or more traditional fighters.

When asked for his view of the documents, Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at London's Royal United Services Institute, said in an emailed response: ""It seems a bit dated.""

""Very interesting though and a real gift for researchers into understanding the group more,"" he added. ""The key for me in many ways is how this highlights the bureaucracy of the organisation once again - kinda like al Qaeda in fact.""

Keith Strobelt, political director of the United Steelworkers local union, poses for a picture in Canton, Ohio, March 4, 2016. Picture taken March 4, 2016.

CANTON, Ohio If Donald Trump wins the Republican Party nomination, his path to the White House will run through this working-class city with a knack for picking presidents.

No Republican has ever won the White House without Ohio. And nowhere better reflects the challenges and opportunities Trump faces in his 2016 presidential quest than Canton, a once-booming industrial city that, like Ohio and the rest of Americas rust belt, is going through profound economic and demographic change.

Canton, a gritty northeastern Ohio city where the once-dominant steel industry has been in decline for 20 years, is the heart of Stark County, a political bellwether that, save twice, has picked every winning presidential candidate since 1964.

The real-estate moguls primary wins in Michigan and in Mississippi on Tuesday, in the face of blistering attacks from the party's establishment, expanded his lead in the White House nominating race and demonstrated his broad appeal across many demographic groups in the Republican Party.

But here, in predominately white Canton, the birthplace of professional American football, he will need to show cross-over appeal in the general election and win over not just Republicans but working-class Democrats and some independents, to beat a Democrat, illustrating the challenge he will face in Ohio and potentially other Midwestern rust belt states.

A more immediate test looms next week in the states Republican primary, where polls show Trump narrowly leads Ohio Governor John Kasich, who casts himself as a pragmatic, statesman-like alternative to Trump. If Trump wins Ohio and Florida  states rich in the delegates who select their party's nominee at July's Republican National Convention - he would almost certainly lock up his partys nomination.

Sitting in a steel workers' meeting at their Canton union hall, Curtis Green, the chapter's vice president, described Trump's support among a growing number of members as their ""dirty little secret.""

""I view him as a radical and a racist and I don't want to be affiliated with that,"" Green said. ""But if you say what you mean, a lot of guys see that in Trump and they respect that. He doesn't dance around the issues, he takes them head on. There are a fair amount of our members who do support Donald Trump.""

OHIO PICKS WINNERS

If Trump just wins the states that Republican nominee Mitt Romney won in 2012, he would have only 206 electoral college votes, short of the 270 needed to win the White House. The fight over electoral college votes has turned recent elections into pitched battles over a dozen or so states.

Ohio is often at the center.

The state, which has not voted for the loser in a presidential election since 1960, is seen as a microcosm of American swing voters  from culturally conservative Reagan Democrats who defected from their party to support Republican Ronald Reagan in the 1980s to suburban soccer moms and upwardly mobile Hispanics.

To offset the growing proportion of blacks and Hispanics in the voting age population, Trump must turn white voters out in greater numbers than Romney in cities such as Canton. His performance in primary states where Democrats and independent can vote, as well as Republicans, suggests Trump could attract large numbers of these voters in a general election.

Reuters interviews here with more than two dozen voters show why.

In this city of 72,500 people, Trump's denunciation of free trade, political correctness and illegal immigrants is resonating among some traditionally Democratic blue-collar steel workers.

""The labor unions, who usually support the Democrats, a lot of our members, and a lot of their families, are supporting Trump,"" said Keith Strobelt, a political director for the United Steelworkers local union in Canton. Strobelt does not support Trump.

Canton's local United Steelworkers union has 1,800 members - down from 6,700 at its peak 30 years ago. Its leadership has not officially endorsed a candidate, thought it has praised Democrat Senator Bernie Sanders. Some rank-and-file members, however, say they better identify with Trumps broadsides against illegal immigration and tirades against trade with China and Mexico.

""It could be that several hundred of our members will back Trump,"" Strobelt said. ""A lot find him refreshing. He says a lot of things they say around their dinner tables.""

Em fevereiro, a previsao da Conab era de safra de 83,34 milhoes de toneladas, apos um recorde de 84,67 milhoes em 2014/15.

Para a primeira colheita, a agencia estatal reduziu a previsao para 28,24 milhoes, ante 28,36 milhoes em fevereiro, por perdas de produtividade.

Ja para a segunda safra, tambem conhecida como ""safrinha"" e que esta em plena fase de plantio, a Conab elevou a previsao em 290 mil toneladas, para um recorde de 55,28 milhoes de toneladas.

O principal fator a elevar a previsao da segunda safra foi justamente a area plantada, que e vista agora em alta de 1,8 por cento ante a safrinha de 2014/15. Em fevereiro, a previsao de alta era de 0,7 por cento.

Essa ampliacao da area consegue ate suplantar uma previsao de queda de 0,5 por cento nas produtividades medias da segunda safra, na comparacao com a temporada passada.

""Na medida em que a colheita da soja avanca (em Mato Grosso), ajudada pelo clima que permite a entrada dos equipamentos nas lavouras, a grande expectativa se relaciona com o comportamento dos produtores em relacao a ampliacao ou nao da area plantada com o milho segunda safra, que por ocasiao do levantamento ja havia semeada em torno de 60 por cento da estimativa"", disse a Conab.

Ate o mes passado, os tecnicos do governo projetavam uma estabilidade na area plantada em Mato Grosso, principal produtor nacional de milho na segunda safra. No relatorio divulgado nesta quinta, ja aparece uma previsao de leve alta de 1 por cento na area semeada.

A Conab destaca, no entanto, que o clima continuara sendo decisivo para a safrinha de milho no Centro-Oeste, nao apenas porque influencia diretamente nas produtividades, mas tambem porque uma previsao de poucas chuvas poderia reduzir o estimulo para expansao de area pelos agricultores.

""A ausencia das chuvas em algumas regioes produtoras, que no momento e extremamente importante para a colheita da soja, tem gerado entre os produtores uma forte indecisao sobre o momento apropriado para o plantio do cereal"", destacou a Conab.

Por outro lado, a estatal avaliou que uma normalizacao das chuvas provocaria forte incremento do plantio, acima do que ja esta previsto no levantamento atual.

""O clima estabelecera a dependencia (para uma definicao de safra), uma vez que as condicoes de mercado sao estimuladoras"", disse a Conab.

Para o Parana, the region is changing in ways that favor Democrats, reflecting the Republican Party's broader problems with a U.S. electorate that is becoming less white and less culturally conservative.

In 2000, Canton was nearly 75 percent white, with an African American population of 20 percent, and an Hispanic population of just over 1 percent. Its biggest employer was the Timken Company, a giant ball bearing and high custom steel manufacturer that was the dominant economic force in Canton for much of the 20th century.

By 2010, according to Census data, Canton was 69 percent white. Its black population had increased by 3 percent, its Hispanic residents to nearly 3 percent.

Tuesdays primary in neighboring Michigan showed how volatile this election has become, with Trumps potent appeal among disaffected whites stretching beyond the South. In the Democratic race, Sanders won most of the states white working-class countryside and small towns in an upset over front-runner Hillary Clinton.

In Canton, like elsewhere in the rust belt heartlands stretching from the Midwest to the Great Lakes region and parts of the Northeast, manufacturing has been hollowed out since the 1970s, due in part to foreign competition. In 1990, Ohio had over 1 million manufacturing jobs; today, just 680,000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Ohio has shed nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs since the 2007-2009 Great Recession.

A different type of worker, more white collar and upscale, has moved into the Canton area.

The top two employers are now the Aultman Hospital and Mercy Medical Center, highly competitive health care providers.

While Trump might pick up blue collar Democrats, and older folks who are disillusioned with the political process, the flip side is he could lose more upper-status voters in Ohio,"" said John Green, a political science professor at the University of Akron, close to Canton. ""Republican Party leaders in Ohio are wringing their hands. There is a perception that Trump helps among blue collar voters - but could alienate white collar voters.""

Jane Timken, the vice-chair of the Stark County Republican Party and the wife of TimkenSteel's chief executive, said the local party was encountering people who had never voted Republican before but were supporting Trump.

But, she said, there was concern Trump might turn off other voters, especially independents who account for one fifth of Ohio's voters.

There is no polling to predict which way Canton and Stark County will vote in November's general election. But after a long era of mixed local government, the city council, after elections last year, is now made up of entirely Democratic Party members, although the current mayor, a former Democrat, won office as an independent.

In Canton, there are nearly 6,000 voters registered as Democrats, compared to just over 1,100 Republicans according to the Stark County Board of Elections. In 2006, there were 12,000 registered Democrats and 4,400 Republicans.

Democratic strategists say that despite the demographic changes, Trump could still prevail.

Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic strategist, cites Trump's dominant performance in the Republican primary in Massachusetts on March 1. Although not a rust belt state, Trump won big in heavily blue collar, union cities.

""Trump put together a coalition in Massachusetts that elects Democratic governors. He won among Catholics, a week after picking a fight with the Pope. I absolutely think he can put the rust belt into play,"" she said.

Catwalk-to-shop retail model divides brands","['Marie-louise Gumuchian', 'Li-mei Hoang']","A model presents a creation from the Ermanno Scervino Autumn/Winter 2016 women's collection during Milan Fashion Week, Italy, in this February 27, 2016 file photo.

Models present creations by German designer Karl Lagerfeld as part of his Fall/Winter 2016/2017 women's ready-to-wear collection for fashion house Chanel at the Grand Palais in Paris, France, in this March 8, 2016 file photo.

MILAN/LONDON With minutes until show time, a group of seamstresses are adding the final touches to designer Ermanno Scervino's latest creations to be unveiled on the catwalk.

Embellished coats, mosaic print suits and lace dresses are among the outfits the Italian designer is presenting at Milan Fashion Week. It will be months before they hit the shops.

With the amount of craftsmanship involved, Scervino says his clothes take time to make and he has no plans to follow other labels selling their items straight off the catwalk, effectively bridging the traditional six-month runway-to-retail gap.

""I think that it is not for me, it is not for (products of) excellence,"" Scervino told Reuters. ""We have long (designing) time frames. I am not interested.""

The recent autumn/winter 2016/2017 fashion weeks in New York, London, Milan and Paris have seen designers divided over retail models some labels are adopting to put their items immediately on sale after their catwalk presentations.

In an age of social media - where fashion shows are streamed online - and with competition from high street retailers regularly updating their collections, Britain's Burberry and designer Tom Ford announced new ""see now, buy now"" strategies last month.

""If we are Instagramming, live-streaming and showing the collections, we can't expect a customer and a consumer to tie in with a traditional kind of calendar,"" Burberry Chief Executive Christopher Bailey said.

""So I do think we all need to evolve and change but I don't think that there's one rule that fits everybody.""

Other labels such as Prada, Diane von Furstenberg and Monique Lhuillier have made similar moves even if on a smaller scale, selling a select few items. Designer Karl Lagerfeld said Chanel is already putting its pre-collections designs in stores fast.

""I realise that when people see an image they want it right away,"" said Lhuillier, who put five looks for sale after her New York show. ""This is the way we're experimenting to see if this is how we want to show.""

Buyers are welcoming the fast fashion move, namely when brands have customers in different climates.

""I think the changes have been a long time coming,"" Ed Burstell, managing director of Liberty store in London, said.

""No one can understand now when they see something 'why do I have to wait six months to buy it'.""

However, opposition remains from those who say preparing collections is a lengthy process.

""When you want to make a collection creative, you need the time, you need to study the fabrics, specific research,"" Carlo Capasa, head of Italy's national chamber of fashion, said.

In Paris, label Dior echoed that.

""How can a collection like the one you've just seen be delivered to the shops tomorrow?,"" Chief Executive Sidney Toledano said after Dior's show.

""That would mean we'd manufactured it six months ago and put it in the fridge ... When you put a collection in the shops the following day, that means that the selection from the runway has already been made -- you're taking a risk.""

A U.S. congressional committee stepped up the pressure on Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) on Thursday, urging the company to explain why it was withholding documents related to an investigation into drug pricing.

The House Oversight Committee had sent a letter to Chief Executive Michael Pearson last August, seeking documents about steep hikes in prices of two of the company's heart drugs.

Four top executives left the company in January, the biggest leadership exodus since co-founder Jack Dorsey returned as chief executive last year.

The departures added to concerns about the company's ability to make its product more engaging and generate more money from advertising.

Twitter has been offering cash bonuses to some employees, ranging from $50,000 to $200,000 as an incentive to keep them around for another six months to a year, the Journal reported on Wednesday. (on.wsj.com/2219IVi)

The company has also granted varying amounts of restricted stock depending on when the employees started working, intending to make up for the value lost since they joined the company, the newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Twitter's shares have lost more than 60 percent of their value over the past 12 months.

""Competitive compensation, strong leadership and a confidence in the direction of the company are all key elements to having top talent,"" a Twitter spokeswoman said in an email.

""We are investing in all three areas to ensure we maintain these employees,"" she said, without providing further details.

Dorsey said in October he would give a third of his stock in the company, a stake of about 1 percent, to the employee equity pool.

Later that month, he spoke about ""hiring and investing in talent"" and the need for ""bold rethinking.""

Twitter showed no growth in users in the fourth quarter. That was the first time that had happened since the company went public in 2013.

Twitter's shares were unchanged at $17.66 in light premarket trading.

f economists' expectations of 81.6 percent. Statscan lowered the third-quarter figure to 81.6 percent from an initially reported 82.0 percent.

Lower activity in most parts of the construction industry sent the sector's utilization rate down to 83.7 percent from 84.7 percent in its fourth consecutive quarter of declines.

The oil and gas industry operated at 78.3 percent of its capacity, down from 79.4 percent as extraction volumes fell. The energy sector has suffered because of the drop in oil prices.

The manufacturing sector overall ran at 83.3 percent of its capacity, down slightly from 83.4 percent. The utilization rate fell in 12 of the industry's 21 major groups. Those groups accounted for about 60 percent of manufacturing's gross domestic product.

For the year overall, the average capacity utilization rate fell 1 percentage point to 81.3 percent. The cheaper price of oil, a major Canadian export, put Canada in a mild recession in the first half of 2015.

It remains to be seen, however, whether this is another instance of the Golden States being out in front of the rest of the country or just inhabiting a parallel universe.

Todays California is a bright blue state in federal elections. It is firmly on the progressive side on social issues and proactively seeks to lead the way in addressing climate change. At the same time, Governor Jerry Brown has imposed fiscal restraint. With the help of large Democratic legislative majorities and a voter-approved ballot measure that allows budget passage by a simple majority vote in the legislature, once red-hot appropriation wars have cooled.

A cadre of moderate Democrats has also been able to flex some political muscle in support of business-related issues in the Legislature, which has muted Republican rhetoric and charmed the GOPs corporate allies. Political civility is the order of the day, at least for now.

Partisan warfare beyond Sacramento has ebbed considerably, partly because California is no longer a truly competitive two-party state. Instead, independent voters are becoming increasingly influential. Democratic registration has remained relatively flat; it has dropped a modest 0.5 percent since 2003, to 43.1 percent of the state electorate. GOP registration, meanwhile, fell 7.7 percent, to just 27.6 percent of registered voters.

The big registration gain has been among voters with no declared party preference. They make up 24 percent of registered voters, up 7.9 percent from 2003. These voters skew younger and are more Latino and Asian than the rest of the electorate. These voting blocs are more inclined to vote Democratic, which further isolates the GOP.

So it should not be surprising that Democrats have overwhelming majorities in the legislature and in the states congressional delegation. All statewide-elected officeholders are Democrats, and it has been more than a quarter of a century since the Republican presidential ticket carried California.

Demographics, of course, have played a big part in reshaping Californias political landscape. The states diverse population is not fertile ground for Republicans, particularly in light of the GOPs anti-immigrant rhetoric and the partys obstructionism in Washington. Social issues such as abortion rights and gun control also tilt California toward the Democrats.

This doesnt mean that California has become a one-party state. Its more a no party state. Modern California has long had a candidate-centric electoral process. This dynamic has been abetted by a series of systemic changes that have rearranged the political battlefield in ways that shifts the political wars toward the center of the ideological spectrum.

A major catalyst for Californias new moderate politics has been a series of ballot measures enacted by voters that overturned the states closed primary system, took reapportionment out of the hands of the legislature, unclogged the gridlock surrounding Californias historically contentious state-budget process and, most recently, revamped legislative term limits.

A consequential change has been the implementation of the top two primary. Under this system, all candidates for a legislative, congressional or statewide office compete on a single primary ballot. Voters then choose between the two top vote-getters  regardless of party affiliation  in the general election. No longer are there closed primaries in which the most liberal candidate generally prevails in Democratic districts, and hard-right conservatives dominate the Republican districts.

Under the new rules, campaigns increasingly look to the entire electorate in primaries, not just to the party faithful. In several legislative and congressional races, this has meant run-offs between two contenders from the same party. Independents and voters of the opposition party often hold the balance of power.

The race to fill retiring Senator Barbara Boxers seat may showcase the impact of the top-two primary system. In past elections, the two major-party finalists were chosen in closed Democratic and Republican primaries, which tilted liberal and conservative, respectively. Under the new system, all candidates from all parties will appear on the same ballot. So, on this Junes ballot, Democratic front-runners Attorney General Kamala Harris and Orange County Representative Loretta Sanchez will face lesser-known opponents, including former GOP state chairmen Duf Sundheim and Tom Del Beccaro.

Given their higher visibility and substantial funding advantages, the two Democrats will likely square off in the general election in November. Harris will have the advantage of a strong San Francisco Bay area base and the name recognition that comes with having been on the statewide ballot twice.

Sanchez, meanwhile, could appeal to the states substantial Latino voting bloc and draw on her Orange County and Southern California roots. Sanchez also has national-security chops from her 19 years in Congress, where she is the most senior woman member of the House Armed Services Committee and the House Homeland Security Committee.

While Harris probably would have had a significant advantage in a closed Democratic primary, the outcome of a Democrat-versus-Democrat contest in November is far less clear. Harris, who is very much in the mold of President Barack Obama, will have to compete for Republican and independent votes against a pugnacious candidate who has frequently taken pro-business and tough-on-terrorism stances. The outcome, like so many contested elections in California today, is likely to be decided in the middle.

None of this is to say that political donnybrooks are a thing of the past in the Golden State. Big issues remain unresolved, including billions of dollars in public pension obligations, decades of neglected infrastructure needs, education challenges and Californias perpetual water wars. Northern California still pretty much hates the South. Mega-interests  among them, powerful public-employee unions, Indian Gaming tribes, major businesses and environmental activists  still regularly duke it out in the capitol and on the ballot.

All things considered, though, politics and governance seem to be functioning far better in California than in Washington  or on the presidential campaign trail. At a time when moderate has become a dirty word on the national scene, California government is functioning  and functioning well  pretty much in the middle of the road.

Its too early to say if the Golden State is just taking a breather from political dysfunction or if a new era of kinder, gentler politics has settled in and  like so many of Californias previous political movements and cultural trends  spreads across the nation.",[]

Benfica, leading 1-0 from the first leg of the round of 16 tie and fielding a makeshift defence, fell behind in the 69th minute to a Zenit goal scored by Brazilian striker Hulk.

With Zenit pressing for a second, however, Benfica snatched an 85th-minute equaliser when Gaitan was first to react after Raul Jimenez's long-range drive hit the bar and he headed in from the rebound.

Substitute Talisca scored with the last kick of the game to leave Zenit waiting for their first ever quarter-final place. Twice former European champions Benfica reached the last eight for the first time since 2012.

The first hour was a cagey affair with few chances, although Benfica nearly snatched an away goal in the fourth minute when Jonas's curling free kick was tipped over the bar by Yuri Lodygin.

Zenit came to life after a double substitution by coach Andre Villas-Boas just before the hour and immediately created chances.

They went ahead in the 69th minute after Yuri Zhirkov, who appeared to foul Nelson Semedo, broke down the left and crossed into the middle where Hulk, who up to that point had a dismal game, headed in.

Lodygin saved Zenit when he brilliantly turned away Victor Lindelhof's header, but Benfica were on the ropes and Zenit nearly grabbed a second when goal when Artem Dzyuba ran through the middle of the Benfica defence but his shot was blocked by Ederson.

Gaitan's goal would have been enough for Benfica to advance but the visitors completed a 3-1 aggregate win six minutes into added time when Gaitan burst forward and a lucky bounce presented Talisca with a chance which the Brazilian crashed home in style.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 05:15:40+00:00,Bucks rally to defeat Heat,['Reuters Editorial'],"(The Sports Xchange) - Finding a strong bench combination has been an issue all season long for the Milwaukee Bucks.

Wednesday was no different, as head coach Jason Kidd moved Greg Monroe back into the starting five while relegating Miles Plumlee back to the bench.

The move paid off, as Plumlee hit 8 of 12 shots and scored 18 points as the Bucks rallied down the stretch for a 114-108 victory over the Miami Heat at the Bradley Center.

""Sometimes, we try to take a step back and try to not put an emphasis on starting,"" Kidd said. ""You just play your minutes. Miles played the same way as he did when he was starting.""

Plumlee and Monroe had switched places 12 games ago as Kidd tried to add some punch to his bench, which had been plagued by injuries and general ineffectiveness.

Both players responded well to the move, especially Plumlee, who averaged 6.9 points and 5.6 rebounds in 19.1 minutes a night.

He wasn't the only reserve to step up in a big way for Milwaukee. Little-used point guard Tyler Ennis was pressed into action thanks to the season-ending injury to Michael Carter-Williams and a stomach virus that kept O.J. Mayo away Wednesday night.

He scored eight points with five assists in 25 minutes of work and had five in the fourth quarter as the Bucks re-took the lead and pulled away for the victory.

""We needed it tonight,"" said Khris Middleton, who finished with 22. ""Those guys have been working hard all year long. They finally got a chance to play some minutes and really produced out there for us.""

The Bucks held an eight-point lead early in the third quarter before Miami got on a little bit of a roll and grabbed the lead on a hook shot by Luol Deng that made it a 76-74 game with 3:49 left in the quarter.

Deng scored 11 of his 20 in the third and added seven more in the final quarter, but Milwaukee answered and tied the game at 89 on a Middleton jumper with 8:15 remaining.

Wade found Deng open in the corner to put the Heat back up three, but a bucket and two free throws by Plumlee put Milwaukee back in front.

A layup by Giannis Antetokounmpo pushed the lead to five with 6:07 remaining and Milwaukee held on for the victory.

""I don't think they really knew what they wanted to do with me and Giannis in the pick-and-roll, so it worked out for us,"" said Middleton.

""It's something that we've been doing lately with smaller guys guarding me and him, so it's been working for us.""

Miami and Milwaukee both shot 52.5 percent from the field, hitting an identical 42 of 80 shots.

And while the Heat outperformed from beyond the arc, hitting 6 of 15 compared to 4 of 8 for Milwaukee, the Bucks held an advantage at the free-throw line, making 26 of 37 while Miami made just 18 in 19 trips, and also capitalized on second-chance points, scoring 19 off 12 offensive rebounds.

But Miami's good shooting was nullified by carelessness; Milwaukee forced 17 turnovers which the Bucks flipped for 23 points.

""They had 66 paint points, we had 60. They beat us at the line. They beat us in second chance points,"" said Dwyane Wade, who scored 18 but was forced to play with four fouls for much of the final quarter.

""But as a team, we had just too many turnovers.""

Josh Richardson hit three 3-pointers and finished with 14 points while Hassan Whiteside scored 23 off the bench to lead Miami, which had its five-game winning streak snapped.

The Bucks got 24 from Antetokounmpo and 23 from Jabari Parker while Monroe finished with 10 and eight rebounds.",[]

LONDON Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored the winner as Paris St Germain beat Chelsea 2-1 to knock them out of the Champions League for the second successive season at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.

PSG's victory after their 2-1 first-leg win in Paris put Laurent Blanc's team into the last eight for the fourth successive season 4-2 on aggregate.

A composed display built on superb passing outclassed the English champions and confirmed the runaway Ligue 1 leaders as one of the favourites to win this season's premier European club competition.

PSG went ahead in the 16th minute when Angel Di Maria found Ibrahimovic, sent off when the sides clashed at the same stage a year ago, wide on the right.

The 34-year-old Swedish striker's cross eluded the defence for Adrian Rabiot to tap in, giving Thibaut Courtois no chance.

But Chelsea, without injured skipper John Terry at the back, recovered with neat moves of their own and equalised with a superbly constructed goal when Diego Costa checked past Thiago Silva to fire wide of Kevin Trapp after 27 minutes.

The hosts, however, lost their cutting edge when Costa went off injured and Ibrahimovic turned in Di Maria's cross from close range after 67 minutes, meaning Chelsea needed to score three times to win the tie.

""It was a difficult game for us but we never change our philosophy, we try to play with the ball and create gaps to score,"" PSG's former Chelsea defender David Luiz told BT Sport.

""It was a collective victory. Everyone knows how hard it is to play here. We kept calm and we scored at key moments.""

Chelsea's interim manager Guus Hiddink bemoaned the gulf in quality between the sides.

""You saw the difference between the squads when we had to bring young guys on and they have Edinson Cavani to come in,"" the Dutchman said.

""We gave too much respect in the first 10 minutes, they were dominating. They are a good side but once we stepped up we had some chances.""

PSG, who have only lost twice in 44 matches in all competitions this season and are set to win the French League for the fourth successive year, took an early grip on the game with Ibrahimovic linking superbly with Di Maria and Lucas.

They deserved their opening goal, but Chelsea, who have improved after a poor start to the season, began to impose themselves with Willian central to most of their best moves and Costa a constant threat.

Costa went off with a calf injury and the visitors wrapped up the match and the tie through Ibrahimovic's goal.

Chelsea, languishing 10th in the domestic standings, now have the FA Cup as their only hope of a trophy this season as PSG eye bigger prizes.

Volunteers distribute bottled water to help combat the effects of the crisis when the city's drinking water became contaminated with dangerously high levels of lead in Flint, Michigan, March 5, 2016.

U.S. Democratic presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders listens as Abdelmajid Jondy speaks during a community forum about contaminated water in Flint, Michigan February 25, 2016.

FLINT, Mich. The Flint water crisis has united Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in outrage, but some residents suffering through the city's major public health scandal want more than talking points from the presidential contenders.

As Flint becomes the focal point of the Michigan primary battle when it hosts a nationally televised debate on Sunday, residents want to see Clinton and Sanders push harder for funding to replace the city's crumbling water pipes, pay for long-term medical needs and lower their water bills.

""We don't want our pain to be exploited as a political backdrop. We need more from both of the candidates,"" said Nayyirah Shariff, a Flint resident and co-founder of the activist Flint Democracy Defense League who has met with both Clinton and Sanders.

The crisis in Flint, a predominantly black city of 100,000, was triggered when an emergency city manager installed by Governor Rick Snyder switched the city's water supply from Lake Huron to the nearby Flint River to save money.

The change corroded Flint's aging pipes and released lead and other toxins into the water supply, exposing thousands of residents including children to high lead levels that have sparked serious health problems.

The crisis has sparked national outrage and led to calls for Snyder to resign.

Both Democratic presidential contenders have raced to condemn the water contamination and criticize Republican Snyder for a slow state response, linking it to broader racial and economic inequities.

But Melissa Mays, who has suffered seizures since the contamination and has three children with elevated lead levels in their blood, said she has not gone to local events where Clinton and Sanders met with residents.

""I'm not going to be used like that. I'm not going to be a token,"" said Mays, founder of Water You Fighting For?, another activist group. ""Do something first, then I'll show up.""

President Barack Obama declared a state of emergency in Flint in January, but lawmakers in Congress have been unable to agree on a funding package to replace aging pipes.

DEBATE TO HIGHLIGHT CITY'S PLIGHT

The issue will get a full national airing from the Democratic presidential candidates in a debate in Flint scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. EST on Sunday.

Republican presidential candidates have steered clear of Flint on the campaign trail, but when U.S. Senator Marco Rubio was asked about Flint during Thursday's debate in Detroit he defended Snyder and said the ""politicizing"" of the crisis was unfair. The U.S. presidential election is in November.

Both Clinton and Sanders, who are vying for support from black voters in Michigan and nationally, have highlighted the crisis in Flint as an example of racial and economic inequality.

Clinton was quick to jump on the issue, sending aides to Flint to meet with local officials, visiting the city on Feb. 7 and pressing for adding the debate in Flint. She was rewarded with an endorsement from Flint Mayor Karen Weaver and several black pastors in the region.

Sanders also waded into the controversy, quickly calling for Snyder's resignation, but he did not visit Flint until Feb. 25, more than two weeks after Clinton.

Clinton gets credit from some residents for her aggressive approach, even if some see it as political expediency.

""She has certainly tried to bring a great deal of awareness to what has gone in Flint,"" said Rev. Allen Overton, a member of the Flint-area Concerned Pastors for Social Action group and a Clinton supporter. ""Sanders is trying to catch up.""

The Rev. Dan Scheid of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Flint said the crisis raises questions about race and class - issues ripe for political exploitation.

""The cynic in me would say there is an understandable level of opportunism taking place,"" Scheid said. ""But any attention the candidates can bring in putting this injustice in front of the country is helpful.""

Keri Webber, whose entire family has been afflicted with an array of illnesses, including a daughter with lead in her bones, said she was frustrated by the parade of politicians expressing sympathy for Flint but taking few concrete steps to help.

""The Democrats are trying to build a name off us, and the Republicans couldn't tell you where Flint, Michigan, is,"" Webber said.

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Barack Obama deliver remarks to reporters after their bilateral meeting alongside the APEC Summit in Manila, Philippines, in this November 19, 2015 file photo.

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama was preparing a red-carpet welcome for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the White House on Thursday, ending a frosty period in U.S.-Canada relations and celebrating their shared goals on climate and trade.

Obama will host Trudeau, the Liberal Party leader who took office in November, for an Oval Office meeting where they will talk about curbing climate emissions from oil and gas fields - a dramatic shift from years of debate over building the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a project Obama blocked last year.

Also on the agenda are plans to expedite travel and trade between the two countries, and shared areas of global concern ranging from Syria to Ukraine.

""We are two countries that are, in every sense of the word, inseparable,"" Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, told Reuters.

The leaders are slated to hold a news conference at 11:40 a.m. (1640 GMT) in the Rose Garden.

Later, they will toast each other at a lavish state dinner planned with a theme of ""Anticipation of Spring,"" a feeling close to the hearts of Canadians, who endure long and harsh winters.

The dinner will feature Colorado lamb, sidestepping what could have been the awkward optics of a beef dish.

Canada won a World Trade Organization case last year against a U.S. meat-labeling law for beef and pork. The law was repealed in December, and the White House hopes that Canada formally ends its lawsuit.

Trudeau, who is struggling at home with a soft economy and weak Canadian dollar, campaigned on repairing strained ties.

""Few relationships matter as much to Canada as a good relationship with the United States of America, for jobs, for economic growth, for trade purposes, and building the kinds of opportunities for Canadians right across the country that we truly need,"" he said on Wednesday before leaving for Washington.

Americans have been captivated by the photogenic Trudeau, 44, whose father, Pierre Trudeau, was prime minister from 1968 through 1979, and again from 1980 to 1984.

But his visit may be overshadowed by the raucous race to succeed Obama in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Candidates on both the left and the right have taken anti-trade positions.

Obama hopes to convince a reluctant U.S. Congress to ratify the sprawling Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact before he leaves office in January. Canada is also wrestling with the merits of the TPP.

LONDON British takeover target Home Retail reported improved trading at its Argos stores and a bigger-than-expected cash pile on Thursday, a week before a deadline for bids.

Supermarket group Sainsbury's and South Africa's Steinhoff International are pursuing Home Retail, which said sales at Argos stores open for more than a year fell by 1.1 percent in the last eight weeks of its financial year to Feb. 27, an improvement on a 2.6 percent drop for the year.

Chief Executive John Walden said both bids were ""interesting"", but Home Retail's board needed to receive them before it could express a preference.

""We need to wait and understand whether there are firm offers forthcoming, and then we'll figure out a process,"" he said.

Argos' total sales rose 1.9 percent to 515 million pounds in the period, the company said in a statement, as demand for furniture and sports goods offset lower electrical product sales.

Like-for-like sales were impacted by the opening of 90 net new stores over the year, it said.

Walden said he was pleased with the improvement in Argos' sales performance and the progress the group was making online.

Sales through Internet channels, including reserving items for store collection and same-day home delivery, grew 13 percent, representing just over half of total Argos sales.

The group ended 2015 with underlying cash of 310 million pounds on its balance sheet, ahead of analyst forecasts by 100 million pounds. It said net cash at the end of its financial year was around 625 million pounds, including disposal proceeds.

""That's clear value that any buyer's going to get immediately, so you would certainly think we have successfully added more value to the business in the last quarter,"" Walden told reporters.

Last month Sainsbury's had a 1.3 billion pounds bid for Home Retail trumped by Steinhoff. Both suitors have been given until March 18 to formalise their offers.

Shares in Home Retail, which have jumped by more than 75 percent since news of a possible bid from Sainsbury emerged on Jan. 5, were trading up 0.1 percent at 180 pence.

Analyst David Jeary at Canaccord Genuity noted that Steinhoff's 175 pence-a-share offer was currently above Sainsbury's mixed shares and cash offer, but below the market price, indicating a higher bid was expected.

""With the shares trading above the Steinhoff offer, the market is clearly discounting an increased bid (or bids).""

Under UK takeover rules, whichever company bids first triggers a 53-day extension for their rival, effectively creating a ""game of chicken"" as each weighs up a bid.

Home Retail completed the 340 million pounds disposal of its Homebase home improvement business to Australian group Wesfarmers last month, leaving it with just the Argos business.

The company said it was on track to report profit before tax in line with market expectations of 93 million pounds.

LONDON Morrisons, the smallest of Britain's four main supermarket groups, raised its profit outlook on Thursday after identifying ways to broaden its business including a deal to supply food to online giant Amazon.

The group, based in the northern English city of Bradford, said it expected 50-100 million pounds of additional profit in the medium term from areas such as online business, wholesale, manufacturing and lower interest costs.

Last week Morrisons surprised the market by announcing a wholesale supply deal with Amazon and agreeing the outline of a new deal with online grocer Ocado to grow Morrisons.com.

There are signs 2016 could be a better year for Britain's big supermarkets who have been hammered by a price war and lost ground to German discounters Aldi and Lidl.

The ""big four"", headed by market leader Tesco, are narrowing the price gap with the discounters, improving product availability and customer service and doing a better job at highlighting their larger product ranges and online services.

Shares in Morrisons have risen 41 percent over the last three months, buoyed by improving trading and the Amazon deal. Last week the company re-entered Britain's FTSE 100 index of blue chip companies after a three month absence.

They slipped 2.9 percent to 196 pence by 1045 GMT.

UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT

Over the coming months hundreds of Morrisons' fresh and frozen products will be made available to Amazon's UK customers. Some analysts expect that over time the project will be extended to Morrisons' entire range.

""In terms of whether it can grow to be a bigger business, I think in the end that's down to customers and down to the execution in the broader supply chain on both sides,"" Chief Executive David Potts told reporters.

""Our belief is it will be advantageous to stakeholders in Morrisons,"" he said.

Potts, a former Tesco executive who joined Morrisions a year ago, was speaking after the firm reported an expected 27 percent slump in full-year profit.

RECOMMENDED: Retailers invite rival brands to fill their empty spaces

Morrisons and bigger rivals Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda, are cutting prices to stem the loss of shoppers to the discounters.

Morrisons made an underlying pretax profit before one off items of 302 million pounds in the year to Jan. 31, at the mid-point of previous guidance but down from the 413 million pounds made in 2014-15. It represents a fourth straight year of decline and a nine year low.

Though turnover for the year fell 4.1 percent to 16.1 billion pounds, sales at stores open over a year showed an improving trend and were up 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter - a first quarterly rise in four years.

""We've got our tails up a bit on trade,"" said Potts, who also upgraded guidance on working capital, property disposal proceeds, and the dividend.

Morrisons was now more competitive and receiving positive customer feedback from moves to tailor offers to local tastes and improved store standards, he said.

""The notable improvement in sales trends towards the end of the year is a sign that the back-to-basics strategy may be starting to bear fruit,"" said Tristan Chapple, head of research at Phoenix Asset Management, which owns 1 percent of Morrisons.

A woman walks out of the headquarters of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, in Beijing in this November 20, 2013 file photo.

China's central bank is preparing regulations that would allow commercial lenders to swap non-performing loans of companies for stakes in those firms, two people with direct knowledge of the new policy told Reuters.

The new rules would reduce commercial banks' non-performing loan (NPL) ratios, and free up cash for fresh lending for investment in a new wave of infrastructure products and factory upgrades that the government hopes will rejuvenate the world's second-largest economy.

NPLs surged to a decade-high last year as China's economy grew at its slowest pace in a quarter of a century. Official data showed banks held more than 4 trillion yuan ($614 billion) in NPLs and ""special mention"" loans, or debts that could sour, at the year-end.

The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the release of a new document explaining the regulatory change was imminent. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

""Such a rule change shows banks' bad loans have risen to such a level that this issue has to be tackled now before it's too late,"" said Wu Kan, Shanghai-based head of equity trading at investment firm Shanshan Finance.

State banks have extended loans to government financing vehicles and state-owned coal and steel producers, so this policy can help give lenders time to deal with non-performing assets as China pushes supply-side reforms, Wu added.

The quality of assets held by banks is worse than it looks, analysts have said. To avoid stumping up capital and to protect their balance sheets, some banks have under-reported bad loans and under-recognized overdue debt.

The top banking regulator has warned commercial lenders to pay special attention to risks.

Bank shares .CSI300BI fell more than 2 percent on Thursday, with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS) down 2 percent and Bank of Communications (601328.SS) losing 2.7 percent.

""This was mainly due to a technical correction, but there's also investor uncertainty over how those non-performing assets would be valued, and disposed of eventually,"" said Wu at Shanshan Finance.

The sources said the new regulations would get special approval from the State Council, China's cabinet-equivalent body, thus skirting the need to revise commercial bank law, which bars banks from investing in non-financial institutions.

Previously, Chinese commercial banks usually dealt with NPLs by selling them at a discount to state-designated asset management companies which, in turn, would try to recover the debt or re-sell at a profit to distressed debt investors.

The sources had no further detail on how banks would value the new equity stakes, which would represent assets on their balance sheets, or what ratio or amount of NPLs they would be able to convert this way.

On paper, the move would also represent a way for indebted companies to reduce their leverage, cutting the cost of servicing debt and making them more worthy of fresh credit.

Beijing has prioritized the closure of so-called ""zombie"" firms responsible for much of China's corporate debt overhang, and has taken aim at overcapacity in industries such as steel and coal.

Lai Xiaomin, chairman of China Huarong Asset Management Co (2799.HK), the country's biggest bad debt manager, said he had no direct knowledge of the move, but would welcome such debt-to-equity swaps.

These would help companies ""improve their financial situation"" and ""prevent the spread of financial risk"", Lai told Reuters. Coal, steel, real estate and machinery were among the sectors he thought most suitable for debt-to-equity swaps.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 11:53:46+00:00,ECB couldn't 'tolerate' London grip on euro trading post-Brexit - France's Noyer,['Reuters Editorial'],"Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer attends a conference of central bankers hosted by the Bank of France in Paris November 7, 2014.

LONDON European authorities could not allow London to remain the trading centre for the euro if Britain left the European Union, former Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said on Thursday.

In an article for economic think tank OMFIF, Noyer, who was one of the European Central Bank's most senior figures until late last year, sent the latest warning that the euro zone would try to wrestle more control of trading back from London.

The volume of euro-dollar trading alone was some $640 billion (450.5 billion) a day in London last year and traders in the City financial district now buy and sell more than twice as many euros as the whole 19-member euro zone.

""If Britain left the EU, the euro area authorities could no longer tolerate such a high proportion of financial activities involving their currency taking place abroad,"" Noyer wrote.

""It is already very difficult for euro members to accept that our currency is largely traded outside the currency area, beyond the control of the ECB and of euro area institutions such as market regulators.""

The head of London-based HSBC, the world's fifth-largest currency trader and Europe's biggest bank by assets, has already said it could move around 1,000 employees from London to Paris should Britain vote to leave the EU in a June referendum.

The currency market's second biggest player, Deutsche Bank, has also said it may cut its British operations while industry lobbyists say several other banks are mothballing investments until the outcome of the referendum is known.

More than 40 percent of the roughly $5 trillion per day of foreign exchange traded globally by banks, companies and investment houses passes through London.

The ECB has already attempted to require clearing houses that deal with large amounts of euro denominated securities, such as LCH.Clearnet in London, to shift to the euro zone, but this was rebuffed by the EU's top court in Luxembourg.

""When tensions occur and risks materialise, the interests of a foreign financial centre might take priority over those of the currency area itself,"" Noyer said in the article.

""That can be acceptable only if, and as long as, the UK is a member of the EU, and accepts the involvement of, and co-operation with, the European regulatory agencies.""

reuters.com,2016-03-10 10:42:02+00:00,Opera becomes first big browser maker with built-in ad-blocker,['Eric Auchard'],"FRANKFURT Norwegian company Opera is introducing a new version of its desktop computer browser that promises to load web pages faster by incorporating ad-blocking, a move that makes reining in advertising a basic feature instead of an afterthought.

Faster loading, increased privacy and security and a desire for fewer distractions are behind the growing demand for ad-blockers.

However, their popularity is cutting into the growth of online marketing for site publishers and corporate brands, who rely on reaching web and mobile users to pay for their content rather than restricting access to paid subscribers.

Opera has a history of introducing innovations that later become common in major browsers such as tabbed browsing and pop-up blocking, which helped users control an earlier generation of in-your-face ads and malware disguised as advertising.

""Ad-blocking technology is an opportunity and a wake-up call to the advertising industry to pay attention to what consumers are actually saying,"" an Opera spokeswoman said.

Opera said it can cut page-loading times by as much as 90 percent by eliminating the complex dance that occurs behind the scenes in a user's browser as various third-party ad networks deliver promotional messages to users.

The Norwegian company, which has agreed to a takeover by a group of Chinese firms led by Beijing Kunlun Tech in a cash deal valued at $1.23 billion, introduced its first computer web browser in 1995.

With the rise of the smartphone, it shifted to focus on the mobile browser and advertising market, where it now derives most of its revenue and counts 281 million users.

Opera said on Thursday it was introducing a version of its browser aimed at software developers and early adopters, but will eventually offer the feature for both computers and phones.

The Oslo-based firm ranks a distant fifth behind more mainstream desktop computers browsers from Microsoft, Google, Firefox and Apple. The company counts 60 million active monthly desktop users worldwide.

Opera sees no contradiction in the fact that it relies on advertising for a big chunk of its own revenue but is introducing ad-blocking control features in its products. Demand for ad-blocking should abate when messages became less disruptive and more relevant, an Opera spokeswoman said.

Because it is building the features directly into its browser, page delivery times are 40 percent faster than existing ad-blocker plug-ins, or browser extensions, it said. Top plug-in providers include AdBlock, AdMuncher and Ghostery that run on top of existing browsers.

A study published by PageFair and Adobe estimated online ad revenue lost to blockers in 2015 would amount to $21.8 billion and those losses could almost double to $41.4 billion in 2016. Ad-placement firm Carat forecasts global digital and mobile advertising will near $150 billion this year.

A woman walks out of the headquarters of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, in Beijing in this November 20, 2013 file photo.

China's central bank is preparing regulations that would allow commercial lenders to swap non-performing loans of companies for stakes in those firms, two people with direct knowledge of the new policy told Reuters.

The new rules would reduce commercial banks' non-performing loan (NPL) ratios, and free up cash for fresh lending for investment in a new wave of infrastructure products and factory upgrades that the government hopes will rejuvenate the world's second-largest economy.

NPLs surged to a decade-high last year as China's economy grew at its slowest pace in a quarter of a century. Official data showed banks held more than 4 trillion yuan ($614 billion) in NPLs and ""special mention"" loans, or debts that could sour, at the year-end.

The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the release of a new document explaining the regulatory change was imminent. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

""Such a rule change shows banks' bad loans have risen to such a level that this issue has to be tackled now before it's too late,"" said Wu Kan, Shanghai-based head of equity trading at investment firm Shanshan Finance.

State banks have extended loans to government financing vehicles and state-owned coal and steel producers, so this policy can help give lenders time to deal with non-performing assets as China pushes supply-side reforms, Wu added.

The quality of assets held by banks is worse than it looks, analysts have said. To avoid stumping up capital and to protect their balance sheets, some banks have under-reported bad loans and under-recognized overdue debt.

The top banking regulator has warned commercial lenders to pay special attention to risks.

Bank shares .CSI300BI fell more than 2 percent on Thursday, with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS) down 2 percent and Bank of Communications (601328.SS) losing 2.7 percent.

""This was mainly due to a technical correction, but there's also investor uncertainty over how those non-performing assets would be valued, and disposed of eventually,"" said Wu at Shanshan Finance.

CABINET APPROVAL

The sources said the new regulations would get special approval from the State Council, China's cabinet-equivalent body, thus skirting the need to revise commercial bank law, which bars banks from investing in non-financial institutions.

Previously, Chinese commercial banks usually dealt with NPLs by selling them at a discount to state-designated asset management companies which, in turn, would try to recover the debt or re-sell at a profit to distressed debt investors.

Keith Strobelt, political director of the United Steelworkers local union, poses for a picture in Canton, Ohio, March 4, 2016. Picture taken March 4, 2016.

CANTON, Ohio If Donald Trump wins the Republican Party nomination, his path to the White House will run through this working-class city with a knack for picking presidents.

No Republican has ever won the White House without Ohio. And nowhere better reflects the challenges and opportunities Trump faces in his 2016 presidential quest than Canton, a once-booming industrial city that, like Ohio and the rest of Americas rust belt, is going through profound economic and demographic change.

Canton, a gritty northeastern Ohio city where the once-dominant steel industry has been in decline for 20 years, is the heart of Stark County, a political bellwether that, save twice, has picked every winning presidential candidate since 1964.

The real-estate moguls primary wins in Michigan and in Mississippi on Tuesday, in the face of blistering attacks from the party's establishment, expanded his lead in the White House nominating race and demonstrated his broad appeal across many demographic groups in the Republican Party.

But here, in predominately white Canton, the birthplace of professional American football, he will need to show cross-over appeal in the general election and win over not just Republicans but working-class Democrats and some independents, to beat a Democrat, illustrating the challenge he will face in Ohio and potentially other Midwestern rust belt states.

A more immediate test looms next week in the states Republican primary, where polls show Trump narrowly leads Ohio Governor John Kasich, who casts himself as a pragmatic, statesman-like alternative to Trump. If Trump wins Ohio and Florida  states rich in the delegates who select their party's nominee at July's Republican National Convention - he would almost certainly lock up his partys nomination.

Sitting in a steel workers' meeting at their Canton union hall, Curtis Green, the chapter's vice president, described Trump's support among a growing number of members as their ""dirty little secret.""

""I view him as a radical and a racist and I don't want to be affiliated with that,"" Green said. ""But if you say what you mean, a lot of guys see that in Trump and they respect that. He doesn't dance around the issues, he takes them head on. There are a fair amount of our members who do support Donald Trump.""

OHIO PICKS WINNERS

If Trump just wins the states that Republican nominee Mitt Romney won in 2012, he would have only 206 electoral college votes, short of the 270 needed to win the White House. The fight over electoral college votes has turned recent elections into pitched battles over a dozen or so states.

Ohio is often at the center.

The state, which has not voted for the loser in a presidential election since 1960, is seen as a microcosm of American swing voters  from culturally conservative Reagan Democrats who defected from their party to support Republican Ronald Reagan in the 1980s to suburban soccer moms and upwardly mobile Hispanics.

To offset the growing proportion of blacks and Hispanics in the voting age population, Trump must turn white voters out in greater numbers than Romney in cities such as Canton. His performance in primary states where Democrats and independent can vote, as well as Republicans, suggests Trump could attract large numbers of these voters in a general election.

Reuters interviews here with more than two dozen voters show why.

In this city of 72,500 people, Trump's denunciation of free trade, political correctness and illegal immigrants is resonating among some traditionally Democratic blue-collar steel workers.

""The labor unions, who usually support the Democrats, a lot of our members, and a lot of their families, are supporting Trump,"" said Keith Strobelt, a political director for the United Steelworkers local union in Canton. Strobelt does not support Trump.

Canton's local United Steelworkers union has 1,800 members - down from 6,700 at its peak 30 years ago. Its leadership has not officially endorsed a candidate, thought it has praised Democrat Senator Bernie Sanders. Some rank-and-file members, however, say they better identify with Trumps broadsides against illegal immigration and tirades against trade with China and Mexico.

""It could be that several hundred of our members will back Trump,"" Strobelt said. ""A lot find him refreshing. He says a lot of things they say around their dinner tables.""

WRINGING THEIR HANDS

But in a general election, Trump faces formidable odds in Canton, as he does across Ohio and the Midwest. Canton and the region is changing in ways that favor Democrats, reflecting the Republican Party's broader problems with a U.S. electorate that is becoming less white and less culturally conservative.

In 2000, Canton was nearly 75 percent white, with an African American population of 20 percent, and an Hispanic population of just over 1 percent. Its biggest employer was the Timken Company, a giant ball bearing and high custom steel manufacturer that was the dominant economic force in Canton for much of the 20th century.

By 2010, according to Census data, Canton was 69 percent white. Its black population had increased by 3 percent, its Hispanic residents to nearly 3 percent.

Tuesdays primary in neighboring Michigan showed how volatile this election has become, with Trumps potent appeal among disaffected whites stretching beyond the South. In the Democratic race, Sanders won most of the states white working-class countryside and small towns in an upset over front-runner Hillary Clinton.

In Canton, like elsewhere in the rust belt heartlands stretching from the Midwest to the Great Lakes region and parts of the Northeast, manufacturing has been hollowed out since the 1970s, due in part to foreign competition. In 1990, Ohio had over 1 million manufacturing jobs; today, just 680,000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Ohio has shed nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs since the 2007-2009 Great Recession.

A different type of worker, more white collar and upscale, has moved into the Canton area.

The top two employers are now the Aultman Hospital and Mercy Medical Center, highly competitive health care providers.

While Trump might pick up blue collar Democrats, and older folks who are disillusioned with the political process, the flip side is he could lose more upper-status voters in Ohio,"" said John Green, a political science professor at the University of Akron, close to Canton. ""Republican Party leaders in Ohio are wringing their hands. There is a perception that Trump helps among blue collar voters - but could alienate white collar voters.""

Jane Timken, the vice-chair of the Stark County Republican Party and the wife of TimkenSteel's chief executive, said the local party was encountering people who had never voted Republican before but were supporting Trump.

But, she said, there was concern Trump might turn off other voters, especially independents who account for one fifth of Ohio's voters.

There is no polling to predict which way Canton and Stark County will vote in November's general election. But after a long era of mixed local government, the city council, after elections last year, is now made up of entirely Democratic Party members, although the current mayor, a former Democrat, won office as an independent.

In Canton, there are nearly 6,000 voters registered as Democrats, compared to just over 1,100 Republicans according to the Stark County Board of Elections. In 2006, there were 12,000 registered Democrats and 4,400 Republicans.

Democratic strategists say that despite the demographic changes, Trump could still prevail.

Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic strategist, cites Trump's dominant performance in the Republican primary in Massachusetts on March 1. Although not a rust belt state, Trump won big in heavily blue collar, union cities.

""Trump put together a coalition in Massachusetts that elects Democratic governors. He won among Catholics, a week after picking a fight with the Pope. I absolutely think he can put the rust belt into play,"" she said.

OTTAWA Canadian new home prices rose in January, driven by higher costs in Vancouver and Toronto, data from Statistics Canada showed on Thursday, highlighting the ongoing strength of the country's hottest markets.

The national 0.1 percent price gain fell slightly short of economists' expectations for an increase of 0.2 percent. The new housing price index excludes apartments and condominiums, which the government says are a particular cause for concern and which account for one-third of new housing.

Vancouver was the top contributor with a 0.4 percent gain, making for the city's eighth consecutive increase. Builders cited new listing prices and market conditions as the main reasons for January's gain.

The combined region of Toronto and Oshawa, where prices have been increasing for the last year, saw a 0.2 percent rise with builders pointing to similar factors as in Vancouver.

But prices were either lower or unchanged in two-thirds of the metropolitan areas covered in the survey, including Calgary, where prices were flat.

Canada's housing sector has accelerated in the years since the financial crisis but a more trifurcated market has emerged lately with energy-sensitive areas slowing, Toronto and Vancouver gaining and the rest of the country plodding along.

U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina March 9, 2016. Picture taken March 9, 2016.

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidates may find themselves in a more subdued debate than usual on Thursday night in Miami, since nothing Donald Trump's rivals have thrown at him has made a major dent in his front-running campaign.

After the histrionics of last week's gathering in Detroit, the four remaining candidates are likely to search for higher ground as they offer closing arguments to Republican voters, particularly those in Florida and Ohio, who vote next Tuesday in nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election.

The burden is particularly heavy on U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Governor John Kasich, who must do well in their home states or face pressure to exit the race.

While Kasich is holding his own against Trump in Ohio opinion polls, Rubio has lagged far behind Trump in Florida.

Trump's victories in Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii on Tuesday added to his momentum after a week of attacks by mainstream Republicans who are offended by his statements on Muslims, women and illegal immigrants and alarmed by his threats to international trade deals.

Trump defended his calls for a tougher U.S. stance on free trade on Thursday, saying the United States has been taken advantage of in negotiations with other countries. He also cited currency devaluations as a particular problem.

""I like free trade but you have to be represented by very, very good and smart and cunning people and we are not,"" Trump said in an interview on CNBC. ""Other countries are and that's why they're all taking advantage.""

The tough-talking billionaire businessman told CNN on Wednesday he expected the debate to be a ""nicer, softer, lighter debate, I hope."" But he added: ""I'll be ready. I'm the only one who can beat Hillary,"" a reference to Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton.

The tone could be set by Trump, 69, who forecast before several previous debates that he would take a more measured approach, only to quickly get into a verbal brawl with his rivals.

The CNN-hosted debate will be held at the University of Miami at 8:30 p.m. (0130 GMT on Friday).

""I would focus on a positive uplifting message that takes us back to why they're running for president and what's at stake in this election,"" said Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney.

In Detroit last Thursday, Trump came under sustained fire from Rubio, 44, over parts of his business empire such as Trump University, a now-defunct venture that critics said offered a flimsy education. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas piled on Trump over his past support for Democratic causes.

Trump blasted Rubio throughout the debate as a lightweight and Cruz as a liar.

'KIDS EMBARRASSED'

The Trump-Rubio debate clash in Detroit followed an abrupt change in Rubio's campaign to begin raising personal questions about Trump, such as saying he had small hands, a statement Trump saw as a reference to his penis size.

Rubio said he now regretted the personal insults.

""In terms of things that have to do with personal stuff, yeah, at the end of the day, it's not something I'm entirely proud of. My kids were embarrassed by it, and if I had to do it again, I wouldn't,"" Rubio told MSNBC on Wednesday.

Cruz, 45, who would like to knock Rubio and Kasich out of the race so he could draw more support from anti-Trump Republican voters, will seek to use the debate to position himself as the best Trump alternative.

""Trump is clearly trying to reach out and be a little more statesmanlike,"" said Cruz backer Saul Anuzis, a former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. ""Cruz is going to make the case as to why he can beat Trump and be the viable alternative. From our perspective, we think it's a two-man race, we're the only one with a path.""

Rubio is fighting for survival and is facing something of a last stand in Florida. Rival campaigns said Rubio may feel a need to return to the optimistic message he stuck to for months before getting sidetracked by Trump.

Rubio told Fox News on Wednesday the campaign was always going to come down to who wins Florida.

""The nominee has to win Florida. You cant be the Republican nominee if you dont win Florida,"" he said.

Kasich, Rubio and Cruz have one shot at denying Trump the nomination - preventing him from assembling the required 1,237 delegates to win the nomination outright, which would mean delegates would have to choose the nominee at their July 18-21 convention in Cleveland.

Trump said on CNN on Wednesday that 1,237 was an ""artificial number"" and that if he entered the convention with more delegates than his rivals, he should be the nominee.

While he has vowed to wage war against the party if he is denied the nomination at the convention, Kasich, 63, said it was possible for Republicans to have a contested convention and emerge united.

""Can you go to a convention and come out united? Absolutely,"" he told a Fox News town hall on Wednesday.

The deal, signed on Wednesday in Dhaka, came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement of the new credit line to Bangladesh during his Dhaka visit in June last year. It follows India's $1 billion in assistance provided to Bangladesh in 2011 for infrastructure development.

The credit line would be used to finance development in the power sector, railways, road transportation, information and communication technology, shipping, health and technical education sectors, the Exim Bank said it a statement.

During Modi's visit, the two countries signed a land boundary agreement, more than four decades after the neighbours first tried to resolve the complex territorial disputes.

MUMBAI A group of Indian banks, seeking to recover more than $1 billion in loans from Kingfisher Airlines has taken possession of nine trademarks related to the defunct carrier as the mystery over the whereabouts of its chief, Vijay Mallya, deepens.

Mallya, who built his fortune with Kingfisher Beer and is a guarantor to the debt, left the country last week, a lawyer for the lenders told the Indian Supreme Court on Wednesday. The banks have asked the court to demand his return and to impound his passport.

The latest twist in Mallya's fortunes come as authorities are looking to make good on a pledge to clean up bank balance sheets, with the industry saddled by an estimated $120 billion in bad and troubled loans.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told parliament on Thursday that the lenders will take every possible action to recover the debt from Mallya and other defaulters.

""As far as the government is concerned, the clear instructions are that the banks must go all out to take every possible action,"" he said, adding that there were some cases of ""wilful default even bordering (on) fraud"".

Kingfisher stopped flying in October 2012, leaving creditors, suppliers and employees unpaid. It owed banks 90.91 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) at the end of November, Jaitley said.

Separately, State Bank of India (SBI)(SBI.NS), the leader of Kingfisher's creditor banks, said in a statement that it had moved ""very promptly on taking the appropriate legal steps required to protect banks' interest and public money"".

SBI denied accusations in media reports that laxity on the part of the banks had helped Mallya to leave the country.

Mallya, who had billed himself as the ""King of Good Times"" living an extravagant life, has been called a wilful defaulter by some banks. He said over the weekend that the he had no intention of running away from Kingfisher's creditors and was in talks with them over a one-time settlement.

The trademarks seized include the ""Kingfisher"" label, ""Flying Models"" and ""Fly the Good Times"", according to a notice in newspapers by the banks' trustee, SBICAP Trustee Co.

Harish Bijoor, a brand consultant, described the banks' move as a knee-jerk reaction and said there might not be many takers for the trademarks.

""Who would ever want to run with a label called Kingfisher Airlines?"" Bijoor said, adding that he does not expect the move to affect India's best-selling beer, Kingfisher.

Kingfisher beer is made by United Breweries (UBBW.NS), which is part of Mallya's UB Group but now counts Heineken (HEIN.AS) as its biggest shareholder.

Four women and one man were shot and killed, with three more people wounded in the attack late on Wednesday, in a residential neighborhood in Wilkinsburg, about 8 miles (13 km) east of the city, the Allegheny County Police Department said.

Dozens of shell casings littered the pavement of an alleyway near the site, where police were gathering evidence and talking to witnesses, according to media reports.

A 41-year-old woman who was wounded in the shooting was treated and released from a local hospital, according to a hospital spokesman.

One of the dead was identified as Tina Shelton, 38, a mother of five who held down three jobs and was encouraged by family members to attend the barbecue as a way to relax after work, her father Vernes Pugh and other relatives told local station WPXI-TV.

""I'm very upset. She's a hard working woman,"" said Pugh, who had driven his daughter home from work, along with two of her children, at 6:30 p.m. before she left for the cookout. Her youngest child is a 12-year-old boy, he told WPXI-TV.

Two suspects fired from an alley onto a backyard party at a home, the police department said in a statement, then one of the shooters fired from the side or adjacent backyard as partygoers tried to run into the home. The suspects then fled.

Four died at on the back porch, while another woman died at a hospital, the police statement said. Two males were reported in critical condition and a woman in stable condition at local hospitals.

""We do not have any suspects in custody and the motive is not exceptionally clear at this point,"" said Lieutenant Andrew Schurman of the Allegheny County Police Department.

The shooting in Wilkinsburg, a borough of about 15,000 chiefly lower- and middle-income residents, is the latest in a series of mass shootings that have made gun control a matter of heated debate in the United States.

""Wilkinsburg is a community filled with grief, shock and anger this morning,"" Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald said in a statement on Thursday. ""As a community, we must say enough is enough and providing information on this senseless shooting can be our first step to stopping the violence in our communities.""

The shooting generated more than 10,000 tweets, with many expressing outrage over gun violence.

""Woke up to the terrible news about the Wilkinsburg shooting,"" U.S. congressman Mike Doyle, who represents the Pennsylvania district that includes Wilkinsburg, said on Twitter. ""My prayers are with the families and friends of the victims.""

reuters.com,2016-03-10 13:23:16+00:00,Racket firm Head give Sharapova benefit of doubt,['Martyn Herman'],"Russia's Maria Sharapova celebrates after winning her fourth round match against Switzerland's Belinda Bencic at the Australian Open tennis tournament at Melbourne Park, Australia, January 24, 2016.

LONDON Racket firm Head has extended its contract with five-times grand slam champion Maria Sharapova despite her failed drugs test at this year's Australian Open, CEO Johan Eliasch said on Thursday.

The 28-year-old Russian will be provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) from this weekend after she admitted at a news conference on Monday taking the banned substance meldonium.

Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer cut ties with Sharapova this week, while Nike and Porsche have distanced themselves from her.

However, Eliasch said Sharapova, under contract with Head since 2011, had 'earned the benefit of the doubt' after making an 'honest' mistake.

""For a decade Maria Sharapova has been a role model and woman of integrity who has inspired millions of fans around the world to play and watch tennis,"" he said in a statement.

""The honesty and courage she displayed in announcing and acknowledging her mistake was admirable. HEAD is proud to stand behind Maria, now and into the future and we intend to extend her contract.

""We look forward to working with her and to announcing new sponsorships in the weeks and months ahead.""

A statement issued later confirmed that the contract had been signed and extended.

In Los Angeles on Monday, Sharapova said she had been taking meldonium, also known as mildronate, for 10 years because of health problems and regular bouts of flu.

The drug, produced in Latvia but unavailable for purchase in the United States where Sharapova is based, was only added to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list of banned substances in January, shortly before her positive test in Melbourne.

Manufactured for people suffering from heart problems, it can also increase blood flow and improve exercise capacity.

Head said they were convinced Sharapova had not taken the drug to gain any competitive advantage.

""It is common ground within the scientific community that in order for meldonium to have any relevant performance enhancing effect it has to be taken in daily dosages in excess of 1,000 to 2,000mg,"" the statement said.

""According to the attorney for Maria, her dosage was significantly less than that.""

While underlining Head's commitment to clean sport, Eliasch said he trusted Sharapova's explanation that she had not realized meldonium had been banned by WADA.

""In the absence of any evidence of any intent by Maria of enhancing her performance or trying to gain an unfair advantage through the use of mildronate, we further conclude this falls into the category of 'honest' mistakes,"" he said.

Russian biathlete Eduard Latypov was suspended from competition on Thursday after testing positive for meldonium, the latest in a flurry of athletes to fall foul of the drug since it was prohibited.

After electing to bat, South Africa posted 178 for four in their 20 overs, boosted by a magnificent unbeaten 97 from Hashim Amla.

Australia paced their reply perfectly, however, and profited from a fine opening stand of 76 between Shane Watson (42) and Usman Khawaja (33).

Those two fell in a single Imran Tahir over, but any thoughts South Africa had of clawing their way back into the game evaporated as a composed Smith, whose runs came from just 26 balls, and David Warner (33) added 79 for the third wicket.

Australia reached their target with four deliveries remaining, but never looked like falling short.

They head off to India for the World Twenty20 where they open their campaign against New Zealand on March 18.

Opener Amla proved the anchor for South Africas innings as he caressed an unbeaten 97 from 62 balls that included eight fours and four sixes.

Quinton de Kock (25 from 13 balls) and David Miller (30 from 16) provided impetus, but the innings slowed when Faf du Plessis and Rilee Roussow, in for the rested AB de Villiers, took 28 balls to score a combined 20 runs.

South Africa take on England in their first match of the World Twenty20, also on March 18.

BRUSSELS European Union interior ministers expressed reservations on Thursday over easing visa requirements for Turkey, a key element of a tentative deal with Ankara that Brussels and Germany hope will halt the mass influx of refugees and migrants to Europe.

EU and Turkish leaders agreed in principle on Monday that Ankara would prevent people from leaving its shores for Europe in exchange for more help for refugees living in Turkey, visa liberalisation for Turks visiting Europe and accelerating Turkey's long-dormant EU accession talks.

The 28 EU leaders have given themselves until the next summit due on March 17-18 to hone the details of an agreement that has stirred resistance in some countries, not least due to concerns over Turkey's record on human rights and press freedom.

Last Friday Turkish authorities seized control of the country's largest newspaper, Zaman, in a widening crackdown on supporters of a U.S.-based Muslim cleric opposed to President Tayyip Erdogan.

EU officials also say Turkey, a country of 75 million, only meets about half of more than 70 technical requirements for visa-free travel with Europe.

""It is highly questionable that Turkey, which puts a newspaper critical of the government under its own control, presents a wish-list three days later and is rewarded by discussions about earlier visa liberalisation,"" said Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.

""I ask myself if the EU is throwing its values overboard,"" Mikl-Leitner said as she arrived for Thursday's ministerial talks, adding that she would push for a termination clause to be inserted into any final agreement.

SCHENGEN ZONE UNDER THREAT

Austria and other countries along the main migration route linking Greece to Germany via the Western Balkans, have resorted to unilateral tightening of border controls as the bloc struggles to forge a joint response to the migrant crisis.

That has put further strain on Europe's Schengen zone of passport-free travel, now on the verge of collapse, deepened rifts between states over the crisis that has already fuelled support for far-right parties across the bloc.

Under Monday's tentative deal, Turkey would take back all migrants crossing to Europe who are ineligible for asylum as well as everyone - including those fleeing wars and hence eligible for international protection - fished out from the sea before reaching EU shores.

But the forcible mass repatriation of migrants to Turkey would be difficult to implement, not least because many will have risked their lives and spent large sums of money to get to Europe in the first place.

However, EU officials said just a few returns should be sufficient to convince the migrants they stood no chance of being allowed to stay and to agree to be sent back to Turkey.

""People will not stop coming by themselves, so we have to show that it doesn't pay to use a trafficker and come to Europe in an illegal way,"" said Klaas Dijkhoff, migration minister of the Netherlands, current holder of the EU's rotating presidency.

The interior ministers meeting in Brussels will also discuss plans for a common EU border and coast guard that the bloc hopes to deploy for the first time in late summer to improve protection of its external borders.

To ease the burden on Greece, where tens of thousands of migrants are now stranded in increasingly dire humanitarian conditions, the EU is stepping up relocations, with more than 900 people moved so far. However, that still falls far short of the 160,000 migrants EU states committed to move internally.

The EU ministers also expressed concern on Thursday that, with borders all but shut across the Western Balkans, migration routes would split into smaller streams of people seeking other routes of entry into the EU.

Italy could come under increased pressure if people stuck in Greece try to get out via Albania and the Adriatic Sea.

""We are working to prevent that,"" Italy's Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said, without giving details.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 09:29:59+00:00,Proud Latvia regrets ban on meldonium drug its scientists invented,['Gederts Gelzis'],"RIGA Latvia expressed sadness on Wednesday over the banning of the drug that has cast a pall over the career of tennis star Maria Sharapova, describing it as ""one of the most significant accomplishments"" of the tiny nation's scientists.

The five-time grand slam champion has revealed she tested positive in January for the drug meldonium, which its Latvian inventor once said had been used to toughen up Soviet troops fighting at high altitudes three decades ago.

Latvia, a Baltic nation of under 2 million people that won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, is relatively unknown to outsiders apart from visitors who use the capital Riga as a destination for partying.

So meldonium, which is marketed as Mildronate by the Latvian pharmaceutical firm Grindeks, is a source of some national pride.

""It's sad that there is such a situation, that this drug has been banned,"" said Andrejs Vaivars, a spokesman for Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis. ""Especially given that is one of the most significant accomplishments of Latvian scientists in general.""

Meldonium, which is available cheaply over the counter without a prescription in the Baltic states and Sharapova's native Russia, is normally used to treat heart conditions such as angina.

But the drug, which boosts blood flow and may enhance athletic performance, was banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) as of Jan. 1. Sharapova said she had missed an email informing her about the ban.

Scientist Ivars Kalvins invented the drug in mid-1970s when Latvia was still a Soviet republic. Kalvins told the local newspaper Diena in 2009 that it had been used to boost troops' fighting stamina in the 1980s. At that time Soviet forces were battling insurgents in Afghanistan.

""There are high mountain conditions, lack of oxygen,"" Kalvins said. ""They were all given Mildronate. They didn't know what they were using themselves. Nobody asked them anything back there.""

Kirovs Lipmans, chairman of Grindeks and its biggest shareholder, said use of the drug did not constitute doping and he criticised the government for not defending its reputation against WADA.

""The government is not fighting against it, it is not doing anything, they are absolutely not interested in this. How can they act like that?"" said Lipmans, who also heads the Latvian Ice Hockey Federation and is a member of the country' Olympic Committee. Government officials said WADA was acting independently and they could not influence its decisions. Grindeks is seeking to register Mildronate in China, and Lipmans said he would like to see it also registered in the future in western Europe. The company has said it was looking to diversify its sales as its revenues in Russia were hit by the fall in rouble.

Krispy Kreme UK owner Alcuin Capital Partners did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and Krispy Kreme UK declined to comment.

The UK IPO market has been subdued so far this year amid worries about a global economic slowdown and uncertainty about Britain's future in the European Union.

As of the end of February, eight companies had listed in London, raising 385 million pounds ($545 million). That compared with 468 million pounds raised by 11 companies in the same period last year, according to the London Stock Exchange.

Alcuin bought Krispy Kreme UK from an investment group led by three American entrepreneurs in 2011. The Telegraph reported then that the deal was worth 25 million pounds.

Krispy Kreme UK, the largest maker of premium branded doughnuts in the country, has a franchise agreement with U.S.-based Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc (KKD.N).

News of the share sale follows chocolate maker and retailer Hotel Chocolat's announcement on Wednesday that it planned to raise 50 million pounds through a listing on London's junior AIM market.

The Krispy Kreme brand started in the United States in 1937. The UK business opened for business in 2003 at Harrods department store in London.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 15:27:29+00:00,"In Houston, oil workers may face the ax but employment still grows",['Howard Schneider'],"BAYTOWN, Texas Plunging energy prices robbed the Texas economy of an estimated 60,000 jobs last year, as oil and gas companies put the brakes on production and slashed investment, throwing engineers and geologists out of work.

But the forest of construction cranes sprouting around this petrochemical hub tell the flip side of the story, as some of the same forces that drove down those prices sparked tens of billions of dollars in investment in new processing plants to take advantage of cheap and plentiful supplies of oil and gas.

Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Phillips Chemical Co, a joint venture of Chevron Corp and Phillips 66, are building mammoth chemical crackers to process polyethylene from natural gas, and logistics firms have created millions of new square feet of warehouse space as they plan to ship the output to the global plastics industry.

Rising chemicals output has contributed to record traffic at the Houston Port Authority, and officials say the trend is expected to continue. Throughout the Baytown area, which is on the outskirts of Houston, an estimated $8 billion worth of projects is expected to be finished this year and another $22 billion completed in 2017.

This has all propped up employment in Texas at an otherwise difficult time. The positive impact on the overall U.S. economy from the chemicals industry that this illustrates is also one of the reasons the U.S. should avoid a downturn despite troubles elsewhere in the world. That in turn should create the conditions for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again this year.

""They are shedding jobs upstream. That's the nature of the business,"" said B.J. Simon, associate executive director of the Baytown-West Chambers County Economic Development Foundation. But ""the opportunity to build these crackers just could not be passed up...access to cheap feedstocks changed the whole equation downstream.""

Construction workers have jobs, new schools are being built to handle a growing local population, a new Kroger Marketplace store is being completed, and a partially vacant shopping mall is being overhauled.

JOBS: THE FED'S NORTH STAR

The global economy may be sputtering, with weak demand one of the reasons that oil prices have cratered. But the U.S. keeps adding jobs, and at a rate consistent with the outlook from Fed policymakers who expect growing U.S. payrolls will mean enough domestic spending to keep the economy expanding overall.

Texas ""lost a lot of energy jobs,"" said Dallas Fed research head Mine Yucel, but the state ""has been very resilient. I was surprised.""

Across the oil patch, there's a similar pattern of positive trends offsetting bad news. Though low prices have crippled investment in exploration and cut drilling rigs, overall employment in Oklahoma continues to rise in a state that has built large logistics and defense contracting industries.

In North Dakota, ground zero for the fracking boom, overall employment has dropped, but the unemployment rate remains a super-low 2.7 percent compared to the national average of 4.9 percent. The number is held down by an expected adjustment: just as workers flocked to the state when vacancies were plentiful, the labor force has declined as the jobs disappeared and workers returned home.

These states represent a drop in the bucket compared to Texas's $1.6 trillion, 12.5 million-job economy, a size approaching that of Canada. Despite the oil downturn, the unemployment rate is only 4.7 percent as non-energy companies like fiber-optic manufacturer Applied Optoelectronics expand in the state.

In a rough year for the oil business, the state as a whole added 144,000 jobs in 2015, according to the Texas Workforce Commission, with strong gains across the trade and hospitality sectors, as well as professional services, health and education.

ROCKY START

The Fed meets next week to take stock of the U.S. economy after a rocky beginning to the year.

A rate hike is not expected at the March meeting but the central banks post-meeting statement and fresh economic projections from policymakers will provide important insight into how worried the Fed is about the combined impact of cheap oil and weak global demand on prospects for U.S. jobs, growth and investment.

In an organization that prizes consensus under Chair Janet Yellen, clear cracks have emerged: between Vice Chair Stanley Fischer's recent statement that inflation is ""stirring,"" for example, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard's continued caution about how the rest of the world may inhibit the U.S.

The Fed raised rates in December for the first time in a decade and projections by its policymakers at the time showed they expected four hikes this year. However, many investors and analysts now feel the Fed may be stuck where it is for much of the rest of the year.

The jobs growth figures provide a counterweight to that view. The labor recovery has been going on for seven years now, and whenever hiring has slowed in one sector of the economy another has picked up the slack.

The early strength in commodity-based jobs that spread across the fracking fields of North Dakota and Oklahoma gave way over the past two years to a surge in construction, education and health-related positions. Even in government, where belt-tightening by local, state and federal agencies trimmed payrolls coming out of the recession, employment is growing again.

U.S. non-farm jobs growth has held at an average of 190,000 per month during the recovery. That's faster than anticipated and strong enough to both accommodate new entrants to the labor force and bring sidelined workers back into jobs.

There have been concerns that many of the jobs being created were at the low end of the wage spectrum, in restaurants, hotels and retail stores. But more recent analysis of occupation and wage trends by Goldman Sachs showed that over the past two years in particular job gains have been strongest in higher-paying positions.

For a graph showing the composition of U.S. jobs growth in the past few years, see tmsnrt.rs/1pvEZyo

In its most recent Beige Book release of anecdotal economic information, Fed officials noted that former oilfield workers were shifting into jobs as auto mechanics, while construction and petrochemical companies had shortages in fields considered complementary to the skills of frontline oil and gas workers.

""It's easier to place a welder right now than someone with a four-year degree,"" said Jim Hanna, a vice president for human resources and industrial relations with Fluor, the engineering and construction giant working on the Chevron Phillips Chemical project in Baytown.

Fluor's workforce at that site is already up to 3,000, with 600 more to be hired over the summer.

FEWER BMWS

In the Houston metropolitan area, which compared to the rest of Texas has traditionally been most dependent on the energy sector, the oil crash did not prevent a net gain of 23,000 jobs last year. That was well short of the above-average 100,000 positions that the city had been adding in recent years as oil production surged, said Patrick Jankowski, vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership. But it is also more in line with the city's long-run average and likely more sustainable.

While there may be some impact on wages from the loss of higher paying positions for geologists and engineers, said Jankowski, some of the skilled construction trade and health jobs that will replace them also pay above average.

Fluor's Hanna said it was typical for construction workers to put in 50-hour weeks or more, with annual wages running upwards of $100,000.

""I would not describe Houston's economy as strong, but I would never use the word recession,"" Jankowski said. ""We will have a year or two of slower growth, rather than a boom...We will be selling fewer BMWs.""

reuters.com,2016-03-10 15:20:31+00:00,How a hacker's typo helped stop a billion dollar bank heist,['Serajul Quadir'],"Commuters pass by the front of the Bangladesh central bank building in Dhaka March 8, 2016.

DHAKA A spelling mistake in an online bank transfer instruction helped prevent a nearly $1 billion heist last month involving the Bangladesh central bank and the New York Fed, banking officials said.

Unknown hackers still managed to get away with about $80 million, one of the largest known bank thefts in history.

The hackers breached Bangladesh Bank's systems and stole its credentials for payment transfers, two senior officials at the bank said. They then bombarded the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with nearly three dozen requests to move money from the Bangladesh Bank's account there to entities in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, the officials said.

Four requests to transfer a total of about $81 million to the Philippines went through, but a fifth, for $20 million, to a Sri Lankan non-profit organisation was held up because the hackers misspelled the name of the NGO, Shalika Foundation.

Hackers misspelled ""foundation"" in the NGO's name as ""fandation"", prompting a routing bank, Deutsche Bank, to seek clarification from the Bangladesh central bank, which stopped the transaction, one of the officials said.

There is no NGO under the name of Shalika Foundation in the list of registered Sri Lankan non-profits. Reuters could not immediately find contact information for the organization.

Deutsche Bank declined to comment.

At the same time, the unusually high number of payment instructions and the transfer requests to private entities - as opposed to other banks - raised suspicions at the Fed, which also alerted the Bangladeshis, the officials said.

The details of how the hacking came to light and was stopped before it did more damage have not been previously reported. Bangladesh Bank has billions of dollars in a current account with the Fed, which it uses for international settlements.

The transactions that were stopped totalled $850-$870 million, one of the officials said.

Last year, Russian computer security company Kaspersky Lab said a multinational gang of cyber criminals had stolen as much as $1 billion from as many as 100 financial institutions around the world in about two years.

Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's son Qusay took $1 billion from Iraq's central bank on the orders of his father on the day before coalition forces began bombing the country in 2003, American and Iraqi officials have said. In 2007, guards at the Dar Es Salaam bank in Baghdad made off with $282 million.

MONEY RECOVERED

Bangladesh Bank has said it has recovered some of the money that was stolen, and is working with anti-money laundering authorities in the Philippines to try to recover the rest.

A bank spokesman could not be reached for comment late on Thursday.

The recovered funds refer to the Sri Lanka transfer, which was stopped, one of the officials said.

Initially, the Sri Lankan transaction reached Pan Asia Banking Corp, which went back to Deutsche Bank for more verification because of the unusually large size of the payment, a Pan Asia official said. ""The transaction was too large for a country like us,"" the official said. ""Then (Deutsche) came back and said it was a suspect transaction."" A Pan Asia spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.

The dizzying, global reach of the heist underscores the growing threat of cyber crime and how hackers can find weak links in even the most secure computer networks.

More than a month after the attack, Bangladeshi officials are scrambling to trace the money, shore up security and identify weaknesses in their systems. They said there is little hope of ever catching the hackers, and it could take months before the money is recovered, if at all.

Security experts said the perpetrators had deep knowledge of the Bangladeshi institution's internal workings, likely gained by spying on bank workers.

The Bangladesh government, meanwhile, is blaming the Fed for not stopping the transactions earlier. Finance Minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith told reporters on Tuesday that the country may resort to suing the Fed to recover the money.

""The Fed must take responsibility,"" he said.

The New York Fed has said its systems were not breached, and it has been working with the Bangladesh central bank since the incident occurred.

The hacking of Bangladesh Bank happened sometime between Feb. 4-5, over the Bangladeshi weekend, which falls on a Friday, the officials said. The bank's offices were shut.

Initially, the central bank was not sure if its system had been breached, but cyber security experts brought in to investigate found hacker ""footprints"" that suggested the system had been compromised, the officials said.

These experts could also tell that the attack originated from outside Bangladesh, they said, adding the bank is looking into how they got into the system and an internal investigation is ongoing.

The bank suspects money sent to the Philippines was further diverted to casinos there, the officials said.

The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp, which oversees the gaming industry, said it has launched an investigation. The country's anti-money laundering authority is also working on the case.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 14:53:30+00:00,How much is that halo? Pope imposes checks on costs of making saints,['Philip Pullella'],"VATICAN CITY Pope Francis on Thursday made key changes to the complex and often opaque financial procedures involved in the making of Roman Catholic saints.

A decree calls for new controls on the costs of making saints, which can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars in the gathering of evidence and lawyers' fees. The process can take decades.

Accusations have sometimes been made of mismanagement and corruption and that the system favors candidates for sainthood from wealthy countries.

In his 2015 book ""Merchants in the Temple,"" Italian author Gianluigi Nuzzi wrote that a commission looking into Vatican finances found that the church's saint-making office had little or no documentation of funds used by postulators, the chief promoters of candidatures.

Nuzzi, who is now on trial in the Vatican for publishing leaked documents, wrote that about a million euros ($1.1 million) in suspect funds held by a postulator in the Vatican bank was frozen in 2014.

The new decree stipulates that contributions from the faithful and groups must go into an account and be managed by an administrator. The administrator must ""scrupulously respect the intentions"" of contributors, keep detailed documentation, and present budgets to a superior.

In his book, Nuzzi wrote that a single sainthood could cost 750,000 euros. The new norms provide for the creation of a ""solidarity fund"" to help candidates from poor areas.

The 21-article decree demands more financial vigilance at each stage of the process, which usually starts in a local diocese after a preliminary investigation.

The church posthumously confers sainthood on people who are believed to have been sufficiently holy during their lives that they are now in heaven and can intercede with God to perform miracles.

If the Vatican agrees that someone is a possible candidate, years of investigation begin. If a miracle, usually an inexplicable healing of a sick person, is attributed to the candidate, he or she is beatified. The final step, canonization, requires a second miracle.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 15:20:31+00:00,How a hacker's typo helped stop a billion dollar bank heist,['Serajul Quadir'],"Commuters pass by the front of the Bangladesh central bank building in Dhaka March 8, 2016.

DHAKA A spelling mistake in an online bank transfer instruction helped prevent a nearly $1 billion heist last month involving the Bangladesh central bank and the New York Fed, banking officials said.

Unknown hackers still managed to get away with about $80 million, one of the largest known bank thefts in history.

The hackers breached Bangladesh Bank's systems and stole its credentials for payment transfers, two senior officials at the bank said. They then bombarded the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with nearly three dozen requests to move money from the Bangladesh Bank's account there to entities in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, the officials said.

Four requests to transfer a total of about $81 million to the Philippines went through, but a fifth, for $20 million, to a Sri Lankan non-profit organisation was held up because the hackers misspelled the name of the NGO, Shalika Foundation.

Hackers misspelled ""foundation"" in the NGO's name as ""fandation"", prompting a routing bank, Deutsche Bank, to seek clarification from the Bangladesh central bank, which stopped the transaction, one of the officials said.

There is no NGO under the name of Shalika Foundation in the list of registered Sri Lankan non-profits. Reuters could not immediately find contact information for the organization.

Deutsche Bank declined to comment.

At the same time, the unusually high number of payment instructions and the transfer requests to private entities - as opposed to other banks - raised suspicions at the Fed, which also alerted the Bangladeshis, the officials said.

The details of how the hacking came to light and was stopped before it did more damage have not been previously reported. Bangladesh Bank has billions of dollars in a current account with the Fed, which it uses for international settlements.

The transactions that were stopped totalled $850-$870 million, one of the officials said.

Last year, Russian computer security company Kaspersky Lab said a multinational gang of cyber criminals had stolen as much as $1 billion from as many as 100 financial institutions around the world in about two years.

Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's son Qusay took $1 billion from Iraq's central bank on the orders of his father on the day before coalition forces began bombing the country in 2003, American and Iraqi officials have said. In 2007, guards at the Dar Es Salaam bank in Baghdad made off with $282 million.

MONEY RECOVERED

Bangladesh Bank has said it has recovered some of the money that was stolen, and is working with anti-money laundering authorities in the Philippines to try to recover the rest.

A bank spokesman could not be reached for comment late on Thursday.

The recovered funds refer to the Sri Lanka transfer, which was stopped, one of the officials said.

Initially, the Sri Lankan transaction reached Pan Asia Banking Corp, which went back to Deutsche Bank for more verification because of the unusually large size of the payment, a Pan Asia official said. ""The transaction was too large for a country like us,"" the official said. ""Then (Deutsche) came back and said it was a suspect transaction."" A Pan Asia spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.

The dizzying, global reach of the heist underscores the growing threat of cyber crime and how hackers can find weak links in even the most secure computer networks.

More than a month after the attack, Bangladeshi officials are scrambling to trace the money, shore up security and identify weaknesses in their systems. They said there is little hope of ever catching the hackers, and it could take months before the money is recovered, if at all.

Security experts said the perpetrators had deep knowledge of the Bangladeshi institution's internal workings, likely gained by spying on bank workers.

The Bangladesh government, meanwhile, is blaming the Fed for not stopping the transactions earlier. Finance Minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith told reporters on Tuesday that the country may resort to suing the Fed to recover the money.

""The Fed must take responsibility,"" he said.

The New York Fed has said its systems were not breached, and it has been working with the Bangladesh central bank since the incident occurred.

The hacking of Bangladesh Bank happened sometime between Feb. 4-5, over the Bangladeshi weekend, which falls on a Friday, the officials said. The bank's offices were shut.

Initially, the central bank was not sure if its system had been breached, but cyber security experts brought in to investigate found hacker ""footprints"" that suggested the system had been compromised, the officials said.

These experts could also tell that the attack originated from outside Bangladesh, they said, adding the bank is looking into how they got into the system and an internal investigation is ongoing.

The bank suspects money sent to the Philippines was further diverted to casinos there, the officials said.

The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp, which oversees the gaming industry, said it has launched an investigation. The country's anti-money laundering authority is also working on the case.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 15:07:40+00:00,China blasts U.S. 'rape and murder' at U.N. Human Rights Council,"['Stephanie Nebehay', 'Tom Miles']","GENEVA China strongly rejected U.S.-led criticism of its human rights record at the U.N. Human Rights Council on Thursday, saying the United States was hypocritical and guilty of crimes including the rape and murder of civilians.

""The U.S. is notorious for prison abuse at Guantanamo prison, its gun violence is rampant, racism is its deep-rooted malaise,"" Chinese diplomat Fu Cong told the Council, using unusually blunt language.

""The United States conducts large-scale extra-territorial eavesdropping, uses drones to attack other countries' innocent civilians, its troops on foreign soil commit rape and murder of local people. It conducts kidnapping overseas and uses black prisons.""

Fu was responding to a joint statement by the United States and 11 other countries, who criticised China's crackdown on human rights and its detentions of lawyers and activists.

""These actions are in contravention of China's own laws and international commitments,"" said U.S. Ambassador Keith Harper, who read out the statement backed by Australia, Japan and nine northern European countries.

""These extra-territorial actions are unacceptable, out of step with the expectations of the international community, and a challenge to the rule-based international order.""

Harper read the statement straight after U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein gave his main annual speech to the council. He recalled his message to China in mid-February, when he cited a ""very worrying pattern"" of detentions.

Fu said Zeid should ""refrain from making subjective comments not backed up by real facts"".

He also criticised Japan's support for the joint statement, saying Japan had refused to take responsibility for conscripting 100,000 ""comfort women"" in Asian countries during World War Two.

In China's crackdown, police have detained about 250 human rights lawyers, legal assistants, and activists since a nationwide crackdown began last July, although many have subsequently been released.

Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, said the message delivered by Harper was the first collective joint statement on China in the 10 history of the council.

""The statement shows that while President Xi may think he can eradicate dissent at home, the world stands with embattled human rights defenders across China,"" she said in a statement.

FRANKFURT The European Central Bank cut interest rates and increased its asset-buying programme in order to stop exceptionally lower inflation from leaking into the overall economy, ECB President Mario Draghi said on Thursday.

""It is crucial to avoid second-round effects,"" he told a news conference, referring to price falls extending beyond headline products such as oil.

The ECB said it now expected 2016 euro zone inflation to be 0.1 percent, well down from its previous forecast of 1.0 percent.

Draghi also said the bank intended to keep interest rates low or even lower for an extended period of time.

Earlier, the ECB surprised financial markets by dropping its main refinancing rate to zero from 0.05 percent.

It also expanded its quantitative easing asset-buying programme to 80 billion euros a month from 60 billion euros and cut its deposit rate to -0.4 percent from -0.3 percent, charging banks more to keep their money with the ECB.

North Sea crude currently trades at just over $40 per barrel, a rise of almost 50 percent from a 12-year-low seen in January but still far below a mid-2014 peak of around $115.

An Iraqi oil official told state newspaper Al-Sabah on Wednesday that the world's biggest oil exporters both in and outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plan to meet in Moscow on March 20 to discuss an output freeze.

The report was later denied by Russia's energy ministry, which said no date or place had been set for a possible meeting.

""If they can agree on a production freeze I think we have seen a bottom. If they fail, I think the oil price will drop $10 per barrel again,"" DNB Markets analyst Torbjoern Kjus told an energy conference in Oslo.

OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Venezuela, along with non-OPEC exporter Russia, pledged earlier this year to leave supply at January's levels if others cooperated.

DNB Markets predicted last week that the price of North Sea Brent crude would reach $45 in three months and $55 in six months.

U.S.-based Uber plans to expand in Tanzania, Uganda and Ghana this year and will focus on convincing...

NAIROBI U.S.-based Uber plans to expand in Tanzania, Uganda and Ghana this year and will focus on convincing traditional taxi drivers to work for the ride-hailing service, Alon Lits, Uber's general manager for sub-Saharan Africa, said.

Traffic-clogged roads, high rates of urban crime and a lack of credit card are big challenges Uber faces in sub-Saharan Africa, where it operates in seven cities in South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya.

But its biggest problem is the one it faces from Rome to Rio; the friction with traditional taxi drivers who see Uber as a threat to their livelihoods.

In the Kenyan capital Nairobi, Uber's fastest growing market in sub-Saharan Africa, an Uber driver was attacked and his car torched last month after the government rejected calls by Kenya's taxi association to ban the company.

""Part of our strategy when we launch in new markets will be that engagement up front with taxi operators,"" Lits told Reuters in an interview in Nairobi. ""We will be doing a better job of engaging.""

That strategy will involve convincing traditional taxi drivers to work for Uber, showing them they can continue working on their own, but when they don't have a fare they can also choose to use the Uber smartphone app to pick up passengers and make extra money.

Lits said Uber, which operates in more than 400 cities worldwide, will set up East and West Africa ""hubs"" in Nairobi and Lagos to act as launchpads for forays into Tanzania, Uganda and Ghana, and would begin operating in a second city each in Nigeria and Kenya.

""We feel we are at a point now where we have a strong sense for what it takes to build a successful Uber business in Africa,"" Lits said.

In Europe and North America, Uber accounts are tied to a customer's credit card, eliminating the need for cash. But in sub-Saharan Africa, where only about a third of people own a bank account, low credit cards usage has presented another obstacle to Uber's growth.

Lits said Uber's experiment in Kenya to let riders pay fares with cash or via mobile money had boosted growth in Nairobi, where about 100,000 people open the Uber app once a month.

""It's definitely going to be part of our strategy as we push across Africa,"" he said.

Lits said Uber's overtures to prospective full-time Uber drivers in sub-Saharan Africa - where the company launched in 2013 - will be mainly financial. As with traditional taxis, most Uber drivers rent their vehicles, which eats into their income.

In Kenya and Nigeria, the company is looking to make it cheaper for Uber drivers to rent vehicles.

The stream of migrants risking perilous sea crossings has so far shown little sign of abating after Turkey reached the draft deal with the EU on Monday, under which it will try to stem the flow in return for funding and political rewards.

Turkey's EU Minister Volkan Bozkir said the deal, under which Ankara agreed to take back all irregular migrants, does not apply to those who have already reached the Greek islands and that the number returned was ultimately expected to be in the thousands or tens of thousands.

The top U.N. rights official voiced concern the tentative deal may lead to ""collective and arbitrary expulsions"" illegal under international law, and urged the EU to adopt a more humane set of measures at a summit on March 17.

One of the victims from Wednesday night's capsize, in which their boat hit rough weather as it traveled toward the Greek island of Lesbos, managed to swim ashore but died during attempts to revive him, a coastguard official told Reuters.

Of the four bodies found at sea, one was that of a six-month-old baby, rescuers said. Nine other people were pulled from the water alive.

""The rescue operation for the two others is continuing,"" the coastguard official said. Initial reports suggested Iranians were also among the group, but the coastguard later confirmed this was not the case.

The European Union has offered Turkey billions of euros in aid to curb illegal migration. Under the draft deal struck on Monday, Turkey also received promises of faster visa liberalization for Turks traveling to Europe, and a speeding up of Ankara's long-stalled EU membership talks.

The aim is to discourage illegal migrants and break the grip of human smugglers who have sent them on treacherous journeys across the Aegean. But migrants have continued to try to cross from Turkey's coast in recent days.

""Forming the mindset that 'You cant go there anymore, theres no hope there' is the basis of preventing (illegal migration),"" Bozkir told the state-run Anadolu agency.

He also said Turkey would meet by May 1 the EU's conditions for visa-free travel to Europe, seen by many Turks as the main benefit of the deal. EU leaders set requirements including changing Turkey's visa policy toward Islamic states and introducing harder-to-fake biometric passports.

Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said Turkey was already making progress fighting people smuggling networks, telling broadcaster NTV that 2,000 people had been arrested. He did not give a timeframe.

""Turkey is conducting a very effective fight. As you know, we will make illegal migration a terrorism crime. Every day and everywhere our security forces are apprehending organizers of illegal migration,"" he told NTV.

More than 130,000 people this year have reached Europe from Turkey, which borders Iran and conflict zones in Syria and Iraq, while 350 people have died on the perilous journey, according to the International Organisation for Migration.

More than 35,000 people are trapped at the Greek-Macedonian border at Idomeni as Europe tries to close the Balkan route to foreigners fleeing violence and economic upheaval.

SAN FRANCISCO Yahoo Inc has entered into a partnership to stream live National Hockey League broadcasts, part of its push to use sports to draw in millennial viewers and the advertisers who want to reach them.

Starting with Friday's match between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Tampa Bay Lightning, Yahoo will provide access to live games that are outside a viewer's home market, game highlights and additional content for free on the Yahoo Sports homepage and on Tumblr.

Yahoo will stream four NHL games per week. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Yahoo also has a separate deal with NBC Sports to stream two additional games per week.

Adam Cahan, Yahoo's senior vice president of mobile and emerging products, said the deal helps advertisers reach millennials, an elusive demographic, as they are unlikely to see games on TV due to shifting viewing habits.

The effort is also an attempt to build off of Yahoo's first-ever global live stream in October of an NFL match played in London. Yahoo guaranteed advertisers 3.5 million viewers for that event and delivered around 15.2 million.

Since then, the NFL has opened up discussions with Yahoo and several other Internet companies to live stream all three games broadcast in London during the 2016 season.

Yahoo has used momentum from that broadcast to secure streaming deals with Major League Baseball, the Professional Golf Association and competitive video gaming organizations.

With the company in the process of spinning off its core business - which includes its Web sites and email service - and a possible sale of that business afterward, Cahan said the new advertising streams could be helpful to that effort.

""We're excited we can bring those kinds of unique experiences to users and can bring it at the scale Yahoo can deliver,"" he said.

Neil Doshi, a managing director at Mizuho Securities, said the deal could improve Yahoo's sale prospects with private equity firms or organizations without sports broadcast packages, but it doesn't guarantee a huge bump in its valuation.

""If they got FIFA, NBA or NFL, I think those would have a little broader appeal than just hockey,"" he said.

Berlin Die deutschen Exporteure haben wegen der sinkenden Nachfrage aus groen Landern wie China einen Fehlstart ins Jahr 2016 erwischt.

Die Ausfuhren fielen im Januar mit knapp 89 Milliarden Euro um 1,4 Prozent niedriger aus als ein Jahr zuvor. ""Einen starkeren Ruckgang gab es zuletzt vor rund anderthalb Jahren"", erklarte das Statistische Bundesamt am Donnerstag. Verglichen mit dem Vormonat gab es einen Ruckgang von 0,5 Prozent. Okonomen hatten hingegen mit einem Anstieg gerechnet.

""Das ist ein schwacher Jahresauftakt"", sagte der Auenwirtschaftschef des Deutschen Industrie- und Handelskammertages (DIHK), Volker Treier. ""Uns trifft die Wachstumsschwache Chinas."" Auch in anderen wichtigen Schwellenlandern wie Russland und Brasilien sehe es nach wie vor nicht gut aus. ""Auf der Weltkonjunktur liegt derzeit Mehltau."" China - nach den USA die zweitgrote Volkswirtschaft der Welt - durfte in diesem Jahr so langsam wachsen wie seit einem Vierteljahrhundert nicht mehr.

""SCHUB DURCH EURO-ABWERTUNG IST ABGEKLUNGEN""

Die Lieferungen in die Lander auerhalb der Europaischen Union schrumpften um insgesamt 5,0 Prozent im Vergleich zum Januar 2015. Da hilft auch der vergleichsweise schwache Euro nicht, der deutsche Waren in anderen Wahrungsraumen billiger macht. ""Die Schubkraft der Euro-Abwertung ist abgeklungen"", erklarte DekaBank-Okonom Andreas Scheuerle. ""In diesem Jahr dominiert die Entwicklung der globalen Nachfrage, und die ist derzeit angesichts der Probleme in den Schwellenlandern schwach."" Die Ausfuhren in die Euro-Zone nahmen dagegen nur um 0,1 Prozent ab. Die Exporte in die EU-Lander auerhalb des Wahrungsraums - wozu etwa Grobritannien und Polen gehoren - wuchsen hingehen um 2,9 Prozent.

Der Exportverband BGA erwartet 2016 trotz der mauen Weltwirtschaft ein Exportplus von 4,5 Prozent. 2015 hatten die Unternehmen erneut einen Rekord geschafft: Sie lieferten Waren im Wert von rund 1,2 Billionen Euro ins Ausland und damit 6,4 Prozent mehr als im Jahr davor.

Besser als die Exporte entwickeln sich derzeit die deutschen Importe. Sie wuchsen im Januar um 1,2 Prozent zum Vormonat und damit drei Mal so stark wie erwartet.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 14:07:00+00:00,U.S. jobless claims hit five-month low as labor market strengthens,['Lucia Mutikani'],"WASHINGTON The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, hitting its lowest level since October, pointing to sustained strength in the labor market that should further dispel fears of a recession. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 259,000 for the week ended March 5, the lowest reading since mid-October, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The prior week's claims were revised to show 1,000 fewer applications received than previously reported.

Claims are being watched for any sign of labor market weakness following a recent massive stock market sell-off that caused financial market conditions to tighten amid fears the economy was heading into recession.

So far, the labor market remains on strong footing, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 242,000 jobs in February and the unemployment rate holding at an eight-year low of 4.9 percent.

The recession fears have also been soothed by strong consumer spending at the start of the year, as well as signs of some stabilization in the troubled manufacturing sector.

A tightening labor market and firming inflation could see the Federal Reserve gradually raising interest rates this year. The U.S. central bank hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.

The dollar rose against the euro following the European Central Bank's decision to lower key interest rates and expand its bond purchase program in an effort stimulate growth in the euro zone. U.S. Treasury debt prices were mixed, while U.S. stock index futures rallied.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims slipping to275,000 in the latest week. A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing last week's claims data and no states had been estimated.

Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with healthy labor market conditions, for a year - the longest run since the early 1970s. Last week's drop saw claims breaking outside their recent 262,000-294,000 range.

The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,500 to 267,500 last week, the lowest level since late October.

The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 32,000 to 2.23 million in the week ended Feb. 27. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims fell 4,500 to 2.25 million.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Idomeni camp is 'big violation of human rights': Ai Weiwei,['Thomson Reuters'],"ROUGH CUT - SUBTITLED (NO REPORTER NARRATION) China's renowned artist and activist Ai Weiwei visited the Greek border camp of Idomeni with his film crew on Wednesday (March 9). Some 14,000 people are stranded there after new border restrictions were imposed along the Balkan migration route. Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia said on Tuesday (March 8) they would place new restrictions on the entry of migrants and Macedonia responded on Wednesday by closing its border completely to illegal migrants, a police official said. Ai walked around the makeshift camp speaking with the migrants - seeing for himself the difficult conditions they have to brave as they wait to cross over to Macedonia and continue their trek northwards to wealthier European states. Ai, known for his criticism of China's human rights record, said he was witnessing a ""huge, big violation of human rights"" in the middle of Europe. ""What we have seen here is almost unbelievable, you know. If you say this is in the middle of Europe, all the people stuck here, and there's no hope for them even to be transferred to anywhere else, you know. It's just in the rain, in the cold, and women, children, all the people waiting for some bread, or some dry clothes, and this is a very sad situation and people have no hope because the door is closed, totally shut off. I think this is a huge, big violation of human rights, right in front of us. I don't know what is going to come out from this, but in Lesbos people still come in thousands every day, and here nobody tells them what to do, and they stay here, still having hope to go to Germany or some other location, but I think, as the sky is getting darker and I don't think there's much hope for them,"" he said. People fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and beyond have flooded into the EU since early 2015, most making the perilous sea crossing from Turkey to Greece, then heading north through the Balkans to Germany. But a cascade of border shutdowns in the Balkans has caused the blocking of the so-called 'Balkans corridor' used by more than a million people since the migratory wave started a year ago. More than 34,0000 people are now trapped on Greece's islands and mainland. At an emergency EU-Turkey summit on Monday (March 7), aimed to stem the migrant influx to Europe, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told leaders of the bloc Ankara was willing to take back all migrants who enter Europe from Turkey in future in return for financial aid, faster EU entry talks and quicker visa-free travel for its citizens.

BRUSSELS European Union interior ministers expressed reservations on Thursday over easing visa requirements for Turkey, a key element of a tentative deal with Ankara that Brussels and Germany hope will halt the mass influx of refugees and migrants to Europe.

EU and Turkish leaders agreed in principle on Monday that Ankara would prevent people from leaving its shores for Europe in exchange for more help for refugees living in Turkey, visa liberalisation for Turks visiting Europe and accelerating Turkey's long-dormant EU accession talks.

The 28 EU leaders have given themselves until the next summit due on March 17-18 to hone the details of an agreement that has stirred resistance in some countries, not least due to concerns over Turkey's record on human rights and press freedom.

Last Friday Turkish authorities seized control of the country's largest newspaper, Zaman, in a widening crackdown on supporters of a U.S.-based Muslim cleric opposed to President Tayyip Erdogan.

EU officials also say Turkey, a country of 75 million, only meets about half of more than 70 technical requirements for visa-free travel with Europe.

""It is highly questionable that Turkey, which puts a newspaper critical of the government under its own control, presents a wish-list three days later and is rewarded by discussions about earlier visa liberalisation,"" said Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.

""I ask myself if the EU is throwing its values overboard,"" Mikl-Leitner said as she arrived for Thursday's ministerial talks, adding that she would push for a termination clause to be inserted into any final agreement.

SCHENGEN ZONE UNDER THREAT

Austria and other countries along the main migration route linking Greece to Germany via the Western Balkans, have resorted to unilateral tightening of border controls as the bloc struggles to forge a joint response to the migrant crisis.

That has put further strain on Europe's Schengen zone of passport-free travel, now on the verge of collapse, deepened rifts between states over the crisis that has already fuelled support for far-right parties across the bloc.

Under Monday's tentative deal, Turkey would take back all migrants crossing to Europe who are ineligible for asylum as well as everyone - including those fleeing wars and hence eligible for international protection - fished out from the sea before reaching EU shores.

But the forcible mass repatriation of migrants to Turkey would be difficult to implement, not least because many will have risked their lives and spent large sums of money to get to Europe in the first place.

However, EU officials said just a few returns should be sufficient to convince the migrants they stood no chance of being allowed to stay and to agree to be sent back to Turkey.

""People will not stop coming by themselves, so we have to show that it doesn't pay to use a trafficker and come to Europe in an illegal way,"" said Klaas Dijkhoff, migration minister of the Netherlands, current holder of the EU's rotating presidency.

The interior ministers meeting in Brussels will also discuss plans for a common EU border and coast guard that the bloc hopes to deploy for the first time in late summer to improve protection of its external borders.

To ease the burden on Greece, where tens of thousands of migrants are now stranded in increasingly dire humanitarian conditions, the EU is stepping up relocations, with more than 900 people moved so far. However, that still falls far short of the 160,000 migrants EU states committed to move internally.

The EU ministers also expressed concern on Thursday that, with borders all but shut across the Western Balkans, migration routes would split into smaller streams of people seeking other routes of entry into the EU.

Italy could come under increased pressure if people stuck in Greece try to get out via Albania and the Adriatic Sea.

""We are working to prevent that,"" Italy's Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said, without giving details.

DHAKA A spelling mistake in an online bank transfer instruction helped prevent a nearly $1 billion heist last month involving the Bangladesh central bank and the New York Fed, banking officials said.

Unknown hackers still managed to get away with about $80 million, one of the largest known bank thefts in history.

The hackers breached Bangladesh Bank's systems and stole its credentials for payment transfers, two senior officials at the bank said. They then bombarded the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with nearly three dozen requests to move money from the Bangladesh Bank's account there to entities in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, the officials said.

Four requests to transfer a total of about $81 million to the Philippines went through, but a fifth, for $20 million, to a Sri Lankan non-profit organisation was held up because the hackers misspelled the name of the NGO, Shalika Foundation.

Hackers misspelled ""foundation"" in the NGO's name as ""fandation"", prompting a routing bank, Deutsche Bank, to seek clarification from the Bangladesh central bank, which stopped the transaction, one of the officials said.

There is no NGO under the name of Shalika Foundation in the list of registered Sri Lankan non-profits. Reuters could not immediately find contact information for the organization.

Deutsche Bank declined to comment.

At the same time, the unusually high number of payment instructions and the transfer requests to private entities - as opposed to other banks - raised suspicions at the Fed, which also alerted the Bangladeshis, the officials said.

The details of how the hacking came to light and was stopped before it did more damage have not been previously reported. Bangladesh Bank has billions of dollars in a current account with the Fed, which it uses for international settlements.

The transactions that were stopped totalled $850-$870 million, one of the officials said.

Last year, Russian computer security company Kaspersky Lab said a multinational gang of cyber criminals had stolen as much as $1 billion from as many as 100 financial institutions around the world in about two years.

Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's son Qusay took $1 billion from Iraq's central bank on the orders of his father on the day before coalition forces began bombing the country in 2003, American and Iraqi officials have said. In 2007, guards at the Dar Es Salaam bank in Baghdad made off with $282 million.

MONEY RECOVERED

Bangladesh Bank has said it has recovered some of the money that was stolen, and is working with anti-money laundering authorities in the Philippines to try to recover the rest.

A bank spokesman could not be reached for comment late on Thursday.

The recovered funds refer to the Sri Lanka transfer, which was stopped, one of the officials said.

Initially, the Sri Lankan transaction reached Pan Asia Banking Corp, which went back to Deutsche Bank for more verification because of the unusually large size of the payment, a Pan Asia official said. ""The transaction was too large for a country like us,"" the official said. ""Then (Deutsche) came back and said it was a suspect transaction."" A Pan Asia spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.

The dizzying, global reach of the heist underscores the growing threat of cyber crime and how hackers can find weak links in even the most secure computer networks.

More than a month after the attack, Bangladeshi officials are scrambling to trace the money, shore up security and identify weaknesses in their systems. They said there is little hope of ever catching the hackers, and it could take months before the money is recovered, if at all.

Security experts said the perpetrators had deep knowledge of the Bangladeshi institution's internal workings, likely gained by spying on bank workers.

The Bangladesh government, meanwhile, is blaming the Fed for not stopping the transactions earlier. Finance Minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith told reporters on Tuesday that the country may resort to suing the Fed to recover the money.

""The Fed must take responsibility,"" he said.

The New York Fed has said its systems were not breached, and it has been working with the Bangladesh central bank since the incident occurred.

The hacking of Bangladesh Bank happened sometime between Feb. 4-5, over the Bangladeshi weekend, which falls on a Friday, the officials said. The bank's offices were shut.

Initially, the central bank was not sure if its system had been breached, but cyber security experts brought in to investigate found hacker ""footprints"" that suggested the system had been compromised, the officials said.

These experts could also tell that the attack originated from outside Bangladesh, they said, adding the bank is looking into how they got into the system and an internal investigation is ongoing.

The bank suspects money sent to the Philippines was further diverted to casinos there, the officials said.

The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp, which oversees the gaming industry, said it has launched an investigation. The country's anti-money laundering authority is also working on the case.

Jonny Hayes celebrates after scoring the first goal for Aberdeen. Action Images via Reuters / Lee Smith

LONDON A huge shock is on the cards in British football as a rank outsider is threatening to gatecrash the millionaire favourites. But it is Scottish hopefuls Aberdeen and not English league leaders Leicester who have bridged the biggest financial gulf.

As far as squad values and wage bills are concerned, it would be a bigger upset if Aberdeen pipped Celtic to the Scottish title than if Leicester held off a pack of blue-chip chasers in the English top flight.

Leicester are five points ahead of Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League, with Arsenal and Manchester City also in contention. Aberdeen are a point behind Celtic.

Things are far from over with teams still left to play nine or 10 games in the season. Yet the longest high street odds suggest a 44 percent chance of Leicester being crowned champions with Aberdeen rated a 10 percent shot to do so.

The disparity in the finances between these clubs and their rivals could partly explain why bookmakers see Aberdeen as far greater underdogs.

At 95 million pounds ($135 million), the market value of Leicester's squad equates to around 40 percent of Tottenham's (234 million pounds) and 30 percent of Arsenal's (330 million pounds).

The Leicester squad is worth 25 percent of Manchester City's (376 million pounds), the most valuable in the league, according to Transfermarkt.

North of the border, Aberdeen's squad is worth less than 7 million pounds, or 17 percent of Celtic's 40 million-pound group of players.

""All credit to Aberdeen, they have hung in there but with the money Celtic are spending and the players they have got, you would have fully expected them to pull away,"" former Rangers striker Kris Boyd said of his old rivals this week.

HIGHER MOUNTAIN

Although Aberdeen arguably have a higher mountain to climb, if either team triumph it would be one of the biggest surprises in European domestic football for years.

Aberdeen, under Alex Ferguson of Manchester United fame, were the last side outside the ""old firm"" of Glasgow's Celtic and Rangers to win the Scottish league, back in 1984-85.

Rangers are favourites to be back in the top flight next year having been in lower division wilderness following their relegation in 2012 for financial irregularities.

Blackburn Rovers were the last real surprise English winners in 1994-95 but they did it with a wage bill to match most of their rivals.

In Europe, Atletico Madrid pipped Spain's La Liga giants Real Madrid and Barcelona in the 2013-14 season, but according to Transfermarkt their squad is currently worth 269 million pounds, more than half that of their rivals.

Current information on wages is hard to pin down, but Global Sports Salaries Survey, published annually by website 'Sporting Intelligence', gives an insight into how difficult it is to spring an upset in Scotland versus England.

The most recent survey showed six clubs in the Premier League paid average salaries for first-team players in the summer of 2014 of 3-5 million pounds per player, two or three times more than the 1-2 million pounds paid by the rest.

In Scotland, Celtic paid 900,000 pounds, around seven times the 140,000 pounds forked out by Aberdeen.

Ross County -- who currently lie fourth and knocked Celtic out of the Scottish League Cup in January -- paid an average of just 36,000 pounds per player.

($1 = 0.7032 pounds)

A document identifying supporters of Islamic State is seen in this still image from video, released by Sky News to Reuters in London on March 10, 2016.

LONDON A disillusioned former member of Islamic State has passed a stolen memory stick of documents identifying 22,000 supporters in over 50 countries to a British journalist, a leak that could help the West target Islamist fighters planning attacks.

Leaks of such detailed information about Islamic State are rare and give Britain's spies a potential trove of data that could help unmask militants who have threatened more attacks like those that killed 130 people in Paris last November.

A man calling himself Abu Hamed, a former member of Islamic State who became disillusioned with its leaders, passed the files to Britain's Sky News on a memory stick he said he had stolen from the head of the group's internal security force.

On it were enrolment forms containing the names of Islamic State supporters and of their relatives, telephone numbers, and other details such as the subjects' areas of expertise and who had recommended them.

One of the files, marked ""Martyrs"", detailed a group of IS members who were willing and trained to carry out suicide attacks, Sky said.

Richard Barrett, a former head of global counter-terrorism at Britain's MI6 Secret Intelligence Service, said the cache was ""a fantastic coup"" in the fight against Islamic State.

""It will be an absolute goldmine of information of enormous significance and interest to very many people, particularly the security and intelligence services,"" Barrett told Sky News.

Sky said it had informed the British authorities about the documents which were passed to its correspondent, Stuart Ramsay, at an undisclosed location in Turkey.

Western security sources said that if genuine, the files could be gold dust as they could help identify potential attackers and the networks of sympathisers behind them, and give insight on the structure of the group.

Reuters was not able to independently verify the documents, given their provenance. A selection of them was published in Arabic.

Islamic State militants claimed responsibility for the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris and the Oct. 31 downing of a Russian passenger plane over Egypt's Sinai region that killed 224. They have promised more attacks on the West and Russia.

SUICIDE BOMBERS

Western leaders say Islamic State, which has proclaimed a caliphate in the parts of Syria and Iraq it controls, now poses a greater danger to the West than al Qaeda. It uses a militant interpretation of Islam to justify attacks on its foes and the use of extreme violence, including rape and beheadings, against those it sees as infidels.

The defector, a former Free Syrian Army fighter who switched to Islamic State, said the group had been taken over by former soldiers from the Iraqi Baath party of Saddam Hussein, who was ousted in 2003 after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.

Some of the defector's Arabic documents, posted on the Zaman Al Wasl Syrian news website, were forms issued by ""Islamic State in Iraq and Sham, the General Directorate of Borders"" and displayed personal details of each fighter, according to a review of some of the documents by Reuters.

The forms included answers to 23 questions such as assumed name, birthplace, education level, extent of Sharia learning and previous jobs, as well as details about the individuals' journey to Islamic State and whether they were potential suicide bombers or more traditional fighters.

When asked for his view of the documents, Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at London's Royal United Services Institute, said in an emailed response: ""It seems a bit dated.""

""Very interesting though and a real gift for researchers into understanding the group more,"" he added. ""The key for me in many ways is how this highlights the bureaucracy of the organisation once again - kinda like al Qaeda in fact.""

DHAKA A spelling mistake in an online bank transfer instruction helped prevent a nearly $1 billion heist last month involving the Bangladesh central bank and the New York Fed, banking officials said.

Unknown hackers still managed to get away with about $80 million, one of the largest known bank thefts in history.

The hackers breached Bangladesh Bank's systems and stole its credentials for payment transfers, two senior officials at the bank said. They then bombarded the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with nearly three dozen requests to move money from the Bangladesh Bank's account there to entities in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, the officials said.

Four requests to transfer a total of about $81 million to the Philippines went through, but a fifth, for $20 million, to a Sri Lankan non-profit organisation was held up because the hackers misspelled the name of the NGO, Shalika Foundation.

Hackers misspelled ""foundation"" in the NGO's name as ""fandation"", prompting a routing bank, Deutsche Bank, to seek clarification from the Bangladesh central bank, which stopped the transaction, one of the officials said.

There is no NGO under the name of Shalika Foundation in the list of registered Sri Lankan non-profits. Reuters could not immediately find contact information for the organization.

Deutsche Bank declined to comment.

At the same time, the unusually high number of payment instructions and the transfer requests to private entities - as opposed to other banks - raised suspicions at the Fed, which also alerted the Bangladeshis, the officials said.

The details of how the hacking came to light and was stopped before it did more damage have not been previously reported. Bangladesh Bank has billions of dollars in a current account with the Fed, which it uses for international settlements.

The transactions that were stopped totalled $850-$870 million, one of the officials said.

Last year, Russian computer security company Kaspersky Lab said a multinational gang of cyber criminals had stolen as much as $1 billion from as many as 100 financial institutions around the world in about two years.

Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's son Qusay took $1 billion from Iraq's central bank on the orders of his father on the day before coalition forces began bombing the country in 2003, American and Iraqi officials have said. In 2007, guards at the Dar Es Salaam bank in Baghdad made off with $282 million.

MONEY RECOVERED

Bangladesh Bank has said it has recovered some of the money that was stolen, and is working with anti-money laundering authorities in the Philippines to try to recover the rest.

A bank spokesman could not be reached for comment late on Thursday.

The recovered funds refer to the Sri Lanka transfer, which was stopped, one of the officials said.

Initially, the Sri Lankan transaction reached Pan Asia Banking Corp, which went back to Deutsche Bank for more verification because of the unusually large size of the payment, a Pan Asia official said. ""The transaction was too large for a country like us,"" the official said. ""Then (Deutsche) came back and said it was a suspect transaction."" A Pan Asia spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.

The dizzying, global reach of the heist underscores the growing threat of cyber crime and how hackers can find weak links in even the most secure computer networks.

More than a month after the attack, Bangladeshi officials are scrambling to trace the money, shore up security and identify weaknesses in their systems. They said there is little hope of ever catching the hackers, and it could take months before the money is recovered, if at all.

Security experts said the perpetrators had deep knowledge of the Bangladeshi institution's internal workings, likely gained by spying on bank workers.

The Bangladesh government, meanwhile, is blaming the Fed for not stopping the transactions earlier. Finance Minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith told reporters on Tuesday that the country may resort to suing the Fed to recover the money.

""The Fed must take responsibility,"" he said.

The New York Fed has said its systems were not breached, and it has been working with the Bangladesh central bank since the incident occurred.

The hacking of Bangladesh Bank happened sometime between Feb. 4-5, over the Bangladeshi weekend, which falls on a Friday, the officials said. The bank's offices were shut.

Initially, the central bank was not sure if its system had been breached, but cyber security experts brought in to investigate found hacker ""footprints"" that suggested the system had been compromised, the officials said.

These experts could also tell that the attack originated from outside Bangladesh, they said, adding the bank is looking into how they got into the system and an internal investigation is ongoing.

The bank suspects money sent to the Philippines was further diverted to casinos there, the officials said.

The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp, which oversees the gaming industry, said it has launched an investigation. The country's anti-money laundering authority is also working on the case.

Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks during the Univision News and Washington Post Democratic U.S. presidential candidates debate in Kendall, Florida March 9, 2016.

WASHINGTON Major U.S. hedge fund managers are on pace this year to more than double the amount they gave in the 2012 election campaign, with independent fundraising groups backing Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Ted Cruz receiving the most so far.

About $47 million has been lavished on presidential candidates and lawmakers and the political action committees that support them by two dozen of the industry's top managers in the first 13 months of this election season, according to a Reuters review of Federal Election Commission filings. (For a list of the top givers see tmsnrt.rs/1nlPYZv)

Most of the hedge fund support going to Cruz and Clinton has come from a handful of people out of the two dozen managers studied.

Robert Mercer, co-chief executive of Renaissance Technologies, for example, has given $11 million to Keep the Promise I, a Super PAC that supports Cruz. Mercer is an enigmatic computer programmer who is a powerful financial force in conservative politics.

Cruz wants to abolish the tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service, slash income and payroll taxes and impose a new ""business transfer tax."" Cruz's wife, Heidi Cruz, is a Goldman Sachs executive in Houston.

Clintons main benefactor is billionaire George Soros, a long-time patron of Democratic and humanitarian causes and chairman of Soros Fund Management. Soros alone is responsible for $7.3 million of the $11.7 million that has gone to Super PACs and other committees supporting Clinton.

The hedge fund managers' spokespersons either declined to comment or did not respond to queries from Reuters.

But Whitney Tilson, a hedge fund manager who runs Kase Capital, said one reason fellow managers are spending more this election is Donald Trump, the front-runner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.

""There are some pretty heated emotions about Donald Trump,"" said Tilson, who plans to support the Democratic Party nominee.

Trump, who says he is self-funding his campaign, supports closing a loophole that lets some hedge fund managers pay less than the usual income tax rate on performance fees they get known as ""carried interest."" Clinton supports this, too.

The Managed Funds Association, an industry lobbying group, declined to comment on policy aims under the next president.

BIG MONEY, LITTLE IMPACT

There are other worries, too, about a Trump presidency.After months of campaigning and debates, Trump's economic and financial policy positions are still sketchy or unknown.

A Trump presidency could bring ""tremendous uncertainty and instability,"" said Gregory Wawro, a political science professor at Columbia University.

Wawro speculated that Trumps popularity with blue-collar and middle-class voters could prompt the Republican Party to reassess an approach to taxes and economic issues that has favored top earners and major corporations in recent years.

The surge of hedge fund donations has had little effect on the Republican race so far.

Cruz is running well behind Trump while U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is seen by establishment Republicans as their best hope to stop Trump winning the nomination, is a distant third.

Conservative Solutions, a Super PAC that backs Rubio, received $2.5 million from Paul Singer, the long-time Republican fundraiser who runs Elliott Management, and another $2.6 million in contributions from hedge fund manager Kenneth Griffin of Citadel Investment Group.

Two other Republican candidates with major hedge fund backing, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, have dropped out of the race.

Christie's Super PAC, America Leads, received about $3 million from Steve Cohen of Point72 Asset Management, while Right to Rise, a PAC that supports Bush, drew $450,000 in donations from managers including Citadel's Griffin, David Tepper of Appaloosa Management and Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management.

In the Democratic race, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders has eschewed donations from Wall Street. He has racked up a string of wins in early state nominating contests with attacks on Wall Street and calls for a more equitable distribution of the country's wealth.

Overall, hedge fund contributions to 2016 presidential candidates and lawmakers and the PACs supporting them favored Republicans over Democrats by about 3 to 2.

Abdul Qadr al-Najdi, described in an interview released by the SITE monitoring group on Thursday as ""the emir tasked with administering the Libyan provinces"", said he was praying for Libya to be made the ""vanguard of the Caliphate"".

He also warned neighbouring countries that they would not be able to defend themselves from the militants.

""You are protecting yourself from the detonators with shields of bamboo, and from the flood with a ring of wood,"" he said, in the interview in the Islamic State publication al-Naba.

Tunisia, where more than 50 people died in an assault by Islamists near the Libyan border this week, has just completed a trench and barrier on its southern frontier in an effort to stop militants crossing.

Islamic State has taken advantage of the political chaos and security vacuum following the 2011 uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi to establish a presence in several cities. Western officials have expressed alarm over the expansion and estimates the number of its fighters to be as high as 6,000.

Last year it took full control of the eastern city of Sirte and the surrounding coastline. That had proved easier than expanding elsewhere in Libya, where ""the number of factions and their disputes"" was one reason for failure, Nadji said.

Islamic State militants were mostly pushed out of the eastern city of Derna by rival Islamist factions in June, and has been targeted by local security forces in the western city of Sabratha following a U.S. air strike on a suspected training camp in February.

Najdi described Islamic State in Libya as ""still young"" but said it was making progress in imposing religious law in areas under its control, in line with its actions in Iraq and Syria.

""The provinces of Libya have become the destination of the

mujahideen and a sanctuary for the oppressed,"" he said.

""The numbers of immigrants multiplied from all areas despite the ardent attempts by the West to prevent their immigration.""

Najdi said the Libyan province was ""in constant communication"" with central offices in Iraq and Syria, where the group took swathes of territory in 2014 but has since come under increasing pressure from air strikes and local forces.

A U.S. air strike in a suburb of Derna in November killed Islamic State's previous leader in Libya, known as Abu Nabil.

BRASILIA O governo vai avaliar o cenario politico antes de enviar ao Congresso uma proposta de reforma da Previdencia e pode optar por evitar uma pauta com potencial para aumentar a disputa no Congresso e na sociedade brasileira, disse a Reuters o ministro do Trabalho e Previdencia, Miguel Rossetto.

Um dos pontos centrais da nova agenda do governo para enfrentar problemas estruturais do pais, a reforma da Previdencia nao e um tema de consenso nem mesmo dentro do governo.

A presidente Dilma Rousseff afirmou, no inicio deste ano, que a intencao do Palacio do Planalto era enviar uma proposta pronta ao Congresso ate abril deste ano. Rossetto admite que os prazos e conveniencias podem ser reavaliados.

Nos vamos avaliar, temos que avaliar a dinamica politica da sociedade brasileira"", disse Rossetto a Reuters na noite de quarta-feira, acrescentando que houve ""uma mudanca forte"" a partir da ultima sexta-feira com a conducao coercitiva do ex-presidente Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

""Evidentemente que isso traz um processo permanente de avaliacao das pautas da agenda politica do governo. Nao interessa agendas de natureza tao somente conflitiva com o Congresso e a sociedade, afirmou Rossetto ao ser perguntado se o governo iria enfrentar, em um momento de baixa popularidade, um tema que alienaria a base social que ainda lhe resta --sindicatos e movimentos sociais.

Nos ultimos dias, o processo de impeachment da presidente voltou a ganhar impulso, especialmente depois de noticia com supostas informacoes da delacao premiada do ex-lider do governo no Senado Delcidio do Amaral (PT-MS).

Com a conducao coercitiva de Lula, as bases sociais do governo reagiram em defesa do ex-presidente, mas a simpatia pelo governo Dilma ainda e limitada pela antipatia ao ajuste fiscal e a mudancas que mexem no que e visto como direitos adquiridos.

Em entrevista a Reuters publicada na quarta-feira, o ministro da Fazenda, Nelson Barbosa, havia garantido que o governo vai levar adiante a ideia de ter uma proposta para a reforma da Previdencia pronta ate abril. [nL1N16I0GW]

As posicoes dispares revelam a dificuldade que o proprio governo tem de cerrar fileiras em torno de uma reforma que vai contra boa parte do que o PT, partido da presidente, sempre defendeu.

Ha duas semanas, em um primeiro encontro do forum da Previdencia, formado por representantes de empresarios e trabalhadores, os sindicatos afirmaram que se recusam a aceitar boa parte das propostas que o governo estuda --entre elas, idade minima, cobranca previdenciaria de trabalhadores rurais ou reducao da diferenca no tempo de aposentadoria entre homens e mulheres.

POSICOES EM ABERTO

O governo, afirma Rossetto, nao esta fechado sobre nenhum dos pontos que estao sendo discutidos para tentar chegar a uma proposta comum.

O governo nao tem uma posicao sobre a agenda dos projetos. Varias posicoes existem dentro do governo. Eu penso, por exemplo, que a regra atual 85/95 (que soma a idade com o tempo de servico), com progressividade, e um sistema adequado para a realidade do mercado de trabalho brasileiro, disse.

Ele ressaltou que o sistema previdenciario deve levar em consideracao as diferentes idades com que os brasileiros comecam a trabalhar, alguns muito cedo. Nossa expectativa e buscar pontos de acordo.

O ministro defende que e papel do governo apresentar solucoes para os problemas do pais, e a Previdencia e um dos mais urgentes.

Segundo Rossetto, estatisticas mostram que em 2030, 20 por cento da populacao brasileira tera 60 anos ou mais, estando apta a se aposentar pelas regras atuais, enquanto esse indice e de 10 por cento atualmente.

Em 20 anos, havera uma estabilidade no crescimento do numero de brasileiros, ja que o pais tem uma taxa de fertilidade negativa --abaixo de 2 filhos por mulher-- e deve diminuir o ritmo de aumento da expectativa de vida.

Com as regras atuais, a projecao do ministerio e de um deficit da Previdencia equivalente a 3,52 por cento do Produto Interno Bruto em 2040. Atualmente ele esta em 1,14 por cento.

O Ministerio da Fazenda, no entanto, defende que uma idade minima e o ponto base de qualquer reforma previdenciaria que pretenda ter sucesso, algo que os trabalhadores rejeitam.

O governo caminha para aceitar uma versao mais acelerada da regra atual, que soma os anos de servico com a idade para se chegar a um tempo minimo de contribuicao. Atualmente, de 85 para mulheres e 95 para homens, chegando a 90/100 em 2022. A intencao e antecipar esse indice final.

Rossetto diz que o governo e o PT estao unidos na defesa de uma reforma da Previdencia.

O partido esta unido e tem um compromisso absoluto com a presidente. Nao podemos ficar tangenciando o ajuste fiscal para sempre, afirmou. Mas o PT vem assumindo sua responsabilidade de apresentar a sua agenda.

Parlamentares do partido ja deixaram claro a presidente, em mais de uma reuniao no Palacio do Planalto, que avaliam nao ser essa a hora de lidar com uma reforma da Previdencia.

O proprio ministro admite que pelo menos o ritmo da reforma pode ser revisto, especialmente frente a uma polarizacao crescente na politica do pais e ao que chamou de odio institucional, principalmente depois da conducao coercitiva de Lula, determinada pelo juiz Sergio Moro na ultima sexta-feira.

Vamos avaliar isso. Tem a ver com esse dialogo com sociedade e com o Congresso. O governo vai monitorar e medir na definicao do ritmo da reforma.

DISCURSO DO ODIO

Rossetto nao poupa criticas a oposicao e a midia, acusando partidos como PSDB, PPS e DEM de estimularem o odio e terem um padrao de politica inaceitavel.

Ha uma polarizacao crescente patrocinada por alguns orgaos de imprensa, afirmou, revelando que o governo teme atos de violencia nos protestos de domingo.

O PT pediu a seus diretorios que nao marcassem manifestacoes para esse dia, e sindicatos como a CUT ja avisaram que nao irao a atos em Sao Paulo que estavam sendo programados para o mesmo local dos protestos contra o governo.

Ainda assim, o partido esta programando atos culturais para o mesmo dia, em outros locais.

Acho que ha risco sim (de violencia). Infelizmente tem setores que vem operando com um total sentimento de odio, estimulando esse odio nas redes sociais, disse. Temos que estar atento para os riscos.",[]
reuters.com,2016-03-10 13:03:12+00:00,"Com perdas em alimentos e moveis e eletrodomesticos, varejo inicia ano com queda de 1,5%",['Reuters Editorial'],"RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO As fortes quedas em moveis e eletrodomesticos, alimentos e combustiveis pressionaram as vendas no varejo brasileiro em janeiro e o setor iniciou o ano sem dar sinais de recuperacao em breve diante das perdas de emprego e da inflacao alta que assolam o pais.

No primeiro mes do ano, informou o Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica (IBGE) nesta quinta-feira, as vendas varejistas cairam 1,5 por cento sobre dezembro, no segundo pior resultado para o mes na serie iniciada em 2001.

Sobre o mesmo mes do ano anterior, as vendas despencaram 10,3 por cento, maior queda desde marco de 2003 (-11,4 por cento), depois de terem encerrado 2015 com a maior queda historica.

""O volume de vendas na entrada de 2016 mostra uma aceleracao no ritmo de queda das vendas, que e quase generalizada e reflete toda a conjuntura economica"", destacou a economista do IBGE Isabella Nunes.

Os resultados foram piores do que as expectativas em pesquisa da Reuters, de recuo de 0,6 por cento na comparacao mensal e de 8,35 por cento sobre um ano antes.

As mesmas pressoes que afetaram o setor varejista ao longo do ano passado persistem em 2016, impossibilitando a visualizacao de qualquer sinal de estabilidade em breve --a forte recessao economica exacerbada pela fraqueza da confianca em meio as perdas de emprego e renda, juros e inflacao elevados.

Foram exatamente esses fatores que levaram o consumo das familias a recuar 4,0 por cento em 2015, contribuindo para o Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) encolher 3,8 por cento.

O IBGE apontou que a maior queda nas vendas varejistas em janeiro aconteceu em Moveis e eletrodomesticos, de 4,3 por cento.

Hipermercados, supermercados, produtos alimenticios, bebidas e fumo, setor com maior peso na estrutura do comercio varejista, registrou perdas de 0,9 por cento. Ja as vendas de combustiveis e lubrificantes cairam 3,1 por cento sobre dezembro.

""A perda das vendas de hipermercados tem a ver com a renda real mais fraca. Ha ainda uma evolucao de precos de alimentos acima da inflacao e os consumidores estao tendo que se ajustar a essa realidade com produtos alternativos e mais acessiveis"", explicou Isabella, do IBGE.

Por sua vez, o volume de vendas no varejo ampliado --que inclui veiculos e material de construcao-- apresentou recuo de 1,6 por cento, com queda de 6,6 por cento nas vendas de material de construcao.

A pesquisa Focus do Banco Central continua apontando que a inflacao medida pelo IPCA encerrara este ano bem acima dos limites definidos pelo governo, a 7,59 por cento, com a economia registrando contracao de 3,50 por cento.

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration chief Mark Rosekind told Reuters on the sidelines of an event on highway safety that the agency is collecting more information to get a ""more detailed exploration of what exactly happened.""

A Google self-driving car struck a municipal bus in Mountain View, Calif. in a minor crash Feb. 14, and the search engine firm said it bears ""some responsibility"" for the crash in what may be the first crash that was the fault of the self-driving vehicle.

DETROIT The growing popularity of car- and ride-sharing services such as Uber, Lyft and Zipcar will not put a crimp in U.S. vehicle sales any time soon, according to a survey released on Thursday.

Such services are primarily substitutes for taxis and rental cars and will have ""limited impact on current or future vehicle ownership,"" said KBB.com, a unit of Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc [COXET.UL] that provides financial and information services to car dealers and consumers.

The survey of more than 1,900 U.S. residents showed consumers still favored individual ownership because of such factors as safety, reliability and convenience, KBB said.

Nevertheless, traditional auto companies are forming alliances with the newcomers. Avis Budget Group (CAR.O) now owns Zipcar, and General Motors Co (GM.N) recently invested $500 million in Lyft. Other companies have created their own sharing service, notably Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) with Car2Go.

A farther-reaching study in late February, conducted by Boston Consulting Group, said the growth of car-sharing services would erode traditional manufacturers' vehicle sales and revenues through 2021 but would not be nearly as disruptive as the rise of self-driving cars later in the decade.

The KBB survey said the ride- and car-sharing services are used primarily by younger consumers and residents of large cities.

More than two-thirds of the respondents see ride-sharing services as ""a great way to combat drunk driving,"" KBB said.

BRUSSELS - European Union regulators will release data from its year-long inquiry into barriers to cross-border e-commerce next week, the 28-nation bloc's antitrust chief said on Thursday, potentially laying the groundwork for cases against some companies.

The investigation has focused on trade in electronics, clothing, shoes and digital content, examining whether companies have engaged in anti-competitive practices, such as agreements to prevent the sale of products or services in certain countries, or to sell at higher prices.

A paper on the data collected will be released on March 18, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told reporters on the sidelines of a conference organized by German law group Studienvereinigung Kartellrecht.

""This is the first analysis and then maybe we will look into opening cases,"" she said.

While about half of EU consumers shopped online in 2014, only 15 percent bought a product online in another EU country because of language barriers, different laws and anti-competitive behavior, data from the European Commission shows.

Vestager said that an interim report would be issued towards the end of the summer or the beginning of autumn. The final report is scheduled for the first quarter of 2017.

The U.S. officials said on Tuesday that Abu Omar al-Shishani, also known as Omar the Chechen and described by the Pentagon as the group's ""minister of war"", was targeted near the town of al-Shadadi in Syria.

Observatory director Rami Abdulrahman said he had been badly wounded but not killed and had been moved to Islamic State's base of operations in Raqqa for treatment.

""He did not die,"" Abdulrahman said.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says it gathers its information from all sides in the conflict. Reuters had no way to independently verify the report.

Born in 1986 in Georgia, which was then still part of the Soviet Union, the red-bearded Shishani had a reputation as a close military adviser to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was said by followers to have relied heavily on Shishani.

The strike itself involved multiple waves of manned and unmanned aircraft, targeting Shishani near al-Shadadi in Syria, a U.S. official said.

The Pentagon believes Shishani was sent there to bolster Islamic State troops after they suffered a series of setbacks at the hands of U.S.-allied Arab and Kurdish forces on the ground.

An official in the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which has been fighting Islamic State in the al-Shadadi area, said on Tuesday it had received information that Shishani was killed but had no details and had been unable to confirm the death.

The official declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.

Following are comments by ECB President Mario Draghi at a press conference after the bank's policy meeting.

GROWTH DAMPENERS

""The economic recovery in the euro area continues to be dampened by subdued growth prospects in emerging markets, volatile financial markets, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms.""

INFLATION OUTLOOK

""Inflation rates are expected to remain at negative levels in the coming months and to pick up later in 2016. Thereafter, supported by our monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery, inflation rates should recover further.""

CLOSELY MONITORING WAGES

""The Governing Council will closely monitor price-setting behaviour and wage developments in the euro area, paying particular attention to ensure that the current low inflation environment does not become entrenched in second-round effects on wage and price-setting.""

RATE OUTLOOK

""The Governing Council expects key interest rates to remain at the present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases.""

NEED INFLATION TO RETURN

""While very low or even negative inflation rates are unavoidable over the next few months as a result of movements in oil prices, it is crucial to avoid second-round effects by securing the return of inflation to levels below but close to 2 percent without undue delay.""

DOWNSIDE GROWTH RISKS

""The risks to the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside.""

HEIGHTENED RISKS

""With today's comprehensive package of monetary policy decisions, we are providing substantial monetary stimulus to counteract heightened risks to the ECB's price-stability objective.""

MODERATE RECOVERY

""We expect the economic recovery to proceed at a moderate pace.""

NEW MEASURES

""This comprehensive package will exploit the synergies between the different instruments and has been calibrated to further ease financing conditions, stimulate new credit provision and thereby reinforce the momentum of the euro area's economic recovery and accelerate the return of inflation to levels below but close to 2 percent.""

WASHINGTON Europe's top trade official plans an ambitious push to seal a sweeping U.S.-European free trade deal this year even as bitter U.S. presidential primary races sour voter sentiment towards trade.

With many candidates, including Republican front-runner Donald Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders, voicing strong opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, its European counterpart, still under negotiation, has largely flown under the radar.

European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom told reporters on a visit to Washington on Wednesday that major negotiating rounds for the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) were scheduled for April and July, with more informal meetings in March, June and May.

She will meet U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman this week to discuss progress.

Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton's surprise defeat by Sanders in manufacturing-heavy Michigan has laid bare growing voter anger over trade and job losses..

Despite such opposition, Malmstrom said she was determined to sew up most of the TTIP chapters by summer, including settling major differences over U.S. ""Buy American"" government procurement standards, how to resolve investment disputes and over Europe's many geographical rules that govern food products from Parma ham to feta cheese.

""We are determined to try to push this, if possible, to finalize it, being aware that there will be a new administration that will have a word on it,"" Malmstrom said. ""If we are to finish this before the end of the year, of course we need to enter the end-game by the summer.""

But with some U.S. congressional leaders saying that the TPP deal is unlikely to get a vote before the November presidential election, the TTIP is virtually certain to be left to President Barack Obama's successor.

Malmstrom said that EU and U.S. negotiators last week traded proposals on the difficult issue of investment dispute resolution. The EU has objected to the U.S. model for investor-state dispute settlement with binding arbitration and recently bolstered its argument by signing a free trade deal with Canada that includes Europe's model for a more court-like system that allows for appeals.

No negotiations have taken place yet over the dispute resolution proposals, but Malmstrom said, ""I don't expect this to pass smoothly.""

Malmstrom said she was determined not to let U.S. campaign rhetoric against free trade jobs stall the TTIP negotiations.

""Without entering into debate with one individual, I don't share those arguments,"" she said. ""In good trade agreements, there are a lot of economic advantages.""

After rolling out the welcome mat in September for Syrian refugees streaming into Europe, to the alarm of many European leaders who were not consulted, she has now gambled on a last-minute deal with Turkey to stop the migrant flow.

Whether that tentative bargain - improvised in the middle of the night a week before German regional elections in which her party faces losses - will turn out to be a breakthrough or a landmine in the migrant crisis remains to be seen.

Reaction at home to Merkel's Turkish gamble has been mixed. Top-selling Bild newspaper welcomed the deal with the headline ""Ball in Turkey's court"", but some of her own conservative lawmakers object to giving Turks visa-free travel in exchange.

German officials say it was Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu who surprised everyone by arriving at a meeting with Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in Brussels on Sunday night with a bold plan offering to take back all migrants who cross into Europe in return for political and economic rewards.

Merkel immediately sensed that the deal could ""change the whole dynamic"", a German official said, adding that the gains would far outweigh concessions the EU would make in return.

Davutoglu's price was a doubling of European money to keep Syrian refugees in Turkey, faster visa liberalization for Turks and accelerated EU membership talks for Ankara.

European Union diplomats and officials in Brussels were flabbergasted by the proposal sprung on them at a summit on Monday, with some irritated at having been kept in the dark during the preparations.

""Ask Mrs Merkel,"" one responded when asked how the idea of sending back all migrants, including Syrian refugees, to Turkey was compatible with international law.

LITTLE CLUE

European Council President Donald Tusk - who chaired Monday's summit - spent two days in Ankara and Istanbul last week meeting Davutoglu and President Tayyip Erdogan, working for a different deal, and was given little clue of what was coming.

Neither Tusk nor European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was invited to the Sunday night preparatory meeting.

Nor was France, Germany's closest European partner, which has minimized its commitment to take in refugees due to security fears since last November's Islamist attacks in Paris but also to the rise of far-right anti-immigration leader Marine Le Pen.

While Merkel took care to involve French President Francois Hollande in her diplomacy with Russia over Ukraine, she turned to Rutte this time as one of the few EU leaders willing to take in Syrian refugees directly from Turkey. Rutte also has a role in running the six-month Dutch presidency of EU meetings.

The proposal for a one-for-one swap in which Europe would admit one Syrian refugee from Turkey for each one the Turks took back from Greek islands - among the most contentious aspects of the draft deal - was first introduced by the Dutch. That left open how many might be brought to Europe - after Merkel found no takers for earlier German suggestions of accepting hundreds of thousands.

Diplomats said that when some leaders asked Tusk why he had not briefed them about the Turkish plan after his trip, he acknowledged that he had not known about the crucial offer to take back all migrants and refugees until Monday morning.

In fact, the former Polish prime minister was caught in a tug-of-war between Merkel and Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann, who infuriated her by holding a conference of central European and Balkan countries last month, without Germany or Greece, to coordinate the closure of their borders to migrants.

""There was a race between Merkel's Plan A and the central Europeans' Plan B, which she suspected Tusk of supporting,"" one EU envoy said. ""So Tusk was sidelined."" Tusk was indeed pushing hard for a closure of the Balkan migration route and had secured broad support for that from EU envoys on Sunday afternoon.

Plan A, which Merkel called a ""European solution"", entailed persuading Ankara to stop migrants leaving its shores, returning those who do not qualify for asylum to home countries or to Turkey, and sharing out legitimate refugees among EU countries.

Plan B, reflecting scepticism that Ankara would deliver and exhaustion with continued arrivals, involved shutting borders across the Balkans and bottling up new migrants in Greece. For Tusk, that was a way of showing the Turks that if they did not halt departures, Europe would act alone and withdraw its offers.

Davutoglu's Plan C was more ambitious than either, but there are big doubts about whether it can be implemented, whether it will work and whether it is legal.

IMPRESSION OF PROGRESS

Although Merkel denied domestic motives, the timing was helpful. The initiative offered a crucial sign of progress six days before votes in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt on which her political future may be riding.

Heavy defeats for her Christian Democrats could weaken her and might raise question marks over her ability to lead the party into next year's general election, although her popularity is still high and no alternative leader is in sight.

The legality, enforceability and feasibility of Davutoglu's offer will only be tested after the state polls.

Officially, the European Commission is clinging to the line that a formal agreement with Turkey to be concluded at the next summit on March 17-18 will ""at the end of it"" comply with both European and international law.

Juncker said European law allowed the return of irregular migrants to any ""safe"" third country, but added that Greece and Turkey would need to amend some domestic rules.

EU insiders say for the proposed arrangement to be legal, Turkey would have to change the way it applies the Geneva Convention on refugees to include non-European nationals, and Greece would have to create a special court to hear asylum seekers' appeals against being sent back to Turkey.

Under EU rules, migrants are entitled to appeal against being returned to a third country on grounds of a risk to their life or safety there, but the court would not consider their claim for protection from their own country.

Merkel's embrace of the Turkish plan may pose political problems for Hollande, British Prime Minister David Cameron - struggling to win a referendum in June on staying in the EU in which immigration is a big issue - and Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, whose country is the most outspoken in the EU about Turkey's human rights record.

However, most fellow leaders are reluctant to resist Merkel, the EU's longest-serving national leader at the head of its most powerful member state, in her hour of political need.

LONDON A UK decision to leave the European Union would deprive the EU of one of its best-rated members, leaving the bloc and its investment bank vulnerable to credit rating downgrade.

While ratings agencies have warned a vote to leave could hurt the UK's rating, a Brexit could also have consequences for institutions which Britain supports via its EU membership.

Britain accounts for some 16 percent of the EU's nominal gross domestic product, makes a net annual budget contribution of about 6.5 billion euros ($7.2 billion) and is among the highest-rated of the EU's 28 members.

It is rated AAA by S&P, Aa1 by Moody's and AA+ by Fitch.

""European entities which would be most affected in the case of Brexit are the European Union itself, with a risk of being downgraded, and the European Investment Bank (EIB),"" said Societe Generale strategist Cristina Costa in a note.

The EU, which has about 54 billion euros in outstanding bonds, is rated AAA by Fitch, Moody's and DBRS and AA+ with a negative outlook by Standard & Poor's.

Since the agencies have stressed the average weighted ratings in their approach to supranational borrowers, a British departure could weigh on the ratings of the EU and the EIB, analysts said.

No comment was immediately available from the EU.

There would be no immediate rating impact from Britain leaving the EU on any of the bloc's other members, Moody's said on Thursday.

WATCH OUT

Analysts say the EIB is especially at risk from a potential Brexit because while the EU and the EIB have similar memberships, they have different structures with regards to financing from its shareholders.

Unlike the EU, the EIB operates like a bank, so has its own capital base - about 243 billion euros, according to its latest financial report. The EIB is also able to tap additional funds known as callable capital, which is almost 222 billion euros.

Because ownership of the EIB is concentrated in the region's five largest economies, its profile would weaken if the UK left, analysts said.

The UK has a 16.1 percent share of the EIB's capital, similar to that of Germany, France and Italy, as this graphic shows tmsnrt.rs/1LT8zHX

While other member states would probably pick up a reduced UK share, the uncertainty could weigh on EIB bonds.

According to SocGen, the loss of Britain as a shareholder would lower the share of high-rated EIB backers to roughly 60 percent from 66 percent.

An EIB source told Reuters there was no automatic consequence of a Brexit on the EIB's AAA rating.

""If it were to materialize, the EIB would closely monitor any potential impact ... and would consider how best to address such a situation and reassure the markets in due course,"" the source said.

Commerzbank rates strategist Rainer Guntermann said any Brexit downgrade to the EIB's ratings could have implications for bond investors.

""Regulation-driven investors in the insurance sector, even if not forced to, prefer to hold triple A-rated paper such as from the German government, EIB or German agencies,"" he said. ""There would be a significant impact if the EIB rating were to slide just one notch.""

The gap between EIB bond yields and the European agency benchmark, KfW, has been tight with the five-year yield spread at about 6-8 basis points.

As the June 23 vote approaches, SocGen and Commerzbank anticipate wider spreads.

SocGen's Costa said spreads could widen by at least five to 10 bps even with support from the ECB's bond-buying program.

Other institutions such as the European Stability Mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, were not expected to take a direct hit.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 15:04:18+00:00,Oil meeting on output freeze unlikely without Iran progress: sources,['Rania El Gamal Alex Lawler'],"The logo of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is pictured at its headquarters in Vienna, Austria, August 21, 2015.

DUBAI/LONDON A meeting between oil producers to discuss a global pact on freezing production is unlikely to take place in Russia on March 20, sources familiar with the matter say, as OPEC member Iran is yet to say whether it would participate in such a deal.

OPEC officials including Nigeria's oil minister have said a meeting would take place in Moscow on that date, potentially as the next step in widening an agreement to freeze output at January levels struck by OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Qatar plus non-member Russia last month.

But the biggest roadblock to a wider deal, OPEC delegates say, is Iran. Tehran feels it should be exempt from the agreement as it wants to recover market share it lost under Western sanctions. Kuwait said on Tuesday it will commit to the deal - if all major producers including Iran do so.

""They are not agreeing on the meeting. Why would the ministers meet again now? Iran says they will not do anything,"" said an OPEC source from a major producer. ""Only if Iran agrees, things will change.""

The pact on freezing output has helped support oil prices, which started a slide in mid-2014 due to oversupply. Brent crude LCOc1 was trading above $40 a barrel on Thursday, up 50 percent from a 12-year low of $27.10 reached in January.

Some delegates are wary that if many oil producers met too soon before getting the nod from everyone, prices could weaken again if the talks ended in disarray.

""Our view is not to go there with the possibility of no agreement so as not to affect prices negatively,"" said another source from a major OPEC member, referring to the proposed March 20 meeting.

OPEC's Gulf members favor meeting in the first half of April, in Doha or another Gulf city, a Gulf delegate said last week.

Another OPEC delegate was more pessimistic, saying he expected no major progress until OPEC's next scheduled meeting in June.

IRAN COMPROMISE?

Tehran has rejected freezing its output at January levels, put by OPEC secondary sources at 2.93 million barrels per day (bpd), and wants to return to much higher pre-sanctions production.

""Tehran wanted a freeze ... for them to be based on 4 million barrels per day, their pre-sanctions production figure,"" said one source familiar with the discussions. A source familiar with Iranian thinking agreed.

The issue is set to be discussed when Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak meets Iranian counterpart Bijan Zanganeh. Novak is visiting Tehran on Monday, RIA news agency reported, citing the Russian embassy in Iran.

Some OPEC sources hinted that there could be a workable agreement on the table to get Tehran on board.

""If they are willing to find a solution, they should offer a fair deal to Iran,"" one said.

There are precedents for OPEC members to be exempt from agreements on output restraint. Iraq, for example, was not included for many years due to sanctions and war.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 15:46:17+00:00,"ECB pulls out all stops with rate cuts, stimulus boost","['Francesco Canepa', 'Balazs Koranyi']","FRANKFURT The European Central Bank unleashed some of it last remaining stimulus weapons on Thursday, cutting all three of its interest rates and expanding asset-buying to boost the economy and prevent ultra-low inflation becoming entrenched.

It slashed its inflation expectations for this year but also suggested that interest rates would go no lower.

In moves that briefly pushed the euro 1 percent down against the dollar, the ECB cut its deposit rate deeper into negative territory and increased monthly asset buys to 80 billion euros from 60 billion euros, above expectations of a hike to 70-billion.

While the deposit rate was cut 10 basis points to -0.4 percent, the main refinancing rate was shaved to zero from 0.05 percent and its marginal lending rate -- used by banks to borrow from the ECB overnight -- fell to 0.25 percent from 0.3 percent.

""Rates will stay low, very low, for a long period of time and well past the horizon of our purchases,"" ECB President Mario Draghi, judged to have disappointed markets in December with measures below expectations, told a news conference.

Purchases are due to end in March next year.

He added, ""From today's perspective and taking into account the support of our measures to growth and inflation, we don't anticipate that it will be necessary to reduce rates further,""

The ECB said it would also start buying corporate debt and launch four new rounds of cheap loan packages, to be extended by banks to the real economy.

Slashing its 2016 inflation forecast from one percent to just 0.1 percent, the Bank said further rounds of ultra-cheap four-year loans to banks could include extra financial sweeteners for them to take up the offer to pass on to others.

""A bank that is very active in granting loans to the real economy can borrow more than a bank that concentrates on other activities,"" Draghi noted.

REACTION

""Good news for Europe: Having delivered less than expected in December, the ECB returned to its usual form today and eased policy by a bit more than projected,"" said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg bank.

But others were more critical, warning that such loose monetary policy risked creating asset price bubbles and removed any incentive for governments to reform their economies.

""What will happen if the global economic situation deteriorates sharply once more, requiring a strong monetary policy response? I do not anticipate this happening, but if it did, the ECB would have already shot most of its powder, said Michael Menhart, chief economist at German reinsurer Munich Re.

Draghi answered such criticisms partly in German, arguing: ""Suppose we had embraced the 'nein zu allem' ('no to everything') policy strategy? We deem that the counterfactual would have been a disastrous deflation.""

But he acknowledged the limitations of negative rates and said any future moves would likely have to focus on other, non-conventional measures.

""Does it mean that we can go as negative as we want without having any consequences on the banking system? The answer is no,"" he said.

The ECB has little to show for the 700 billion euros it has spent buying government bonds and other assets in the past year, as tumbling raw materials prices blunt the impact of its quantitative easing.

That raises the risk that people will lose faith in the bank's commitment to its mandate. Inflation has been below the ECB's nearly 2 percent target for three years and is likely to remain so for many more.

The ECB's move came after the G20 group of the world's major economies last month agreed they need to look beyond ultra-low interest rates and printing money to shake the global economy out of its torpor.

The U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, Bank of England and Swiss National Bank are all set to meet next week.

While Europe's growth prospects have held up relatively well on resilient domestic consumption, weak business and industrial sentiment indicators suggest it is facing increasing headwinds, particularly from slowing growth in China.

FRANCFORT La Banque centrale europeenne (BCE) a mobilise jeudi l'ensemble des outils a sa disposition pour stimuler l'inflation et le credit, reduisant ses trois taux directeurs, augmentant ses achats de dettes sur les marches et promettant aux banques de nouveaux financements.

Ses annonces ont fait perdre jusqu'a 1% a l'euro mais la monnaie unique est rapidement remontee, le president de la BCE, Mario Draghi, ayant precise que l'institution ne prevoyait pas de reduire davantage ses taux.

La BCE a abaisse, comme attendu, le taux de sa facilite de depot a -0,4% contre -0,3%, mais elle a aussi ramene son taux de refinancement a zero, une premiere, et reduit le taux de sa facilite de pret marginal (celui auquel les banques peuvent lui emprunter des liquidites au jour le jour) a 0,25%.

Elle a parallelement porte de 60 a 80 milliards d'euros le montant de ses achats mensuels sur les marches financiers, un programme qui sera en outre etendu au marche des obligations d'entreprises.

""Les taux vont rester bas, tres bas, pour une periode de temps prolongee et bien au-dela de l'horizon temporel de nos achats"", a explique Mario Draghi lors d'une conference de presse.

""Dans la perspective actuelle et en prenant en compte le soutien apporte par nos mesures a la croissance et a l'inflation, nous n'anticipons pas qu'il sera necessaire d'abaisser encore les taux. Evidemment, des faits nouveaux peuvent changer la situation et les perspectives.""

PLUS QUE 0,1% D'INFLATION EN 2016

La BCE procedera egalement a partir du mois de juin a quatre nouvelles operations de prets de liquidites a long terme aux banques de la zone euro. Et ces operations seront d'autant plus favorables que les banques seront disposees a preter aux entreprises et aux menages, a souligne Mario Draghi.

""Une banque tres active dans l'octroi de prets a l'economie reelle peut emprunter plus qu'une banque qui se concentre sur d'autres activites"", a-t-il dit.

Le president de la BCE, qui avait decu les marches en decembre en devoilant un assouplissement de sa politique moins ambitieux qu'attendu, a justifie ses nouvelles initiatives par le risque de voir la reprise economique dans la zone euro compromise par le ralentissement des pays emergents.

Les services de la banque centrale ont en effet revu en baisse leurs previsions de croissance et d'inflation, disant ne tabler desormais que sur une hausse de 0,1% des prix dans la zone euro cette annee, soit dix fois moins qu'attendu en decembre, alors que l'institution vise un taux de pres de 2%.

""Bonne nouvelle pour l'Europe : apres avoir fait moins qu'attendu en decembre, la BCE a renoue aujourd'hui avec ses methodes habituelles en assouplissant sa politique un peu plus qu'attendu"", a commente Holger Schmieding, economiste de la banque Berenberg.

Mais d'autres observateurs sont plus critiques en soulignant le risque pris par la BCE de favoriser la creation de bulles sur les marches tout en dissuadant les gouvernements d'entreprendre des reformes.

LES LIMITES DES TAUX NEGATIFS

""Que se passera-t-il si la situation economique mondiale se deteriore nettement une fois de plus, ce qui necessiterait une reponse forte de la politique monetaire ? Ce n'est pas ce que je prevois mais si c'est le cas, la BCE aura deja epuise toutes ses munitions"", explique Michael Menhart, chef economiste du reassureur allemand Munich Re.

Mario Draghi a repondu indirectement a ces critiques, en allant jusqu'a utiliser la langue allemande : ""Supposons que nous ayons adopte la politique du 'nein zu allem' ('non a tout'). On peut supposer que la consequence aurait ete une deflation desastreuse"", a-t-il dit.

Il a toutefois admis que les taux negatifs avaient leurs limites et que d'eventuelles nouvelles mesures devraient porter sur le volet non conventionnel de la politique monetaire.

""Cela veut-il dire que nous pouvons nous enfoncer en territoire negatif aussi longtemps que nous le voulons sans aucune consequence negative pour le systeme bancaire ? La reponse est non"", a-t-il dit.

Apres etre tombe a 1,0823 dollar, au plus bas depuis six semaines, l'euro est remonte a plus de 1,11 dollar.

Sur les marches actions, la vive hausse declenchee par les annonces sur les taux s'est nettement attenuee apres la conference de presse.

Vers 16h30, l'indice paneuropeen FTSEurofirst 300 gagnait moins de 0,5% alors que sa progression atteignait 2,6% juste apres le communique sur les taux. A Paris, le CAC 40 s'adjugeait 1% au meme moment a 4.470 points, 110 points en dessous de son plus haut du jour.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has not changed its key interest rate since cutting by a surprise 50 basis points in September. Governor Raghuram Rajan has emphasised the need for fiscal reform and stable inflation before he takes any further action.

India unveiled a fire-fighting budget last week that seeks to win back support among rural voters for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government and sustain growth against a grim global backdrop, putting the onus for support back on Rajan.

Junior Finance Minister Jayant Sinha said the tight fiscal policy could allow for further monetary easing. Also giving Rajan room to act, the poll of 23 economists predicted retail prices rose 5.60 percent in February, a touch slower than January's 5.69 percent.

""Food inflation eased in February...most likely due to the fact that temperatures have finally returned to normal, after unusually high temperatures earlier in winter led to delays in the sowing of rabi (summer) crops such as wheat and barley,"" said Shilan Shah, India economist at Capital Economics.

""The chances of there being perhaps one more rate cut in the near term have risen, but this is because the FY16/17 budget adopted a tighter fiscal stance than expected rather than any change in the outlook for inflation,"" he added.

Although inflation has been climbing since July, it has remained below the RBI's January 2016 target of 6 percent for nearly a year-and-a-half.

The RBI is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points at its April 5 meeting and follow up with a second cut in the last three months of 2016, a separate Reuters poll conducted last week found, as it tries to boost flagging growth.

Indian industrial production was expected to contract for a third straight month in January, the latest poll also found.

Economists predicted Friday's data will show a fall of 0.5 percent in factory output, following a 1.3 percent and 3.4 percent decline in December and November respectively.

""Although auto sales are doing well and the manufacturing PMI recovered very recently, other indicators such as rail freight and production in 'core' industries remain weak,"" said Devika Mehndiratta, ANZ Research's chief Asia economist.

The slight rebound is likely due to a similar bounce back in infrastructure output, which rose 2.9 percent in January, up from December's 0.9 percent. Infrastructure output accounts for over one-third of the wider industrial measure.

GENEVA China has written to diplomats and U.N. officials urging them not to attend a Geneva event on Friday where the Dalai Lama will speak, reasserting that it opposes his appearance at all venues due to his ""separatist activities"".

Reuters reported in October that China is waging a campaign of intimidation, obstruction and harassment that Western diplomats and activists say is aimed at silencing criticism of its human rights record at the United Nations.

In a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday, China's diplomatic mission in Geneva raised objections about the presence of Tibet's exiled spiritual leader on the panel of Nobel laureates, being held at the Geneva Graduate Institute.

""Inviting the 14th Dalai Lama to the aforementioned event violates the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China, in contravention of the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter. China resolutely opposes the 14th Dalai Lama's separatist activities in whatever capacity and in whatever name in any country, organisation or event,"" it said.

The letter was dated March 8, the day that the event - being sponsored by the United States and Canada - was announced.

""The Permanent Mission of China kindly requests the Permanent Missions of all Member States, U.N. agencies and relevant International Organizations not to attend the above-mentioned event, nor meet the 14th Dalai Lama and his clique.""

The Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Price in 1989, fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Communist rule. China views him as a separatist, but the monk says he only wants genuine autonomy for his Himalayan homeland.

No delegation is making a formal complaint about China at the four-week session but there has been criticism recently of its mass arrests of lawyers, including from the United States.

A joint statement critical of China, sponsored by about a dozen countries including the United States, is to be read out at the forum on Thursday around midday (1200 GMT), the U.S. mission's spokesman in Geneva said.

He declined to comment on China's request for a boycott, saying: ""I refer you to Chinese authorities for their views. We do not comment on the substance of our diplomatic exchanges.""

Philippe Burrin, director of the Geneva institute, said that ""pressures are being applied from various sides"" but the event would not be cancelled.

""This is a question of freedom of expression and academic freedom to organise an event,"" he told Reuters.

""It is not an event on Tibet, it is not on a politically sensitive subject, i.e. territorial issues, but on the role of civil society in promoting human rights,"" he said.

U.N. Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, Kate Gilmore, the panel's moderator, is believed to be one of the first senior U.N. officials to meet the Dalai Lama.

The event, which also features Nobel laureates from Iran and Yemen, is taking place on the sidelines of the annual session of the U.N. Human Rights Council, which monitors and examines violations worldwide.

Thursday is the fifty-seventh anniversary of the beginning of the Tibetan peoples peaceful uprising against Chinas invasion and occupation of Tibet.

A document identifying supporters of Islamic State is seen in this still image from video, released by Sky News to Reuters in London on March 10, 2016.

LONDON A disillusioned former member of Islamic State has passed a stolen memory stick of documents identifying 22,000 supporters in over 50 countries to a British journalist, a leak that could help the West target Islamist fighters planning attacks.

Leaks of such detailed information about Islamic State are rare and give Britain's spies a potential trove of data that could help unmask militants who have threatened more attacks like those that killed 130 people in Paris last November.

A man calling himself Abu Hamed, a former member of Islamic State who became disillusioned with its leaders, passed the files to Britain's Sky News on a memory stick he said he had stolen from the head of the group's internal security force.

On it were enrolment forms containing the names of Islamic State supporters and of their relatives, telephone numbers, and other details such as the subjects' areas of expertise and who had recommended them.

One of the files, marked ""Martyrs"", detailed a group of IS members who were willing and trained to carry out suicide attacks, Sky said.

Richard Barrett, a former head of global counter-terrorism at Britain's MI6 Secret Intelligence Service, said the cache was ""a fantastic coup"" in the fight against Islamic State.

""It will be an absolute goldmine of information of enormous significance and interest to very many people, particularly the security and intelligence services,"" Barrett told Sky News.

Sky said it had informed the British authorities about the documents which were passed to its correspondent, Stuart Ramsay, at an undisclosed location in Turkey.

Western security sources said that if genuine, the files could be gold dust as they could help identify potential attackers and the networks of sympathisers behind them, and give insight on the structure of the group.

Reuters was not able to independently verify the documents, given their provenance. A selection of them was published in Arabic.

Islamic State militants claimed responsibility for the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris and the Oct. 31 downing of a Russian passenger plane over Egypt's Sinai region that killed 224. They have promised more attacks on the West and Russia.

SUICIDE BOMBERS

Western leaders say Islamic State, which has proclaimed a caliphate in the parts of Syria and Iraq it controls, now poses a greater danger to the West than al Qaeda. It uses a militant interpretation of Islam to justify attacks on its foes and the use of extreme violence, including rape and beheadings, against those it sees as infidels.

The defector, a former Free Syrian Army fighter who switched to Islamic State, said the group had been taken over by former soldiers from the Iraqi Baath party of Saddam Hussein, who was ousted in 2003 after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.

Some of the defector's Arabic documents, posted on the Zaman Al Wasl Syrian news website, were forms issued by ""Islamic State in Iraq and Sham, the General Directorate of Borders"" and displayed personal details of each fighter, according to a review of some of the documents by Reuters.

The forms included answers to 23 questions such as assumed name, birthplace, education level, extent of Sharia learning and previous jobs, as well as details about the individuals' journey to Islamic State and whether they were potential suicide bombers or more traditional fighters.

When asked for his view of the documents, Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at London's Royal United Services Institute, said in an emailed response: ""It seems a bit dated.""

""Very interesting though and a real gift for researchers into understanding the group more,"" he added. ""The key for me in many ways is how this highlights the bureaucracy of the organisation once again - kinda like al Qaeda in fact.""

MONACO This year Olympic Games could feature an athletics programme without two of the sports most powerful nations - Russia and Kenya - while a third, Ethiopia, is under immense pressure to show it has adequate anti-doping measures.

Ethiopia is the latest to have its credibility questioned after it was announced last month that six athletes, some of them elite performers, are under investigation for doping.

In addition, former middle-distance world champion Abeba Aregawi, an Ethiopian-turned-Swede, has tested positive.

Russia is currently banned from all athletics following discovery of a state-sponsored doping regime and revelations of corruption.

Kenya, having missed a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) deadline last month, has now been given until May 12 to show it has adequate systems in place after a series of high-profile positive tests by athletes and the suspension of several leading athletics officials.

That is the backdrop to a meeting of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Council on Thursday and Friday where president Sebastian Coe will be fighting to restore the credibility of the sport he graced on the track.

Coe won his two 1,500m golds at the 1980 and 1984 Games, both of which were hit by political boycotts, and results from Rio in August could end up carrying a similar asterisk.

Russia has finished second to the United States in the athletics medal table in the last three Olympics while it was top of the tree in the last three editions of the world championships.

The two east African countries have had a stranglehold on the longer distances for both genders.

In the last five world championships Kenya has averaged above five golds, and 13 medals, with Ethiopia not far behind. It is a similar story at the last five Olympics where Kenya have won 12 gold and 47 track and field medals and Ethiopia 15 gold and 32 in total.

That sustained success, however, is now viewed through the prism of widespread drug-taking and poor controls.

QUESTION OF SPORT

The IAAF will discuss progress Russia has made following visits from an IAAF task force and WADA officials but the country appears to be losing its battle to claim re-admission in time for the Rio de Janeiro Games in August.

Kenya, whose federation is in disarray after recent suspensions, has a matter of weeks to persuade WADA they are code-compliant, or face joining Russia on the sidelines.

Ethiopia has so far escaped censure from WADA but the organisation has instructed the country to improve its programme and develop its own anti-doping organisation after the its athletics doctor Ayalew Tilhaun called their growing drugs problem ""a terrifying development.""

""Ethiopia hasnt been declared non-compliant but it faces serious questions, former WADA head Dick Pound told Reuters.

The head of Ethiopian athletics, Bililign Mekoya, told Reuters: We are not a country known for committing such offences but this has become a global phenomenon. We ... are working to strengthen our capacity and have recently formed our own anti-doping agency.

Those promises sound hopeful but one Ethiopian athletics official told Reuters that the country was a long way from establishing a credible service.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said the Ethiopia's capacity to tackle doping ""does not amount to having more than a few first aid kits"".

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday blasted currency devaluations around the world for hurting the U.S. economy and costing American jobs, and defended his calls for a tougher U.S. stance on trade.

Asked about the European Central Bank's decision on Thursday to cut interest rates, Trump told CNBC that such devaluations were driving manufacturing and other jobs outside of the United States.

""We just sit back and do nothing,"" Trump said. ""That's getting to be very dangerous as far as I'm concerned.""

A more effective economic move than devaluations would be charging a tax on products made abroad and sold in the United States, particularly those from China, Trump said.

""China is the grand master of all,"" Trump said. ""I have great relationships and business relationships with China, and even those people say they can't believe what they're getting away with.""

Additionally, the front-runner for the Republican nomination in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election said that while he supports free trade if it is ""fair,"" the United States has been taken advantage of in negotiations.

Trump also said if elected president he would move quickly to stop corporate inversions - when a U.S. company acquires an overseas firm and reduces its tax bill by moving its headquarters to the purchased firm's location. Trump said he thinks corporate inversions cost the United States twice as much as estimated.

He said drugmaker Pfizer Inc and other companies that have recently left the country show ""there are things that are very structurally wrong with what we're doing.""

""I think it's $5 trillion, but I don't think our country has any idea what it is, but I think it's much more than $2.5 trillion,"" he said, referring to U.S. tax revenue lost when companies pull off corporate inversions.

Trump said Republicans and Democrats agree they want to halt such inversions, but ""they can't make a deal because they don't have leadership.""

""I could make a deal in 15 minutes by getting people in a room,"" Trump said. ""Everybody wants that money to come into the United States. ... It would be so easy.""

Regardless of the results and despite suggestions to the contrary in some media, it seems highly unlikely that Merkel will leave office before her third term as chancellor is up in 2017. But poor results for her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Sunday could increase pressure on her to adopt a tougher line on refugees and raise doubts about her prospects of running for a fourth term next year.

Below are five top things to watch for in the votes:

KLOECKNER VS DREYER

The election in Rhineland-Palatinate is probably the most important of all three for Merkel. Just a few weeks ago, the CDU candidate Julia Kloeckner looked like a shoo-in to seize control of the state after 25 years of Social Democrat (SPD) rule. But polls now show her running neck-and-neck with SPD incumbent Malu Dreyer. A charismatic former wine queen who has pushed for a harder line on refugees than the chancellor, Kloeckner is a rising star in the CDU and is seen as a possible successor to Merkel. A loss would be a devastating blow to her prospects and deepen anxiety within the CDU. By contrast, a Kloeckner win in this SPD stronghold would give her and the party a feel-good boost. The race between Kloeckner and Dreyer is a first: never before have two women battled each other to run a German state.

CRUMBLING STRONGHOLD

When the Greens won control of the CDU stronghold of Baden-Wuerttemberg in 2011 it was seen as a fluke, linked to the wave of anti-nuclear sentiment that followed the Fukushima disaster in Japan and the weakness of the CDU candidate at the time. But five years later, Winfried Kretschmann, the first Greens politician to lead a state government, remains popular and has come from behind to take a narrow poll lead over his CDU rival Guido Wolff. If Kretschmann comes out on top and the CDU is shut out of the state government again, it will be a setback for Merkel. CDU losses in both Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland Palatinate is a worst-case scenario for her.

ANTI-IMMMIGRANT SURGE

On an election evening with many uncertainties, one outcome seems sure: a surge in support for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The AfD is expected to deliver a record high result in Saxony-Anhalt where it is polling around 18 percent, roughly the same level as the SPD and far-left Linke party. But the big surprise is its strength in western Germany as a result of the refugee crisis. In Baden-Wuerttemberg it is polling around 12 percent and in the Rhineland close to 10 percent. Ironically, strong AfD scores are likely to help Merkels CDU by reducing the chances of left-wing majorities in the three states. But Merkel could also be blamed, if the AfD does well, for contributing to the rise of the far-right with her refugee policies. Although no other parties are prepared to cooperate with the AfD, the vote on Sunday is likely to establish them as a national force and give them substantial momentum heading into the federal vote next year, when they could enter the Bundestag for the first time.

SPD TRIPLE-WHAMMY

Although much of the focus ahead of the three votes has been on potential damage to Merkel, the biggest loser could end up being SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel, who also serves as vice chancellor and economy minister. The SPD could face a crushing triple-whammy on Sunday. In Baden-Wuerttemberg it is polling around 16 percent, well under its record-low result of 23 percent in 2011. In the Rhineland it could lose power after running the state for a quarter century. And in Saxony-Anhalt, it risks coming in fourth place in a state vote for the first time ever. Although top SPD officials are playing down the prospect that Gabriel will be ousted, even in this worst-case scenario, one cant rule out that he could throw in the towel himself. Possible replacements as SPD leader include Hamburg premier Olaf Scholz, Labour Minister Andrea Nahles and European Parliament President Martin Schulz.

VOTER FRAGMENTATION

For much of the post-war era there were just three main party groupings in German politics: the CDU/CSU, the SPD and the Free Democrats (FDP). Then came the Greens in the 1980s and the Linke in the aftermath of reunification. Now with the rise of the AfD, the number has risen to six. This fragmentation will be on display on Sunday like never before. In Baden-Wuerttemberg and Saxony-Anhalt, even so-called grand coalitions between Merkels conservatives and the SPD may not have majorities. This too would be a first.",[]

Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh made his comments after a series of ballistic missile tests conducted by guard units that drew international concern, including a call by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for new sanctions against Iran.

The tests, which state television said ended on Wednesday night, were seen as a challenge to a United Nations resolution and last year's nuclear accord with world powers under which Tehran agreed to curb its atomic program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions.

""Iran's missile program will not stop under any circumstances,"" Hajizadeh said. ""The IRGC has never accepted the U.N. Security Council resolutions on Iran's missile work.

""We are always ready to defend the country against any aggressor. Iran will not turn into Yemen, Iraq or Syria,"" he was quoted as saying by state television.

The Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) maintains an arsenal of dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles - the largest in the Middle East, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.

Tehran says its missile program is solely for defensive use with conventional, non-nuclear warheads.

Iran's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that the tests were not in violation of the nuclear agreement, which led to lifting of sanctions in January.

The Guards said the tests were aimed at displaying Iran's ""deterrent power and its ability to confront any threat"".

""Some of the missiles carried 24 warheads and one tonne of TNT,"" said Hajizadeh, who heads the Guard's aerospace division.

Hajizadeh said Iran had no intention of starting a war, ""but the Zionist regime (Israel) is our enemy and we don't trust American officials.""

""We have underground tunnels around the country and under mountains, where we store our missiles... These tunnels cannot be destroyed even if targeted by atomic bombs,"" he said.

State TV in October aired footage of long tunnels with ready-to-fire missiles on the back of trucks, saying the facility was one of hundreds of underground missile bases around the country.

The United States imposed sanctions against businesses and individuals in January over another missile test in October 2015. But Iranian officials have repeatedly expressed Tehran's determination to develop what it called Iran's defense capabilities.

The United States said on Wednesday it was aware of and reviewing reports of an additional Iranian ballistic missile test and that the administration would determine an appropriate response.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif about the missile tests, a State Department spokesman said.

But Iran's Students News Agency ISNA said on Thursday that Zarif and Kerry had not discussed the issue.

""John Kerry has sent emails to Zarif asking for a telephone call to discuss issues, including Iran's missile tests, but it did not happen because Zarif is on an official visit,"" ISNA quoted a source as saying.

Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp celebrates with Dejan Lovren and Emre Can at the end of the match. Reuters / Eddie Keogh

LONDON Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp stands on the brink of history ahead of their Europa League clash against Manchester United on Thursday, but it is an unwanted record the German coach is battling to avoid.

Never during the two sides' fierce 122-year rivalry have Liverpool lost five successive matches against United, but they stand on the brink of the unwanted milestone after four straight defeats.

Liverpool boss Klopp has only been in charge for one of those games, having joined the club in October, and feels recent history will not affect the outcome of Thursday's last 16 first-leg match.

The squad at his disposal, he says, is much stronger than the one he had in January for the most recent victory in United's run, a 1-0 win at Anfield.

""Manchester United have won the last four but it means nothing,"" Klopp told reporters on Wednesday.

""It would mean more if they had much more quality than us. But I think it is pretty close and we are both in a good moment...

""We are in a completely different situation (from the last game against United). We have more players available. We have to use this.""

The most dominant run in the rivalry currently belongs to Liverpool, who won five successive matches between 2000 and 2002.

United's current stranglehold over the fixture, however, has been overseen by their coach Louis van Gaal, a long-standing rival of Klopp's, stretching back to when the pair were in charge of Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund.

Bayern coach Van Gaal won the first two of their four meetings in Germany, before Klopp won the next two, including a 3-1 win in Munich, Dortmund's first Bundesliga victory there in two decades.

Both managers have come through difficult periods in recent weeks, with Liverpool winning their last three Premier League games and United notching up four victories in a row in all competitions before Sunday's defeat by West Bromwich Albion.

""A few weeks ago there was a lot of pressure on Van Gaal, but they came through well. A lot of teams dream about their problems,"" Klopp said.

""I don't believe in enemies in football. I don't have a problem with Louis van Gaal but the last thing I want in this game is that he wins,"" the German added.

The Financial Times' website and Twitter feeds were hacked May 17, 2013, renewing questions about whether the popular social media service has done enough to...

Dhaka Es hatte der vielleicht grote Bankraub aller Zeiten werden konnen: Fast eine Milliarde Dollar wollten Hacker der Zentralbank von Bangladesch entwenden.

Doch sie machten einen klitzekleinen Fehler - und ihr Vorhaben flog auf. Mageblich an der Aufdeckung des Betrugs beteiligt war die Deutsche Bank.

Nach Aussagen von hochrangigen Vertretern der Zentralbank geschah Folgendes: Unbekannte Cyberdiebe knackten die Sicherheitssysteme der Notenbank und kamen an die Zugangsdaten fur Zahlungsuberweisungen. Anfang Februar schlugen sie dann zu - an einem Wochenende, als die Zentralbank-Buros geschlossen waren. Sie wiesen den New Yorker Ableger der US-Notenbank (Fed), der fur die Kollegen in Bangladesch internationale Zahlungen abwickelt, zu einer Vielzahl von Transaktionen an. Das Geld sollte an private Einrichtungen auf den Philippinen und in Sri Lanka uberwiesen werden.

81 Millionen Dollar wurden auf diesem Wege transferiert. Weitere 850 bis 870 Millionen Dollar sollten folgen. Aber dann machten die Hacker einen Tippfehler bei der Uberweisung, die an eine Stiftung in Sri Lanka gehen sollte: Statt ""foundation"" schrieben sie ""fandation"". Dies veranlasste die fur die konkrete Abwicklung zustandige Deutsche Bank zu einer Nachfrage bei der Zentralbank Bangladeschs, die die Transaktion stoppte. Zur gleichen Zeit wurde die Notenbank auch von der Federal Reserve von New York alarmiert. Diese war hellhorig geworden, da die Zahl der Uberweisungsauftrage uberraschend hoch war und das Geld an private Empfanger gehen sollte statt an andere Banken. Soweit die Informationen aus Zentralbankkreisen in Bangladesch.

BANGLADESCH ERWAGT KLAGE GEGEN US-NOTENBANK

Die Notenbank hat nach eigener Auskunft einen Teil der gestohlenen 81 Millionen Dollar ausfindig gemacht. Aber der Fall ist zu einem Politikum geworden. Die Regierung wirft der New Yorker Fed vor, die Transaktionen zu spat gestoppt zu haben, und erwagt eine Schadenersatzklage.

Der Diebstahl wirft auch ein Schlaglicht auf die wachsende Gefahr von Hackerangriffen in der Bankenbranche. So gab die russische IT-Sicherheitsfirma Kaspersky Lab vergangenes Jahr bekannt, dass Cyberkriminelle innerhalb von zwei Jahren rund eine Milliarde Dollar von weltweit etwa hundert Geldhausern gestohlen hatten. Sie hatten sich Zugang zu internen Netzwerken verschafft und so Geldautomaten manipuliert.

Andere rekordverdachtige Bankplunderungen gingen nicht auf Hacker zuruck. Im Jahr 2003 erleichterte ein Sohn des fruheren irakischen Machthabers Saddam Hussein auf Gehei seines Vaters die heimische Zentralbank ebenfalls um eine Milliarde Dollar. 2007 erbeuteten Wachter einer Sicherheitsfirma in der irakischen Hauptstadt Bagdad 282 Millionen Dollar bei einem Bankraub.",[]

U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina March 9, 2016. Picture taken March 9, 2016.

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidates may find themselves in a more subdued debate than usual on Thursday night in Miami, since nothing Donald Trump's rivals have thrown at him has made a major dent in his front-running campaign.

After the histrionics of last week's gathering in Detroit, the four remaining candidates are likely to search for higher ground as they offer closing arguments to Republican voters, particularly those in Florida and Ohio, who vote next Tuesday in nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election.

The burden is particularly heavy on U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Governor John Kasich, who must do well in their home states or face pressure to exit the race.

While Kasich is holding his own against Trump in Ohio opinion polls, Rubio has lagged far behind Trump in Florida.

Trump's victories in Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii on Tuesday added to his momentum after a week of attacks by mainstream Republicans who are offended by his statements on Muslims, women and illegal immigrants and alarmed by his threats to international trade deals.

Trump defended his calls for a tougher U.S. stance on free trade on Thursday, saying the United States has been taken advantage of in negotiations with other countries. He also cited currency devaluations as a particular problem.

""I like free trade but you have to be represented by very, very good and smart and cunning people and we are not,"" Trump said in an interview on CNBC. ""Other countries are and that's why they're all taking advantage.""

The tough-talking billionaire businessman told CNN on Wednesday he expected the debate to be a ""nicer, softer, lighter debate, I hope."" But he added: ""I'll be ready. I'm the only one who can beat Hillary,"" a reference to Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton.

The tone could be set by Trump, 69, who forecast before several previous debates that he would take a more measured approach, only to quickly get into a verbal brawl with his rivals.

The CNN-hosted debate will be held at the University of Miami at 8:30 p.m. (0130 GMT on Friday).

""I would focus on a positive uplifting message that takes us back to why they're running for president and what's at stake in this election,"" said Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney.

In Detroit last Thursday, Trump came under sustained fire from Rubio, 44, over parts of his business empire such as Trump University, a now-defunct venture that critics said offered a flimsy education. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas piled on Trump over his past support for Democratic causes.

Trump blasted Rubio throughout the debate as a lightweight and Cruz as a liar.

'KIDS EMBARRASSED'

The Trump-Rubio debate clash in Detroit followed an abrupt change in Rubio's campaign to begin raising personal questions about Trump, such as saying he had small hands, a statement Trump saw as a reference to his penis size.

Rubio said he now regretted the personal insults.

""In terms of things that have to do with personal stuff, yeah, at the end of the day, it's not something I'm entirely proud of. My kids were embarrassed by it, and if I had to do it again, I wouldn't,"" Rubio told MSNBC on Wednesday.

Cruz, 45, who would like to knock Rubio and Kasich out of the race so he could draw more support from anti-Trump Republican voters, will seek to use the debate to position himself as the best Trump alternative.

""Trump is clearly trying to reach out and be a little more statesmanlike,"" said Cruz backer Saul Anuzis, a former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. ""Cruz is going to make the case as to why he can beat Trump and be the viable alternative. From our perspective, we think it's a two-man race, we're the only one with a path.""

Rubio is fighting for survival and is facing something of a last stand in Florida. Rival campaigns said Rubio may feel a need to return to the optimistic message he stuck to for months before getting sidetracked by Trump.

Rubio told Fox News on Wednesday the campaign was always going to come down to who wins Florida.

""The nominee has to win Florida. You cant be the Republican nominee if you dont win Florida,"" he said.

Kasich, Rubio and Cruz have one shot at denying Trump the nomination - preventing him from assembling the required 1,237 delegates to win the nomination outright, which would mean delegates would have to choose the nominee at their July 18-21 convention in Cleveland.

Trump said on CNN on Wednesday that 1,237 was an ""artificial number"" and that if he entered the convention with more delegates than his rivals, he should be the nominee.

While he has vowed to wage war against the party if he is denied the nomination at the convention, Kasich, 63, said it was possible for Republicans to have a contested convention and emerge united.

""Can you go to a convention and come out united? Absolutely,"" he told a Fox News town hall on Wednesday.

MUMBAI A group of Indian banks, seeking to recover more than $1 billion in loans from Kingfisher Airlines has taken possession of nine trademarks related to the defunct carrier as the mystery over the whereabouts of its chief, Vijay Mallya, deepens.

Mallya, who built his fortune with Kingfisher Beer and is a guarantor to the debt, left the country last week, a lawyer for the lenders told the Indian Supreme Court on Wednesday. The banks have asked the court to demand his return and to impound his passport.

The latest twist in Mallya's fortunes come as authorities are looking to make good on a pledge to clean up bank balance sheets, with the industry saddled by an estimated $120 billion in bad and troubled loans.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told parliament on Thursday that the lenders will take every possible action to recover the debt from Mallya and other defaulters.

""As far as the government is concerned, the clear instructions are that the banks must go all out to take every possible action,"" he said, adding that there were some cases of ""wilful default even bordering (on) fraud"".

Kingfisher stopped flying in October 2012, leaving creditors, suppliers and employees unpaid. It owed banks 90.91 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) at the end of November, Jaitley said.

Indian media believe that Mallya is in Britain and have reported that he could be staying in a luxury residence in Hertfordshire, north of London.

A spokesman for UB Group, Mallya's conglomerate, declined to comment on his whereabouts and the trademark seizure.

CREDITORS' ACTION

Separately, State Bank of India (SBI)(SBI.NS), the leader of Kingfisher's creditor banks, said in a statement that it had moved ""very promptly on taking the appropriate legal steps required to protect banks' interest and public money"".

SBI denied accusations in media reports that laxity on the part of the banks had helped Mallya to leave the country.

Mallya, who had billed himself as the ""King of Good Times"" living an extravagant life, has been called a wilful defaulter by some banks. He said over the weekend that the he had no intention of running away from Kingfisher's creditors and was in talks with them over a one-time settlement.

The trademarks seized include the ""Kingfisher"" label, ""Flying Models"" and ""Fly the Good Times"", according to a notice in newspapers by the banks' trustee, SBICAP Trustee Co.

Harish Bijoor, a brand consultant, described the banks' move as a knee-jerk reaction and said there might not be many takers for the trademarks.

""Who would ever want to run with a label called Kingfisher Airlines?"" Bijoor said, adding that he does not expect the move to affect India's best-selling beer, Kingfisher.

Kingfisher beer is made by United Breweries (UBBW.NS), which is part of Mallya's UB Group but now counts Heineken (HEIN.AS) as its biggest shareholder.

South Africa head to the tournament ranked as the third best team in the 20-over format and on the back of recent series wins in Bangladesh and, crucially, India.

Domingo believes they will be able to quickly put behind them the 2-1 home loss to Australia, confirmed on Wednesday with a six-wicket loss in Cape Town, which he didn't think diminished from an excellent 14 months for his side in the shortest format.

""We are all pretty chilled. I don't think there is a weight of expectation around our team or any of the teams because of the nature of the competition,"" he told reporters.

""You can't get too fancy, you can't get too funky. There is no magic wand to wave. The sides that do the basics really well in high-pressure games, they usually come out on top.""

South Africa have won nine of their last 12 completed Twenty20 matches and bar some debate over who should bat in the middle order, have a settled line-up, most of who are in form.

""We've got a chance,"" Domingo continued. ""We are one of the most consistent sides in this format and can go there very confident. We have prepared very well, we have some of the best players in the world and we've got a seriously good side. We'll be there and thereabouts.""

South Africas good form has been built around their ability to chase down scores and Domingo admits there is a concern over how they defend totals in tight situations.

DETROIT The growing popularity of car- and ride-sharing services such as Uber, Lyft and Zipcar will not put a crimp in U.S. vehicle sales any time soon, according to a survey released on Thursday.

Such services are primarily substitutes for taxis and rental cars and will have ""limited impact on current or future vehicle ownership,"" said KBB.com, a unit of Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc [COXET.UL] that provides financial and information services to car dealers and consumers.

The survey of more than 1,900 U.S. residents showed consumers still favored individual ownership because of such factors as safety, reliability and convenience, KBB said.

Nevertheless, traditional auto companies are forming alliances with the newcomers. Avis Budget Group (CAR.O) now owns Zipcar, and General Motors Co (GM.N) recently invested $500 million in Lyft. Other companies have created their own sharing service, notably Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) with Car2Go.

A farther-reaching study in late February, conducted by Boston Consulting Group, said the growth of car-sharing services would erode traditional manufacturers' vehicle sales and revenues through 2021 but would not be nearly as disruptive as the rise of self-driving cars later in the decade.

The KBB survey said the ride- and car-sharing services are used primarily by younger consumers and residents of large cities.

More than two-thirds of the respondents see ride-sharing services as ""a great way to combat drunk driving,"" KBB said.

The 31-year-old, who has risen from an under-privileged background to global superstardom, spends much of his down time in the United States with Hollywood and music A-listers.

From Super Bowl with Jay Z, to Hollywood parties and New York fashion shows, he is living a life that few of the current crop of drivers have access to or are up for.

German team mate Nico Rosberg, rival and championship runner-up for the past two seasons but winner of last year's final three races, is more likely to stay home with his wife and baby daughter.

Ferrari's four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel, a father of two who is likely to be Mercedes' biggest threat this year, lives in Switzerland where he keeps his family out of the public eye.

Both are fully focused on beating the Briton.

""It seems crazy to question whether Lewis can win another title, given that he's won the last two,"" former racer turned television pundit David Coulthard told British reporters.

""But you have to ask where his energy is going...There is no question that Lewis is fit and focused when he's at the racetrack. But he does have a full-on social life away from grand prix racing.

""We all know it's not easy jumping on and off aircraft. Is this the year that's going to take it's toll?""

That may be wishful thinking from someone who still represents Red Bull, the dominant team before Mercedes, but the Scot is not alone in expressing concern.

When Hamilton was at McLaren, where he won his first championship in 2008, he was kept on a tight leash but since he joined Mercedes in 2013 he has been allowed to be himself.

He now has more money than he knows what to do with, a collection of supercars, a house in Colorado, an apartment in Monte Carlo and a bright red private jet.

He has gone skiing with U.S. Olympic champion Lindsey Vonn and been filmed driving Justin Bieber around Beverley Hills in a LaFerrari supercar.

SOMEWHERE ELSE

""I feel I know him less today than I knew him 15 years ago,"" says former racer and Sky television commentator Martin Brundle. ""He's moved on to a new level and I don't say that in any way as a criticism.

""The Lewis I knew as a racer has moved into a whole sphere of life that I don't have access to, don't know and don't understand. He seems like he's gone somewhere else, to me.""

After completing huge amounts of mileage in the first pre-season test in Barcelona on the Thursday, Hamilton flew to Los Angeles for an Oscars party before testing resumed on Tuesday.

As his 2.5 million followers on Instagram are well aware, he then went to Paris where he was photographed with ex-Beatle Paul McCartney at Stella McCartney's fashion show. On Saturday, he was at Vivienne Westwood's.

If some traditionalists would rather he spent more time in the factory talking to engineers, which he also does, F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone is delighted and Hamilton sees no need to change anything.

""I try to find a balance in my life,"" the Briton, who also spends many hours making music in the recording studio, told the official formula1.com website last month.

""Sure, you need to be recharged and have full batteries for the season. And yes, the lifestyle that I live is definitely different to the other drivers. But who says that it has to be the way they are doing things?

""My style works perfectly for me. It's all about enjoying every moment. I move as much as I can...and do my job in the best way I can.""

Brundle echoed Coulthard's comments but felt sure Hamilton's relentless desire to win was as strong as ever.

Mercedes have won 32 of the last 38 grands prix and Hamilton accounts for 21 of them -- 10 in 2015 and 11 in 2014. A drop off in form at the end of last season came only after he had clinched his third championship in Texas.

""I believe he gave Rosberg a confidence and a self-belief that he didn't ought to be letting him have,"" said Brundle of those last three races.

""(But) I think that street-fighting Lewis will be a greater opposition (in Australia) than he was at the end of last year when he relaxed because the championship was in his pocket.""

reuters.com,2016-03-10 14:25:42+00:00,Revolutionary Guards commander says Iran's missile work will not stop: state TV,['Parisa Hafezi'],"ANKARA A senior Revolutionary Guards commander has said that Iran's ballistic missile program will not stop under any circumstances and that Tehran has missiles ready to be fired, according to Iranian state television.

Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh made his comments after a series of ballistic missile tests conducted by guard units that drew international concern, including a call by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for new sanctions against Iran.

The tests, which state television said ended on Wednesday night, were seen as a challenge to a United Nations resolution and last year's nuclear accord with world powers under which Tehran agreed to curb its atomic program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions.

""Iran's missile program will not stop under any circumstances,"" Hajizadeh said. ""The IRGC has never accepted the U.N. Security Council resolutions on Iran's missile work.

""We are always ready to defend the country against any aggressor. Iran will not turn into Yemen, Iraq or Syria,"" he was quoted as saying by state television.

The Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) maintains an arsenal of dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles - the largest in the Middle East, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.

Tehran says its missile program is solely for defensive use with conventional, non-nuclear warheads.

Iran's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that the tests were not in violation of the nuclear agreement, which led to lifting of sanctions in January.

The Guards said the tests were aimed at displaying Iran's ""deterrent power and its ability to confront any threat"".

""Some of the missiles carried 24 warheads and one tonne of TNT,"" said Hajizadeh, who heads the Guard's aerospace division.

Hajizadeh said Iran had no intention of starting a war, ""but the Zionist regime (Israel) is our enemy and we don't trust American officials.""

""We have underground tunnels around the country and under mountains, where we store our missiles... These tunnels cannot be destroyed even if targeted by atomic bombs,"" he said.

State TV in October aired footage of long tunnels with ready-to-fire missiles on the back of trucks, saying the facility was one of hundreds of underground missile bases around the country.

The United States imposed sanctions against businesses and individuals in January over another missile test in October 2015. But Iranian officials have repeatedly expressed Tehran's determination to develop what it called Iran's defense capabilities.

The United States said on Wednesday it was aware of and reviewing reports of an additional Iranian ballistic missile test and that the administration would determine an appropriate response.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif about the missile tests, a State Department spokesman said.

But Iran's Students News Agency ISNA said on Thursday that Zarif and Kerry had not discussed the issue.

""John Kerry has sent emails to Zarif asking for a telephone call to discuss issues, including Iran's missile tests, but it did not happen because Zarif is on an official visit,"" ISNA quoted a source as saying.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 11:58:36+00:00,Auto trade body lowers FY 2017 growth target on higher taxes,['Reuters Editorial'],"NEW DELHI India's auto trade body has lowered the growth estimate for passenger vehicle sales in the next fiscal year to 11 percent from an earlier forecast of 12 percent, after the government raised taxes on car sales last month.

In his annual federal budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley imposed a sales levy of up to 4 percent on new passenger vehicles aimed at helping fight air pollution and congestion, and a 1 percent luxury tax on cars priced higher than 1 million rupees ($14,916).

The higher taxes will be a dampener for passenger vehicle sales and there may be a retardation in growth, Sugato Sen, deputy director general at Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), told reporters on Thursday.

Sales growth could further fall to 9 percent if the monsoon rains are poor as that would hurt incomes and sentiment in rural areas, Sen added. Farmers depend heavily on monsoon rains to irrigate their land.

SIAM earlier estimated sales of passenger cars and utility vehicles to grow by as much as 12 percent in the fiscal year starting April 1, higher than the 8 percent growth estimated for the current year.

In February, passenger car sales fell 4.2 percent, the second consecutive monthly decline, lowering the overall growth outlook for the year to end-March.

Central executive committee member of the National League for Democracy U Htin Kyaw arrives for the opening of the new parliament in Naypyitaw February 1, 2016.

NAYPYITAW Myanmar's National League for Democracy (NLD) proposed a close friend of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi as its presidential candidate on Thursday, ending a four-month wait for the identity of the president expected to rule in her name.

The NLD nominated Htin Kyaw, who joined the party just two months ago, as its lower house candidate. Thanks to the party's crushing majority, that makes him near-certain to become titular head of the country's first democratically elected government since the army seized power in 1962 when the full parliament votes next week.

The wildly popular Suu Kyi and the NLD won a landslide electoral victory in November, but she is barred from holding the presidency herself under a junta-drafted 2008 constitution because her children are not Myanmar citizens.

Suu Kyi has said that she would run the country regardless through a proxy. Until Thursday, she and the NLD leadership had kept the identity of their nominee a closely guarded secret even from rank-and-file MPs.

Htin Kyaw runs a charity founded by Suu Kyi and has been a trusted member of her inner circle since the mid-1990s. He is not a lawmaker.

NLD central executive committee member Han Tha Myint confirmed to Reuters that Htin Kyaw was the party's preferred presidential candidate.

Suu Kyi told NLD lawmakers at a meeting after the nomination that she had considered the loyalty and discipline of Htin Kyaw and other candidates before making her choice.

""I believe the people will be happy about the results,"" she said. ""We'd like to form a government which is transparent.""

Candidates needed to be able to command the respect of both the domestic and international community, she added.

""I'm very happy,"" said lower house NLD lawmaker Myint Myint Soe. ""I believe our leader Aung San Suu Kyi chose the right people for these positions. I know U Htin Kyaw personally and I think he is a nice person.""

In an earlier statement, released before the nomination was revealed, Suu Kyi had urged patience from her supporters.

""The NLD is determined to meet people's expectations and will do its best,"" she said.

INDIRECT ELECTION

Under Myanmar's indirect system for electing a president, three candidates are nominated - one by the lower house, one by the upper house, and one by the military bloc in parliament, who under the constitution hold a quarter of seats in both houses.

After the candidates have been vetted by a parliamentary commission, both houses will come together to vote in a joint session, with the winner elected president and the two losing nominees becoming vice presidents.Suu Kyi told NLD lawmakers late on Thursday that the presidential vote would take place on March 15.

Because the NLD has a comfortable majority in both chambers it effectively controls two of the nominations.

The NLD nominated Henry Van Thio, a member of the Chin ethnic group from Chin state in the country's northwest bordering India and Bangladesh, as its candidate from the upper house.

The party wants Van Thio to become a vice president to represent the country's myriad ethnic minorities, said executive committee member Han Tha Myint.

That is in line with Suu Kyi's goal of forming a government for national reconciliation. She hopes to end conflict between state forces and numerous armed ethnic groups in the country.

""I am happy and honoured personally, as well as a Chin ethnic, to be selected to do the highest duty for our country,"" Van Thio said as he left parliament. ""We, the ethnic people, will do our best for every sector in the nation-building process.""

The military has yet to make its nomination public. Local media have named Thet Swe, a former navy chief who stepped down last year to run in the election representing the far flung Coco Islands, as one of the possible nominees. The armed forces bloc of MPs, who will make their nomination separately, were not present at the parliament building on Thursday.

The president picks the cabinet that will take over from President Thein Sein's outgoing government on April 1, with the exception of the heads of the home, defence and border security ministries who will be appointed by the armed forces chief.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 14:07:00+00:00,U.S. jobless claims hit five-month low as labor market strengthens,['Lucia Mutikani'],"WASHINGTON The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, hitting its lowest level since October, pointing to sustained strength in the labor market that should further dispel fears of a recession. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 259,000 for the week ended March 5, the lowest reading since mid-October, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The prior week's claims were revised to show 1,000 fewer applications received than previously reported.

Claims are being watched for any sign of labor market weakness following a recent massive stock market sell-off that caused financial market conditions to tighten amid fears the economy was heading into recession.

So far, the labor market remains on strong footing, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 242,000 jobs in February and the unemployment rate holding at an eight-year low of 4.9 percent.

The recession fears have also been soothed by strong consumer spending at the start of the year, as well as signs of some stabilization in the troubled manufacturing sector.

A tightening labor market and firming inflation could see the Federal Reserve gradually raising interest rates this year. The U.S. central bank hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.

The dollar rose against the euro following the European Central Bank's decision to lower key interest rates and expand its bond purchase program in an effort stimulate growth in the euro zone. U.S. Treasury debt prices were mixed, while U.S. stock index futures rallied.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims slipping to275,000 in the latest week. A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing last week's claims data and no states had been estimated.

Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with healthy labor market conditions, for a year - the longest run since the early 1970s. Last week's drop saw claims breaking outside their recent 262,000-294,000 range.

The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,500 to 267,500 last week, the lowest level since late October.

The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 32,000 to 2.23 million in the week ended Feb. 27. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims fell 4,500 to 2.25 million.

Berlin Die groe Koalition unter Kanzlerin Angela Merkel kann sich von den drei Landtagswahlen kommenden Sonntag keine substanziellen Erleichterungen im Bundesrat versprechen.

Das gilt selbst fur den hypothetisch gunstigsten Fall - wenn in Baden-Wurttemberg und Rheinland-Pfalz die CDU den Sprung aus der Opposition in die Landesregierungen in Form eines Bundnisses mit der SPD schafft und in Sachsen-Anhalt die groe Koalition bestatigt wird. Auch dann fehlt eine Stimme fur eine Mehrheit von Union- und SPD-regierten Landern: Derzeit kommt Schwarz-Rot unter Einbeziehung des CSU-dominierten Bayern auf 24 Stimmen in der Landerkammer. Baden-Wurttemberg und Rheinland-Pfalz konnten zwar zusammen zehn Stimmen beitragen. Die absolute Mehrheit im Bundesrat fangt jedoch erst bei 35 der insgesamt 69 Stimmen an.

Merkel wird also auch nach dem 13. Marz so oder so gezwungen sein, zustimmungspflichtige Gesetze weiterhin mit den Grunen abzustimmen. Derzeit ist sie auf die Hilfe von mindestens zwei grun mitregierten Landern angewiesen, um im Bundesrat eine Mehrheit zu organisieren. Die in zwei Landern mitregierende Linkspartei fallt als Verhandlungspartner fur die Kanzlerin so gut wie aus, da die politischen Differenzen wesentlich groer sind als mit den Grunen. Aber auch mit den Grunen ist es aus Sicht der CDU-Chefin nicht einfach. Das hat sich wiederholt in der Fluchtlingspolitik gezeigt. So gingen dem Ja des noch grun-rot regierten Baden-Wurttembergs zur Ausweitung der Liste der Staaten, deren Burger leichter abgeschoben werden konnen, langwierige Verhandlungen voraus.

AUCH ROT-GRUN VON BUNDESRATSMEHRHEIT WEIT ENTFERNT

Auch das rot-grune Lager ist von Mehrheiten im Bundesrat weit entfernt. Zwar konnten SPD und Grune rein rechnerisch eine absolute Mehrheit erlangen, wenn sie Baden-Wurttemberg und Rheinland-Pfalz halten sowie Sachsen-Anhalt dazu gewinnen. Die Landesregierungen von SPD und Grunen kommen derzeit auf 32 Stimmen. Mit den vier Stimmen Sachsen-Anhalts kamen sie auf eine absolute Mehrheit und konnten sogar Gesetzentwurfe beschlieen, mit denen sich dann Bundesregierung und Bundestag befassen mussen. Zieht man jedoch die jungsten Umfragen in Betracht, ist diese Variante auerst unwahrscheinlich. Nach ubereinstimmenden Erhebungen kommen die Grunen kaum uber funf Prozent sogar um den Wiedereinzug in den Magdeburger Landtag bangen. Auch die SPD schwachelt mit Werten zwischen 15,5 und 18 Prozent.

Vieles spricht dafur, dass die Konsens-Findung im Bundesrat eher noch schwieriger wird. Grund dafur ist, dass die wiedererstarkte FDP Chancen auf eine Regierungsbeteiligung in Baden-Wurttemberg und Rheinland-Pfalz hat. Im Sudwesten etwa es zu einer ""Deutschland-Koalition"" aus CDU, SPD und FDP kommen. In Rheinland-Pfalz ist eine neue Landesregierung unter Einschluss der FDP denkbar, wenn sich CDU und SPD nicht auf eine groe Koalition einigen. Damit ware Merkel gezwungen, mit der FDP einen weiteren Verhandlungspartner ins Kalkul zu ziehen, wenn sie Mehrheiten in der Landerkammer sondiert.

FDP KONNTE ZUM MACHTFAKTOR WERDEN

Dass die vergleichsweise unbedeutende FDP, die nicht im Bundestag vertreten ist, plotzlich zu einem Machtfaktor im Bundesratsgefuge werden konnte, liegt an den Regeln fur Abstimmungen. Die zustimmungspflichtigen Gesetze mussen mindestens 35 Ja-Stimmen bekommen, einfache Mehrheiten reichen nicht. Enthaltungen wirken in der Landerkammer wie Nein-Stimmen. In den Landesregierungen ist es aber gute Sitte, sich bei Bundesratsabstimmung zu enthalten, wenn zwischen den Koalitionspartnern kein Konsens hergestellt wird. Das kommt einem Veto-Recht auch des kleinsten Koalitionspartners gleich.

Der mutmaliche Gewinner der Landtagswahlen - die AfD - wird aller Voraussicht nach im Bundesrat keine Rolle spielen. Zwar werden den Rechtspopulisten enorme Stimmengewinne vorhergesagt. Bislang findet sich aber keine Partei, die mit ihnen ein Regierungsbundnis eingehen wurde.",[]

A document identifying supporters of Islamic State is seen in this still image from video, released by Sky News to Reuters in London on March 10, 2016.

LONDON A disillusioned former member of Islamic State has passed a stolen memory stick of documents identifying 22,000 supporters in over 50 countries to a British journalist, a leak that could help the West target Islamist fighters planning attacks.

Leaks of such detailed information about Islamic State are rare and give Britain's spies a potential trove of data that could help unmask militants who have threatened more attacks like those that killed 130 people in Paris last November.

A man calling himself Abu Hamed, a former member of Islamic State who became disillusioned with its leaders, passed the files to Britain's Sky News on a memory stick he said he had stolen from the head of the group's internal security force.

On it were enrolment forms containing the names of Islamic State supporters and of their relatives, telephone numbers, and other details such as the subjects' areas of expertise and who had recommended them.

One of the files, marked ""Martyrs"", detailed a group of IS members who were willing and trained to carry out suicide attacks, Sky said.

Richard Barrett, a former head of global counter-terrorism at Britain's MI6 Secret Intelligence Service, said the cache was ""a fantastic coup"" in the fight against Islamic State.

""It will be an absolute goldmine of information of enormous significance and interest to very many people, particularly the security and intelligence services,"" Barrett told Sky News.

Sky said it had informed the British authorities about the documents which were passed to its correspondent, Stuart Ramsay, at an undisclosed location in Turkey.

Western security sources said that if genuine, the files could be gold dust as they could help identify potential attackers and the networks of sympathisers behind them, and give insight on the structure of the group.

Reuters was not able to independently verify the documents, given their provenance. A selection of them was published in Arabic.

Islamic State militants claimed responsibility for the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris and the Oct. 31 downing of a Russian passenger plane over Egypt's Sinai region that killed 224. They have promised more attacks on the West and Russia.

SUICIDE BOMBERS

Western leaders say Islamic State, which has proclaimed a caliphate in the parts of Syria and Iraq it controls, now poses a greater danger to the West than al Qaeda. It uses a militant interpretation of Islam to justify attacks on its foes and the use of extreme violence, including rape and beheadings, against those it sees as infidels.

The defector, a former Free Syrian Army fighter who switched to Islamic State, said the group had been taken over by former soldiers from the Iraqi Baath party of Saddam Hussein, who was ousted in 2003 after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.

Some of the defector's Arabic documents, posted on the Zaman Al Wasl Syrian news website, were forms issued by ""Islamic State in Iraq and Sham, the General Directorate of Borders"" and displayed personal details of each fighter, according to a review of some of the documents by Reuters.

The forms included answers to 23 questions such as assumed name, birthplace, education level, extent of Sharia learning and previous jobs, as well as details about the individuals' journey to Islamic State and whether they were potential suicide bombers or more traditional fighters.

When asked for his view of the documents, Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at London's Royal United Services Institute, said in an emailed response: ""It seems a bit dated.""

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday blasted currency devaluations around the world for hurting the U.S. economy and costing American jobs, and defended his calls for a tougher U.S. stance on trade.

Asked about the European Central Bank's decision on Thursday to cut interest rates, Trump told CNBC that such devaluations were driving manufacturing and other jobs outside of the United States.

""We just sit back and do nothing,"" Trump said. ""That's getting to be very dangerous as far as I'm concerned.""

A more effective economic move than devaluations would be charging a tax on products made abroad and sold in the United States, particularly those from China, Trump said.

""China is the grand master of all,"" Trump said. ""I have great relationships and business relationships with China, and even those people say they can't believe what they're getting away with.""

Additionally, the front-runner for the Republican nomination in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election said that while he supports free trade if it is ""fair,"" the United States has been taken advantage of in negotiations.

Trump also said if elected president he would move quickly to stop corporate inversions - when a U.S. company acquires an overseas firm and reduces its tax bill by moving its headquarters to the purchased firm's location. Trump said he thinks corporate inversions cost the United States twice as much as estimated.

He said drugmaker Pfizer Inc and other companies that have recently left the country show ""there are things that are very structurally wrong with what we're doing.""

""I think it's $5 trillion, but I don't think our country has any idea what it is, but I think it's much more than $2.5 trillion,"" he said, referring to U.S. tax revenue lost when companies pull off corporate inversions.

Trump said Republicans and Democrats agree they want to halt such inversions, but ""they can't make a deal because they don't have leadership.""

""I could make a deal in 15 minutes by getting people in a room,"" Trump said. ""Everybody wants that money to come into the United States. ... It would be so easy.""

A document identifying supporters of Islamic State is seen in this still image from video, released by Sky News to Reuters in London on March 10, 2016.

LONDON A disillusioned former member of Islamic State has passed a stolen memory stick of documents identifying 22,000 supporters in over 50 countries to a British journalist, a leak that could help the West target Islamist fighters planning attacks.

Leaks of such detailed information about Islamic State are rare and give Britain's spies a potential trove of data that could help unmask militants who have threatened more attacks like those that killed 130 people in Paris last November.

A man calling himself Abu Hamed, a former member of Islamic State who became disillusioned with its leaders, passed the files to Britain's Sky News on a memory stick he said he had stolen from the head of the group's internal security force.

On it were enrolment forms containing the names of Islamic State supporters and of their relatives, telephone numbers, and other details such as the subjects' areas of expertise and who had recommended them.

One of the files, marked ""Martyrs"", detailed a group of IS members who were willing and trained to carry out suicide attacks, Sky said.

Richard Barrett, a former head of global counter-terrorism at Britain's MI6 Secret Intelligence Service, said the cache was ""a fantastic coup"" in the fight against Islamic State.

""It will be an absolute goldmine of information of enormous significance and interest to very many people, particularly the security and intelligence services,"" Barrett told Sky News.

Sky said it had informed the British authorities about the documents which were passed to its correspondent, Stuart Ramsay, at an undisclosed location in Turkey.

Western security sources said that if genuine, the files could be gold dust as they could help identify potential attackers and the networks of sympathisers behind them, and give insight on the structure of the group.

Reuters was not able to independently verify the documents, given their provenance. A selection of them was published in Arabic.

Islamic State militants claimed responsibility for the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris and the Oct. 31 downing of a Russian passenger plane over Egypt's Sinai region that killed 224. They have promised more attacks on the West and Russia.

SUICIDE BOMBERS

Western leaders say Islamic State, which has proclaimed a caliphate in the parts of Syria and Iraq it controls, now poses a greater danger to the West than al Qaeda. It uses a militant interpretation of Islam to justify attacks on its foes and the use of extreme violence, including rape and beheadings, against those it sees as infidels.

The defector, a former Free Syrian Army fighter who switched to Islamic State, said the group had been taken over by former soldiers from the Iraqi Baath party of Saddam Hussein, who was ousted in 2003 after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.

Some of the defector's Arabic documents, posted on the Zaman Al Wasl Syrian news website, were forms issued by ""Islamic State in Iraq and Sham, the General Directorate of Borders"" and displayed personal details of each fighter, according to a review of some of the documents by Reuters.

The forms included answers to 23 questions such as assumed name, birthplace, education level, extent of Sharia learning and previous jobs, as well as details about the individuals' journey to Islamic State and whether they were potential suicide bombers or more traditional fighters.

When asked for his view of the documents, Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at London's Royal United Services Institute, said in an emailed response: ""It seems a bit dated.""

""Very interesting though and a real gift for researchers into understanding the group more,"" he added. ""The key for me in many ways is how this highlights the bureaucracy of the organisation once again - kinda like al Qaeda in fact.""

LONDON A UK decision to leave the European Union would deprive the EU of one of its best-rated members, leaving the bloc and its investment bank vulnerable to credit rating downgrade.

While ratings agencies have warned a vote to leave could hurt the UK's rating, a Brexit could also have consequences for institutions which Britain supports via its EU membership.

Britain accounts for some 16 percent of the EU's nominal gross domestic product, makes a net annual budget contribution of about 6.5 billion euros ($7.2 billion) and is among the highest-rated of the EU's 28 members.

It is rated AAA by S&P, Aa1 by Moody's and AA+ by Fitch.

""European entities which would be most affected in the case of Brexit are the European Union itself, with a risk of being downgraded, and the European Investment Bank (EIB),"" said Societe Generale strategist Cristina Costa in a note.

The EU, which has about 54 billion euros in outstanding bonds, is rated AAA by Fitch, Moody's and DBRS and AA+ with a negative outlook by Standard & Poor's.

Since the agencies have stressed the average weighted ratings in their approach to supranational borrowers, a British departure could weigh on the ratings of the EU and the EIB, analysts said.

No comment was immediately available from the EU.

There would be no immediate rating impact from Britain leaving the EU on any of the bloc's other members, Moody's said on Thursday.

WATCH OUT

Analysts say the EIB is especially at risk from a potential Brexit because while the EU and the EIB have similar memberships, they have different structures with regards to financing from its shareholders.

Unlike the EU, the EIB operates like a bank, so has its own capital base - about 243 billion euros, according to its latest financial report. The EIB is also able to tap additional funds known as callable capital, which is almost 222 billion euros.

Because ownership of the EIB is concentrated in the region's five largest economies, its profile would weaken if the UK left, analysts said.

The UK has a 16.1 percent share of the EIB's capital, similar to that of Germany, France and Italy, as this graphic shows tmsnrt.rs/1LT8zHX

While other member states would probably pick up a reduced UK share, the uncertainty could weigh on EIB bonds.

According to SocGen, the loss of Britain as a shareholder would lower the share of high-rated EIB backers to roughly 60 percent from 66 percent.

An EIB source told Reuters there was no automatic consequence of a Brexit on the EIB's AAA rating.

""If it were to materialize, the EIB would closely monitor any potential impact ... and would consider how best to address such a situation and reassure the markets in due course,"" the source said.

Commerzbank rates strategist Rainer Guntermann said any Brexit downgrade to the EIB's ratings could have implications for bond investors.

""Regulation-driven investors in the insurance sector, even if not forced to, prefer to hold triple A-rated paper such as from the German government, EIB or German agencies,"" he said. ""There would be a significant impact if the EIB rating were to slide just one notch.""

The gap between EIB bond yields and the European agency benchmark, KfW, has been tight with the five-year yield spread at about 6-8 basis points.

As the June 23 vote approaches, SocGen and Commerzbank anticipate wider spreads.

SocGen's Costa said spreads could widen by at least five to 10 bps even with support from the ECB's bond-buying program.

Other institutions such as the European Stability Mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, were not expected to take a direct hit.

Checkpoints south of Misrata are manned by brigades from the city. The Abu Grain checkpoint, about 140 km (85 miles) west of Sirte, was attacked in the late afternoon, hours after the air strikes, raising the possibility that it was a retaliatory move.

There was no immediate confirmation from officials in Misrata, but forces from the city regularly carry out air strikes on Sirte.

Abu Grain is on the road between Misrata and Sirte, where militants loyal to Islamic State took control last year. The militants withdrew after the attack and the situation was under control, the military source said.

War planes, believed to be from Misrata, carried out air strikes at three different sites in Sirte, including near a water plant - where the children were killed - and close to a hotel complex in the city center, the resident said.

Also on Wednesday, a source from Zintan said forces from the town clashed with suspected Islamic State militants who had briefly taken control of a major road about 320 km west of Sirte and 200 km south of the capital, Tripoli.

One member of the Zintan forces was injured before the militants retreated, the source said.

Islamic State has taken advantage of political and a security vacuum in Libya to establish a foothold in the north African country, carrying out attacks on cities and against oil installations.

The European Union's main economic sanctions against Russia, targeting its energy, banking and defense sectors, expire in July this year and many EU governments want to renew them until Russia upholds its part of a peace settlement in Ukraine.

However, a decision needs consensus and some countries closer to Russia, including Hungary and Greece, have yet to decide whether they will support a sanctions extension.

Curry (three) and Thompson (five) combined for eight three-pointers in the game, giving them an even 500 for the season as the Warriors (57-6) won their 27th in a row at home this season and 46th straight at Oracle Arena dating back to last January.

The overall home winning streak is an ongoing NBA record.

Curry finished with 12 points but Thompson poured in 23, Draymond Green had 17 and center Marreese Speights came off the bench to provide an additional 16, helping Golden State clinch a season-series win over the Jazz with a third consecutive win.

Despite playing for a second consecutive night, Utah (29-35) hung tight for the first 23 minutes before Golden State's last-minute flurry in the first half created the game's first double-digit margin.

Curry, who entered the game having made at least one three-pointer in a record 132 straight games, missed his first four attempts from beyond the arc until finally connecting nearly 21 minutes into the game.

Meanwhile, the Warriors struggled to retain a 43-41 lead into the final minute of the first half before Curry connected from 26 feet and Thompson from 29 feet in a six-point flurry that quickly ballooned the lead to eight.

After Joe Ingles missed a three-point attempt at the Utah end with 6.2 seconds left in the half, Curry grabbed the rebound, headed toward midcourt and let fly with from just beyond the line.

The shot banked in, sending the home crowd into a frenzy and capped the 9-0 run that produced a 52-41 advantage.

The Warriors went on to earn a 10th win in their past 11 meetings with the Jazz, but it was a struggle for the better part of three quarters.

In fact, the frustration of their early difficulties boiled over into technical fouls on Andrew Bogut, Curry and Andre Iguodala.

Golden State finally put the Jazz at arm's length with another quarter-ending run, this one in the third period.

Utah was within 68-59 before Warriors backup guard Leandro Barbosa had seven points and Speights five in a 13-4 spurt to close the third quarter and create an 18-point cushion entering the final period.

Backup guard Trey Burke hit eight straight free throws to highlight an 18-point night for the Jazz, who have lost seven of eight after a 28-28 start.

Utah fell three games behind the Houston Rockets (32-32) in the race for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.

Gordon Hayward added 16 points, but missed 10 of his 15 shots as the Jazz shot just 40.5 percent from the field. The Warriors, meanwhile, connected at a 57.1 percent clip.

Discount retailer Dollar General Corp (DG.N) reported a higher-than-expected growth in quarterly sales at established stores as demand increased for items such as candy and snacks, perishables, tobacco and food.

Low gas prices and improving wage growth are supporting a recovery in spending by low-income Americans, Dollar General's main customer group.

The company's shares rose nearly 5 percent in premarket trading on Thursday.

Dollar General also said it planned to open about 900 stores in the year ending January 2017. The company opened 730 stores in fiscal 2015.

Sales at stores open at least 13 months rose 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter as more customers walked into its outlets and spent more per transaction. Analysts on average had expected a growth of 1.9 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.

""Growth in the non-consumable category was broad-based, with notable strength across seasonal and home, offset by a modest decline in apparel,"" the company said.

Dollar General's net income rose about 6 percent to $376.2 million, or $1.30 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.26 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

In contrast, bigger rival Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR.O) reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit this month, hurt by a strong dollar and challenging economic conditions.

Dollar General's net sales increased 7 percent to $5.29 billion in the quarter ended Jan. 29, but came slightly below the average estimate of $5.30 billion.

The company, which Dollar Tree dethroned as the biggest U.S. discount store operator by buying Family Dollar last year, also said it planned to buy back about $1 billion in shares in fiscal 2016.

Dollar General's shares were trading at $78.75 before the bell.

Republican U.S. presidential candidate Marco Rubio and rival candidate Donald Trump (R) speak simultaneously at the U.S. Republican presidential candidates debate in Detroit, Michigan, March 3, 2016.

Republican U.S. presidential candidate Marco Rubio talks with Fox News Channel anchor Megyn Kelly during an interview at a campaign rally in Miami, Florida, March 9, 2016.

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio voiced regret on Wednesday about making personal attacks against front-runner Donald Trump, a strategy that has failed to slow the New York billionaire's momentum.Rubio, Trump, Ohio Governor John Kasich and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the four remaining Republican presidential candidates, participated in a round of Fox News-sponsored town hall events a day before they meet for another debate on Thursday in Miami.

Rubio, whose campaign is fighting for survival after a series of disappointing performances in nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election, has drawn fire for a line of attack in recent weeks in which he got personal with Trump.

He called him a con artist and said among other things that he had small hands, a charge that Trump took to mean as questioning the size of his manhood.

Until Rubio got personal, the U.S. senator from Florida had largely stayed above the fray and had focused his assault on Trump from a policy standpoint.

He told Fox News' ""The Kelly File"" that if he had to do it over again, he would handle the issue differently.

""My kids were embarrassed by it. My wife didnt like it. I dont think it reflects good. Thats not who I am. Thats not what my campaign is going to be about or will ever be about again,"" Rubio said.

""Id do it differently  on the personal stuff. Im not telling you he didnt deserve it, but thats not who I am and thats not what I want to be,"" he added.

Rubio, 44, fared poorly when Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho and Hawaii voted on Tuesday. He needs to win his home state of Florida next Tuesday or face calls for him to exit the race.

He said opinion polls showing him lagging far behind Trump in Florida were not accurate.

""The fact of the matter is the only poll that counts is the one theyll take on Tuesday when they count the votes that these people are going to cast and were going to win in Florida, he said.

Cruz, 45, looking to emerge as the main Trump alternative should Rubio and Kasich falter, said he would keep the focus of the campaign on substantive issues.

""I don't have any views on Donald Trump's anatomy,"" Cruz said at his Fox News town hall.

BROKERED CONVENTION?

Kasich, at his Fox News town hall, said he believed he had a path forward if he wins his home state of Ohio on Tuesday, but that it involved a convention fight when Republicans gather to officially pick their nominee in Cleveland in July.

A contested convention would result if Trump, 69, does not win the required 1,237 delegates, forcing delegates to decide whether to back him at the convention or find a consensus candidate such as Kasich, 63.

President Gerald Ford and challenger Ronald Reagan staged a spirited nomination fight at the 1976 Republican National Convention, but no Republican convention has gone beyond a single ballot since Thomas Dewey's third-ballot win in 1948.

Trump, who has come under withering attack by mainstream Republicans for his statements on Muslims, illegal immigrants and trade policy, said at his Fox News town hall he had attracted many new voters to the Republican Party with his crossover appeal.

He said establishment Republicans would be risking the energy he had brought to the race by trying to prevent him from winning.

""They would be so foolish to throw it away,"" he told host Sean Hannity.

UN vehicles form a line during a visit by members of the UN Security Council at the airport in Timbuktu, Mali, March 5, 2016. Picture taken March 5, 2016.

DAKAR The African Union will send a mission to northern Mali in the next few weeks to look into setting up a counter-terrorism force to support vulnerable U.N. peacekeepers, sources familiar with the matter said.

The Bamako government, as well as some officials of the U.N. force in Mali, MINUSMA, have called for more help in fighting al Qaeda-linked insurgents, who have become increasingly active despite the efforts of French, Malian and U.N. troops.

French forces drove the jihadists out of northern Malian cities in 2013 but they have regrouped, and in November al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb attacked a luxury hotel in Bamako, killing 20 people in a demonstration of their ability to strike beyond their desert bases.

Critics say the 10,000-strong U.N. force's ability to bring peace to Mali is hamstrung by its lack of an aggressive counter-terrorism mandate, meaning it cannot hunt down militants and is vulnerable to attack.

At least 20 Malian and U.N. troops from Africa have been killed this year, according to Reuters estimates.

While an expansion of the U.N. mandate was discussed during a Security Council visit to Mali last week, some permanent members such as France say it is already sufficiently robust, although they back additional resources for the force.

The AU initiative is being floated as an alternative route to improved security, the sources say.

""There is an (AU) mission to assess the security threats in northern Mali in the next few weeks,"" said one security source familiar with the visit who is not authorized to speak publicly.

""This will allow the development of a plan for an international force in the fight against terrorism,"" he added, saying the AU planned to seek U.N. and Malian backing.

A Western diplomat said the force's remit would be similar to an existing AU regional task force set up last year to fight jihadist group Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin.

Planning is at an early stage and details of troop numbers and financing have not yet been determined, the sources said.

AU officials at the continental body's headquarters in Addis Ababa could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for the Malian defense ministry declined to comment.

Army spokesman Colonel Souleymane Maiga said: ""I know that there have been recent meetings on a possible rapid intervention force but the form this force will take has not yet been decided as far as I know.""

Besides funding, one of the difficulties might be harmonizing security initiatives in a region where neighbors have a history of vying for influence, the sources added.

The Group of Five Sahel (G5 Sahel) - Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali and Mauritania - have also agreed to create EU-backed regional rapid reaction forces to counter Islamist militants.

G5 Sahel permanent secretary Najim Elhadj Mohamed said he had not been informed of the AU initiative and it was not clear if the two bodies would cooperate.

Mali's northern neighbor Algeria set up a joint military operations center for Sahel countries in 2010 but there have been few signs of progress on the ground.

Some security experts say more support is needed to fight jihadists in Mali since France's 3,500-strong Barkhane force is overstretched. The Chad-based force was set up to combat Islamists across West Africa's vast Sahel region.

""A bigger contribution from African forces could take the pressure off the French, who could focus more on securing borders and on ISIS (Islamic State) in Libya,"" said Rida Lyammouri, an independent consultant focused on the Sahel and north Africa.

""But to succeed (the AU force) would have to match the violent extremist organizations in terms of their outreach to local communities in Mali,"" he added.

However, he said there was still discussion of whether U.S. taxpayer funds could be used to finance the purchase.

President Barack Obama's administration announced on Feb. 12 that it had approved the sale of the Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) aircraft as well as radars and other equipment to Pakistan.

It drew immediate criticism from India and concern from some members of Congress.

Republican Senator Rand Paul in late February invoked legislation known as the Arms Export Control Act in the hope of stopping the sale by passing a Resolution of Disapproval, calling Pakistan ""an uncertain ally.""

Cardin told reporters he opposed Paul's resolution and expected it would fail, with the chamber's Republican and Democratic leaders opposing it. The measure could be taken up by the Senate as soon as Thursday.

Cardin said lawmakers had concerns about Pakistan's nuclear program, commitment to fighting terrorist organizations and cooperation in the Afghanistan peace process but generally supported the sale.

""It was not controversial that Pakistan needs to modernize its air force and its counter insurgency and counter-terrorism activities, particularly in the mountainous territory of the border with Afghanistan,"" he said.

Congress is currently considering a request to ""reprogram"" some funds, in other words, use them for a different purpose than allocated in a budget bill, to help finance the deal.

Cardin said he was not yet prepared to make a judgment on whether U.S. taxpayer funds should be used to help Pakistan with the purchase.

The European Central Bank cut interest rates and expanded its quantitative easing asset-buying programme on Thursday to boost the...

Frankfurt Im Kampf gegen die chronische Wachstumsschwache und die Mini-Inflation im Euro-Raum greift die EZB zu drastischen Manahmen.

So wird erstmals der Schlusselzins fur die Versorgung der Geschaftsbanken mit Notenbankgeld auf null Prozent von bislang 0,05 Prozent gesenkt, wie die Europaische Zentralbank (EZB) am Donnerstag mitteilte. Auerdem stocken die Wahrungshuter ab April ihre vor allem in Deutschland umstrittenen Anleihenkaufe auf monatlich 80 von bisher 60 Milliarden Euro auf. Auch Unternehmensanleihen werden kunftig aufgekauft. Insgesamt erhoht sich damit der Umfang des Programms auf 1,74 Billionen Euro. Bisher waren es 1,5 Billionen Euro. Banken mussen zudem kunftig einen hoheren Strafzins zahlen, wenn sie uber Nacht Geld bei der Notenbank parken. Als Ausgleich winken ihnen besonders gunstige langerfristige Kreditlinien.

Die Beschlusse losten an den Borsen heftige Reaktionen aus: Der Euro verbilligte sich zeitweise um mehr als einen US-Cent auf 1,0836 Dollar. Anschlieend stieg er aber wieder uber die Marke von 1,10 Dollar. Der Dax kletterte zeitweise um bis zu 2,7 Prozent auf ein Zweimonatshoch von 9989 Punkten, gab danach aber einen Teil der Gewinne wieder ab.

""Mit dem heutigen umfassenden Paket geldpolitischer Entscheidungen liefern wir erhebliche Anreize, um den erhohten Risiken fur das EZB-Preisstabilitatsziel entgegenzuwirken"", erklarte Draghi. ""Die Zinsen werden fur eine sehr lange Zeit niedrig bleiben."" Die Wahrungshuter streben eine Inflationsrate von knapp zwei Prozent an, was sie als ideal fur die Wirtschaft erachten. Davon sind sie aber momentan sehr weit entfernt. Im Februar waren die Preise im Wahrungsraum wegen des Olpreisverfalls sogar um 0,2 Prozent gesunken.

""Wegen der Olpreisentwicklung sind sehr niedrige oder sogar negative Inflationsraten in den kommenden Monaten unvermeidlich"", raumte Draghi ein. Die Verbraucherpreise werden nach den neuen Prognosen der EZB-Experten in diesem Jahr voraussichtlich nur um durchschnittlich 0,1 Prozent steigen. Noch im Dezember waren sie von 1,0 Prozent ausgegangen. Auf breiter Front fallende Preise gelten als gefahrlich, weil sich Konsumenten dann zuruckgehalten - in der Erwartung, Produkte bald noch gunstiger zu bekommen. Unternehmen verdienen dann weniger und schieben Investitionen auf. So entsteht eine Abwartsspirale.

Geschaftsbanken mussen kunftig mit einem negativen Einlagensatz von 0,4 Prozent zurechtkommen. Zuvor lag dieser bei minus 0,3 Prozent. Die Institute mussen nun also eine hohere Strafe zahlen, wenn sie Geld bei der EZB horten. Damit will die Notenbank die Kreditvergabe ankurbeln, die zuletzt kaum in Schwung kam. Mit negativen Auswirkungen fur die Geldhauser durch die scharferen Strafzinsen rechnet Draghi nicht. Er kundigte zudem an, dass die EZB vier langerfristige, besonders gunstige Kreditlinien fur die Banken auflegen wird. Diese sogenannten TLTRO-Geschafte haben eine Laufzeit von vier Jahren. Sie sollen im Juni 2016 starten.",[]

DUBAI/LONDON A meeting between oil producers to discuss a global pact on freezing production is unlikely to take place in Russia on March 20, sources familiar with the matter say, as OPEC member Iran is yet to say whether it would participate in such a deal.

OPEC officials including Nigeria's oil minister have said a meeting would take place in Moscow on that date, potentially as the next step in widening an agreement to freeze output at January levels struck by OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Qatar plus non-member Russia last month.

But the biggest roadblock to a wider deal, OPEC delegates say, is Iran. Tehran feels it should be exempt from the agreement as it wants to recover market share it lost under Western sanctions. Kuwait said on Tuesday it will commit to the deal - if all major producers including Iran do so.

""They are not agreeing on the meeting. Why would the ministers meet again now? Iran says they will not do anything,"" said an OPEC source from a major producer. ""Only if Iran agrees, things will change.""

The pact on freezing output has helped support oil prices, which started a slide in mid-2014 due to oversupply. Brent crude LCOc1 was trading above $40 a barrel on Thursday, up 50 percent from a 12-year low of $27.10 reached in January.

Some delegates are wary that if many oil producers met too soon before getting the nod from everyone, prices could weaken again if the talks ended in disarray.

""Our view is not to go there with the possibility of no agreement so as not to affect prices negatively,"" said another source from a major OPEC member, referring to the proposed March 20 meeting.

OPEC's Gulf members favor meeting in the first half of April, in Doha or another Gulf city, a Gulf delegate said last week.

Another OPEC delegate was more pessimistic, saying he expected no major progress until OPEC's next scheduled meeting in June.

IRAN COMPROMISE?

Tehran has rejected freezing its output at January levels, put by OPEC secondary sources at 2.93 million barrels per day (bpd), and wants to return to much higher pre-sanctions production.

""Tehran wanted a freeze ... for them to be based on 4 million barrels per day, their pre-sanctions production figure,"" said one source familiar with the discussions. A source familiar with Iranian thinking agreed.

The issue is set to be discussed when Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak meets Iranian counterpart Bijan Zanganeh. Novak is visiting Tehran on Monday, RIA news agency reported, citing the Russian embassy in Iran.

Some OPEC sources hinted that there could be a workable agreement on the table to get Tehran on board.

""If they are willing to find a solution, they should offer a fair deal to Iran,"" one said.

There are precedents for OPEC members to be exempt from agreements on output restraint. Iraq, for example, was not included for many years due to sanctions and war.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 10:42:02+00:00,Opera becomes first big browser maker with built-in ad-blocker,['Eric Auchard'],"FRANKFURT Norwegian company Opera is introducing a new version of its desktop computer browser that promises to load web pages faster by incorporating ad-blocking, a move that makes reining in advertising a basic feature instead of an afterthought.

Faster loading, increased privacy and security and a desire for fewer distractions are behind the growing demand for ad-blockers.

However, their popularity is cutting into the growth of online marketing for site publishers and corporate brands, who rely on reaching web and mobile users to pay for their content rather than restricting access to paid subscribers.

Opera has a history of introducing innovations that later become common in major browsers such as tabbed browsing and pop-up blocking, which helped users control an earlier generation of in-your-face ads and malware disguised as advertising.

""Ad-blocking technology is an opportunity and a wake-up call to the advertising industry to pay attention to what consumers are actually saying,"" an Opera spokeswoman said.

Opera said it can cut page-loading times by as much as 90 percent by eliminating the complex dance that occurs behind the scenes in a user's browser as various third-party ad networks deliver promotional messages to users.

The Norwegian company, which has agreed to a takeover by a group of Chinese firms led by Beijing Kunlun Tech in a cash deal valued at $1.23 billion, introduced its first computer web browser in 1995.

With the rise of the smartphone, it shifted to focus on the mobile browser and advertising market, where it now derives most of its revenue and counts 281 million users.

Opera said on Thursday it was introducing a version of its browser aimed at software developers and early adopters, but will eventually offer the feature for both computers and phones.

The Oslo-based firm ranks a distant fifth behind more mainstream desktop computers browsers from Microsoft, Google, Firefox and Apple. The company counts 60 million active monthly desktop users worldwide.

Opera sees no contradiction in the fact that it relies on advertising for a big chunk of its own revenue but is introducing ad-blocking control features in its products. Demand for ad-blocking should abate when messages became less disruptive and more relevant, an Opera spokeswoman said.

Because it is building the features directly into its browser, page delivery times are 40 percent faster than existing ad-blocker plug-ins, or browser extensions, it said. Top plug-in providers include AdBlock, AdMuncher and Ghostery that run on top of existing browsers.

A study published by PageFair and Adobe estimated online ad revenue lost to blockers in 2015 would amount to $21.8 billion and those losses could almost double to $41.4 billion in 2016. Ad-placement firm Carat forecasts global digital and mobile advertising will near $150 billion this year.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) logo is seen before the FCC Net Neutrality hearing in Washington February 26, 2015.

WASHINGTON The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is set to unveil details of a proposal on Thursday to protect consumers' internet privacy, safety advocates and industry officials said.

FCC chairman Tom Wheeler is expected to unveil a long-awaited plan for new broadband privacy rules that be voted on initially by the commission during its March 31 meeting. A final vote on new regulations would follow a public comment period.

A FCC spokeswoman declined to comment on the timing of the privacy proposal.

Broadband providers currently collect significant amounts of consumer data and some use that data for targeted advertising, which has drawn criticism from privacy advocates.

In November, Wheeler said he expected the FCC would address the privacy practices of network service providers.

Consumers should know what is being collected about their internet use, have a right not to have the information collected and have reassurances that the data will be protected, Wheeler said.

On Monday, Verizon Communications Inc agreed to pay $1.35 million to settle an FCC privacy probe after it admitted it inserted unique tracking codes in its users' internet traffic for advertising known as 'supercookies' without getting their consent or allowing them to opt out.

AT&T Senior Vice President Bob Quinn said in a blog post on Wednesday that the FCC is holding broadband providers to a different standard than companies like Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google unit.

""Time and time again, the FCC appears to want to place its thumb on the scale in favor of Internet companies and against the companies that invest in broadband infrastructure in this country,"" Quinn wrote.

A coalition of groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Digital Democracy and Electronic Frontier Foundation has urged the FCC to write sweeping privacy protections for the nation's broadband users.

The FCC has new authority to set privacy rules after it reclassified broadband providers last year as part of new net neutrality regulations. A federal appeals court has not ruled on a court challenge to that decision.

NEW YORK A U.S. judge has agreed to delay the release of a report that says HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) ""moved too slowly"" to enhance its anti-money laundering compliance program following a $1.9 billion pact with the U.S. Justice Department.

U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New York, on Wednesday stayed the release while prosecutors and London-based HSBC appeal his January ruling requiring the unsealing of a report by a federal monitor appointed as part of a 2012 deferred prosecution deal.

Gleeson also agreed to redact parts of the January 2015 report by former New York prosecutor Michael Cherkasky to, among other things, minimize risks that criminals would exploit weaknesses in the anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance programs.

But Gleeson rejected many of HSBC's proposed redactions as ""over-inclusive.""

Among the findings HSBC wanted redacted, Gleeson said, was Cherkasky's conclusion that the bank ""moved too slowly and made too little progress toward instilling the type of culture it will need"" to build an effective compliance program.

The order came on Gleeson's last day on the bench before joining the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton.

Neither the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn nor HSBC responded immediately to requests for comment on Thursday.

Cherkasky, now the executive chairman of compliance company Exiger, was appointed federal monitor as part the five-year deferred prosecution agreement with HSBC.

The deal resolved charges that HSBC had become a ""preferred financial institution"" for Mexican drug cartels and other money launderers and conducted transactions for customers in several countries subject to U.S. sanctions.

Cherkasky's report was to be kept under wraps.

But Hubert Dean Moore of Pennsylvania, who said he had been an HSBC mortgage customer before filing for bankruptcy, asked that it be unsealed so he could review whether the bank still engaged in ""unsafe and unsound business practices.""

HSBC and the Justice Department have opposed the report's unsealing, saying it could provide a ""road map"" for criminals planning to launder money and discourage people from cooperating with the monitor.

Both HSBC and the Justice Department have indicated they will appeal.

In their latest protest against a 2015 EU-brokered deal with Serbia, opposition members of parliament on Thursday released two canisters, threw a glass of water at Prime Minister Isa Mustafa and aimed red lasers at the interior minister's face.

With security measures so far having failed to stop the protests, the government plans to buy a new body scanner, of the type used at international airports to detect explosives.

Opposition members said it was ""top secret"" how they smuggled the canisters into parliament.

However, one police officer checking deputies at the building, speaking on condition of anonymity, said be believed they hide the canisters on their body, under their clothes.

He said the existing scanners did not necessarily detect the canisters - some of which easily fit in a pocket - because they were covered in plastic and rubber.

Police only say publicly they are investigating how the canisters are being taken into parliament.

The government said on Thursday the new scanner would cost around 270,000 euros ($300,000). Parliament has already had new ventilators installed on the roof to clear the gas.

The opposition has been protesting for months against the EU-brokered deal to give more power to a small Serb minority.

The agreement, which has yet to take effect following a critical judicial review by Kosovo's highest court, has set off the worst political crisis in the country, whose population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian, since independence in 2008.

The opposition, which has been demanding the resignation of the government over the agreement, is call its supporters to protest on March 26.

Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, almost a decade after NATO air strikes drove out Serbian security forces accused of killing and expelling ethnic Albanian civilians during a counter-insurgency war.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) logo is seen before the FCC Net Neutrality hearing in Washington February 26, 2015.

WASHINGTON The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is set to unveil details of a proposal on Thursday to protect consumers' internet privacy, safety advocates and industry officials said.

FCC chairman Tom Wheeler is expected to unveil a long-awaited plan for new broadband privacy rules that be voted on initially by the commission during its March 31 meeting. A final vote on new regulations would follow a public comment period.

A FCC spokeswoman declined to comment on the timing of the privacy proposal.

Broadband providers currently collect significant amounts of consumer data and some use that data for targeted advertising, which has drawn criticism from privacy advocates.

In November, Wheeler said he expected the FCC would address the privacy practices of network service providers.

Consumers should know what is being collected about their internet use, have a right not to have the information collected and have reassurances that the data will be protected, Wheeler said.

On Monday, Verizon Communications Inc agreed to pay $1.35 million to settle an FCC privacy probe after it admitted it inserted unique tracking codes in its users' internet traffic for advertising known as 'supercookies' without getting their consent or allowing them to opt out.

AT&T Senior Vice President Bob Quinn said in a blog post on Wednesday that the FCC is holding broadband providers to a different standard than companies like Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google unit.

""Time and time again, the FCC appears to want to place its thumb on the scale in favor of Internet companies and against the companies that invest in broadband infrastructure in this country,"" Quinn wrote.

A coalition of groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Digital Democracy and Electronic Frontier Foundation has urged the FCC to write sweeping privacy protections for the nation's broadband users.

The FCC has new authority to set privacy rules after it reclassified broadband providers last year as part of new net neutrality regulations. A federal appeals court has not ruled on a court challenge to that decision.

Britain said the Hinkley Point project, one of the world's costliest, is needed to replace ageing reactors and polluting coal plants.

The European Commission said it did not see any serious competition issues.

""The Commission's investigation found that competition in the wholesale supply of electricity in the UK will not be hindered by the transaction given the moderate market share of EDF, the very limited market shares of CGN in this market and the presence of other competitors,"" it said in a statement.

NEW YORK A U.S. judge has agreed to delay the release of a report that says HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) ""moved too slowly"" to enhance its anti-money laundering compliance program following a $1.9 billion pact with the U.S. Justice Department.

U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New York, on Wednesday stayed the release while prosecutors and London-based HSBC appeal his January ruling requiring the unsealing of a report by a federal monitor appointed as part of a 2012 deferred prosecution deal.

Gleeson also agreed to redact parts of the January 2015 report by former New York prosecutor Michael Cherkasky to, among other things, minimize risks that criminals would exploit weaknesses in the anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance programs.

But Gleeson rejected many of HSBC's proposed redactions as ""over-inclusive.""

Among the findings HSBC wanted redacted, Gleeson said, was Cherkasky's conclusion that the bank ""moved too slowly and made too little progress toward instilling the type of culture it will need"" to build an effective compliance program.

The order came on Gleeson's last day on the bench before joining the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton.

Neither the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn nor HSBC responded immediately to requests for comment on Thursday.

Cherkasky, now the executive chairman of compliance company Exiger, was appointed federal monitor as part the five-year deferred prosecution agreement with HSBC.

The deal resolved charges that HSBC had become a ""preferred financial institution"" for Mexican drug cartels and other money launderers and conducted transactions for customers in several countries subject to U.S. sanctions.

Cherkasky's report was to be kept under wraps.

But Hubert Dean Moore of Pennsylvania, who said he had been an HSBC mortgage customer before filing for bankruptcy, asked that it be unsealed so he could review whether the bank still engaged in ""unsafe and unsound business practices.""

HSBC and the Justice Department have opposed the report's unsealing, saying it could provide a ""road map"" for criminals planning to launder money and discourage people from cooperating with the monitor.

Both HSBC and the Justice Department have indicated they will appeal.

BALTIMORE Michael Phelps emergiu de um dos periodos mais escuros de sua vida e mergulhou em uma renovacao de sua carreira, o que e uma noticia ruim para qualquer pessoa que tente arruinar sua gloriosa despedida olimpica.

O nadador norte-americano, que possui o recorde de 18 medalhas de ouro em Olimpiadas, se aposentou apos ganhar quatro medalhas de ouro e duas de prata nos Jogos de Londres, em 2012.

Mesmo la no fundo, Phelps sabia que nao deu seu melhor em 2012 e apos atingir seu desempenho mais baixo em 2014, ele voltou a se dedicar, treinando mais duro que nunca, com esperancas de deixar o esporte apos a Olimpiada do Rio, aos 31 anos.

""Sou feliz com o que sou, feliz em estar onde estou. Sou feliz com o que faco e me sinto crianca novamente"", disse Phelps a Reuters no complexo da Under Armour em Baltimore, onde estava realizando uma acao comercial para a marca de artigos esportivos.

""Me sinto mais relaxado do que nunca e mais feliz do que nunca. E o melhor ponto que ja estive na minha vida"".

Seu casamento iminente com a ex-miss California Nicole Johnson e a esperada chegada de seu filho enriqueceram o atleta, que apesar de todos os triunfos esteve extremamente incomodado no passado.

""Olho para tras, para 2012, e como me preparava para aquilo, e posso dizer que era uma piada"", disse Phelps. ""Eu nao tinha paixao e nao estava com muita vontade. Nao tinha motivacao. Acho que precisava de um tempo longe de tudo - do esporte, da minha familia, meus amigos, todas as partes da minha vida.""

Phelps atingiu o fundo em 2014 com sua segunda prisao por dirigir embriagado, que resultou em uma suspensao por seis meses pela associacao norte-americana de natacao e 45 dias em reabilitacao.

Foi uma mudanca forte para Phelps, que nao bebeu mais desde entao.

""Poder sentar e pensar sobre o que queria fazer, onde queria ir. Quem eu sou, de verdade. E poder fazer isso me permitiu viver com mais liberdade, ser mais feliz com quem sou"", acrescentou.",[]

According to Obs, the submarine, from the Murmansk base, did not enter France's territorial waters, but was seen off France's Atlantic coast.

A spokesman for the French navy neither confirmed or denied the information saying it was a general policy not to communicate on such matters.

""Russian naval activity has been on the rise for several months, if not years, and we are permanently attentive to it,"" the spokesman said.

Russia has flexed its military muscle over the past couple of years, amid heightened tensions between the West and Moscow over Ukraine, and the NATO military alliance has repeatedly reported more incursions by Russian fighters and long-range bombers into its airspace.

In Britain and Sweden patrol planes have searched their waters over the past two years after the sighting of a submarine's periscope and reports of foreign ""underwater activity"".

In mid-February French and British fighter jets intercepted two Russian Tu-160 bomber planes heading toward British airspace near the French coast.

Hackers nao identificados, porem, conseguiram levar cerca de 80 milhoes de dolares em um dos maiores roubos a bancos ja conhecidos na historia.

Os hackers invadiram os sistemas do banco central de Bangladesh no mes passado e roubaram credenciais para transferencias de pagamentos, afirmaram duas autoridades da instituicao monetaria.

Eles entao bombardearam o Fed de Nova York com dezenas de pedidos de transferencia de dinheiro da conta do Banco de Bangladesh para outras entidades nas Filipinas e Sri Lanka, disseram as autoridades.

Quatro pedidos para transferencia de um total de cerca de 81 milhoes de dolares foram realizados, mas um quinto, de 20 milhoes, para uma organizacao sem fins lucrativos do Sri Lanka, nao foi aceito porque os hackers escreveram errado o nome da ONG.

O nome completo da ONG nao foi divulgado. Mas uma das autoridades afirmou que os hackers escreveram errado ""foundation"", que aparece no nome da organizacao, e digitaram ""fandation"". A palavra errada fez o banco que direcionaria a transferencia, Deutsche Bank, buscar esclarecimentos com o banco central de Bangladesh, que interrompeu a transacao.

Representantes do Deutsche Bank nao comentaram o assunto.

Ao mesmo tempo, um numero incomumente elevado de instrucoes de pagamento e os pedidos de transferencia para entidades privadas causou suspeitas no Fed, o que fez com que a autoridade monetaria dos Estados Unidos tambem alertasse o governo de Bangladesh.

Os detalhes sobre como o golpe foi descoberto e interrompido antes que causasse mais estragos nao tinham sido divulgados anteriormente. O Banco de Bangladesh tem bilhoes de dolares em uma conta corrente no Fed, utilizada para acordos internacionais.

As transacoes que foram interrompidas totalizavam entre 850 milhoes e 870 milhoes de dolares, disse uma das autoridades.

No ano passado, a companhia russa de seguranca de computadores Kaspersky Lab disse que um grupo internacional de cibercriminosos roubou ate 1 bilhao de dolares de ate 100 instituicoes financeiras ao redor do mundo em cerca de dois anos.

O Banco de Bangladesh afirmou que recuperou parte do dinheiro roubado e que esta trabalhando com autoridades contra lavagem de dinheiro nas Filipinas para tentar recuperar o restante.

Os recursos recuperados sao os envolvidos na transferencia para a entidade no Sri Lanka, que acabou interrompida, disse uma das autoridades.

Mais de um mes depois do ataque, autoridades de Bangladesh estao tendo dificuldades para rastrear o dinheiro, reforcar a seguranca, alem de identificar as fraquezas no sistema. Elas afirmaram que ha pouca esperanca de descobrir quem sao os hackers e que pode levar meses antes que o dinheiro seja recuperado, se e que sera.

Especialistas em seguranca afirmaram que os hackers tinham conhecimento profundo do funcionamento do banco central de Bangladesh, obtido provavelmente por meio de espionagem de funcionarios da instituicao.

Enquanto isso, o governo de Bangladesh esta responsabilizando o Fed por nao ter interrompido as transacoes antes. O ministro das Financas do pais, Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, afirmou na terca-feira que Bangladesh podera processar o Fed para recuperar o dinheiro.

O Fed de Nova York, por sua vez, afirmou que seus sistemas nao foram invadidos e que tem trabalhado com o banco central de Bangladesh desde que o incidente ocorreu.

O ataque aconteceu entre 4 e 5 fevereiro, durante o fim de semana em Bangladesh, que cai numa sexta-feira, disseram as autoridades. Os escritorios do banco central estavam fechados.

Inicialmente, o banco central nao tinha certeza se seu sistema foi invadido, mas especialistas em ciberseguranca que investigaram o caso encontraram ""pegadas"" dos hackers que sugerem que o sistema foi comprometido, disseram as autoridades.

Os especialistas tambem puderam determinar que o ataque foi originado fora de Bangladesh e as autoridades do banco central afirmaram que a instituicao esta tentando determinar como os hackers conseguiram entrar no sistema.

MUMBAI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - India and Bahrain have agreed to take steps to curb human trafficking and cooperate more closely on the rescue and repatriation of victims, an official statement said on Thursday.

The memorandum of understanding is expected to be signed when Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh visits Bahrain in early April, and follows an anti-trafficking pact between India and Bangladesh last year, India's government press bureau said.

South Asia, with India at its centre, is the fastest-growing region for human trafficking in the world, and the second-largest after Southeast Asia, according to the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime.

More than 150,000 people are known to be trafficked within South Asia every year, but the trade is underground and the real number is likely to be much higher.

Under the bilateral accord, India and Bahrain will ""increase bilateral cooperation on the issues of prevention, rescue, recovery and repatriation related to human trafficking, especially women and children expeditiously"", the statement said.

India has said it is considering similar agreements to curb human trafficking with other Gulf nations and Nepal.

India is both a source and a transit country for trafficking to Bahrain. People from South Asia often migrate voluntarily to Bahrain and other Gulf nations for jobs as domestic workers or in the construction and hospitality industries.

After being promised good salaries and working conditions, some face forced labour after arriving in Bahrain - their passports are withheld, their movements restricted, their wages unpaid and they are subjected to threats and physical or sexual abuse.

Domestic workers are among the most exploited people in the world, and some Asian countries including Indonesia have proposed banning women from moving to the Middle East to do domestic work.

India and Bahrain will aim to ensure speedy investigation and prosecution of traffickers in either country. Measures will also be taken to prevent trafficking, and repatriation of victims will be done quickly, the statement said.

A joint task force with representatives from both sides will be set up to monitor the working of the memorandum.

The opinions expressed are their own.

Mario Draghi has rediscovered his mojo. The European Central Bank chief may have underwhelmed investors in December but bounced back on Thursday by unveiling an aggressive package of easing measures that triggered a big market rally. The problem: he may be encouraging excessive risk-taking without being able to lift inflation.

Stock and bond prices shot up while credit indices tightened sharply after Draghi increased the value of monthly ECB asset purchases by a third to 80 billion euros, and said non-bank investment-grade corporate bonds would qualify for its buying programme, which aims to spur economic activity by cutting borrowing costs. He also unveiled plans for new four-year loans for banks. These could carry interest rates as low as the deposit rate, which was cut by 10 basis points to minus 0.4 percent.

The ECBs plan to buy corporate bonds is a radical departure for a central bank that was far more conservative than its peers during the financial crisis. But there are also several sleights of hand.

First, while bonds issued by banks still dont qualify for ECB buying, Draghi is helping them by indirectly cutting their funding costs. As yields on other corporate debt fall due to ECB buying, investors will turn to bank debt and subordinated bonds. Second, negative rates for long-term loans would mean the ECB effectively pays banks to borrow. This would mitigate any damage done to bank margins by the more negative deposit rate. No wonder the EURO STOXX Banks index rose 4.9 percent, outperforming the wider market, and the iTraxx Senior Financials index tightened 10 basis points to 87 basis points.

But all this light and joy cant distract from a couple of rather big clouds. Given euro zone inflation has failed to respond much to past easing, its unclear whether Draghis new measures can spur consumer prices this time. Worse, the ECB chief just gave investors a new reason to disregard fundamentals when buying corporate bonds. When the ECBs easing party finally ends, the excessive risk-taking it is encouraging could leave an even bigger hangover.",[]

In a wide ranging interview on foreign policy, Obama also put a share of the blame for the crisis in Libya on Washington's European allies. Libya is embroiled in political chaos after its 2011 uprising and facing a security vacuum and a growing threat from Islamic State.

""When I go back and I ask myself what went wrong, there's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up,"" Obama said.

""You've got countries that have very few civic traditions, so that as autocratic regimes start fraying, the only organizing principles are sectarian.""

On Syria, now in its fifth year of civil war, Obama defended his decision not to launch strikes there in 2013, despite concerns over President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons. Critics have seen that as a missed opportunity that might have helped bring an end to the war.

""For me to push the pause button at that moment, I knew, would cost me politically,"" he said. ""I believe ultimately it was the right decision to make.""

He also discussed Russia, which has increased its role in the Middle East by staking out a role in Syria and infuriating Washington with its support of Assad, who the United States and other Western nations have said must leave power.

Aboul Gheit served as Egypt's foreign minister during the final seven years of former president Hosni Mubarak's rule, leaving his post in 2011 following the mass protests that toppled the aging autocrat.

The Arab League was due to vote to replace Egyptian diplomat Nabil El-Araby, who headed the 22-member organization after serving as Egypt's foreign minister under a transitional government formed after the 2011 uprising.

Qatar welcomed Mubarak's fall and supported Islamist President Mohamed Mursi, who was elected in 2012 and overthrown a year later by the army after protests against his rule.

El-Araby said last month that he would not seek another term as secretary-general after his current one ends in July.

The difficulty in agreeing a successor to El-Araby follows Morocco's announcement last month that it would not host the 2016 Arab League meeting as scheduled, saying it wanted to avoid giving a false impression of unity in the Arab world.

The Arab League has recently been a forum for predominantly Sunni Muslim countries led by Saudi Arabia to air grievances with regional Shi'ite power Iran.

The two regional powers are backing different sides in Syria's civil war and different factions in neighboring Lebanon.

The Alpine state, the smallest on the Balkan migration route, committed itself last year to taking 587 refugees and said it would start receiving them once the route is closed.

Egypt must give Italy ""all the information and documentation necessary to conduct a rapid, transparent and impartial investigation into the Regeni case,"" it said.

It called on European Union diplomats to pressure Egypt to improve its human rights record, saying Regeni's killing occurred ""within a context of torture, death in custody and enforced disappearances across Egypt in recent years."" Egypt has denied human rights abuses.

WASHINGTON Wars and chaos in the Middle East will not end until Saudi Arabia and Iran can find a way to ""share the neighborhood"" and make some kind of peace, U.S. President Barack Obama said in a magazine interview released on Thursday.

""The competition between the Saudis and the Iranians, which has helped to feed proxy wars and chaos in Syria and Iraq and Yemen, requires us to say to our friends, as well as to the Iranians, that they need to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace,"" Obama told The Atlantic.

In a wide ranging interview on foreign policy, Obama also put a share of the blame for the crisis in Libya on Washington's European allies. Libya is embroiled in political chaos after its 2011 uprising and facing a security vacuum and a growing threat from Islamic State.

""When I go back and I ask myself what went wrong, there's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up,"" Obama said. The Obama administration withdrew U.S. troops from Iraq but has grappled with years of Middle East turmoil since the Arab Spring uprising. Obama, in his final year in the White House, said there were limits on how far the United States could police the region.

""You have countries that are failing to provide prosperity and opportunity for their people. You've got a violent, extremist ideology, or ideologies, that are turbocharged through social media,"" he said. ""You've got countries that have very few civic traditions, so that as autocratic regimes start fraying, the only organizing principles are sectarian.""

On Syria, now in its fifth year of civil war, Obama defended his decision not to launch strikes there in 2013, despite concerns over President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons. Critics have seen that as a missed opportunity that might have helped bring an end to the war.

""For me to push the pause button at that moment, I knew, would cost me politically,"" he said. ""I believe ultimately it was the right decision to make.""

He also discussed Russia, which has increased its role in the Middle East by staking out a role in Syria and infuriating Washington with its support of Assad, who the United States and other Western nations have said must leave power.

On Russian President Vladimir Putin, Obama said the two have ""very businesslike"" meetings, adding: ""He understands that Russia's overall position in the world is significantly diminished.""

Some 14,000 people are stranded there after new border restrictions were imposed along the Balkan migration route. Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia said on Tuesday (March 8) they would place new restrictions on the entry of migrants and Macedonia responded on Wednesday by closing its border completely to illegal migrants, a police official said. Ai walked around the makeshift camp speaking with the migrants - seeing for himself the difficult conditions they have to brave as they wait to cross over to Macedonia and continue their trek northwards to wealthier European states. Ai, known for his criticism of China's human rights record, said he was witnessing a ""huge, big violation of human rights"" in the middle of Europe. ""What we have seen here is almost unbelievable, you know. If you say this is in the middle of Europe, all the people stuck here, and there's no hope for them even to be transferred to anywhere else, you know. It's just in the rain, in the cold, and women, children, all the people waiting for some bread, or some dry clothes, and this is a very sad situation and people have no hope because the door is closed, totally shut off. I think this is a huge, big violation of human rights, right in front of us. I don't know what is going to come out from this, but in Lesbos people still come in thousands every day, and here nobody tells them what to do, and they stay here, still having hope to go to Germany or some other location, but I think, as the sky is getting darker and I don't think there's much hope for them,"" he said. People fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and beyond have flooded into the EU since early 2015, most making the perilous sea crossing from Turkey to Greece, then heading north through the Balkans to Germany. But a cascade of border shutdowns in the Balkans has caused the blocking of the so-called 'Balkans corridor' used by more than a million people since the migratory wave started a year ago. More than 34,0000 people are now trapped on Greece's islands and mainland. At an emergency EU-Turkey summit on Monday (March 7), aimed to stem the migrant influx to Europe, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told leaders of the bloc Ankara was willing to take back all migrants who enter Europe from Turkey in future in return for financial aid, faster EU entry talks and quicker visa-free travel for its citizens. EU leaders aim to work out key details with Turkey by the next scheduled summit on March 17-18. European Council President Donald Tusk said the outcome would show migrants that there was no longer a path into Europe for people seeking a better life.",[]

BRUSSELS European Union interior ministers expressed reservations on Thursday over easing visa requirements for Turkey, a key element of a tentative deal with Ankara that Brussels and Germany hope will halt the mass influx of refugees and migrants to Europe.

EU and Turkish leaders agreed in principle on Monday that Ankara would prevent people from leaving its shores for Europe in exchange for more help for refugees living in Turkey, visa liberalisation for Turks visiting Europe and accelerating Turkey's long-dormant EU accession talks.

The 28 EU leaders have given themselves until the next summit due on March 17-18 to hone the details of an agreement that has stirred resistance in some countries, not least due to concerns over Turkey's record on human rights and press freedom.

Last Friday Turkish authorities seized control of the country's largest newspaper, Zaman, in a widening crackdown on supporters of a U.S.-based Muslim cleric opposed to President Tayyip Erdogan.

EU officials also say Turkey, a country of 75 million, only meets about half of more than 70 technical requirements for visa-free travel with Europe.

""It is highly questionable that Turkey, which puts a newspaper critical of the government under its own control, presents a wish-list three days later and is rewarded by discussions about earlier visa liberalisation,"" said Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.

""I ask myself if the EU is throwing its values overboard,"" Mikl-Leitner said as she arrived for Thursday's ministerial talks, adding that she would push for a termination clause to be inserted into any final agreement.

SCHENGEN ZONE UNDER THREAT

Austria and other countries along the main migration route linking Greece to Germany via the Western Balkans, have resorted to unilateral tightening of border controls as the bloc struggles to forge a joint response to the migrant crisis.

That has put further strain on Europe's Schengen zone of passport-free travel, now on the verge of collapse, deepened rifts between states over the crisis that has already fuelled support for far-right parties across the bloc.

Under Monday's tentative deal, Turkey would take back all migrants crossing to Europe who are ineligible for asylum as well as everyone - including those fleeing wars and hence eligible for international protection - fished out from the sea before reaching EU shores.

But the forcible mass repatriation of migrants to Turkey would be difficult to implement, not least because many will have risked their lives and spent large sums of money to get to Europe in the first place.

However, EU officials said just a few returns should be sufficient to convince the migrants they stood no chance of being allowed to stay and to agree to be sent back to Turkey.

""People will not stop coming by themselves, so we have to show that it doesn't pay to use a trafficker and come to Europe in an illegal way,"" said Klaas Dijkhoff, migration minister of the Netherlands, current holder of the EU's rotating presidency.

The interior ministers meeting in Brussels will also discuss plans for a common EU border and coast guard that the bloc hopes to deploy for the first time in late summer to improve protection of its external borders.

To ease the burden on Greece, where tens of thousands of migrants are now stranded in increasingly dire humanitarian conditions, the EU is stepping up relocations, with more than 900 people moved so far. However, that still falls far short of the 160,000 migrants EU states committed to move internally.

The EU ministers also expressed concern on Thursday that, with borders all but shut across the Western Balkans, migration routes would split into smaller streams of people seeking other routes of entry into the EU.

Italy could come under increased pressure if people stuck in Greece try to get out via Albania and the Adriatic Sea.

""We are working to prevent that,"" Italy's Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said, without giving details.

The migrants, camped within sight of Serbian border guards, were angered and confused by news that Serbia, Slovenia and Croatia had closed their borders to migrants in transit, effectively blocking the Balkan route taken by more than 1 million migrants to the European Union over the past year.

Persistent heavy rain has turned their makeshift camp of around 50 small tents provided by aid agencies into a quagmire and daytime temperatures are only around 5 degrees centigrade.

""Our children are dying. There is water all over, even under the tents ... Now it seems that the bombs in Syria look better than this misery. We are not animals,"" said Ibrahim Mardini, a 23-year-old student from Aleppo in Syria.

The migrants' long journeys from Iraq or Syria ended with a train ride through Macedonia and finally a walk to the Serbian border, where they have been stranded for three or four days.

Blocked from entering Serbia, they refuse to give up on their dream of reaching the European Union. Macedonian authorities say they could go back to an established migrant camp less than 1 mile (1 km) away in Macedonia, but they refuse.

""I want to go to any country, just not here. My baby is very tired. I cannot take it any more. I don't want to go back. I walked too long,"" said 25-year-old Weaam Fattal, also from Aleppo.

""I don't have any other plan, I don't know where to go,"" said Fattal, who said she left Syria about two months ago.

Dhomo Shevan, a 45-year-old farmer from Iraq, was defiant.

""If they don't let us pass, we will just go. Let us see if they stop us. This is unbearable,"" he said.

Aid workers were distributing food and water and have set up portable toilets for the migrants. A Red Cross vehicle arrived and delivered blankets and warm hats for the children.

Close by, about 1,000 more migrants are crammed into the Macedonian transit camp, designed for 700 people. Their future is equally uncertain.

Ivo Kunovski, an aid worker with U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, said: ""We dont know what is next. We are waiting to see what will they (the authorities) decide.

""There is enough food and clothes. Everyone has a roof over their head, but the situation with the people in no man's land is worse. There are women, children and elderly people there. We are trying to help them,"" he said.

The closure of the Balkan route could lead to migrants taking new routes to try to reach Europe, the deputy executive director of EU border agency Frontex said on Thursday.

""We haven't always conveyed how much we treasure our alliance and ties with our Canadian friends,"" Obama said in a welcoming ceremony.

The two nations started the day by agreeing joint steps to fight climate change, including cutting methane emissions from oil and gas operations and signing last year's Paris climate deal ""as soon as feasible.""

Methane, which can leak from pipelines and valves, is a powerful greenhouse gas, with up to 80 times the potential of carbon dioxide to trap the planet's heat.

The countries also committed to cutting emissions of methane by 40 to 45 percent below 2012 levels by 2025, to take steps to fight climate change in the Arctic, and to speed development of green technologies.

Obama has much in common with Trudeau, the progressive 44-year-old Liberal Party leader who took office in November. He replaced Conservative Stephen Harper, who had hectored the White House for years in a failed bid to push through U.S. approval for the Keystone XL oil pipeline.

Trudeau's official visit will be capped by a state dinner on Thursday, making him the first Canadian leader to be granted that honor since 1997.

""Our great countries have been friends a long time. We grew up together ... and through it all, our enormous shared accomplishments speak for themselves,"" he said in reply to Obama.

Americans have been captivated by the photogenic Trudeau, 44, whose father, Pierre Trudeau, was prime minister from 1968 through 1979, and again from 1980 to 1984.

Also on the agenda for Oval Office talks are plans to expedite bilateral travel and trade, and shared areas of global concern ranging from Syria to Ukraine.

Trudeau, who is struggling at home with a soft economy and a weak Canadian dollar, campaigned on repairing strained ties.

But his visit may be overshadowed by the raucous race to succeed Obama in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Candidates on both the left and right have taken anti-free-trade positions.

Obama hopes to convince a reluctant U.S. Congress to ratify the sprawling Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact before he leaves office in January. Canada is also wrestling with the merits of the TPP.

WASHINGTON O pre-candidato republicano a Presidencia dos Estados Unidos Donald Trump criticou nesta quinta-feira as desvalorizacoes cambiais em curso em todo o mundo, afirmou que elas prejudicam a economia dos EUA e tiram empregos do pais, e apoiou os clamores por uma postura mais dura no comercio.

Indagado sobre a decisao tomada pelo Banco Central Europeu, tambem nesta quinta-feira, de reduzir as taxas de juros, Trump disse ao canal de televisao CNBC que tais desvalorizacoes estao levando empregos no setor manufatureiro, entre outros, para fora dos EUA.

""Simplesmente ficamos assistindo sem fazer nada"", disse Trump. ""Isso esta se tornando muito perigoso.""

Uma medida economica mais eficaz do que as desvalorizacoes seria cobrar um imposto sobre produtos feitos no exterior e vendidos nos EUA, particularmente aqueles vindos da China, afirmou Trump.

""A China e a gra-mestra de todos"", disse Trump. ""Tenho otimos relacionamentos e relacionamentos de negocios com a China, e mesmo aquelas pessoas dizem que nao acreditam nas coisas das quais eles estao se safando.""

The U.S. Federal Reserve will hike rates again by end-June and once more before year-end, according to economists in a Reuters poll who are generally as convinced or even more about the trajectory of rates than a month ago.

Fed rate-setters meet next week to decide monetary policy. While policymakers are expected to keep rates on hold then, conflicting economic data in the recent past has clouded the outlook among policymakers and forecasters alike.

Still, economists polled this week gave a 60 percent chance of rates rising by mid-year, encouraged in part by a strong jobs report for February. Financial markets are pricing in a similar probability only by November.

Explaining how his conviction for a rate hike by mid-year has increased, JPMorgan economist Dan Silver said there were concerns economic growth was really losing momentum at the start of the year but those risks have now receded.

""The latest round of indicators, mostly the January reports on retail sales, industrial production and combining them with the payroll report for February - they've all kind of reduced those fears.""

But Federal Open Market Committee members do not appear as united on the outlook for rates as they were ahead of the decision in December, when they raised rates for the first time in nearly a decade.

In the past week, Fed Governor Lael Brainard argued for patience in raising rates while Vice-Chair Stanley Fischer warned inflation is showing signs of accelerating, suggesting a preference for tighter policy.

A strong labor market but relatively weak wage inflation has thrown up a challenge for Fed Chair Janet Yellen to provide a clear picture of the policy path, especially as most global central banks remain disposed to ease.

The European Central Bank went beyond all expectations on Thursday, cutting all three of its interest rates and increasing the size of its bond buying program.

But unlike the ECB, the Fed is expected to carry on in the opposite direction, pushing the fed funds target rate up to a range of 0.50 - 0.75 percent in the second quarter and to 0.75 - 1.00 by year end, from 0.25 - 0.50 percent now, according to median forecasts in the poll.

A survey last week of the Wall Street primary dealers - banks who do business directly with the Fed - showed similar results. [FED/R]

""As long as the labor market data remain on track and the signs of somewhat higher inflation come to fruition, then it is likely the FOMC will act unless there is another episode of volatility in financial markets,"" said Terry Sheehan, economist at Stone & McCarthy.

CONFLICTING DATA BUT NO RECESSION

The U.S. economy has now added 200,000 or more new jobs in all but four of the past 12 months, increasing by 242,000 in February -- some 50,000 more than expected.

At the same time, economic activity has remained relatively modest, as has inflation.

Still, the consensus from over 100 forecasters is the economy will maintain a steady pace of growth, a little higher than an annualized 2 percent rate, about where it's expected to be in the current quarter, until at least Q2 2017.

The probability of a U.S. recession over the next 12 months is seen as only 15 percent, down from 20 percent in last month's poll.

But inflation, as measured by the core PCE price index, is not expected to rise near the Fed's 2 percent target even as far out as the middle of next year.

That still relatively weak inflation outlook could stand in the way of further hikes, especially with weakening global trade, a strong dollar and ongoing concerns about China's economic slowdown.

A strong labor market but relatively weak wage inflation has thrown up a challenge for Fed Chair Janet Yellen to provide a clear picture of the policy path, especially as most global central banks remain disposed to ease.

The European Central Bank went beyond all expectations on Thursday, cutting all three of its interest rates and increasing the size of its bond buying program.

But unlike the ECB, the Fed is expected to carry on in the opposite direction, pushing the fed funds target rate up to a range of 0.50 - 0.75 percent in the second quarter and to 0.75 - 1.00 by year end, from 0.25 - 0.50 percent now, according to median forecasts in the poll.

A survey last week of the Wall Street primary dealers - banks who do business directly with the Fed - showed similar results. [FED/R]

""As long as the labor market data remain on track and the signs of somewhat higher inflation come to fruition, then it is likely the FOMC will act unless there is another episode of volatility in financial markets,"" said Terry Sheehan, economist at Stone & McCarthy.

CONFLICTING DATA BUT NO RECESSION

The U.S. economy has now added 200,000 or more new jobs in all but four of the past 12 months, increasing by 242,000 in February -- some 50,000 more than expected.

At the same time, economic activity has remained relatively modest, as has inflation.

Still, the consensus from over 100 forecasters is the economy will maintain a steady pace of growth, a little higher than an annualized 2 percent rate, about where it's expected to be in the current quarter, until at least Q2 2017.

The probability of a U.S. recession over the next 12 months is seen as only 15 percent, down from 20 percent in last month's poll.

But inflation, as measured by the core PCE price index, is not expected to rise near the Fed's 2 percent target even as far out as the middle of next year.

That still relatively weak inflation outlook could stand in the way of further hikes, especially with weakening global trade, a strong dollar and ongoing concerns about China's economic slowdown.

Attendees take part in the 2016 Volkswagen Passat reveal in the Brooklyn borough of New York September 21, 2015.

BERLIN The departure of Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) U.S. boss is a blow to the carmaker's attempts to revive sales after its emissions test cheating scandal, but should not disrupt its efforts to strike a deal with U.S. regulators, analysts and sources told Reuters.

Michael Horn, whose surprise departure from the helm of Volkswagen Group of America was announced late on Wednesday, was not on the teams negotiating with U.S. regulators over a fix for almost 600,000 vehicles found to be emitting up for 40 times the legal limit of pollutants, sources close to the matter said.

But he was a popular figure among U.S. dealers, who viewed him as critical to the German company's attempts to win back customers in the world's second-biggest car market.

""VW has its back to the wall, Horn's departure is happening at the most inconvenient time,"" said Arndt Ellinghorst, an analyst at banking advisory firm Evercore ISI. ""If such a key figure quits, this will inevitably cause more unrest.""

Almost six months after it admitted to installing test-rigging software, Europe's largest carmaker has still to reach an agreement with U.S. regulators on how to fix affected cars.

A federal judge has set a March 24 deadline for it to say whether it has found a fix acceptable to the authorities.

VW also faces mounting legal action - the U.S. Justice Department sued the company in January for up to $46 billion for violating environmental laws and this week sent VW a civil subpoena under a bank fraud law.

And its sales in the United States are sliding.

VW said on Wednesday Hinrich Woebcken, a former BMW (BMWG.DE) manager set to take the helm of VW's core brand in North America next month, would assume Horn's responsibilities on an interim basis.

Three sources at VW's Wolfsburg headquarters said Woebcken's appointment to the North American job may have been a factor behind Horn's departure - which VW said was a mutual decision.

Horn's resignation marks the second blow in five months to VW's efforts to assemble a management team for North America after former Skoda boss Winfried Vahland last October rejected an offer to run the VW brand there.

VW is also still looking for a senior figure to help it deal with U.S. authorities after an aborted attempt to hire ex-FBI chief Louis Freeh for that role, one of the sources said.

""VW is in a bind and it's anything but helpful to have a vacuum at the top level"" of its U.S. management, said Commerzbank analyst Sascha Gommel, who has his rating on VW shares under review.

VW sources told Reuters on Thursday it planned to cut 3,000 office jobs in Germany by the end of next year.

Horn was criticized by U.S. lawmakers in October for blaming VW's test cheating on ""a couple of software engineers.""

He said he knew in the spring of 2014 the company might be breaking U.S. emissions rules, but that he didn't know about the use of illegal ""defeat device"" software until about Sept. 3, 2015, when VW admitted cheating to U.S. regulators.

LJUBLJANA Macedonia hopes stopping migrants at its border with Greece, which has effectively closed the Balkan route into northern Europe, will help the country join NATO, Defense Minister Zoran Jolevski said on Thursday.

Macedonia's bid to join the defense bloc has been blocked because Athens has disputed the country's name since Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, saying it implies territorial claims to a Greek province of the same name.

""I hope that Macedonia will get its ... place at a NATO table. We have shown that we are a responsible member of the international community,"" Jolevski said when asked whether Macedonia's conduct in the crisis could enhance its NATO bid.

He told a news conference during a visit to Slovenia the Balkan region would be more stable when more countries from the region join the military alliance. Montenegro was invited to join NATO in December. Bosnia also aspires to become a member.

""An invitation for Montenegro is a big step forward, we believe an invitation for Macedonia would also be important, as well as the process (on NATO membership) being activated for Bosnia and Herzegovina. That will help the stability and prosperity of southeastern Europe,"" Jolevski said.

Jolevski said the Macedonian border with Greece was not completely closed to migrants, but some 14,000 to 15,000 migrants have built up at the border in recent days as Macedonia strictly limits the migrant flow.

Jolevski said the country was coordinating its actions with Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.

He said Macedonia would continue to prevent illegal migrant crossings of its border with the help of the army, and urged the European Union, other European states and Turkey to find a joint solution for the conflict in Syria.

O tricampeao mundial Pele ira leiloar dois mil objetos, incluindo as tres medalhas que ganhou em Copas do Mundo e uma replica da taca Jules Rimet que pode chegar a um milhao de dolares, comunicaram os leiloeiros nesta quinta-feira.

O ex-jogador tambem esta vendendo a bola de seu milesimo gol, alem de camisas que usou no Santos e no New York Cosmos. E a primeira vez que o antigo craque poe a venda objetos emblematicos de sua carreira, informou a casa de leiloes Julien's Auctions.

""Ele e um tremendo icone, e um grande embaixador do futebol"", disse Martin Nolan, diretor-executivo da casa sediada em Beverly Hills, na California, a Reuters.

O leilao de tres dias ira acontecer em Londres entre 7 e 9 de junho e sera precedido de uma exibicao publica a partir de 1o de junho.

Em 1958, aos 17 anos, Pele se tornou a pessoa mais jovem a jogar e marcar gols em uma final de Copa do Mundo. Ele ajudou o Brasil a conquistar ainda os Mundiais de 1962 e 1970, e esta no Livro Guinness de Recordes pelos 1.283 mil gols de sua carreira.

Hoje com 75 anos, e depois de passar por cirurgias no quadril e na prostata, Pele disse que, tendo doado a maior parte de sua colecao a cidade de Santos, ""decidi dar aos torcedores e colecionadores a chance de terem um pedaco da minha historia tambem. Espero que eles valorizem estes artefatos e compartilhem minha historia com seus filhos e com as geracoes futuras"".

Ele contou que uma parte da renda sera doada ao hospital infantil Pequeno Principe, em Curitiba.

O principal item do leilao e uma replica da taca Jules Rimet criada especialmente para Pele pela Fifa e pelo governo mexicano depois que o jogador levou a selecao brasileira a conquista de sua terceira Copa no Mexico em 1970. A taca tem uma inscricao das suas tres vitorias em Mundiais.

A Julien's estimou o preco de venda entre 400 e 600 mil dolares, mas diz que pode ser arrematada por muito mais.

NEW DELHI/MOSCOW India plans to sign energy deals with Russian oil major Rosneft next week to buy stakes in Siberian fields, two sources privy to the deal said, as New Delhi accelerates a push to secure overseas energy assets.

India, the world's third biggest oil importer, has to ship in three quarters of its oil needs and a substantial fall in oil prices has added an extra incentive to seal purchases of assets that are now relatively cheap to limit its reliance on imports.

Rosneft's Chief Executive Igor Sechin will visit Delhi on March 15-16 to stitch together the deals, the sources said.

Rosneft, the world's biggest listed oil company by output, also stands to benefit as it has been scouting for partners as Western sanctions tied to Russia's annexation of Crimea have limited its access to global funds and technology.

Russia is keen to develop and deepen its economic ties with India, one of the world's fastest-growing economies, when its own economy is stagnant, hit by Western sanctions and a plunge in global oil prices.

During Sechin's visit, a sale purchase agreement is likely to be signed with Indian Oil Corp, Oil India Ltd and Bharat PetroResources Ltd (BPRL) for a 29 percent stake in the Taas-Yuriakh oil field, the sources said.

In December, IOC and Oil India signed a memorandum with Rosneft, which paves the way for acquisition of a stake in Taas-Yuriakh oil assets in East Siberia.

Later BPRL, the exploration arm of Bharat Petroleum Corp, joined the negotiations.

Taas-Yuriakh, which operates the Srednebotuobinsk field in east Siberia, is expected to produce more than 5 million tonnes of oil annually in the medium term.

Rosneft last year sold a 20 percent share in Taas-Yuriakh to BP for $750 million, and based on that valuation a 29 percent stake could be worth around $1 billion.

India also wants to raise its overall stake in the Vankor oil field in Siberia to 49.9 percent from the current 15 percent.

ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) is expected to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Rosneft to raise its stake in the Vankor field in Siberia to 26 percent from the current 15 percent, they said.

IOC, Oil India and BPRL may sign an MoU for buying an additional 23.9 percent stake in the Vankor project, they said.

The sources said the sale purchase agreement for raising the stake in Vankor field will be signed in June at International Economic Forum in St. Petersburg.

Oil India chairman and managing directors of ONGC Videsh and BPRL did not respond to Reuters' phone calls seeking comment, while no comment was available from Rosneft.

Documents identifying supporters of Islamic State are seen in this still image from video, released by Sky News to Reuters in London on March 10, 2016.

LONDON A disillusioned former member of Islamic State has passed a stolen memory stick of documents identifying 22,000 supporters in over 50 countries to a British journalist, a leak that could help the West target Islamist fighters planning attacks.

Leaks of such detailed information about Islamic State are rare and give Britain's spies a potential trove of data that could help unmask militants who have threatened more attacks like those that killed 130 people in Paris last November.

A man calling himself Abu Hamed, a former member of Islamic State who became disillusioned with its leaders, passed the files to Britain's Sky News on a memory stick he said he had stolen from the head of the group's internal security force.

On it were enrolment forms containing the names of Islamic State supporters and of their relatives, telephone numbers, and other details such as the subjects' areas of expertise and who had recommended them.

One of the files, marked ""Martyrs"", detailed a group of IS members who were willing and trained to carry out suicide attacks, Sky said.

Richard Barrett, a former head of global counter-terrorism at Britain's MI6 Secret Intelligence Service, said the cache was ""a fantastic coup"" in the fight against Islamic State.

""It will be an absolute goldmine of information of enormous significance and interest to very many people, particularly the security and intelligence services,"" Barrett told Sky News.

Sky said it had informed the British authorities about the documents which were passed to its correspondent, Stuart Ramsay, at an undisclosed location in Turkey.

Western security sources said that if genuine, the files could be gold dust as they could help identify potential attackers and the networks of sympathizers behind them, and give insight on the structure of the group.

Reuters was not able to independently verify the documents, given their provenance. A selection of them was published in Arabic.

Islamic State militants claimed responsibility for the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris and the Oct. 31 downing of a Russian passenger plane over Egypt's Sinai region that killed 224. They have promised more attacks on the West and Russia.

SUICIDE BOMBERS

Western leaders say Islamic State, which has proclaimed a caliphate in the parts of Syria and Iraq it controls, now poses a greater danger to the West than al Qaeda. It uses a militant interpretation of Islam to justify attacks on its foes and the use of extreme violence, including rape and beheadings, against those it sees as infidels.

The defector, a former Free Syrian Army fighter who switched to Islamic State, said the group had been taken over by former soldiers from the Iraqi Baath party of Saddam Hussein, who was ousted in 2003 after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.

Some of the defector's Arabic documents, posted on the Zaman Al Wasl Syrian news website, were forms issued by ""Islamic State in Iraq and Sham, the General Directorate of Borders"" and displayed personal details of each fighter, according to a review of some of the documents by Reuters.

The forms included answers to 23 questions such as assumed name, birthplace, education level, extent of Sharia learning and previous jobs, as well as details about the individuals' journey to Islamic State and whether they were potential suicide bombers or more traditional fighters.

When asked for his view of the documents, Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at London's Royal United Services Institute, said in an emailed response: ""It seems a bit dated.""

""Very interesting though and a real gift for researchers into understanding the group more,"" he added. ""The key for me in many ways is how this highlights the bureaucracy of the organization once again - kinda like al Qaeda in fact.""

DUBLIN Senior U.S. and EU officials on Thursday played down the risk that probes into U.S. firms' tax dealings could lead to a trans-Atlantic tax war, saying both sides were engaging closely to avoid an escalation.

The United States Treasury Department has accused European Union antitrust officials of singling out U.S. companies like Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) in a series of probes into tax deals with European governments.

The Treasury Department has said it is looking at a never-used statute that would allow it to double U.S. taxes on EU firms and individuals in retaliation for discriminatory taxes.

But officials from both sides said there was a long way to go before such measures might actually be used.

""I don't see a risk of a tax war,"" said Robert Stack, Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Tax Affairs at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, speaking to journalists at a tax conference in Dublin.

Asked about the 1934 statute that would allow the United States to retaliate, he said his department was simply looking at it and was not preparing to use it.

""We have simply told in a letter back to our Congress that we will have a look at it. That's all we are saying. Full stop.""

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager in February rejected Stack's earlier criticism that the EU had no right to go after foreign profits held overseas by the firms, and signaled the probes against Apple, Starbucks (SBUX.O) and McDonald's (MCD.N) would continue.

All the companies have denied wrongdoing. Apple could face a hefty back-tax bill as the EU investigation covers a period of up to 10 years.

European Commission tax director Valere Moutarlier, speaking at the same conference, said there was a healthy dialogue between the two sides, and no sign of things escalating.

""People know each other, people talk to each other. I do not anticipate a war,"" he told Reuters when asked about possible U.S. retaliation. ""I am not sure that in reality we are close to being up in arms.""

Moutarlier described the current environment as ""over-politicized"" but he said he was hopeful that this would not last long, adding that all sides should wait for the rulings before reacting.

Dozens of Islamic State fighters were killed or wounded in the strikes that followed similarly heavy air raids in the Palmyra area on Wednesday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported.

The attacks add to the pressure on a group that is losing ground to a separate, U.S.-backed campaign by Syrian militia in the northeast, and whose military commander was declared probably dead by U.S. officials on Tuesday.

The group's tactics in Syria appear to reflect the strains, as it turns to suicide missions seemingly aimed at causing maximum casualties rather than sustainable territorial gains.

Islamic State is not included in a cessation of hostilities agreement that has brought about a lull in the war raging in western Syria between rebels aiming to topple President Bashar al-Assad and the Syrian army backed by the Russian air force.

Military operations against Islamic State in central and eastern Syria are continuing as both Damascus and its allies on one hand, and the United States and its allies on the other, seek to degrade Islamic State's self-declared ""caliphate"" that stretches into Iraq.

The Observatory said Russian war planes carried out 150 raids in the Palmyra area on Wednesday, followed by further attacks on Thursday. ""If they take Tadmur (Palmyra) and Qarayatain, the regime would have taken back a big geographic area of Syria,"" said Observatory Director Rami Abdulrahman.

The loss of Qaraytain and Palmyra and the surrounding desert would reduce Islamic State's hold to about 20 percent of Syria.

Qarayatain is 100 km (60 miles) southwest of Palmyra. After capturing Palmyra, Islamic State blew up some of its ancient monuments in what the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO called a war crime.

Islamic State however appears well-entrenched in Palmyra, and while recovering the city would be a big boost for Damascus, its priority may be elsewhere for now, including the border with Turkey where it has been fighting rebels despite the truce.

FINANCES UNDER STRAIN

The momentum has turned against Islamic State since its rapid advances two years ago following the capture of the Iraqi city of Mosul. Its finances are also under strain, with fighters' pay cut by up to a half.

In what would be another major blow to Islamic State, U.S. officials said on Tuesday that its ""minister of war"", Abu Omar al-Shishani, was likely killed in a U.S. air strike near the town of al-Shadadi in northeastern Syria.

The militant, also known as Omar the Chechen, had a reputation as a close military adviser to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

The Pentagon believes Shishani was sent to bolster Islamic State troops after they suffered setbacks at the hands of U.S.-allied militias including the Kurdish YPG.

The Observatory, which says it gathers its information from sources on all sides of the war, said on Thursday that Shishani was badly wounded but still alive and being treated somewhere in the group's Syrian stronghold of Raqqa province.

Recent Islamic State attacks have included suicide car bombings in the government-held cities of Damascus and Homs, and a determined but ultimately unsuccessful effort to sever the government's only land supply route to Aleppo.

Dozens of its fighters were also killed in a Feb. 27 attack on the YPG-held town of Tel Abyad at the Turkish border. A YPG official sent Reuters a list of the names of 72 IS fighters he said had been sent there on a suicide mission.

The official said Shishani's death, if true, would not be that significant because Islamic State ""is being broken by the YPG and Syria Democratic Forces with or without him"". ""It doesn't change the equation at all as far as we are concerned.""

reuters.com,2016-03-10 16:51:03+00:00,"Loss of U.S. boss seen hitting VW turnaround, but not talks with regulators",['Andreas Cremer'],"President and Chief Executive Officer of Volkswagen Group of America Michael Horn testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington October 8, 2015.

Attendees take part in the 2016 Volkswagen Passat reveal in the Brooklyn borough of New York September 21, 2015.

BERLIN The departure of Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) U.S. boss is a blow to the carmaker's attempts to revive sales after its emissions test cheating scandal, but should not disrupt its efforts to strike a deal with U.S. regulators, analysts and sources told Reuters.

Michael Horn, whose surprise departure from the helm of Volkswagen Group of America was announced late on Wednesday, was not on the teams negotiating with U.S. regulators over a fix for almost 600,000 vehicles found to be emitting up for 40 times the legal limit of pollutants, sources close to the matter said.

But he was a popular figure among U.S. dealers, who viewed him as critical to the German company's attempts to win back customers in the world's second-biggest car market.

""VW has its back to the wall, Horn's departure is happening at the most inconvenient time,"" said Arndt Ellinghorst, an analyst at banking advisory firm Evercore ISI. ""If such a key figure quits, this will inevitably cause more unrest.""

Almost six months after it admitted to installing test-rigging software, Europe's largest carmaker has still to reach an agreement with U.S. regulators on how to fix affected cars.

A federal judge has set a March 24 deadline for it to say whether it has found a fix acceptable to the authorities.

VW also faces mounting legal action - the U.S. Justice Department sued the company in January for up to $46 billion for violating environmental laws and this week sent VW a civil subpoena under a bank fraud law.

And its sales in the United States are sliding.

VW said on Wednesday Hinrich Woebcken, a former BMW (BMWG.DE) manager set to take the helm of VW's core brand in North America next month, would assume Horn's responsibilities on an interim basis.

Three sources at VW's Wolfsburg headquarters said Woebcken's appointment to the North American job may have been a factor behind Horn's departure - which VW said was a mutual decision.

Horn's resignation marks the second blow in five months to VW's efforts to assemble a management team for North America after former Skoda boss Winfried Vahland last October rejected an offer to run the VW brand there.

VW is also still looking for a senior figure to help it deal with U.S. authorities after an aborted attempt to hire ex-FBI chief Louis Freeh for that role, one of the sources said.

""VW is in a bind and it's anything but helpful to have a vacuum at the top level"" of its U.S. management, said Commerzbank analyst Sascha Gommel, who has his rating on VW shares under review.

VW sources told Reuters on Thursday it planned to cut 3,000 office jobs in Germany by the end of next year.

Horn was criticized by U.S. lawmakers in October for blaming VW's test cheating on ""a couple of software engineers.""

He said he knew in the spring of 2014 the company might be breaking U.S. emissions rules, but that he didn't know about the use of illegal ""defeat device"" software until about Sept. 3, 2015, when VW admitted cheating to U.S. regulators.

VIENNA Two months after what is widely believed to have been a nuclear test by North Korea, the radioactive particles to prove it have yet to be detected, suggesting the communist state is getting better at hiding the fallout, experts say.

Fifty-five days after North Korea's previous test in 2013, those particles, known as radionuclides, wafted over a monitoring station in Japan, proving what seismic evidence already suggested - that an atomic bomb had been detonated.

Now, 64 days after North Korea announced its latest test and seismic data appeared to confirm it, diplomats and nuclear analysts suspect final technical proof may never materialize.

""With every day that passes, it becomes less likely that we will get a conclusive analysis,"" said one diplomat who follows North Korea's nuclear program closely.

January's detonation followed three previous nuclear tests by North Korea, the last before January's was the 2013 one.

Back then, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty organisation (CTBTO), a body monitoring seismic and radionuclide data world wide, confirmed the nuclear bomb test as such by analyzing traces of the colorless, odorless noble gas xenon.

The CTBTO system can differentiate between chemical and nuclear explosions. It cannot differentiate between a standard nuclear bomb test and a hydrogen bomb test, a more powerful nuclear weapon that North Korea claimed to have used.

CTBTO head Lassina Zerbo and other diplomats have said seismic data did not indicate the test involved a hydrogen bomb.

""It can be assumed that North Korea is getting better at hiding the results of its nuclear tests, and sealing off the area where they are testing to prevent nuclides from leaking into the atmosphere,"" Mark Hibbs, nuclear expert at think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said.

Experts and diplomats caution that due to xenon's short nuclear half live it now might be too late to get such proof.

""Over 55 days after the announced nuclear test in the DPRK, several recent (...) radionuclide measurements could be consistent with either a release from a test or with other possible sources, and are therefore not conclusive,"" CTBTO's Zerbo said in an emailed statement about North Korea.

The CTBTO's analyses are based on a network of data centers across the globe which collect seismic and radionuclide data and which have in the past been the first points to pick up on North Korea testing a nuclear bomb.

Difficult weather patterns make such analyses more complex.

""The task may be even more difficult now if the North Koreans have been working to improve their nuclear explosion containment techniques,"" Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, said in an emailed statement.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 16:57:44+00:00,Exclusive: House Speaker Ryan seeks halt to presidential 'Draft Ryan' group,['Susan Cornwell'],"U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) holds a news conference after a Republican House caucus meeting at the U.S. Capitol in Washington January 6, 2016.

WASHINGTON House Speaker Paul Ryan's political operation is sending a cease-and-desist letter on Thursday to a group that is trying to draft him as a Republican presidential candidate, urging it to halt its activities and warning of legal risk.

With establishment Republicans desperately searching for a way to stop Donald Trump's march toward the party's 2016 presidential nomination, Ryan's name has been mentioned often as an alternative. But he has said he does not want to run for president this year and has disavowed the Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan group.

The organization has continued attempts to collect 1 million signatures on an online petition to draft Ryan, arguing that the very definition of a draft movement is to encourage a reluctant participant to join.

The Draft Ryan group, which registered with U.S. Federal Election Commission as a Super PAC, was another indication of Ryan's rise to the Republican Party's top ranks since he became speaker last year. Ryan was Mitt Romney's vice presidential running mate on the Republicans' 2012 ticket.

A spokesman for the group, David Catalfamo, said it had not yet received the letter from the Ryan camp, but that ""as reported, its a sad commentary on the state of our politics today.

""The Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan is simply a patriotic effort to save our party and save our country, Catalfamo said.

Timothy Kronquist, an attorney for Ryan's political operation, addressed the letter to the group's treasurer, David Satterfield. It urged the organization to immediately cease and desist from any representations that it is acting on Ryan's behalf or raising funds that would assist Ryan's campaign activities.

""We believe the actions of your organization are not in compliance with federal law and may constitute fraudulent solicitation of funds,"" the letter said.

""Speaker Ryan has repeatedly announced publicly that he is not running for president in 2016 ... It is in the public interest for your organization to cease potentially confusing and misleading people into supporting your organization.""

A copy of the letter, which was dated Thursday, was seen by Reuters.

Dividing the party, Trump has racked up primary wins and expanded his lead this week despite attacks from the party's establishment, which is trying to stop him from claiming the nomination at the Republican convention in July.

Ryan has abstained from endorsing any presidential candidate in the 2016 race.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 07:02:18+00:00,Frequent flyer Hamilton moves on to another plane,['Alan Baldwin'],"LONDON Lewis Hamilton can become Britain's first four-times Formula One world champion this season, but some former racers fear the Mercedes driver's celebrity lifestyle could make the task harder.

The 31-year-old, who has risen from an under-privileged background to global superstardom, spends much of his down time in the United States with Hollywood and music A-listers.

From Super Bowl with Jay Z, to Hollywood parties and New York fashion shows, he is living a life that few of the current crop of drivers have access to or are up for.

German team mate Nico Rosberg, rival and championship runner-up for the past two seasons but winner of last year's final three races, is more likely to stay home with his wife and baby daughter.

Ferrari's four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel, a father of two who is likely to be Mercedes' biggest threat this year, lives in Switzerland where he keeps his family out of the public eye.

Both are fully focussed on beating the Briton.

""It seems crazy to question whether Lewis can win another title, given that he's won the last two,"" former racer turned television pundit David Coulthard told British reporters.

""But you have to ask where his energy is going...There is no question that Lewis is fit and focussed when he's at the racetrack. But he does have a full-on social life away from grand prix racing.

""We all know it's not easy jumping on and off aircraft. Is this the year that's going to take it's toll?""

That may be wishful thinking from someone who still represents Red Bull, the dominant team before Mercedes, but the Scot is not alone in expressing concern.

When Hamilton was at McLaren, where he won his first championship in 2008, he was kept on a tight leash but since he joined Mercedes in 2013 he has been allowed to be himself.

He now has more money than he knows what to do with, a collection of supercars, a house in Colorado, an apartment in Monte Carlo and a bright red private jet.

He has gone skiing with U.S. Olympic champion Lindsey Vonn and been filmed driving Justin Bieber around Beverley Hills in a LaFerrari supercar.

SOMEWHERE ELSE

""I feel I know him less today than I knew him 15 years ago,"" says former racer and Sky television commentator Martin Brundle. ""He's moved on to a new level and I don't say that in any way as a criticism.

""The Lewis I knew as a racer has moved into a whole sphere of life that I don't have access to, don't know and don't understand. He seems like he's gone somewhere else, to me.""

After completing huge amounts of mileage in the first pre-season test in Barcelona on the Thursday, Hamilton flew to Los Angeles for an Oscars party before testing resumed on Tuesday.

As his 2.5 million followers on Instagram are well aware, he then went to Paris where he was photographed with ex-Beatle Paul McCartney at Stella McCartney's fashion show. On Saturday, he was at Vivienne Westwood's.

If some traditionalists would rather he spent more time in the factory talking to engineers, which he also does, F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone is delighted and Hamilton sees no need to change anything.

""I try to find a balance in my life,"" the Briton, who also spends many hours making music in the recording studio, told the official formula1.com website last month.

""Sure, you need to be recharged and have full batteries for the season. And yes, the lifestyle that I live is definitely different to the other drivers. But who says that it has to be the way they are doing things?

""My style works perfectly for me. It's all about enjoying every moment. I move as much as I can...and do my job in the best way I can.""

Brundle echoed Coulthard's comments but felt sure Hamilton's relentless desire to win was as strong as ever.

Mercedes have won 32 of the last 38 grands prix and Hamilton accounts for 21 of them -- 10 in 2015 and 11 in 2014. A drop off in form at the end of last season came only after he had clinched his third championship in Texas.

""I believe he gave Rosberg a confidence and a self-belief that he didn't ought to be letting him have,"" said Brundle of those last three races.

""(But) I think that street-fighting Lewis will be a greater opposition (in Australia) than he was at the end of last year when he relaxed because the championship was in his pocket.""

LONDON A hair's breadth separated Leicester City and Newcastle United at the end of the relegation battle last season but a 36-point chasm and a gulf in confidence exists between the sides ahead of Monday's Premier League clash.

With Leicester's title challenge showing no sign of wilting as the inevitable pressure of the run-in continues to mount, Newcastle's season is seemingly skidding towards the abyss.

It is by no means certain that Newcastle manager Steve McClaren will still be in the dugout for the game at Leicester's King Power Stadium with his immediate future up in the air.

A scheduled meeting with managing director Lee Charnley did not take place on Wednesday, according to media reports, with former Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez strongly linked to the role should the club decide to end McClaren's stay at St James' Park.

Despite spending heavily in the transfer window, Newcastle are 19th in the table having been in the bottom three for 146 days this season.

On paper they should be little more than cannon fodder for Claudio Ranieri's Leicester, who have won five of the last seven to open a five-point lead at the summit as their more-fancied rivals have all stumbled.

Confounding their doubters on a weekly basis, Leicester, who finished 14th and two points above Newcastle last season, are looking more like champions every match they play.

They came through a testing February when they played Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal and now need only to keep their heads over the final nine games to claim one of the most remarkable title triumphs in English football history.

They could find their lead cut to two points, however, by the time they take the field against Newcastle as second-placed Tottenham Hotspur visit doomed bottom club Aston Villa on Sunday.

Spurs, who face a testing trip to Borussia Dortmund in the Europa League on Thursday, need to get back to winning ways swiftly if they are to maintain their pursuit, having taken just one point from their last two games.

It is a similar story for Manchester City, whose fading title hopes probably could not survive a defeat at Norwich City on Saturday.

City bounced back from a 3-0 defeat by Liverpool with a thumping 4-0 victory over Villa, but still trail Leicester by 10 points, although they do have a game in hand.

Third-placed Arsenal, whose challenge has fallen away in recent weeks after three games without a victory, are likely to drop further behind as they play Watford in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Sunday.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 16:51:03+00:00,"Loss of U.S. boss seen hitting VW turnaround, but not talks with regulators",['Andreas Cremer'],"President and Chief Executive Officer of Volkswagen Group of America Michael Horn testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington October 8, 2015.

Attendees take part in the 2016 Volkswagen Passat reveal in the Brooklyn borough of New York September 21, 2015.

BERLIN The departure of Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) U.S. boss is a blow to the carmaker's attempts to revive sales after its emissions test cheating scandal, but should not disrupt its efforts to strike a deal with U.S. regulators, analysts and sources told Reuters.

Michael Horn, whose surprise departure from the helm of Volkswagen Group of America was announced late on Wednesday, was not on the teams negotiating with U.S. regulators over a fix for almost 600,000 vehicles found to be emitting up for 40 times the legal limit of pollutants, sources close to the matter said.

But he was a popular figure among U.S. dealers, who viewed him as critical to the German company's attempts to win back customers in the world's second-biggest car market.

""VW has its back to the wall, Horn's departure is happening at the most inconvenient time,"" said Arndt Ellinghorst, an analyst at banking advisory firm Evercore ISI. ""If such a key figure quits, this will inevitably cause more unrest.""

Almost six months after it admitted to installing test-rigging software, Europe's largest carmaker has still to reach an agreement with U.S. regulators on how to fix affected cars.

A federal judge has set a March 24 deadline for it to say whether it has found a fix acceptable to the authorities.

VW also faces mounting legal action - the U.S. Justice Department sued the company in January for up to $46 billion for violating environmental laws and this week sent VW a civil subpoena under a bank fraud law.

And its sales in the United States are sliding.

VW said on Wednesday Hinrich Woebcken, a former BMW (BMWG.DE) manager set to take the helm of VW's core brand in North America next month, would assume Horn's responsibilities on an interim basis.

Three sources at VW's Wolfsburg headquarters said Woebcken's appointment to the North American job may have been a factor behind Horn's departure - which VW said was a mutual decision.

Horn's resignation marks the second blow in five months to VW's efforts to assemble a management team for North America after former Skoda boss Winfried Vahland last October rejected an offer to run the VW brand there.

VW is also still looking for a senior figure to help it deal with U.S. authorities after an aborted attempt to hire ex-FBI chief Louis Freeh for that role, one of the sources said.

""VW is in a bind and it's anything but helpful to have a vacuum at the top level"" of its U.S. management, said Commerzbank analyst Sascha Gommel, who has his rating on VW shares under review.

VW sources told Reuters on Thursday it planned to cut 3,000 office jobs in Germany by the end of next year.

Horn was criticized by U.S. lawmakers in October for blaming VW's test cheating on ""a couple of software engineers.""

He said he knew in the spring of 2014 the company might be breaking U.S. emissions rules, but that he didn't know about the use of illegal ""defeat device"" software until about Sept. 3, 2015, when VW admitted cheating to U.S. regulators.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 17:01:40+00:00,North Korean nuclear test shook the earth but where's the proper proof?,['Shadia Nasralla'],"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaks during a ceremony to award party and state commendations to nuclear scientists, technicians, soldier-builders, workers and officials for their contribution to what North Korea said was a succesful hydrogen bomb test, at the meeting hall...

VIENNA Two months after what is widely believed to have been a nuclear test by North Korea, the radioactive particles to prove it have yet to be detected, suggesting the communist state is getting better at hiding the fallout, experts say.

Fifty-five days after North Korea's previous test in 2013, those particles, known as radionuclides, wafted over a monitoring station in Japan, proving what seismic evidence already suggested - that an atomic bomb had been detonated.

Now, 64 days after North Korea announced its latest test and seismic data appeared to confirm it, diplomats and nuclear analysts suspect final technical proof may never materialize.

""With every day that passes, it becomes less likely that we will get a conclusive analysis,"" said one diplomat who follows North Korea's nuclear program closely.

January's detonation followed three previous nuclear tests by North Korea, the last before January's was the 2013 one.

Back then, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty organisation (CTBTO), a body monitoring seismic and radionuclide data world wide, confirmed the nuclear bomb test as such by analyzing traces of the colorless, odorless noble gas xenon.

The CTBTO system can differentiate between chemical and nuclear explosions. It cannot differentiate between a standard nuclear bomb test and a hydrogen bomb test, a more powerful nuclear weapon that North Korea claimed to have used.

CTBTO head Lassina Zerbo and other diplomats have said seismic data did not indicate the test involved a hydrogen bomb.

""It can be assumed that North Korea is getting better at hiding the results of its nuclear tests, and sealing off the area where they are testing to prevent nuclides from leaking into the atmosphere,"" Mark Hibbs, nuclear expert at think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said.

Experts and diplomats caution that due to xenon's short nuclear half live it now might be too late to get such proof.

""Over 55 days after the announced nuclear test in the DPRK, several recent (...) radionuclide measurements could be consistent with either a release from a test or with other possible sources, and are therefore not conclusive,"" CTBTO's Zerbo said in an emailed statement about North Korea.

The CTBTO's analyses are based on a network of data centers across the globe which collect seismic and radionuclide data and which have in the past been the first points to pick up on North Korea testing a nuclear bomb.

Difficult weather patterns make such analyses more complex.

""The task may be even more difficult now if the North Koreans have been working to improve their nuclear explosion containment techniques,"" Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, said in an emailed statement.

LONDON Racket firm Head has extended its contract with five-times grand slam champion Maria Sharapova despite her failed drugs test at this year's Australian Open, CEO Johan Eliasch said on Thursday.

The 28-year-old Russian will be provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) from this weekend after she admitted at a news conference on Monday taking the banned substance meldonium.

Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer cut ties with Sharapova this week, while Nike and Porsche have distanced themselves from her.

However, Eliasch said Sharapova, under contract with Head since 2011, had 'earned the benefit of the doubt' after making an 'honest' mistake.

""For a decade Maria Sharapova has been a role model and woman of integrity who has inspired millions of fans around the world to play and watch tennis,"" he said in a statement.

""The honesty and courage she displayed in announcing and acknowledging her mistake was admirable. HEAD is proud to stand behind Maria, now and into the future and we intend to extend her contract.

""We look forward to working with her and to announcing new sponsorships in the weeks and months ahead.""

A statement issued later confirmed that the contract had been signed and extended.

In Los Angeles on Monday, Sharapova said she had been taking meldonium, also known as mildronate, for 10 years because of health problems and regular bouts of flu.

The drug, produced in Latvia but unavailable for purchase in the United States where Sharapova is based, was only added to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list of banned substances in January, shortly before her positive test in Melbourne.

Manufactured for people suffering from heart problems, it can also increase blood flow and improve exercise capacity.

Head said they were convinced Sharapova had not taken the drug to gain any competitive advantage.

""It is common ground within the scientific community that in order for meldonium to have any relevant performance enhancing effect it has to be taken in daily dosages in excess of 1,000 to 2,000mg,"" the statement said.

""According to the attorney for Maria, her dosage was significantly less than that.""

While underlining Head's commitment to clean sport, Eliasch said he trusted Sharapova's explanation that she had not realised meldonium had been banned by WADA.

""In the absence of any evidence of any intent by Maria of enhancing her performance or trying to gain an unfair advantage through the use of mildronate, we further conclude this falls into the category of 'honest' mistakes,"" he said.

Russian biathlete Eduard Latypov was suspended from competition on Thursday after testing positive for meldonium, the latest in a flurry of athletes to fall foul of the drug since it was prohibited.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 17:10:28+00:00,Syria air strikes target Islamic State in ancient Palmyra,['Tom Perry'],"Tourists take pictures at the ancient Palmyra theater in the historical city of Palmyra, Syria in this April 18, 2008 file photo.

BEIRUT Russian warplanes were said to have launched heavy strikes on the Islamic State-held city of Palmyra on Thursday in what may be a prelude to a Syrian government bid to recapture the historic site lost to the jihadist group last May.

Dozens of Islamic State fighters were killed or wounded in the strikes that followed similarly heavy air raids in the Palmyra area on Wednesday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported.

The attacks add to the pressure on a group that is losing ground to a separate, U.S.-backed campaign by Syrian militia in the northeast, and whose military commander was declared probably dead by U.S. officials on Tuesday.

The group's tactics in Syria appear to reflect the strains, as it turns to suicide missions seemingly aimed at causing maximum casualties rather than sustainable territorial gains.

Islamic State is not included in a cessation of hostilities agreement that has brought about a lull in the war raging in western Syria between rebels aiming to topple President Bashar al-Assad and the Syrian army backed by the Russian air force.

Military operations against Islamic State in central and eastern Syria are continuing as both Damascus and its allies on one hand, and the United States and its allies on the other, seek to degrade Islamic State's self-declared ""caliphate"" that stretches into Iraq.

The Observatory said Russian war planes carried out 150 raids in the Palmyra area on Wednesday, followed by further attacks on Thursday. ""If they take Tadmur (Palmyra) and Qarayatain, the regime would have taken back a big geographic area of Syria,"" said Observatory Director Rami Abdulrahman.

The loss of Qaraytain and Palmyra and the surrounding desert would reduce Islamic State's hold to about 20 percent of Syria.

Qarayatain is 100 km (60 miles) southwest of Palmyra. After capturing Palmyra, Islamic State blew up some of its ancient monuments in what the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO called a war crime.

Islamic State however appears well-entrenched in Palmyra, and while recovering the city would be a big boost for Damascus, its priority may be elsewhere for now, including the border with Turkey where it has been fighting rebels despite the truce.

FINANCES UNDER STRAIN

The momentum has turned against Islamic State since its rapid advances two years ago following the capture of the Iraqi city of Mosul. Its finances are also under strain, with fighters' pay cut by up to a half.

In what would be another major blow to Islamic State, U.S. officials said on Tuesday that its ""minister of war"", Abu Omar al-Shishani, was likely killed in a U.S. air strike near the town of al-Shadadi in northeastern Syria.

The militant, also known as Omar the Chechen, had a reputation as a close military adviser to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

The Pentagon believes Shishani was sent to bolster Islamic State troops after they suffered setbacks at the hands of U.S.-allied militias including the Kurdish YPG.

The Observatory, which says it gathers its information from sources on all sides of the war, said on Thursday that Shishani was badly wounded but still alive and being treated somewhere in the group's Syrian stronghold of Raqqa province.

Recent Islamic State attacks have included suicide car bombings in the government-held cities of Damascus and Homs, and a determined but ultimately unsuccessful effort to sever the government's only land supply route to Aleppo.

Dozens of its fighters were also killed in a Feb. 27 attack on the YPG-held town of Tel Abyad at the Turkish border. A YPG official sent Reuters a list of the names of 72 IS fighters he said had been sent there on a suicide mission.

The official said Shishani's death, if true, would not be that significant because Islamic State ""is being broken by the YPG and Syria Democratic Forces with or without him"". ""It doesn't change the equation at all as far as we are concerned.""

reuters.com,2016-03-10 17:14:01+00:00,Exclusive: House Speaker Ryan seeks halt to presidential 'Draft Ryan' group,['Susan Cornwell'],"U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) holds a news conference after a Republican House caucus meeting at the U.S. Capitol in Washington January 6, 2016.

WASHINGTON House Speaker Paul Ryan's political operation is sending a cease-and-desist letter on Thursday to a group that is trying to draft him as a Republican presidential candidate, urging it to halt its activities and warning of legal risk.

With establishment Republicans desperately searching for a way to stop Donald Trump's march toward the party's 2016 presidential nomination, Ryan's name has been mentioned often as an alternative. But he has said he does not want to run for president this year and has disavowed the Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan group.

The organization has continued attempts to collect 1 million signatures on an online petition to draft Ryan, arguing that the very definition of a draft movement is to encourage a reluctant participant to join.

The Draft Ryan group, which registered with U.S. Federal Election Commission as a Super PAC, was another indication of Ryan's rise to the Republican Party's top ranks since he became speaker last year. Ryan was Mitt Romney's vice presidential running mate on the Republicans' 2012 ticket.

A spokesman for the group, David Catalfamo, said it had not yet received the letter from the Ryan camp, but that ""as reported, its a sad commentary on the state of our politics today.

""The Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan is simply a patriotic effort to save our party and save our country, Catalfamo said.

Timothy Kronquist, an attorney for Ryan's political operation, addressed the letter to the group's treasurer, David Satterfield. It urged the organization to immediately cease and desist from any representations that it is acting on Ryan's behalf or raising funds that would assist Ryan's campaign activities.

""We believe the actions of your organization are not in compliance with federal law and may constitute fraudulent solicitation of funds,"" the letter said.

""Speaker Ryan has repeatedly announced publicly that he is not running for president in 2016 ... It is in the public interest for your organization to cease potentially confusing and misleading people into supporting your organization.""

A copy of the letter, which was dated Thursday, was seen by Reuters.

Dividing the party, Trump has racked up primary wins and expanded his lead this week despite attacks from the party's establishment, which is trying to stop him from claiming the nomination at the Republican convention in July.

Ryan has abstained from endorsing any presidential candidate in the 2016 race.

E' quanto dicono tre fonti vicine alla situazione.

L'indiscrezione sta rimbalzando da alcuni giorni sulla stampa nazionale. Ma, di fatto, era nell'aria sin da quando il controllo di Icbpi e passato agli operatori di private equity Bain Capital, Advent International e Clessidra.

Una fonte, nei mesi scorsi, indicava come potenziali target, per la 'nuova Icbpi', Sia e Bassilichi. La prima sarebbe il vero oggetto dei desideri degli azionisti della societa a cui fa capo CartaSi, che, pero, stando a piu fonti, si sono visti la strada sbarrata da vari fattori (concorrenziale, volonta di Bankitalia di non vedere un asset strategico nelle mani di fondi esteri).

Cosi, Sia sta seguendo la strada che dovrebbe portarla a Piazza Affari.

A questo punto, lo sguardo di Bain, Advent e Clessidra (che per Icbpi, inoltre, pensano a uno sviluppo all'estero) si e rivolto a Bassilichi.

Il gruppo toscano attivo nella monetica, inserito nel progetto Elite di Borsa Italiana, pareva a sua volta avviato verso la quotazione.

Le condizioni dei mercati, pero, sono tali da rendere difficili le Ipo quest'anno. E gli azionisti finanziari di Bassilichi da tempo sono in attesa di monetizzare almeno in parte l'investimento.

Negli anni scorsi Bassilichi aveva avviato colloqui con almeno un paio di operatori di private equity per aprirvi le porte del capitale. Secondo diverse fonti, le trattative erano state avviate con Permira e con Clessidra; quest'ultima, dunque, conosce l'asset molto bene.

L'ipotesi di un riassetto azionario e finita nel cassetto nel 2014, quando Bassilichi ha acquisito dal Monte dei Paschi di Siena, storico partner e azionista (11,74%), l'attivita di back office, dando vita a Fruendo (60% Bassilichi, 40% Accenture), una mossa che ha decisamente incrementato il personale e reso meno appetibile l'asset, dato l'appesantimento della struttura di costi, agli occhi del private equity.

Indossati i panni di Icbpi, pero, Clessidra torna a farsi avanti.

""Le trattative sono in corso"", dicono le fonti, concordi nel definire l'operazione ""grande, delicata e complessa"".

Una delle fonti fa notare che ""ci sono tanti soggetti in gioco"". Un'altra sottolinea i tempi lunghi dell'iter autorizzativo. Una terza, pero, indica ""il primo semestre"" come traguardo auspicabile per la firma dell'accordo.

L'attuale azionariato di Bassilichi vede, oltre a Mps, la famiglia Bassilichi al 23,5%, MPVenture Sgr (che non ha piu nulla a che fare con Mps) al 19% (attraverso il veicolo Arno 1), Sici Sgr (attraverso i fondi Toscana Venture e Centro Invest) al 16,29%, la Finanziaria Senese di Sviluppo al 12,84%, Banca Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna all'8,87% e altri soci al 3,8%. Infine, ci sono azioni proprie pari al 3,96% del capitale.

Una delle fonti riferisce che ""non e detto"" che gli azionisti finanziari escano completamente dal capitale nel quadro dell'operazione.

Icbpi vede l'85,29% del capitale in mano a Mercury Italy, veicolo partecipato da Bain, Advent e Clessidra (i pesi sono grosso modo 40-40-20), mentre un gruppo di banche, tra cui Bper (presente anche in Bassilichi), controlla l'8,4%.

Bassilichi ha chiuso il 2014 (ultimo bilancio disponibile) con ricavi pari a 320 milioni.

Nessun commento da parte di Bassilichi e Icbpi.

In his 2015 book ""Merchants in the Temple,"" Italian author Gianluigi Nuzzi wrote that a commission looking into Vatican finances found that the church's saint-making office had little or no documentation of funds used by postulators, the chief promoters of candidatures.

Nuzzi, who is now on trial in the Vatican for publishing leaked documents, wrote that about a million euros ($1.1 million) in suspect funds held by a postulator in the Vatican bank was frozen in 2014.

The new decree stipulates that contributions from the faithful and groups must go into an account and be managed by an administrator. The administrator must ""scrupulously respect the intentions"" of contributors, keep detailed documentation, and present budgets to a superior.

In his book, Nuzzi wrote that a single sainthood could cost 750,000 euros. The new norms provide for the creation of a ""solidarity fund"" to help candidates from poor areas.

The 21-article decree demands more financial vigilance at each stage of the process, which usually starts in a local diocese after a preliminary investigation.

The church posthumously confers sainthood on people who are believed to have been sufficiently holy during their lives that they are now in heaven and can intercede with God to perform miracles.

If the Vatican agrees that someone is a possible candidate, years of investigation begin. If a miracle, usually an inexplicable healing of a sick person, is attributed to the candidate, he or she is beatified. The final step, canonisation, requires a second miracle.

Human Rights Council,"['Stephanie Nebehay', 'Tom Miles']","GENEVA China strongly rejected U.S.-led criticism of its human rights record at the U.N. Human Rights Council on Thursday, saying the United States was hypocritical and guilty of crimes including the rape and murder of civilians.

""The U.S. is notorious for prison abuse at Guantanamo prison, its gun violence is rampant, racism is its deep-rooted malaise,"" Chinese diplomat Fu Cong told the Council, using unusually blunt language.

""The United States conducts large-scale extra-territorial eavesdropping, uses drones to attack other countries' innocent civilians, its troops on foreign soil commit rape and murder of local people. It conducts kidnapping overseas and uses black prisons.""

Fu was responding to a joint statement by the United States and 11 other countries, who criticised China's crackdown on human rights and its detentions of lawyers and activists.

""These actions are in contravention of China's own laws and international commitments,"" said U.S. Ambassador Keith Harper, who read out the statement backed by Australia, Japan and nine northern European countries.

""These extra-territorial actions are unacceptable, out of step with the expectations of the international community, and a challenge to the rule-based international order.""

Harper read the statement straight after U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein gave his main annual speech to the council. He recalled his message to China in mid-February, when he cited a ""very worrying pattern"" of detentions.

Fu said Zeid should ""refrain from making subjective comments not backed up by real facts"".

He also criticised Japan's support for the joint statement, saying Japan had refused to take responsibility for conscripting 100,000 ""comfort women"" in Asian countries during World War Two.

In China's crackdown, police have detained about 250 human rights lawyers, legal assistants, and activists since a nationwide crackdown began last July, although many have subsequently been released.

Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, said the message delivered by Harper was the first collective joint statement on China in the 10 history of the council.

""The statement shows that while President Xi may think he can eradicate dissent at home, the world stands with embattled human rights defenders across China,"" she said in a statement.

Republican U.S. presidential candidate Ted Cruz speaks during a campaign event at Central Baptist Church in Kannapolis, North Carolina, March 8, 2016.

WASHINGTON White House hopefuls Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and 13 other Republican U.S. senators on Thursday demanded that Islamic State fighters be sent to the Guantanamo Bay detention center, which would boost its population as President Barack Obama moves to close it.

The lawmakers introduced a resolution expressing the need to detain the fighters at the controversial military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after reports that U.S. special operations forces had captured leaders of the militant group.

""There should be no confusion in the minds of our enemies that, if captured, they will be sent to the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay to be interrogated,"" Rubio said in a statement.

Rubio, Cruz, billionaire front-runner Donald Trump and Ohio Governor John Kasich face off in a presidential debate on Thursday night in Miami.

The resolution was led by Senator Steve Daines. In addition to Rubio and Cruz, the co-sponsors were Senators Jerry Moran, Cory Gardner, Tom Cotton, Mark Kirk, Orrin Hatch, Joni Ernst, Johnny Isakson, John Boozman, Pat Roberts, Jim Inhofe, Tim Scott and David Vitter.

The measure would be nonbinding but underscores the strong resistance in the Republican-controlled Congress toward Obama's efforts to close the detention camp.

Obama launched a final push to persuade Congress to close the detention center for suspected members of groups such as al Qaeda last month.

The Obama administration has been trying for years to make good on a pledge the president made at the beginning of his first term in 2009 to close the facility but has faced stiff political opposition.

Republican lawmakers insist the prison is an essential tool for holding and interrogating suspects who threaten the United States. Opponents of the detention center say that holding prisoners for years without charge or trial is a human rights violation that goes against fundamental U.S. values and potentially endangers American military personnel.

Berlin/Munchen Durch die Beschrankungen fur Fluchtlinge entlang der Balkanroute bleibt die Zahl der Einreisen nach Deutschland auf einem sehr niedrigen Niveau.

Am Mittwoch verzeichnete die Bundespolizei den zweitniedrigsten Tageswert in diesem Jahr. 125 Menschen seien im Bundesgebiet angekommen, davon 89 in Bayern, sagte ein Sprecher der Behorde am Donnerstag in Potsdam. Am Dienstag waren es deutschlandweit 162 Personen. Im Marz kamen bislang im Schnitt knapp 313 Migranten pro Tag nach Deutschland. Der bisher niedrigste Tageswert im Jahr 2016 wurde mit 103 Einreisen am 23. Februar ermittelt.

VIENNA Two months after what is widely believed to have been a nuclear test by North Korea, the radioactive particles to prove it have yet to be detected, suggesting the communist state is getting better at hiding the fallout, experts say.

Fifty-five days after North Korea's previous test in 2013, those particles, known as radionuclides, wafted over a monitoring station in Japan, proving what seismic evidence already suggested - that an atomic bomb had been detonated.

Now, 64 days after North Korea announced its latest test and seismic data appeared to confirm it, diplomats and nuclear analysts suspect final technical proof may never materialize.

""With every day that passes, it becomes less likely that we will get a conclusive analysis,"" said one diplomat who follows North Korea's nuclear program closely.

January's detonation followed three previous nuclear tests by North Korea, the last before January's was the 2013 one.

Back then, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty organisation (CTBTO), a body monitoring seismic and radionuclide data world wide, confirmed the nuclear bomb test as such by analyzing traces of the colorless, odorless noble gas xenon.

The CTBTO system can differentiate between chemical and nuclear explosions. It cannot differentiate between a standard nuclear bomb test and a hydrogen bomb test, a more powerful nuclear weapon that North Korea claimed to have used.

CTBTO head Lassina Zerbo and other diplomats have said seismic data did not indicate the test involved a hydrogen bomb.

""It can be assumed that North Korea is getting better at hiding the results of its nuclear tests, and sealing off the area where they are testing to prevent nuclides from leaking into the atmosphere,"" Mark Hibbs, nuclear expert at think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said.

Experts and diplomats caution that due to xenon's short nuclear half live it now might be too late to get such proof.

""Over 55 days after the announced nuclear test in the DPRK, several recent (...) radionuclide measurements could be consistent with either a release from a test or with other possible sources, and are therefore not conclusive,"" CTBTO's Zerbo said in an emailed statement about North Korea.

The CTBTO's analyses are based on a network of data centers across the globe which collect seismic and radionuclide data and which have in the past been the first points to pick up on North Korea testing a nuclear bomb.

Difficult weather patterns make such analyses more complex.

""The task may be even more difficult now if the North Koreans have been working to improve their nuclear explosion containment techniques,"" Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, said in an emailed statement.

WASHINGTON House Speaker Paul Ryan's political operation is sending a cease-and-desist letter on Thursday to a group that is trying to draft him as a Republican presidential candidate, urging it to halt its activities and warning of legal risk.

With establishment Republicans desperately searching for a way to stop Donald Trump's march toward the party's 2016 presidential nomination, Ryan's name has been mentioned often as an alternative. But he has said he does not want to run for president this year and has disavowed the Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan group.

The organization has continued attempts to collect 1 million signatures on an online petition to draft Ryan, arguing that the very definition of a draft movement is to encourage a reluctant participant to join.

The Draft Ryan group, which registered with U.S. Federal Election Commission as a Super PAC, was another indication of Ryan's rise to the Republican Party's top ranks since he became speaker last year. Ryan was Mitt Romney's vice presidential running mate on the Republicans' 2012 ticket.

A spokesman for the group, David Catalfamo, said it had not yet received the letter from the Ryan camp, but that ""as reported, its a sad commentary on the state of our politics today.

""The Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan is simply a patriotic effort to save our party and save our country, Catalfamo said.

Timothy Kronquist, an attorney for Ryan's political operation, addressed the letter to the group's treasurer, David Satterfield. It urged the organization to immediately cease and desist from any representations that it is acting on Ryan's behalf or raising funds that would assist Ryan's campaign activities.

""We believe the actions of your organization are not in compliance with federal law and may constitute fraudulent solicitation of funds,"" the letter said.

""Speaker Ryan has repeatedly announced publicly that he is not running for president in 2016 ... It is in the public interest for your organization to cease potentially confusing and misleading people into supporting your organization.""

A copy of the letter, which was dated Thursday, was seen by Reuters.

Dividing the party, Trump has racked up primary wins and expanded his lead this week despite attacks from the party's establishment, which is trying to stop him from claiming the nomination at the Republican convention in July.

Ryan has abstained from endorsing any presidential candidate in the 2016 race.

KAMPALA A call for an economic boycott by Uganda's opposition to protest last month's re-election of long-serving President Yoweri Museveni was mostly ignored on Thursday, despite widespread anger over allegations of vote rigging.

The protest's flop was widely expected in a country where grinding poverty is pervasive, though it also underscored the tough choices facing Museveni's opponents as they seek to thwart an election victory they say was secured fraudulently.

""Museveni is my worst enemy,"" Herbert Tumusiime, a porter at a construction site in Kampala told Reuters. ""I am ready to help whoever is fighting him. But if I don't turn up for work even one day, I will be fired.""

Uganda's electoral commission declared Museveni - in power since 1986 - the winner of the Feb. 18 poll after taking 60 percent of the votes.

The integrity of the election, however, was heavily criticized by monitors from the European Union (EU) who pointed to an ""intimidating atmosphere"" orchestrated by state actors.

They cited other irregularities including voter bribery and delayed voting and also criticized the electoral body which they said lacked transparency and independence.

Early this week Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) the party of Museveni's main opposition rival, Kizza Besigye, asked its supporters to stay at home every Thursday to undermine Museveni's government.

Besigye came second with 35 percent of the vote but he rejected the results and described the election as a sham.

He has been under virtual house arrest since polling day and has been detained each time he has attempted to leave.

""We're calling on Ugandans to stay home every Thursday,"" FDC spokesperson Semujju Nganda said. ""It's to show solidarity with our leader but also non-cooperation and boycott of the regime.""

In Kampala, there was little sign of a positive response to that entreaty, with most businesses running normally.

Heavy security deployments have also been maintained in parts of Kampala since election day.

Protests in Uganda are rarely permitted, most of them dispersed with teargas, gunfire, beatings and arrests.

Gerald Karuhanga, an independent legislator and Museveni critic told Reuters a stay-at-home economic boycott was an inappropriate and ineffective protest tool in a country where most youths already are unemployed and stay home.

""People live on the edge. An economic boycott? They have no economic means to boycott with.""

Columbia Pipeline Group owns and operates about 15,000 miles of natural gas pipelines, connecting the U.S. Gulf Coast to the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast United States.

TransCanada suffered a major setback in November when U.S. President Barack Obama blocked the cross-border Keystone XL pipeline in a victory for environmentalists who campaigned against the project for more than seven years.

The company's proposed Energy East oil pipeline also faced a setback this month, when the Quebec government filed a motion for an injunction to ensure that the pipeline complied with the province's environmental laws.

The Energy East project is opposed by environmentalists concerned about the risk of spills and the likelihood the pipeline would spur development of Alberta's carbon-intensive oil sands.

Britain's Prince William has a snowball thrown at him by his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, during their skiing break in the French Alps, in this pool photograph dated March 3, 2016, and released in London March 7, 2016.

Britain's Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, pose with their children Princess Charlotte and Prince George (2nd R), during their skiing break in the French Alps, in this pool photograph dated March 3, 2016, and released in London March 7, 2016.

LONDON For the last six years, Prince William and his wife Kate have been the darlings of the world's media, gracing the front pages of newspapers and magazines across the globe with their good looks, easy charm and two photogenic children to boot.

In the last month, however, their royal luster has dimmed in the British press as they face accusations of laziness and enjoying the high life while shirking official duties.

""In the blinking of an eye, Prince William has gone from goodie-two-shoes who can do no wrong, to lazy layabout, not pulling his weight, spending too much time with his children and choosing to live in his hideaway in Norfolk,"" royal biographer Penny Junor wrote in the Daily Telegraph.

Ever since the couple's engagement in 2010 and sumptuous wedding the year after, they have been global celebrities, with Kate considered a fashion icon and William feted for his military service, devotion to family and latterly his work as an air ambulance helicopter pilot.

But William and his younger brother Harry have made little secret of their disdain for newspapers, fueled by the death of their mother Princess Diana, who was killed in a 1997 crash as her car fled chasing paparazzi on motorbikes.

In the background there have been grumblings about the royal family's desire to control what appears in the media, and last month the usually gushing British press turned on 'Wills and Kate', as the couple are often called.

It began when the second-in-line to the throne delivered a speech to British diplomats talking about the importance of Britain working with other nations, comments taken by some as tacit support for Britain staying in the European Union ahead of a June referendum.

Under Britain's unwritten constitution, the royal family are supposed to stay out of political matters, and with some papers holding a fairly eurosceptic editorial line, William's comments led to criticism - and personal attacks.

""Meddling Wills is throne idle"", wrote Rupert Murdoch's top-selling Sun tabloid which detailed how the queen, 89, and her 94-year-old husband Prince Philip had carried out hundreds more royal engagements than him in 2015.

The Sun is typically a strong supporter of the monarchy and other usually pro-royal papers also followed suit.

So when William's office Kensington Palace on Monday released pictures of the prince, Kate and children George and Charlotte playing in the snow on a four-day secret skiing holiday, instead of the usual happy headlines, the photos received an icier response.

""Busy? I'm snowed under,"" the Sun splashed on its front page, while the Daily Mail headlined its story ""Part-time Wills slopes off with Kate and kids"".

Junor said William was far from lazy, while fellow royal biographer Robert Lacey said he suspected the prince would have had the queen's approval for prioritizing his young family, as her own family had to take a back seat when she ascended the throne aged just 25.

Lacey said he doubted the criticism would last.

""Young royals are very popular and old royals are very popular, but when you're in the middle ,approaching middle age and losing your hair, you have to work and be seen to work,"" Lacey told Reuters.

""I have no doubt that this is a temporary situation. William will step up to the plate.""

JOHANNESBURG South Africa's rand weakened on Thursday, weighed down by poor economic data, after surrendering brief gains made on the back of the European Central Bank's (ECB) decision to expand its stimulus programme.

Stocks also ended slightly lower, with insurer Sanlam topping the decliners' list after it posted a below-average increase in annual profit.

By 1545 GMT the rand was 0.7 percent weaker at 15.2955 to the dollar. The unit briefly touched a three-month high against the euro before reversing sharply, weakening 2.6 percent to 17.1542.

An announcement by the ECB that it would expand its bond-buying programme and slash lending rates lifted the rand to its highest level in 2-1/2 months but the currency soon fell back again.

""ECB President (Mario) Draghi later said he didn't expect to have to cut rates again, possibly marking the end of the ECB's rate-cut cycle,"" emerging analyst at 4Cast Rajiev Rajkumar said.

South African government bonds held on to their gains, with yields on the benchmark issue due in 2026 shedding 8 basis points to 9.18 percent.

Data released on Thursday showed manufacturing output contracted by 2.5 percent in January, while mining output fell by 4.5 percent year-on-year, further signs of weakness in Africa's most industrialised economy.

Traders said the data had hit sentiment and renewed fears that South Africa's credit status could be downgraded to junk, forcing the central bank to raise interest rates more than it would want.

""The Bank is very conscious that a rating downgrade will result in a selloff on the rand and that will cause more inflation,"" said Gordon Kerr, a trader at Rand Merchant Bank.

On the corporate front, Sanlam, South Africa's biggest insurer by value, reported a 6 percent increase in full-year profit, well below average growth of 19 percent over the past three years, as consumers battle job losses and high personal debt.

Shares in the company dropped 5.19 percent to 59.32 rand.

Overall, a view that recent strong gains might have pushed some stocks into ""oversold"" territory also weighed on sentiment, traders said.

The blue chip JSE Top-40 index lost 0.15 percent to 45,548 and the broader All-share index was up 0.1 percent to 51,533.

Trade volumes were slightly below average, with 274 million shares changing hands, compared with a daily average of 296 million.

Migrants walk in a mud at a makeshift camp on the Greek-Macedonian border, near the village of Idomeni, Greece March 10, 2016.

LJUBLJANA Macedonia hopes stopping migrants at its border with Greece, which has effectively closed the Balkan route into northern Europe, will help the country join NATO, Defence Minister Zoran Jolevski said on Thursday.

Macedonia's bid to join the defence bloc has been blocked because Athens has disputed the country's name since Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, saying it implies territorial claims to a Greek province of the same name.

""I hope that Macedonia will get its ... place at a NATO table. We have shown that we are a responsible member of the international community,"" Jolevski said when asked whether Macedonia's conduct in the crisis could enhance its NATO bid.

He told a news conference during a visit to Slovenia the Balkan region would be more stable when more countries from the region join the military alliance. Montenegro was invited to join NATO in December. Bosnia also aspires to become a member.

""An invitation for Montenegro is a big step forward, we believe an invitation for Macedonia would also be important, as well as the process (on NATO membership) being activated for Bosnia and Herzegovina. That will help the stability and prosperity of southeastern Europe,"" Jolevski said.

Jolevski said the Macedonian border with Greece was not completely closed to migrants, but some 14,000 to 15,000 migrants have built up at the border in recent days as Macedonia strictly limits the migrant flow.

Jolevski said the country was coordinating its actions with Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.

He said Macedonia would continue to prevent illegal migrant crossings of its border with the help of the army, and urged the European Union, other European states and Turkey to find a joint solution for the conflict in Syria.

The debate is very unlikely to lead to Finland's exit from the common currency but the decision to hold such a debate demonstrates a high level of dissatisfaction among Finns with their country's economic performance.

The petition, signed by more than 53,000 people, demands a referendum on leaving the euro.

""We haven't decided the date yet but a preliminary debate will likely be held during a plenary session (of the parliament) in the coming weeks,"" said Johanna Sarhimaa, parliamentary secretary.

The Finnish economy grew by just 0.4 percent last year after three years of contraction, hit by high labour costs, the decline of Nokia's former phone business and a recession in neighbouring Russia.

The centre-right government is struggling to balance public finances and improve export competitiveness through 'internal devaluation', including cuts to workers' benefits, amid opposition from unions.

Paavo Vayrynen, a Finnish member of the European Parliament who launched the anti-euro initiative, compared the country's performance to that of Finland's non-euro neighbour Sweden, which has grown much faster in recent years.

""We should revive our economy by leaving the euro zone and reinstating our own currency (with a floating exchange rate). This will restore our competitiveness,"" he said as he handed the petition to Maria Lohela, the speaker of parliament.

""If the parliament supports the petition, it would urge the government to prepare a law for arranging a referendum.""

Despite the initiative, a Eurobarometer poll from November showed 64 percent of Finns backed the euro. The coalition government remains officially committed to eurozone membership.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 15:34:35+00:00,Carrefour to spend on European revival while China lags,['Dominique Vidalon'],"PARIS Carrefour, the world's second-largest retailer, vowed to renovate and open more stores to keep its European turnaround on track, while warning it would take time to revive its loss-making Chinese business.

The French firm disappointed investors with a lower-than-expected dividend hike and its shares fell on Thursday, despite it recording a fourth straight year of revenue and earnings growth and increased free cash flow last year.

Carrefour proposed raising its 2015 dividend by 2.9 percent to 0.70 euros a share after operating profit rose 2.4 percent to 2.45 billion euros (1.9 billion), in line with a Thomson Reuters poll forecast.

Europe's biggest retailer and the world's second-largest after Wal-Mart, also said it was waiting for the right time to float property unit Carmila, which several analysts estimate is worth at least 4 billion euros.

By 1312 GMT Carrefour shares were off 3.10 percent at 24.55 euros, the sole decliner on the CAC-40 index of French blue chips.

""Mixed performances,"" was the verdict from Bryan Garnier analysts who noted the dividend lagged an expected 0.82 euros. ""China is beginning to lose money, while the equity story misses catalysts somewhat.""

Carrefour said it would invest between 2.5 billion euros and 2.6 billion euros in 2016 on renovating and expanding stores, notably convenience stores, up from 2.4 billion last year.

""This is not the time to sacrifice investments,"" Finance Chief Pierre-Jean Sivignon said.

Carrefour has suffered from its reliance on hypermarkets, which it pioneered, as customers shift to local and online shopping.

In response the company, which makes about three-quarters of its sales in Europe, has cut prices and costs, accelerated expansion into convenience stores, refreshed stores and given greater autonomy to managers, beginning in France.

Operating profit rose 33.4 percent in Europe, excluding France, driven by recovery in Spain and Italy.

Latin America was boosted by a strong sales performance in Argentina and in Brazil, its No.2 market, accounting for about 14 percent of sales, where Carrefour, unlike French rival Casino, is proving resilient to an economic downturn.

This countered an operating profit decline of 6.4 percent in its biggest market France, which reflected the integration of recently acquired Dia discount stores and a rise in taxes on larger commercial spaces. Excluding these factors, profit rose 1.8 percent in France.

China, which makes 5 percent of sales, had an undisclosed operating loss this year as slowing consumption hurt sales.

Carrefour is pursuing a plan there to expand in e-commerce and convenience stores and open logistics centres to cut costs and Chief Executive Georges Plassat said he expected these actions to have an impact on China by end of 2016-early 2017.

John Lewis made a profit before partnership bonus, tax and one-off items of 306 million pounds for the year to Jan. 30. That was within guidance of between 270 million pounds and 320 million pounds, but down 10.9 percent on the previous year's outcome.

Operating profit at the department store division fell 0.1 percent and was down 2 percent at Waitrose.

On a sales basis the Partnership has outperformed rivals for half a decade, helped by its strong online offer, modern stores and a bias to the more prosperous southeast of England.

However, 2015-16 profit was dented by pension charges that rose by 48.2 million pounds from the previous year.

reuters.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,A campaign that makes the political turmoil of 1968 look good,"[""Any Opinions Expressed Here Are The Author's Own"", 'Maurice Isserman', 'Posted Laster', 'Maurice Isserman Teaches History At Hamilton College Is Co-author Of America Divided The Civil War Of The', 'Posted Solidar']","There is rare agreement, on the left and the right, that the 2016 presidential election season is looking to be a repeat of Democratic Partys 1968 race.

There was a bitterly fought primary campaign that year, with fierce public debates over the Vietnam War, race relations and law and order. The campaign led to a divisive and volatile Democratic National Convention in Chicago, with clashes between antiwar protesters and club-swinging cops in the streets outside the arena, and protests inside the hall over both the war and the mayhem outside.

The resulting split in Democratic ranks, plus the widespread public belief that the country was coming apart at the seams, led to Republican Richard M. Nixons win in November. The GOP went on to win the White House in all but one of the next half-dozen elections.

This time around, however, it is Republicans who seem most vulnerable to splintering after a fevered primary season. The Donald Trump insurgency is defying the best efforts of the GOP establishment to steer primary voters to other candidates. This seems a dire threat to Trumps adopted partys prospects  not only in the November election, but also potentially for decades to come.

Trumps supporters, like many liberal anti-war Democratic primary voters did in 1968, view the race in apocalyptic terms. They will not easily be persuaded to cast their votes strategically for another nominee should a brokered convention in July deny the current GOP front-runner the nomination.

I want to see Trump go up there and do damage to the Republican Party, one middle-aged white voter in Mississippi told a reporter after former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, urged the party faithful to support other candidates.

Resentfully nihilistic sentiments among the partys base voters do not contribute to building and maintaining durable majority coalitions, though many political pundits now suggest this could happen. Just ask the Democrats in 1968.

Yet, similar to the 1968 race and identical to it are different categories. History doesnt repeat itself, Mark Twain is supposed to have said, but it does rhyme. (The Twain attribution is a little dubious, but its the kind of thing he might have said.) Consider three ways in which 1968 and 2016 resemble each other while retaining significant dissimilarities.

First, the nominating process is significantly different. In 1968 the Democratic establishments candidate, and eventual nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, did not run in a single primary. Only 14 states and the District of Columbia held primaries that year, and the victories were largely divided between two insurgent, anti-war candidates, Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy, and New York Senator Robert Kennedy. (Though a few favorite son candidates did run as surrogates for Humphrey.)

The overwhelming majority of delegates who gathered at the convention in Chicago in August 1968 were thus chosen by party insiders, chiefly elected officials, rather than primary voters. So it should not have been surprising that they proved overwhelmingly pro-Humphrey  and awarded him the nomination on the first ballot.

Many liberal voters, accordingly, sat on their hands in the falls presidential campaign.

Thanks to reforms in both parties nominating process during the 1970s, most Republican and Democratic delegates today are chosen by primary and caucus voters, allowing presidential candidates to claim a popular mandate. Thus far in the Republican race, Trump has ridden a wave of populist resentments, and is well on his way to secure the simple majority he needs for nomination on the first ballot.

Should he remain the front-runner but fall short of the necessary 1,237 delegates, the consequences for Republicans could prove even more devastating than the boss-driven selection of the presidential candidate did for the Democrats in 1968.

In 1968, Humphreys selection, however controversial within party ranks, was still politics-as-usual. If Trump fails to win on the first ballot, and party insiders manage on a subsequent ballot (the dreaded brokered convention) to steer the nomination to an alternative candidate, it will be perceived as more akin to politics-by-coup-detat. Angry Trump voters are likely to abandon the Republican Party.

Second, the gap between party insiders and insurgent candidates in 1968, while wide in terms of specific issues, especially the Vietnam War, was far narrower in terms of the candidates experience and capabilities. The candidates, ordinarily team players, had a lot in common, among themselves  and with their partys elite. In 1968, McCarthy had served in Congress for 20 years, 10 in the House of Representatives and 10 in the Senate. Kennedy, in addition to being the brother of a martyred Democratic president, had been U.S. attorney general, and spent four years as a senator. McCarthys fellow Minnesotan, Humphrey had served a term as mayor of Minneapolis, before serving three terms as a senator (the last as Democratic majority whip), before taking his place as President Lyndon B. Johnsons vice president.

They were all dyed-in-the-wool Democrats. Solid party men. None of the candidates, faced with defeat, had any intention of bolting the party for a third party effort. In a less polarizing set of circumstances, say minus the Vietnam War, its easy to imagine either Kennedy or Humphrey, and perhaps even McCarthy, proving a candidate acceptable to all the partys factions, insiders and outsiders alike.

Today, however, there is a profound disjunction in the leading Republican candidates experiences, credentials and loyalties. Real estate developer and reality television star Trump has never held or seriously pursued elective office. Cruz and Rubio have backgrounds in Republican state politics, but neither have served long  or with any particular distinction  in national office. At the start of the primary season, none would have been the Republican establishments top choice. At least two, front-runner Trump and his chief rival, Cruz, are regarded by many party insiders as deranged or disloyal. Rubio, acceptable on other grounds, is seen as a hopelessly maladroit.

Further muddying the choices is the fact that the divisions among the candidates, rather than based on a serious debate over policy direction, have devolved into playground insults. Whatever else might be said about the Democrats in 1968, they took their separate stances over real and substantive issues, such as the Vietnam War. Penis size did not emerge as a subject for discussion.

Finally, in comparing 1968 to 2016, the violence factor needs to be considered. The backdrop for the 1968 presidential campaign included the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Kennedy, campus occupations and urban riots, as well as the protests in the streets of Chicago outside the convention. The anti-war protesters chanted The whole world is watching as they were beaten and arrested by Chicago police. In a sense they were right  though not about what the world would conclude from their example.

That fall, Republican television commercials featured clips of the Chicago disturbances, and demanded How can a party that cant keep order in its own backyard hope to keep order in our 50 states?

A fair question  that today can be asked of Republicans. When the front-running candidate for the nomination has some conservative commentators invoking the specter of fascism, the Republican vision of order isnt necessarily going to play well in November.

After one black man was beaten and ejected from a Trump rally in Atlanta, the candidate commented on Fox News, Maybe he should have been roughed up, because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing, (i.e. chanting Black Lives Matter!) Following a similar event a few weeks later, Trumps response was, I love the old days. You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? Theyd be carried out on a stretcher.

The rancor displayed by Trump rally-goers, encouraged by their candidate and directed against protesters and media alike, bears some resemblance to the old days of 1968  especially the hate-filled gatherings for third-party segregationist candidate Alabama Governor George Wallace  who once vowed to run over any protesters who sat-in in front of his limousine.

What happens if Trump is denied the Republican nomination in Cleveland in July? Will his supporters, with his overt or implied approval, fill the streets outside the convention hall in violent protest? Or will some of them seek Second Mmendment solutions to their political frustrations? (One of Trumps New Hampshire campaign officials was arrested earlier this month in connection with his role in the 2014 Bundy Ranch armed standoff with federal officers in Nevada.)

The 2016 election is not simply a repeat of 1968. If the current election evokes the historical rhyme scheme of that earlier contest, it is chiefly in the stakes involved and the uncertainty of the outcome.",[]

The artist walked around the makeshift camp where he said he was witnessing a ""huge, big violation of human rights"" in the middle of Europe.

""What we have seen here is almost unbelievable,"" he said.

""It's just in the rain, in the cold, and women, children, all the people waiting for some bread, or some dry clothes, and this is a very sad situation and people have no hope because the door is closed, totally shut off...I think this is a huge, big violation of human rights, right in front of us.""

People fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and beyond have flooded into Europe since early 2015, most making the dangerous sea crossing from Turkey to Greece, then heading north through the Balkans.

But border shutdowns have caused the blocking of the so-called 'Balkans corridor' and more than 34,0000 people are now trapped on Greece's islands and mainland.

BERLIN Chihira Kanae is greeting visitors to the world's biggest travel fair in Berlin this week, answering questions and guiding people in the right direction. But one passer by's attempt to ask her out for dinner is met with silence.

That's because Chihira Kanae, despite her lifelike features and long brown hair, is a robot, the third version of a robot in human form developed by Toshiba and can only answer pre-programmed questions.

She was joined at the ITB fair on Thursday by another robot host Mario, a small red and white robot made by French Aldebaran Robotics, showing how they might be put to use in the travel industry, such as checking in hotel guests.

""The point is to make people smile and give them a unique experience. It's not to take the place of employees,"" Fabrice Goffin, co-founder of QBMT whose software powers Mario, told Reuters at the fair.

The Marriott hotel in Ghent has been trialling Mario, using him to hand out room keys, high-five guests and liven up meetings held in the hotel by reading out presentations.

Marriott was keen to stress that Mario will not replace any human staff.

""For now it's a great add-on service,"" Roger Langhout, general manager of the Marriot in Ghent, said.

Airline KLM is also testing a guide robot, Spencer, to help passengers navigate their way through Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, one of Europe's largest hubs.

A survey of travelers across Britain, France, Spain, Germany, Canada, Brazil, Japan, the U.S. and China, done by online travel and entertainment deals site Travelzoo showed that 80 percent of consumers expected robots to play a big part in their lives before 2020.

However, the survey also showed people still wanted the human touch when on holiday and in certain countries, such as Germany and France, consumers were more skeptical.

""Consumers still want humans in the picture, as otherwise there is a genuine fear that cultural nuances, humor and irony will be missed and the holiday experience could become too impersonal,"" Richard Singer, Travelzoo's European president, said.

Best Western CEO David Kong said robots were an interesting area but the technology had to be more useful, such as for cleaning rooms. ""If it's just a cutting-edge cool idea, maybe it won't survive.""

reuters.com,2016-03-10 13:47:21+00:00,Merkel risks bruising in crunch German votes,"['Michael Nienaber', 'Paul Carrel']","Angela Merkel, German Chancellor and leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union party CDU speaks about the refugee crisis during an election campaign rally in Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, western Germany March 9, 2016.

BERLIN Isolated in Europe, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces a big test at home on Sunday when three German states vote in elections that risk eroding her base and undermining the migrant policy on which she has staked her legacy.

Merkel, known for her caution, took the high-risk step last summer of opening Germany's borders to refugees fleeing war in Syria - a move that made her Time magazine's Person of the Year but stoked angst among Germans about integrating the migrants.

Now voters in the three states - two in the west, and one in the former east - have a chance to punish Merkel, 61, just as she is trying to use her status as Europe's most powerful leader to push through an EU deal with Turkey to stop the migrant flow.

""Merkel will continue to be chancellor, but maybe with a black eye,"" said Matthias Kortmann at the University of Munich.

Such a loss of face would erode Merkel's standing at a crucial juncture in her efforts to deal with the refugee crisis that saw over 1 million migrants arrive in Germany last year.

She alarmed many European leaders at a summit earlier this week by gambling on a last-minute draft deal with Turkey to stop the migrant flow and demanding their support.

But Merkel, whose gravitas and reputation for deal-making has grown during her 10 years in power, must still seal the Turkey deal with EU leaders at their next summit on March 17-18.

""If she cannot push through her approach then, she will not be able to avoid correcting her stance on refugee policy,"" said Oskar Niedermayer at Berlin's Free University.

Such a shift, which could include tightening Germany's borders, would be damaging to Merkel, who is expected to seek a fourth term in office at a federal election in 2017.

Snapping at the heels of her conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) is the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, whose hardline stance on refugees could bring it big gains in all three states voting on Sunday.

Founded only in 2013, the AfD has morphed from an anti-euro zone bailout party into an anti-immigrant electoral force, to which the CDU is bleeding support in all three states.

SWING STATE

The three regions - Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate in the west, and Saxony-Anhalt in the east - have a combined population of some 17 million, a fifth of Germany's 81 million.

The AfD is strongest in Saxony-Anhalt, where unemployment is running at over 10 percent. Polls put the AfD on as much as 19 percent support in the state, and ahead of the Social Democrats (SPD), Merkel's coalition partner in Berlin, a humiliation for a party that is bracing for big losses on Sunday.

""In Germany, as in the U.S., the party system is fanning out to the extremes,"" said Josef Joffe, publisher-editor of German weekly Die Zeit.

A weakened CDU is still poised to come first in Saxony-Anhalt, but its fate looks less rosy in the two other states.

In Baden-Wuerttemberg, a CDU stronghold for over 50 years before turning to a Green-led coalition with the SPD in 2011 after Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster, the Greens' state premier Winfried Kretschmann, 67, is poised to pip his CDU rival.

But it is Rhineland-Palatinate, a wine-growing region, that is shaping up as the pivotal swing state.

There, Julia Kloeckner, a charismatic 43-year-old former German ""wine queen"" who has positioned herself as a candidate to succeed Merkel one day, has seen her lead shrink in recent weeks and is now neck-and-neck with SPD incumbent, Malu Dreyer.

""Whoever wins Rhineland-Palatinate, CDU or SPD, can present themselves as the overall winner,"" said Kortmann.

Merkel will campaign on Friday in Trier, an ancient Roman town in Rhineland-Palatinate, but she is having difficulty in getting her overall popularity as chancellor to rub off on the CDU's candidates in the state elections.

A poll this week put support for Merkel at its highest this year, with her winning 50 percent of votes in a hypothetical presidential-style election against SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel, on 13 percent.

""Depending on the outcome (of the state votes), Merkel could be weakened domestically, especially within her own party,"" said Kortmann. ""But everybody knows that there is actually no alternative to her in the CDU.""

reuters.com,2016-03-10 10:42:02+00:00,Opera becomes first big browser maker with built-in ad-blocker,['Eric Auchard'],"FRANKFURT Norwegian company Opera is introducing a new version of its desktop computer browser that promises to load web pages faster by incorporating ad-blocking, a move that makes reining in advertising a basic feature instead of an afterthought.

Faster loading, increased privacy and security and a desire for fewer distractions are behind the growing demand for ad-blockers.

However, their popularity is cutting into the growth of online marketing for site publishers and corporate brands, who rely on reaching web and mobile users to pay for their content rather than restricting access to paid subscribers.

Opera has a history of introducing innovations that later become common in major browsers such as tabbed browsing and pop-up blocking, which helped users control an earlier generation of in-your-face ads and malware disguised as advertising.

""Ad-blocking technology is an opportunity and a wake-up call to the advertising industry to pay attention to what consumers are actually saying,"" an Opera spokeswoman said.

Opera said it can cut page-loading times by as much as 90 percent by eliminating the complex dance that occurs behind the scenes in a user's browser as various third-party ad networks deliver promotional messages to users.

The Norwegian company, which has agreed to a takeover by a group of Chinese firms led by Beijing Kunlun Tech in a cash deal valued at $1.23 billion, introduced its first computer web browser in 1995.

With the rise of the smartphone, it shifted to focus on the mobile browser and advertising market, where it now derives most of its revenue and counts 281 million users.

Opera said on Thursday it was introducing a version of its browser aimed at software developers and early adopters, but will eventually offer the feature for both computers and phones.

The Oslo-based firm ranks a distant fifth behind more mainstream desktop computers browsers from Microsoft, Google, Firefox and Apple. The company counts 60 million active monthly desktop users worldwide.

Opera sees no contradiction in the fact that it relies on advertising for a big chunk of its own revenue but is introducing ad-blocking control features in its products. Demand for ad-blocking should abate when messages became less disruptive and more relevant, an Opera spokeswoman said.

Because it is building the features directly into its browser, page delivery times are 40 percent faster than existing ad-blocker plug-ins, or browser extensions, it said. Top plug-in providers include AdBlock, AdMuncher and Ghostery that run on top of existing browsers.

A study published by PageFair and Adobe estimated online ad revenue lost to blockers in 2015 would amount to $21.8 billion and those losses could almost double to $41.4 billion in 2016. Ad-placement firm Carat forecasts global digital and mobile advertising will near $150 billion this year.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 15:20:31+00:00,How a hacker's typo helped stop a billion dollar bank heist,['Serajul Quadir'],"Commuters pass by the front of the Bangladesh central bank building in Dhaka March 8, 2016.

DHAKA A spelling mistake in an online bank transfer instruction helped prevent a nearly $1 billion heist last month involving the Bangladesh central bank and the New York Fed, banking officials said.

Unknown hackers still managed to get away with about $80 million, one of the largest known bank thefts in history.

The hackers breached Bangladesh Bank's systems and stole its credentials for payment transfers, two senior officials at the bank said. They then bombarded the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with nearly three dozen requests to move money from the Bangladesh Bank's account there to entities in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, the officials said.

Four requests to transfer a total of about $81 million to the Philippines went through, but a fifth, for $20 million, to a Sri Lankan non-profit organisation was held up because the hackers misspelled the name of the NGO, Shalika Foundation.

Hackers misspelled ""foundation"" in the NGO's name as ""fandation"", prompting a routing bank, Deutsche Bank, to seek clarification from the Bangladesh central bank, which stopped the transaction, one of the officials said.

There is no NGO under the name of Shalika Foundation in the list of registered Sri Lankan non-profits. Reuters could not immediately find contact information for the organization.

Deutsche Bank declined to comment.

At the same time, the unusually high number of payment instructions and the transfer requests to private entities - as opposed to other banks - raised suspicions at the Fed, which also alerted the Bangladeshis, the officials said.

The details of how the hacking came to light and was stopped before it did more damage have not been previously reported. Bangladesh Bank has billions of dollars in a current account with the Fed, which it uses for international settlements.

The transactions that were stopped totalled $850-$870 million, one of the officials said.

Last year, Russian computer security company Kaspersky Lab said a multinational gang of cyber criminals had stolen as much as $1 billion from as many as 100 financial institutions around the world in about two years.

Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's son Qusay took $1 billion from Iraq's central bank on the orders of his father on the day before coalition forces began bombing the country in 2003, American and Iraqi officials have said. In 2007, guards at the Dar Es Salaam bank in Baghdad made off with $282 million.

MONEY RECOVERED

Bangladesh Bank has said it has recovered some of the money that was stolen, and is working with anti-money laundering authorities in the Philippines to try to recover the rest.

A bank spokesman could not be reached for comment late on Thursday.

The recovered funds refer to the Sri Lanka transfer, which was stopped, one of the officials said.

Initially, the Sri Lankan transaction reached Pan Asia Banking Corp, which went back to Deutsche Bank for more verification because of the unusually large size of the payment, a Pan Asia official said. ""The transaction was too large for a country like us,"" the official said. ""Then (Deutsche) came back and said it was a suspect transaction."" A Pan Asia spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.

The dizzying, global reach of the heist underscores the growing threat of cyber crime and how hackers can find weak links in even the most secure computer networks.

More than a month after the attack, Bangladeshi officials are scrambling to trace the money, shore up security and identify weaknesses in their systems. They said there is little hope of ever catching the hackers, and it could take months before the money is recovered, if at all.

Security experts said the perpetrators had deep knowledge of the Bangladeshi institution's internal workings, likely gained by spying on bank workers.

The Bangladesh government, meanwhile, is blaming the Fed for not stopping the transactions earlier. Finance Minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith told reporters on Tuesday that the country may resort to suing the Fed to recover the money.

""The Fed must take responsibility,"" he said.

The New York Fed has said its systems were not breached, and it has been working with the Bangladesh central bank since the incident occurred.

The hacking of Bangladesh Bank happened sometime between Feb. 4-5, over the Bangladeshi weekend, which falls on a Friday, the officials said. The bank's offices were shut.

Initially, the central bank was not sure if its system had been breached, but cyber security experts brought in to investigate found hacker ""footprints"" that suggested the system had been compromised, the officials said.

These experts could also tell that the attack originated from outside Bangladesh, they said, adding the bank is looking into how they got into the system and an internal investigation is ongoing.

The bank suspects money sent to the Philippines was further diverted to casinos there, the officials said.

The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp, which oversees the gaming industry, said it has launched an investigation. The country's anti-money laundering authority is also working on the case.

Republican U.S. presidential candidate Ted Cruz speaks during a campaign event at Central Baptist Church in Kannapolis, North Carolina, March 8, 2016.

WASHINGTON White House hopefuls Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and 13 other Republican U.S. senators on Thursday demanded that Islamic State fighters be sent to the Guantanamo Bay detention center, which would boost its population as President Barack Obama moves to close it.

The lawmakers introduced a resolution expressing the need to detain the fighters at the controversial military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after reports that U.S. special operations forces had captured leaders of the militant group.

""There should be no confusion in the minds of our enemies that, if captured, they will be sent to the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay to be interrogated,"" Rubio said in a statement.

Rubio, Cruz, billionaire front-runner Donald Trump and Ohio Governor John Kasich face off in a presidential debate on Thursday night in Miami.

The resolution was led by Senator Steve Daines. In addition to Rubio and Cruz, the co-sponsors were Senators Jerry Moran, Cory Gardner, Tom Cotton, Mark Kirk, Orrin Hatch, Joni Ernst, Johnny Isakson, John Boozman, Pat Roberts, Jim Inhofe, Tim Scott and David Vitter.

The measure would be nonbinding but underscores the strong resistance in the Republican-controlled Congress toward Obama's efforts to close the detention camp.

Obama launched a final push to persuade Congress to close the detention center for suspected members of groups such as al Qaeda last month.

The Obama administration has been trying for years to make good on a pledge the president made at the beginning of his first term in 2009 to close the facility but has faced stiff political opposition.

Republican lawmakers insist the prison is an essential tool for holding and interrogating suspects who threaten the United States. Opponents of the detention center say that holding prisoners for years without charge or trial is a human rights violation that goes against fundamental U.S. values and potentially endangers American military personnel.

The agreement was announced as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Barack Obama met at the White House.

The agreement can do ""even more to protect our countries and our communities, especially in the Arctic, from climate change,"" Obama said during a welcoming ceremony for Trudeau. The two countries are seeking to improve relations after Obama last year rejected the Keystone XL pipeline, which was aimed at transporting heavy Canadian oil to the United States.

On a catwalk spiked with mirror columns, designer Nicolas Ghesquiere opened the autumn/winter 2016/2017 show with a black coat adorned with golden buttons and cinched at the waist over shiny red leather trousers and combat-style boots.

Similar trousers, flared and cropped at the ankle, peppered the show in various colours and were worn with block-coloured knits or sleek black leather jackets zipped at the front.

Ghesquiere, who has led a renaissance of the brand known for its monogrammed leather bags, also presented T-shirt-like dresses in bold geometric patterns - blue, red, white and black - in front of guests including Oscar winner Alicia Vikander.

Silk scarf prints, namely of belts and chains, decorated short-sleeve tops-and-skirts combinations. They worn with black leather sleeves that crept up above the elbow.

Looks were layered. Models in gothic make-up wore short or quilted jackets over long waist-cinched tops and trousers or colourful knitted dresses over floral-printed skirts.

For the evening, sleek jackets with front zips were exaggerated at the hips, almost corset-like, while colourful sequined dresses had a trompe l'oeil effects.

There were also leather, bra-like tops over dresses. The outfits were accessorised with lace-up boots, mostly flat, while handbags came in a variety of shapes, colours and sizes.

Some models also wore large black furry hats.

Louis Vuitton, flagship brand of luxury goods group LVMH, wrapped up just under a month of catwalk shows that began in New York and moved onto London and Milan before the Paris finale.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 17:48:55+00:00,"ECB pulls out all stops with rate cuts, stimulus boost","['Francesco Canepa', 'Balazs Koranyi']","FRANKFURT The European Central Bank unleashed some of it last remaining stimulus weapons on Thursday, cutting all three of its interest rates and expanding asset-buying to boost the economy and prevent ultra-low inflation becoming entrenched.

It slashed its inflation expectations for this year but also suggested that interest rates would go no lower.

READ MORE: Europe roars approval as ECB pulls out the bazooka

In moves that briefly pushed the euro 1 percent down against the dollar, the ECB cut its deposit rate deeper into negative territory and increased monthly asset buys to 80 billion euros from 60 billion euros, above expectations of a hike to 70-billion.

While the deposit rate was cut 10 basis points to -0.4 percent, the main refinancing rate was shaved to zero from 0.05 percent and its marginal lending rate -- used by banks to borrow from the ECB overnight -- fell to 0.25 percent from 0.3 percent.

""Rates will stay low, very low, for a long period of time and well past the horizon of our purchases,"" ECB President Mario Draghi, judged to have disappointed markets in December with measures below expectations, told a news conference.

Purchases are due to end in March next year.

He added, ""From today's perspective and taking into account the support of our measures to growth and inflation, we don't anticipate that it will be necessary to reduce rates further,""

The ECB said it would also start buying corporate debt and launch four new rounds of cheap loan packages, to be extended by banks to the real economy.

RECOMMENDED: North Korea fires missiles, to 'liquidate' South Korean assets

Slashing its 2016 inflation forecast from one percent to just 0.1 percent, the Bank said further rounds of ultra-cheap four-year loans to banks could include extra financial sweeteners for them to take up the offer to pass on to others.

""A bank that is very active in granting loans to the real economy can borrow more than a bank that concentrates on other activities,"" Draghi noted.

REACTION

""Good news for Europe: Having delivered less than expected in December, the ECB returned to its usual form today and eased policy by a bit more than projected,"" said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg bank.

But others were more critical, warning that such loose monetary policy risked creating asset price bubbles and removed any incentive for governments to reform their economies.

""What will happen if the global economic situation deteriorates sharply once more, requiring a strong monetary policy response? I do not anticipate this happening, but if it did, the ECB would have already shot most of its powder, said Michael Menhart, chief economist at German reinsurer Munich Re.

Draghi answered such criticisms partly in German, arguing: ""Suppose we had embraced the 'nein zu allem' ('no to everything') policy strategy? We deem that the counterfactual would have been a disastrous deflation.""

But he acknowledged the limitations of negative rates and said any future moves would likely have to focus on other, non-conventional measures.

""Does it mean that we can go as negative as we want without having any consequences on the banking system? The answer is no,"" he said.

The ECB has little to show for the 700 billion euros it has spent buying government bonds and other assets in the past year, as tumbling raw materials prices blunt the impact of its quantitative easing.

That raises the risk that people will lose faith in the bank's commitment to its mandate. Inflation has been below the ECB's nearly 2 percent target for three years and is likely to remain so for many more.

The ECB's move came after the G20 group of the world's major economies last month agreed they need to look beyond ultra-low interest rates and printing money to shake the global economy out of its torpor.

The U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, Bank of England and Swiss National Bank are all set to meet next week.

While Europe's growth prospects have held up relatively well on resilient domestic consumption, weak business and industrial sentiment indicators suggest it is facing increasing headwinds, particularly from slowing growth in China.

In January, Pyongyang tested its fourth nuclear device. It launched a satellite in February to gather additional data for developing an intercontinental ballistic missile. Meanwhile, North Korean engineers keep cranking out weapons material that could fuel dozens of nuclear bombs in years to come.

The international response continues to be ineffective. After much pouting from concerned countries, the United Nations Security Council recently responded to the new round of tests with an impressive new collection of sanctions.

These sanctions promise to halt the movement of contraband by monitoring North Korean commerce transiting in and out of the country, prohibit the export of jet and rocket fuel to Pyongyang, block the Norths ability to conduct international financial transactions and ban the export of North Korean coal and minerals. But they are not enough. Even combined with the prior sanctions, this will not move the North off its nuclear pedestal. It is simply too late.

First, it is inconceivable that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would give up the weapon that places his nation in the exclusive global nuclear club. Pyongyang has invested so much and come so far to mature a nuclear program that provides it with an atomic deterrent and the means of intimidation. Second, history repeatedly finds sanctions are unlikely to be fully enforced or sufficient to squeeze the North.

Washington and its allies must now come to the realization that it is time to adapt.

This process has already begun. South Korea has made a multi-year commitment to increase its military budget to modernize its conventional forces. It has begun deploying longer range surface-to-surface missiles and is acquiring U.S. F-35 strike aircraft. Seoul is talking with Washington about installing the sophisticated missile defense system Terminal High Altitude Area Defense or THAAD. Collectively, the beefing up of its conventional forces bolsters Seouls deterrence capabilities.

Yet fear still grips many in South Korea that Seouls buildup will not be enough. Some conservative legislators and others both in and out of government have called for the South to go nuclear. Were that to occur, Seoul would follow the path of several countries  the Soviet Union, Britain, France and Pakistan  that responded in kind to the possession of nuclear weapons by adversaries.

However, any attempt by South Korea to break its Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty vows would pit it against its crucial Washington ally, which doggedly opposes nuclear proliferation whether by friend or foe.

In addition, nuclear acquisition would present the South with its own challenges. Though South Korea has the technical capacity to build the bomb, it could take years to perfect a deliverable device and marshal an effective deterrent or use doctrine. The effort would prove costly  diverting scarce defense dollars from other vital security needs. It would also raise the ire of China.

Impressing upon the North that no good would come from its bomb remains critical. This raises the question whether more good could come from Washingtons return of nuclear weapons to the South  the United States removed them in 1991 as the Cold War ended.

Given North Koreas unabated nuclear development, is it time to reassess that 1991 removal? Installing them raises a host of additional issues: Would deployment enhance deterrence or make Pyongyang more trigger happy? Would it provide Seoul enough reassurance so that it could eliminate any inclination to go nuclear? Or is offshore deployment enough?

Then, there is the matter of Beijings response. Would the return of the bomb to South Korean soil prompt a major dustup in Sino-U.S. relations? Or would it mark a demonstration of Washingtons commitment to assure the security of all its East Asian allies?

These open questions deserve robust public debate in the United States and South Korea. But so does another matter, now even more off the radar. Is it time for the United States to reach out to North Korea, to formally concede what it cannot change  namely that North Korea is a nuclear-armed nation  not as any favor to the Stalinist regime but to generate a quid pro quo, the establishment of official liaison offices in both capitals? This would put in place a permanent face-to-face communication link to defuse the risk of war should tensions mount.

The alterative  keeping the North ever more isolated  perpetuates the fantasy that Pyongyang still can be sanctioned or otherwise induced to give up the bomb. Rather the challenge now is not to bolster quixotic policies but nurture others that assure Kims bomb does not give birth to a 21st-century nuclear war.",[]

Embellished coats, mosaic print suits and lace dresses are among the outfits the Italian designer is presenting at Milan Fashion Week. It will be months before they hit the shops.

With the amount of craftsmanship involved, Scervino says his clothes take time to make and he has no plans to follow other labels selling their items straight off the catwalk, effectively bridging the traditional six-month runway-to-retail gap.

""I think that it is not for me, it is not for (products of) excellence,"" Scervino told Reuters. ""We have long (designing) time frames. I am not interested.""

The recent autumn/winter 2016/2017 fashion weeks in New York, London, Milan and Paris have seen designers divided over retail models some labels are adopting to put their items immediately on sale after their catwalk presentations.

In an age of social media - where fashion shows are streamed online - and with competition from high street retailers regularly updating their collections, Britain's Burberry and designer Tom Ford announced new ""see now, buy now"" strategies last month.

""If we are Instagramming, live-streaming and showing the collections, we can't expect a customer and a consumer to tie in with a traditional kind of calendar,"" Burberry Chief Executive Christopher Bailey said.

""So I do think we all need to evolve and change but I don't think that there's one rule that fits everybody.""

Other labels such as Prada, Diane von Furstenberg and Monique Lhuillier have made similar moves even if on a smaller scale, selling a select few items. Designer Karl Lagerfeld said Chanel is already putting its pre-collections designs in stores fast.

""I realise that when people see an image they want it right away,"" said Lhuillier, who put five looks for sale after her New York show. ""This is the way we're experimenting to see if this is how we want to show.""

Buyers are welcoming the fast fashion move, namely when brands have customers in different climates.

""I think the changes have been a long time coming,"" Ed Burstell, managing director of Liberty store in London, said.

""No one can understand now when they see something 'why do I have to wait six months to buy it'.""

However, opposition remains from those who say preparing collections is a lengthy process.

""When you want to make a collection creative, you need the time, you need to study the fabrics, specific research,"" Carlo Capasa, head of Italy's national chamber of fashion, said.

In Paris, label Dior echoed that.

""How can a collection like the one you've just seen be delivered to the shops tomorrow?,"" Chief Executive Sidney Toledano said after Dior's show.

""That would mean we'd manufactured it six months ago and put it in the fridge ... When you put a collection in the shops the following day, that means that the selection from the runway has already been made -- you're taking a risk.""

WASHINGTON O presidente dos Estados Unidos, Barack Obama, estendeu o tapete vermelho para o primeiro-ministro do Canada, Justin Trudeau, na Casa Branca nesta quinta-feira, pondo fim a um periodo de frieza nas relacoes entre os dois paises vizinhos e comemorando os objetivos em comum no clima e no comercio.

""Nem sempre expressamos o quanto valorizamos nossa alianca e nossos lacos com nossos amigos canadenses"", disse Obama em uma cerimonia de boas-vindas.

As duas nacoes comecaram o dia acertando medidas conjuntas para combater a mudanca climatica, entre elas cortar as emissoes de metano oriundas de operacoes de petroleo e gas e assinar o acordo climatico acordado na cupula de Paris no ano passado ""tao rapido quanto for factivel"".

South Africa's builder Murray & Roberts expects weaker earnings in the 2017 fiscal year as demand from clients in the energy industry slash...

JOHANNESBURG South African engineering and building group Murray & Roberts expects earnings to fall further in its next financial year as clients in the energy industry slash expenditure to cope with low crude prices, its CEO said on Thursday.

Like its peers, Murray & Roberts is battling a market hit by a commodities price rout that has seen producers in the mining and oil and gas sectors cut spending and projects.

The company has cut about half its staff over the past four years and sold off non-core assets to cope with an industry-wide slump that started after the 2010 soccer World Cup.

The oil and gas division is the largest division of the group, contributing 40 percent of Murray & Roberts' annual revenue of about 30 billion rand ($2 billion).

""We depend on the oil and gas majors to spend money on their projects and assets, if they cut back on their expenditure then the opportunity is less. The group as a whole in 2017 will be at a low point,"" Chief Executive Henry Laas told Reuters in an interview.

""We expect this sector's earnings to be down further in the 2017 financial year than what it is in 2016.""

Murray & Roberts has already flagged lower earnings for the 2016 financial year, which ends in June, citing weak demand from oil and gas majors.

Global oil and gas investments are expected to fall to their lowest in six years in 2016 to $522 billion, following a 22 percent fall to $595 billion in 2015, according to the Oslo-based consultancy Rystad Energy.

Chevron, one of Murray and Roberts' clients slashed its capital budget on Tuesday by as much as 36 percent in 2017 and 2018, a cash-saving bid to preserve its 90-year-old dividend as it copes with low crude prices.

Laas said the company, whose workforce has shrunk from 40,000 to 19,000 over the past four years, would cut more jobs if the market worsens.

""We are okay, but if the market deteriorates further then we will have to cut back,"" he said.

TUNIS The Tunisian military said it killed three militants on Thursday in an operation to clear them out of a border town where more than 50 people died on Monday in an attack the government blamed on Islamic State.

Monday's attack on Ben Guerdan, when around 50 militants stormed through the town assaulting army and police posts, reinforced fears about spillover from jihadist camps in neighboring Libya.

""Security and army units killed three terrorists, arrested another and seized five Kalashnikov rifles in Ben Guerdan on Thursday,"" the army said in statement.

Since the 2011 revolt against autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia has seen a growing threat from Islamist militancy at home and from over the border.

Tunisians trained in jihadist camps in Libya carried out two attacks last year on foreign tourists in Tunisia.

Islamic State's increasing foothold in Libya is worrying its North African neighbors and Western governments. U.S. forces have launched air strikes against the group in Libya, and Western military advisers are helping Tunisia better protect its frontier.

Yaresko is touted as a successor to Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk, who narrowly survived a no confidence vote in February but whose popularity within the coalition and the voting public has collapsed since taking office in 2014.

The crisis has stymied Ukraine's efforts to secure more aid from its international backers, including the International Monetary Fund, which is contingent on Kiev implementing reforms and clamping down on corruption.

A foreign-born former investment manager, Yaresko could be a popular choice with Ukraine's Western allies, but it is unclear whether she would have the political muscle to push through reforms any faster than Yatseniuk could.

""I think it does not help any of us right now to engage in speculation, frankly,"" said Yaresko at an investor conference in Kiev, when quizzed about her possible role in a new government.

""I think the speculation is what's causing the crisis to some extent. So my preference would be to focus on reality.""

With Yatseniuk's coalition in turmoil, Ukraine and the IMF have yet to agree on a new memorandum setting out Kiev's precise commitments on reforms, which it will deliver in exchange for more aid worth $1.7 billion.

Even if Ukraine submits a new memorandum in March, it will have to wait at least until the IMF board meets in April to secure the money, she added.

""The memorandum is a living document,"" Yaresko said. ""The IMF has to know who is going to be in the government ... as a lender you want to know a person who signs. The IMF wants some confidence that the program will be implemented.""

Speaking at the same conference, the IMF's resident representative to Ukraine Jerome Vacher said the memorandum document was constantly evolving.

Discussions were ongoing about Ukraine's plans to fight corruption, reform its pension system and improve the government's finances, he said. However, he stressed the IMF board would need to be sure Kiev will stick to its commitments.

""It is important for us to have clarity on whether the policies will be implemented,"" Vacher said.

PARIS A pair of Rembrandt portraits owned privately for more than 130 years went on public display in Paris on Thursday, bought under shared ownership by the French capital's Louvre museum and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

The portraits date back to 1634 and depict Amsterdam trader Marten Soolmans and his wife Oopjen Coppit. They were painted by the Dutch master for the couple's wedding and are considered a defining example of his work.

Bought by Baron Gustave de Rothschild in 1877 and kept in France ever since, the pair of paintings, for which the museums paid 160 million euros ($174 million), will spend five and then eight years by turns in each museum, always staying together.

Initially they will hang in the Louvre for three months before moving to the Rijksmuseum, where they will undergo restoration.

The two full-body portraits are mainly in black and white and each stand more than two metres tall. They were unveiled in the presence of French President Francois Hollande and King Willem Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands during a visit by the Dutch royal couple.

""This is an exceptional work, legendary in Rembrandt's repertoire. This type of full-body portrait did not exist in Holland in the 17th century."" said Sebastien Allard, director of paintings at the Louvre.

""They are among the most valuable paintings of the era.""

Yaresko is touted as a successor to Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk, who narrowly survived a no confidence vote in February but whose popularity within the coalition and the voting public has collapsed since taking office in 2014.

The crisis has stymied Ukraine's efforts to secure more aid from its international backers, including the International Monetary Fund, which is contingent on Kiev implementing reforms and clamping down on corruption.

A foreign-born former investment manager, Yaresko could be a popular choice with Ukraine's Western allies, but it is unclear whether she would have the political muscle to push through reforms any faster than Yatseniuk could.

""I think it does not help any of us right now to engage in speculation, frankly,"" said Yaresko at an investor conference in Kiev, when quizzed about her possible role in a new government.

""I think the speculation is what's causing the crisis to some extent. So my preference would be to focus on reality.""

With Yatseniuk's coalition in turmoil, Ukraine and the IMF have yet to agree on a new memorandum setting out Kiev's precise commitments on reforms, which it will deliver in exchange for more aid worth $1.7 billion.

Even if Ukraine submits a new memorandum in March, it will have to wait at least until the IMF board meets in April to secure the money, she added.

""The memorandum is a living document,"" Yaresko said. ""The IMF has to know who is going to be in the government ... as a lender you want to know a person who signs. The IMF wants some confidence that the program will be implemented.""

Speaking at the same conference, the IMF's resident representative to Ukraine Jerome Vacher said the memorandum document was constantly evolving.

Discussions were ongoing about Ukraine's plans to fight corruption, reform its pension system and improve the government's finances, he said. However, he stressed the IMF board would need to be sure Kiev will stick to its commitments.

""It is important for us to have clarity on whether the policies will be implemented,"" Vacher said.

Obama will host Trudeau, the Liberal Party leader who took office in November, for an Oval Office meeting where they will talk about curbing climate emissions from oil and gas fields - a dramatic shift from years of debate over building the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a project Obama blocked last year. Also on the agenda are plans to expedite travel and trade between the two countries, and shared areas of global concern ranging from Syria to Ukraine. The two leaders will toast each other at a lavish state dinner planned with a theme of ""Anticipation of Spring,"" a feeling close to the hearts of Canadians, who endure long and harsh winters. Trudeau, who is struggling at home with a soft economy and weak Canadian dollar, campaigned on repairing strained ties. Americans have been captivated by the photogenic Trudeau, 44, whose father, Pierre Trudeau, was prime minister from 1968 through 1979, and again from 1980 to 1984. But his visit may be overshadowed by the raucous race to succeed Obama in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Candidates on both the left and the right have taken anti-trade positions. Obama hopes to convince a reluctant U.S. Congress to ratify the sprawling Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact before he leaves office in January.

Britain's Prince William has a snowball thrown at him by his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, during their skiing break in the French Alps, in this pool photograph dated March 3, 2016, and released in London March 7, 2016.

Britain's Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, pose with their children Princess Charlotte and Prince George (2nd R), during their skiing break in the French Alps, in this pool photograph dated March 3, 2016, and released in London March 7, 2016.

LONDON For the last six years, Prince William and his wife Kate have been the darlings of the world's media, gracing the front pages of newspapers and magazines across the globe with their good looks, easy charm and two photogenic children to boot.

In the last month, however, their royal luster has dimmed in the British press as they face accusations of laziness and enjoying the high life while shirking official duties.

""In the blinking of an eye, Prince William has gone from goodie-two-shoes who can do no wrong, to lazy layabout, not pulling his weight, spending too much time with his children and choosing to live in his hideaway in Norfolk,"" royal biographer Penny Junor wrote in the Daily Telegraph.

Ever since the couple's engagement in 2010 and sumptuous wedding the year after, they have been global celebrities, with Kate considered a fashion icon and William feted for his military service, devotion to family and latterly his work as an air ambulance helicopter pilot.

But William and his younger brother Harry have made little secret of their disdain for newspapers, fueled by the death of their mother Princess Diana, who was killed in a 1997 crash as her car fled chasing paparazzi on motorbikes.

In the background there have been grumblings about the royal family's desire to control what appears in the media, and last month the usually gushing British press turned on 'Wills and Kate', as the couple are often called.

It began when the second-in-line to the throne delivered a speech to British diplomats talking about the importance of Britain working with other nations, comments taken by some as tacit support for Britain staying in the European Union ahead of a June referendum.

Under Britain's unwritten constitution, the royal family are supposed to stay out of political matters, and with some papers holding a fairly eurosceptic editorial line, William's comments led to criticism - and personal attacks.

""Meddling Wills is throne idle"", wrote Rupert Murdoch's top-selling Sun tabloid which detailed how the queen, 89, and her 94-year-old husband Prince Philip had carried out hundreds more royal engagements than him in 2015.

The Sun is typically a strong supporter of the monarchy and other usually pro-royal papers also followed suit.

So when William's office Kensington Palace on Monday released pictures of the prince, Kate and children George and Charlotte playing in the snow on a four-day secret skiing holiday, instead of the usual happy headlines, the photos received an icier response.

""Busy? I'm snowed under,"" the Sun splashed on its front page, while the Daily Mail headlined its story ""Part-time Wills slopes off with Kate and kids"".

Junor said William was far from lazy, while fellow royal biographer Robert Lacey said he suspected the prince would have had the queen's approval for prioritizing his young family, as her own family had to take a back seat when she ascended the throne aged just 25.

Lacey said he doubted the criticism would last.

""Young royals are very popular and old royals are very popular, but when you're in the middle ,approaching middle age and losing your hair, you have to work and be seen to work,"" Lacey told Reuters.

""I have no doubt that this is a temporary situation. William will step up to the plate.""

The agreement was announced as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Barack Obama met at the White House. Methane, which can leak from pipelines and valves, is a powerful greenhouse gas, with up to 80 times the potential of carbon dioxide to trap the planet's heat. The agreement can do ""even more to protect our countries and our communities, especially in the Arctic, from climate change,"" Obama said during a welcoming ceremony for Trudeau. The two countries are seeking to improve relations after Obama last year rejected the Keystone XL pipeline, which was aimed at transporting heavy Canadian oil to the United States. Environmentalists had long opposed the project, which had been under review by Washington for years. Trudeau, a Liberal, had expressed qualified support for Keystone in his campaign. The project had been heavily promoted by his predecessor, Stephen Harper, a Conservative from Alberta's oil patch. On Thursday, the two countries committed to cutting emissions of methane by 40 to 45 percent below 2012 levels by 2025, to take steps to fight climate change in the Arctic, and to speed development of green technologies.

DUBLIN Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny lost a vote in parliament to be re-elected premier on Thursday, as expected, and was set to assume the role in a caretaker capacity while his Fine Gael party attempts to form a new government.

Ireland has become one of several euro zone countries facing a prolonged political stalemate following its inconclusive parliamentary election on Feb. 26. Senior Irish ministers say it could take weeks to break the deadlock.

Kenny's centre-right party fell 29 seats short of the 79 needed to win a parliamentary majority. Its historic rival Fianna Fail is the only viable partner to form a stable coalition but many in both parties are resisting such a tie-up.

Shortly after rejecting Kenny's re-election bid on Thursday, the Irish parliament also blocked an attempt by Fianna Fail's Micheal Martin, leader of the second biggest party, to become prime minister.

Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, whose rivalry dates back almost a century to the country's civil war, have not discussed the prospect of any kind of alliance and have instead been trying to garner support from smaller parties and independent lawmakers.

Finance Minister Michael Noonan of Fine Gael said this week he presumed those talks would evolve into discussions with Fianna Fail once Thursday's vote was out of the way. Kenny has said he would be open to such negotiations.

Fine Gael argues that Ireland needs political stability to preserve and extend growth in the economy, which data on Thursday showed hit 7.8 percent last year, making it the best performer in Europe for a second successive year.

Analysts believe Ireland's economy can handle a degree of uncertainty and the yield on Irish 10-year bonds remains near record lows, aided by European Central Bank quantitative easing.

Some Fine Gael lawmakers have raised two main options for breaking the deadlock: a formal coalition with Fianna Fail or a strongly constructed minority Fine Gael government supported by its rival on a vote-by-vote basis.

If neither can be agreed, Ireland would face a second election.

Fianna Fail, which won just seven fewer seats than Fine Gael in the election, remains unconvinced about cutting any deal with its rival.

""We were very clear at the time of the election that we ruled out Fine Gael as a coalition option and that hasn't changed,"" Fianna Fail frontbench member Billy Kelleher told the Newstalk radio station.

ADDIS ABABA Ethiopia, which plans to become a top regional electricity exporter, will soon launch a new 2,000 megawatt hydropower dam, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn said on Thursday.

Under a new 2015-2020 development plan, Addis Ababa wants to raise output to 17,346 megawatts from a current capacity of just over 2,200 from hydropower, wind and geothermal sources.

""The launch of this new dam will be commenced soon,"" Hailemariam told parliament, without giving further details.Ethiopia's bid to tap several rivers for power generation is part of plans to boost manufacturing and industrialize its agrarian economy.

It already has an array of projects under construction, including the $4.1 billion Grand Renaissance Dam that will churn out 6,000 megawatts upon completion within the next five years, as well as a 1,800-megawatt Gilgel Gibe 3 Dam in its southern region.

But the country's power ambitions have caused disputes in the past. Egypt - solely dependent on the Nile - has expressed concern that the Renaissance Dam will reduce the river's flow. Both countries are currently locked in discussions over the project's technical details.

And rights groups in Kenya say that the Gibe 3 Dam, and a related irrigation scheme, could dramatically reduce the volume of water in its Lake Turkana.

Experts put Ethiopia's hydropower potential at about 45,000 megawatts and geothermal at 5,000, while its wind power potential is believed to be Africa's third-largest behind Egypt and Morocco.

Hailemariam said Ethiopia, which signed a $4 billion-deal with a U.S.-Icelandic firm in 2013 to a build a 1,000 megawatt geothermal plant which will be the country's first privately-run utility, was also in negotiations with international companies to build more power generating projects.

Once Ethiopia's grand plans are complete, it wants to export power to countries in North and southern Africa and beyond.

But poor rainy seasons that have left 10.2 million people requiring food aid in the country of 90 million have also had an adverse impact on existing dams, Hailemariam said.

Four hydropower plants generating a total of 675 megawatts were either producing ""as low as 10 percent or nothing at all"" owing to low water levels, he said.

IDOMENI, Greece Scores of migrants stranded on Greece's northern border scuffled for free food and water on Thursday, struggling to seize eggs and bread thrown from a truck at the muddy tent city which has become their temporary home.

They were among thousands of people, many fleeing war-torn countries in the Middle East and Africa, braving rain, wind and cold temperatures for days at a camp near the town of Idomeni, hoping border shutdowns throughout the Balkans will be lifted.

No one has crossed into Macedonia this week, Greek authorities say, and at least 12,000 people are stranded in squalid conditions in the camp - nearly eight times its capacity.

More than 40 percent of those are children, aid groups on the ground estimate. Babies, some just weeks old, lie down on cardboard boxes. Scores suffer from respiratory conditions.

""My daughter and my wife are crying all the time for two days,"" said 42-year-old Magir Asfour, who fled fighting in the Syrian city of Aleppo. ""Our tent is wet. We didn't sleep last night. It flooded.""

After two days of rainfall, their flimsy summer tent, like others pitched beside them, is soaked through. Nearby, men try, unsuccessfully, to light fires using anything dry - from plastic bags to old, worn-out clothes and nappies.

""I'm carrying wood in the morning and my wife is waiting two hours in the rain to get a couple of sandwiches and an orange for my child,"" Asfour said.

It is a frequent sight across the camp: A young migrant boy trailing through the thick mud, dragging a blanket full of wet firewood to get him and others through the night.

Others are pushing cartfuls of logs to their family's tent, and men stagger wearily along muddy pools of water, weighed down by heavy tree trunks on their shoulders.

Conditions show little sign of improving. Dozens jostled for supplies this week when a shipment of firewood ordered by non-governmental organisations arrived at the camp.

On Thursday, they climbed onto a truck packed with free supplies - rice, pasta, water, diapers - and tossed eggs and bags of food to fellow migrants.

By the latest count, there were more 41,000 refugees and migrants stranded in Greece on Thursday, a day after Macedonia sealed its razor-wired fence border with Greece to ""illegal migrants"" after Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia announced tight new restrictions on migrant entry.

More than 130,000 people have reached Europe from Turkey this year and despite the Balkan route being closed, arrivals to Greece continued unabated on Thursday, with more than 2,300 arrivals to its eastern Aegean islands by early morning.

Mandatory Credit: Soobum Im-USA TODAY Sports/Files

BALTIMORE Michael Phelps has emerged from one of the darkest periods of his life as a happy man and immersed himself in a career revival, which is bad news for anyone looking to spoil his bid for a glorious Olympic farewell.

The American swimmer, who owns a record 18 Olympic gold medals, retired after winning four golds and two silver medals at the 2012 London Games.

Yet deep down, Phelps knew he did not give his best in 2012 and after hitting a personal low in 2014, rededicated himself, embracing life and working harder than ever in hopes of leaving the sport after the Rio Olympics on a high note at the ripe age of 31.

""I'm happy with who I am, Im happy where I am. I'm happy with what Im doing and I feel like a kid again,"" Phelps told Reuters at the Under Armour complex in Baltimore where he was promoting a TV commercial for the apparel maker.

""I feel more relaxed in my own skin than I've ever been, and I'm happier than I've ever been. It's the best spot I've ever been in my life.""

His impending marriage to former Miss California Nicole Johnson and eagerly awaited arrival of their baby boy have enriched the man, who despite all his triumphs had been sorely troubled in the past.

""I look back to 2012 and how I prepared for that and I can tell you it was a joke. It was,"" said Phelps. ""I had no passion and wasn't really too into it. I had no motivation. I think I needed time away from everything - from the sport, from my family, my friends, from every single part of my life.""

Phelps hit bottom in late 2014 with his second arrest on a drunken driving charge that resulted in a six-month ban by USA Swimming and 45 days in alcohol rehabilitation.

'REALLY BAD DOWNS'

It was a life-changing experience for Phelps, who has not had an alcoholic drink since.

""Its probably the most afraid Ive ever felt in my life, he told Sports Illustrated following his experience at the in-patient treatment program. ""I was in a really dark place, not wanting to be alive anymore.""

The most decorated Olympian dealt with other incidents over the years. In February 2009, a photograph of him using a water pipe on a college campus surfaced, bringing him a three-month suspension by USA Swimming.

In November 2004 at age 19, he was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and sentenced to 18 months' probation.

""If you asked me if I would change anything in my life I would say no,"" Phelps told Reuters. ""There were some good ups and Ive been through some really bad downs.

""But its what has come from those experiences both ways, I think, (that) has really made me who I am today and thats something that Im very proud of.""

A hard look at himself helped turn things around.

""To be able to sit down and just think about what I wanted to do, where I wanted to go. Who I am, really. And to be able to do that has allowed me to live more free, to be happy with who I am,"" he said.

COMPETITIVE FORM

Phelps has poured himself into his bubbly life and the quest to cap his legendary swim career in style.

""My sisters getting married, Im getting married, were having a kid, bought a house, were getting ready for Olympic trials, were getting ready for the Olympics,"" said Phelps, rattling off a to-do list.

""We just decided to do it all in one year. Why not?""

Phelps has been building back to competitive form ahead of June's U.S. championships in Omaha.

""I never wanted to look back 20 years down the road and say 'what if I did this differently, what if I did that differently,'"" said Phelps, who has a record 22 Olympic medals.

""This is me giving 100 percent. I dont really know besides 2000 the last time that I gave a hundred, hundred percent. I decided everything I do is going to be (aimed) to retire how I want.""

Looking superbly fit, Phelps gave a 20-minute glimpse of his rigorous out-of-pool workout at the sprawling Under Armour gym.

He squatted 315 pounds, exercised his core using a pulley, a rolling wheel and a ball, before finishing on the monkey bars, stopping at each rung to do pull-ups until he began tearing skin off his hands.

Phelps refused to specify his ""lofty goals"" for Rio, but believes his story is headed for a happy ending.

""My whole life has been a dream come true,"" said Phelps. ""It's time to put some icing on the cake this summer.""

Rights group accuse Gambian authorities of multiple violations, although Banjul denies a deterioration of civil liberties under Jammeh, one of Africa's ""big men"" who has been in power for two decades and will seek re-election this year.

Sheriff Diba fell foul of authorities in the tiny West African country after his union lobbied Jammeh for a reduction in retail fuel prices, according to the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) which represents him.

He was arrested last month and died on February 21 in Mile 2 prison after being beaten and tortured by members of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), the ITF said, citing local sources who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals.

""The ILO director-general (Guy Ryder) has expressed his deep concern urging the government to carry out an independent inquiry into the circumstances of Sheriff Diba's tragic death,"" International Labour Organisation spokesman Hans von Rohland said in an email to Reuters.

Gambia's Information Minister Sheriff Bojang was not immediately available for comment on Thursday. Officials have previously said Diba died of malaria.

Amnesty International echoed the ILO's call for an investigation into Diba's death and for Gambia to uphold freedom of association. Diba's union the Gambian National Transport Control Association has been dissolved by presidential order, according to the ITF.

ITF officials say they are also considering filing a complaint against Gambia with the Banjul-based African Commission on Human and People's Rights or with the U.N. Human Rights Committee over the incident.

Separately, rights groups this week called for Gambia to free a sick journalist whom they say was arrested by the NIA in July 2015 and charged with sedition.

Alagie Abdoulie Ceesay is currently held in the Mile 2 Prison where Diba was also detained.

U.N. rights officers were denied access to its security wing in 2014 while former prisoners have complained of a lack of access to medicine and lawyers.

Migrants try to get products from a truck at a makeshift camp on the Greek-Macedonian border near the village of Idomeni, Greece March 10, 2016.

IDOMENI, Greece Scores of migrants stranded on Greece's northern border scuffled for free food and water on Thursday, struggling to seize eggs and bread thrown from a truck at the muddy tent city which has become their temporary home.

They were among thousands of people, many fleeing war-torn countries in the Middle East and Africa, braving rain, wind and cold temperatures for days at a camp near the town of Idomeni, hoping border shutdowns throughout the Balkans will be lifted.

No one has crossed into Macedonia this week, Greek authorities say, and at least 12,000 people are stranded in squalid conditions in the camp - nearly eight times its capacity.

More than 40 percent of those are children, aid groups on the ground estimate. Babies, some just weeks old, lie down on cardboard boxes. Scores suffer from respiratory conditions.

""My daughter and my wife are crying all the time for two days,"" said 42-year-old Magir Asfour, who fled fighting in the Syrian city of Aleppo. ""Our tent is wet. We didn't sleep last night. It flooded.""

After two days of rainfall, their flimsy summer tent, like others pitched beside them, is soaked through. Nearby, men try, unsuccessfully, to light fires using anything dry - from plastic bags to old, worn-out clothes and nappies.

""I'm carrying wood in the morning and my wife is waiting two hours in the rain to get a couple of sandwiches and an orange for my child,"" Asfour said.

It is a frequent sight across the camp: A young migrant boy trailing through the thick mud, dragging a blanket full of wet firewood to get him and others through the night.

Others are pushing cartfuls of logs to their family's tent, and men stagger wearily along muddy pools of water, weighed down by heavy tree trunks on their shoulders.

Conditions show little sign of improving. Dozens jostled for supplies this week when a shipment of firewood ordered by non-governmental organisations arrived at the camp.

On Thursday, they climbed onto a truck packed with free supplies - rice, pasta, water, diapers - and tossed eggs and bags of food to fellow migrants.

By the latest count, there were more 41,000 refugees and migrants stranded in Greece on Thursday, a day after Macedonia sealed its razor-wired fence border with Greece to ""illegal migrants"" after Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia announced tight new restrictions on migrant entry.

More than 130,000 people have reached Europe from Turkey this year and despite the Balkan route being closed, arrivals to Greece continued unabated on Thursday, with more than 2,300 arrivals to its eastern Aegean islands by early morning.

Authorities evacuated some 120 people in southwestern Serbia earlier this week after rivers overflowed their banks, flooding hundreds of homes and large tracts of farmland.

In a statement, the government said it had declared the state of emergency ""as a preemptive measure to ease and speed up actions of all state bodies"" with the aim of protecting human lives and property and reducing the effects of flooding.

In 2014 the heaviest rainfall in more than a century caused rivers in Serbia to burst their banks, sweeping away roads, bridges and homes. More than 50 people died while total damage was estimated at 1.5 billion euros ($1.67 billion).

But critics said the damage then would not have been so great if the government of Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic and state-owned utilities had reacted in a timely manner to meteorologists' warnings of heavy rain.

""This time we are declaring a state of emergency preventatively,"" Serbia's interior minister, Nebojsa Stefanovic, told B92 TV broadcaster. ""If the rainfall continues there is a danger that certain rivers will flood and we need to be prepared for that.""

He said the army and the police would be deployed to help strengthen dams with sandbags and evacuate people if needed.

A green Umbro brand New York Cosmos football jersey number '10' worn by Pele during the 1976 North American Soccer League (NASL) season is shown in this handout image released on March 8, 2016.

Triple World Cup soccer winner Pele is putting some 2,000 items up for auction, including his three World Cup medals and a one of a kind Jules Rimet trophy that could fetch up to one million dollars, auctioneers said on Thursday.

The Brazilian regarded by many as the greatest soccer player of all time is also selling off his 1,000th goal ball and crown, and jerseys he wore while playing for Brazilian club Santos FC and the New York Cosmos in what marks his first ever public offering of career memorabilia, Julien's Auctions said.

""Pele is like the Marilyn Monroe of the sports world. He is such an icon and a great ambassador for soccer,"" Martin Nolan, executive director of Beverly Hills-based Julien's Auctions, told Reuters.

The three-day auction will take place in London from June 7-9 and will be preceded by a public exhibition starting June 1.

Pele, whose given name is Edson Arantes do Nascimento, became in 1958 at age 17 the youngest ever person to play in, and score in a World Cup final. He went on to help Brazil to World Cup victories in 1962 and 1970, and holds the Guinness World Record for most goals in a career with 1,283.

Now 75 years old, and after recent replacement hip and prostate surgery, Pele said that having donated much of his collection to the city of Santos, he had ""decided to allow fans and collectors to own a piece of my history as well. I hope they treasure these artifacts and share my story with their children and generations to come.""

He said a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Pequeno Principe children's hospital in the Brazilian city of Curitiba.

The top item for auction is a Jules Rimet trophy that was created especially for Pele by world soccer body FIFA and the Mexican government after he led Brazil to the nation's third World Cup victory in Mexico in 1970. It is inscribed with his three wins for Brazil.

Julien's has placed an estimated price of $400,000 - $600,000 on the trophy but says it could sell for much more.

""It is such a unique item. We think that is a very conservative estimate. This is possibly something that could sell for up to one million dollars,"" said Nolan.

Pele's three World Cup medals are expected to fetch up to $200,000, while the ball with which he scored his 1,000th goal is expected to sell for $40,000-$60,000. The player's 1977 New York Cosmos NASL championship ring, 2004 Summer Olympics Torch Relay and L'Equipe Athlete of the Century award are also for sale.

Yet the most humble and precious item of all, if it can be verified, may be a makeshift soccer ball made of rolled-up socks that the pre-teen Pele kicked around the streets of Bauru.

""We have softballs stitched up in canvas but we haven't definitively established yet that we have that first ball. If that ball was to exist it would be phenomenal,"" said Nolan.

MILANO I lavori sulla fusione tra Bpm e Banco Popolare proseguono dopo l'incontro di ieri in Bce tra i vertici delle due banche e la Vigilanza con l'obiettivo di sciogliere i nodi che ad oggi hanno bloccato il decollo dell'operazione.

Per la chiusura del dossier con l'avallo di Francoforte, anche se in una prima fase informale, non sono previste scadenze e l'intenzione e dunque quella di prendersi tutto il tempo necessario per non lasciare niente di intentato. Una fonte vicina alla Bpm sottolinea che il consiglio di gestione ha definito in modo coeso la necessita di arrivare in termini ragionevolmente rapidi e entro l'assemblea del 30 aprile su bilancio e rinnovo del consiglio di sorveglianza, ad una soluzione.

Stamani si e tenuta una riunione del consiglio di gestione della popolare milanese con all'ordine del giorno temi ordinari, ma nell'occasione l'AD Giuseppe Castagna ha aggiornato i consiglieri sullo stato delle trattative e sul summit di ieri in Bce.

""Si lavora, si va avanti"", ha detto un consigliere uscendo dalla riunione sottolineando tuttavia che ""a brevissimo non c'e niente"" e che ""non ci sono scadenze"".

Per il consigliere ""si lavora auspicabilmente fino a quando non si trova un soluzione"".

Le principali questioni poste dalla Bce, come ribadito oggi da un consigliere di Bpm, restano quelle sulla gestione dei crediti deteriorati della banca che nascerebbe dalla fusione, pari complessivamente a quasi 18 miliardi (a livello netto) di cui 8 miliardi di sofferenze.

La Bce ha chiesto una drastica riduzione e tempi di smaltimento particolarmente stretti sui crediti dubbi, anche rispetto all'ipotesi di un piano di riduzione a tre anni, lasciando sullo sfondo la necessita di un aumento di capitale che le due banche non intendono effettuare.

""La Bce vuole che il peso dei crediti deteriorati del gruppo che nascera dalla fusione rientri in un range da grande banca"", spiega una fonte italiana vicina alla situazione secondo cui la Vigilanza europea non avrebbe mai esplicitato negli incontri con le banche la necessita di una ricapitalizzazione.

Sul fronte della governance ci sarebbero invece state alcune aperture da parte della Vigilanza pur rimanendo ferma la richiesta di un contenimento delle strutture.

In particolare, l'ipotesi della creazione, sotto la holding, di una Bpm Spa quale banca rete degli sportelli lombardi del nuovo gruppo, e dotata di un Cda, per un periodo limitato a tre anni potrebbe essere accettata.

Tutte le parti in causa, per motivi diversi, sono comunque intenzionate a portare le discussioni a un esito positivo. ""Non si vuole mollare, da tutte e tre le parti, banche e Bce"", aggiunge la fonte.

Dopo i chiarimenti di ieri il management delle due banche torna dunque al lavoro per presentare soluzioni piu convincenti e fornire ulteriori garanzie, soprattutto sulla gestione dei crediti. Rispetto alle previsioni iniziali i tempi si allungano tanto che un consigliere arriva ad ipotizzare che il via libero definitivo delle assemblee potrebbe a questo punto slittare a dopo l'estate.

Nessun commento dalle parti interessate.

Gli addetti ai lavori usano il verbo 'deliver', in inglese 'consegnare' ma anche 'partorire, far nascere'. In gergo, per la mossa dell'odierno consiglio Bce si farebbe senza dubbio ricorso al verbo 'over-deliver'.

La Banca centrale europea ha portato a zero il costo del denaro e ulteriormente abbassato il tasso su depositi e prestiti overnight, portandoli a rispettivi -0,4% e 0,25%.

Se gia questa prima mossa non era incorporata nei tassi impliciti, con un taglio rispetto al precedente 0,05% sul rifinanziamento principale escluso sia dagli operatori sia dagli analisti, Francoforte non si e fermata qui.

Aumenta da 60 a 80 miliardi di euro l'importo degli acquisti mensili nella cornice del programma di acquisti 'quantitative easing' e viene innalzato il limite sulle singole emissioni e sui singoli emittenti.

In arrivo anche, da giugno, una nuova serie di quattro 'targeted long term financing operation' a durata quattro anni, che potranno venire assegnate a un tasso negativo fino al nuovo riferimento sui depositi.

Tradotto: le banche della zona euro disposte a finanziare l'economia reale saranno pagate da Francoforte per prendere a prestito fondi da girare ai privati.

Ma il cosiddetto coniglio estratto dal cilindro e un altro: a partire dalla fine del secondo trimestre gli acquisti 'qe' sul secondario verranno ampliati alle emissioni corporate, a patto abbiano un rating 'investment grade'.

Si tratta di uno degli strumenti piu comuni nei programmi di espansione monetaria, di norma accompagnato da una piu massiccia sottoscrizione di titoli di Stato. Lo praticano da anni Banca del Giappone e Banca d'inghilterra, che sottoscrive pero carta 'high quality'. Federal Reserve, che ha condotto tre programmi 'qe', si 'limitava' invece ad acquistare titoli garantiti da mutui immobiliari prima della crisi dei 'subprime'.

Resta tutto da vedere quali saranno le conseguenze sulla zona euro.

In un primo momento entusiasti delle parole di Draghi, evidentemente in preda alla confusione i mercati hanno rapidamente innestato la retromarcia.

Se il medico aumenta la dose del farmaco significa comunque che la patologia del malato si e aggravata.

Le nuove misure 'convenzionali' e 'non convenzionali' rispondono infatti a un quadro di vistoso deterioramento, sia in termini di crescita sia soprattutto in termini di inflazione, come illustrato dalle nuove stime trimestrali dello staff.

Dulcis in fundo l'avvertimento di Draghi: se i provvedimenti odierni hanno ricevuto dal consiglio un via libera a ""schiacciante maggioranza"", c'e un limite al di sotto del quale l'istituto centrale non puo abbassare i tassi.

Finora, garantisce il presidente, l'esperienza di tassi negativi e stata ""molto positiva"".

""Questo equivale a dire che qualsiasi tasso negativo avra un effetto positivo? Significa che si possano tenere i tassi in territorio negativo tanto a lungo quanto ci piace senza alcuna conseguenza negativa sul sistema bancario? La risposta e no"" avverte.

Ko Yun-hwa (L), Administrator of Korea Meteorological Administration, points at where seismic waves observed in South Korea came from, during a media briefing at Korea Meteorological Administration in Seoul, South Korea, January 6, 2016.

VIENNA Two months after what is widely believed to have been a nuclear test by North Korea, the radioactive particles to prove it have yet to be detected, suggesting the communist state is getting better at hiding the fallout, experts say.

Fifty-five days after North Korea's previous test in 2013, those particles, known as radionuclides, wafted over a monitoring station in Japan, proving what seismic evidence already suggested - that an atomic bomb had been detonated.

Now, 64 days after North Korea announced its latest test and seismic data appeared to confirm it, diplomats and nuclear analysts suspect final technical proof may never materialise.

""With every day that passes, it becomes less likely that we will get a conclusive analysis,"" said one diplomat who follows North Korea's nuclear programme closely.

January's detonation followed three previous nuclear tests by North Korea, the last before January's was the 2013 one.

Back then, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty organisation (CTBTO), a body monitoring seismic and radionuclide data world wide, confirmed the nuclear bomb test as such by analysing traces of the colourless, odourless noble gas xenon.

The CTBTO system can differentiate between chemical and nuclear explosions. It cannot differentiate between a standard nuclear bomb test and a hydrogen bomb test, a more powerful nuclear weapon that North Korea claimed to have used.

CTBTO head Lassina Zerbo and other diplomats have said seismic data did not indicate the test involved a hydrogen bomb.

""It can be assumed that North Korea is getting better at hiding the results of its nuclear tests, and sealing off the area where they are testing to prevent nuclides from leaking into the atmosphere,"" Mark Hibbs, nuclear expert at think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said.

Experts and diplomats caution that due to xenon's short nuclear half live it now might be too late to get such proof.

""Over 55 days after the announced nuclear test in the DPRK, several recent (...) radionuclide measurements could be consistent with either a release from a test or with other possible sources, and are therefore not conclusive,"" CTBTO's Zerbo said in an emailed statement about North Korea.

The CTBTO's analyses are based on a network of data centres across the globe which collect seismic and radionuclide data and which have in the past been the first points to pick up on North Korea testing a nuclear bomb.

Difficult weather patterns make such analyses more complex.

""The task may be even more difficult now if the North Koreans have been working to improve their nuclear explosion containment techniques,"" Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, said in an emailed statement.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meets scientists and technicians in the field of researches into nuclear weapons in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang March 9, 2016.

SEOUL North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea on Thursday in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, as South Korean and U.S. forces conducted massive war games.

The North also announced it had scrapped all agreements with the South on commercial exchange projects and would ""liquidate"" South Korean assets left behind in its territory.

North Korea has a large stockpile of short-range missiles and is developing long-range and intercontinental missiles as well. Thursday's missiles flew about 500 km (300 miles) into the sea, off the east coast city of Wonsan and probably were part of the Soviet-developed Scud series, South Korea's defence ministry said.

Japan, within range of the longer-range variant of Scud missiles or the upgraded Rodong missiles, lodged a protest through the North Korean embassy in Beijing, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported.

A Pentagon spokesman, Commander Bill Urban, said on Thursday the U.S. Defense Department was aware of the reports of the missile launches. ""We are monitoring the situation closely,"" he said.

North Korea often fires short-range missiles when tensions rise on the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang gets particularly upset about the annual U.S.-South Korea drills, which it says are preparations for an invasion.

The U.S. and South Korea remain technically at war with the North because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armed truce instead of a peace agreement.

Around 17,000 U.S. military personnel are participating alongside some 300,000 South Korean troops in what South Korea's Defence Ministry has called the ""largest-ever"" joint military exercises.

North Korea on Sunday warned it would make a ""pre-emptive and offensive nuclear strike"" in response to the exercises.

""LIQUIDATING"" ASSETS

After Thursday's missile launches, North Korea announced it would ""liquidate"" South Korean assets left behind in the Kaesong industrial zone and in the Mount Kumgang tourist zone.

South Korea protested the move as ""totally unacceptable"" but did not say what it could do to recover the assets that it valued in excess of 1.4 trillion won ($1.17 billion).

Seoul suspended operations in the jointly run zone last month as punishment for the North's rocket launch and nuclear test.

Mount Kumgang was the first major inter-Korean cooperation project. Thousands of South Koreans visited the resort between 1998 and 2008. Seoul ended the tours in 2008 after a North Korean soldier shot dead a South Korean tourist who wandered into a restricted area.

North Korea is also livid about stepped-up United Nations sanctions adopted last week following its recent nuclear test and long-range missile launch.

South Korea's foreign ministry said Thursday's missile launches again violated a series of U.N. Security Council resolutions and it would refer the matter to the Council's sanctions committee mandated to enforce the resolutions.

Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Hong Lei described the situation on the Korean peninsula as ""complex and sensitive.""

""All sides should stop their provocative words and deeds to avoid a further rise in tensions,"" he said.

MINIATURISED WARHEADS

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country has miniaturised nuclear warheads to mount on ballistic missiles, state media reported on Wednesday, and called on his military to be prepared to mount pre-emptive attacks against the United States and South Korea.

It was his first direct comment on the technology needed to deploy nuclear missiles. North Korean state media released photographs they said showed Kim Jong Un inspecting a spherical miniaturised warhead. State media have previously made that claim, which has been widely questioned and never independently verified.

South Korea's defence ministry said it did not believe the North had successfully miniaturised a nuclear warhead or deployed a functioning intercontinental ballistic missile.

U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby declined on Wednesday to comment on Kim's claim to have miniaturised nuclear warheads and accused him of ""provocative rhetoric.""

""I'd say the young man needs to pay more attention to the North Korean people and taking care of them, than in pursuing these sorts of reckless capabilities,"" Kirby said.

The Pentagon said this week it had not seen North Korea demonstrate a capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead. But Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said on Wednesday the department was working on U.S. ballistic missile defences to be prepared.

North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 but its claim to have set off a miniaturised hydrogen bomb last month has been disputed by the U.S. and South Korean governments and many experts, who said the blast was too small to back it up.

Left-arm spinner Wellington Masakadza picked up four for 28 to help Zimbabwe to an 11-run win over Group B rivals Scotland who became the first team to be knocked out of the biennial event following two consecutive defeats.

Hong Kong then became the second team to be ousted as they lost by six wickets to Afghanistan in the late Group B match.

Sean Williams (53) scored his third T20 half-century to resurrect the Zimbabwe innings after they lost two quick wickets batting first.

Captain Hamilton Masakadza was run out for the second consecutive game, falling short of the crease after colliding with opening partner Vusi Sibanda, who followed soon after being treated for an injury he sustained in the clash.

Williams' measured knock and some late hitting from Elton Chigumbura (20) took their side to 147 for seven in 20 overs.

Scotland were then reduced to 20 for four following double strikes from Wellington Masakadza and paceman Tendai Chatara before staging a recovery with a 51-run stand for the sixth wicket between Richie Berrington and captain Preston Mommsen.

Wellington Masakadza struck twice in the 15th over to stall Scotland's progress before Josh Davey smashed 24 off 13 balls to leave his team needing 30 from 18 balls.

Donald Tiripano varied his pace intelligently in the closing stages, snaring two wickets as Scotland were bundled out for 136 with two deliveries remaining.

Hong Kong made a strong start after deciding to bat first, reaching 40 for no loss before Afghanistan's bowlers, led by former captain Mohammad Nabi, fought back with a flurry of wickets.

Off-spinner Nabi took four for 20 as Afghanistan restricted Hong Kong to 116 for six.

Mohammad Shahzad (41) and Noor Ali Zadran (35) then put on 70 for the opening wicket for Afghanistan to put them on course for victory.

The Afghans, who defeated Scotland in their opening match on Tuesday, reached their target with two overs to spare.

The opinions expressed are his own.

John Gutfreund is taking an old Wall Street model to the grave. Salomon Brothers boss during the 1980s died on Wednesday, age 86. His tenure marked the vanguard of investment banks moving from partnerships into trading powerhouses  and ultimately into scandal.

In many respects, Gutfreund  immortalized in Michael Lewis Liars Poker  helped lay the groundwork for the excesses that took the industry to the brink of disaster almost two decades after he was forced out. But Gutfreunds era was one where bankers could only put their own firms and personal wealth, rather than the global economic system, at risk.

Gutfreund (pronounced good friend) started to shake up the firm and its industry within three years of taking the helm in 1978. He did so by selling it for $557 million to Phillips Brothers, the Glencore of its day, in a deal that prompted Billy Salomon, who had hand-picked Gutfreund as his successor  to lament that his materialism is disgraceful.

That marked the first time that a major Wall Street bank was publicly traded  and transferred the bulk of the risk away from employees to shareholders. The combination of more trading nous and less direct exposure to losses spurred even more risk-taking  a recurring theme of the next quarter-century on Wall Street. Salomon was, under Gutfreunds leadership, regarded as the industrys cutting edge.

The sale to Phibro also spawned another Wall Street staple  boardroom coups. By 1984 Gutfreund had wrested control back from his erstwhile allies at Phibro. Within three years, problems hit several securities firms as junk bond bets soured. Unlike in 2008, though, private capital alone came to the rescue, rather than a taxpayer bailout  in Salomons case, from Warren Buffett.

Thats largely because securities firms, unlike the banks they ultimately became, were smaller, less complex and less interconnected than their contemporary incarnations. Even the rogue trader scandal in 1990 that almost wrecked Salomon didnt have enough power to do more than rattle rivals. It did, though, effectively end Gutfreunds career  and unlike latter-day peers he was sent packing without a golden handshake and with a ban from running a securities firm without prior approval from regulators.

In retrospect, that lends his kind of risk-taking a degree of perverse charm compared to the economy-busting mega banks amassed within a few years of his departure, when Salomon was acquired by the behemoth that became Citigroup. In that regard, Gutfreund will be missed.",[]

reuters.com,2016-03-10 18:28:43+00:00,Security fears overshadow world's biggest travel fair,"['Victoria Bryan', 'Maria Sheahan']","BERLIN Security fears are on everybody's lips at the ITB travel trade fair in Berlin this year as a battered tourist industry seeks to reassure travellers and tour operators that they need not shy away from booking summer holidays for this year.

Attacks in tourist hotspots like a Tunisian beach resort and the city of Paris over the past year have rattled travellers' confidence, sending bookings for Tunisia, Turkey and Egypt plummeting and heralding a slowdown in demand for international travel.

""People have money to spend, but there's a strong negative impact from the geopolitical situation. People fear attacks,"" Roy Scheerder, commercial director at low cost Dutch airline Transavia, told Reuters at ITB.

Airlines, tour operators, hoteliers and travel search companies at the fair said they had seen more caution than usual in bookings at the start of the year, often a popular time for people to book trips.

A survey by consultancy IPK International projected that growth in the number of international trips taken would slow to 3 percent this year, down from 4.6 percent in 2015.

Rolf Freitag, founder of IPK, said security fears had knocked off about 1.5 percentage points from the expected growth this year. Of 50,000 people in 42 countries surveyed at the start of February, 15 percent said they would either not travel or holiday in their home country this year.

Hotel groups like Marriott International (MAR.O) and Best Western expressed concern over tourist bookings for Paris after November's attacks on the French capital, which may have a knock-on effect on other destinations.

""It has a ripple effect. If you think about someone travelling from the United States to Paris, Paris was not the only city they would visit, they would also go to other parts of France or Europe, and that has been curtailed,"" Best Western CEO David Kong told Reuters.

The beneficiaries are destinations perceived to carry a smaller risk of becoming the target of attacks.

""The really hot markets are anywhere that's safe. Spain is on fire for this summer. Italy is very strong,"" Darren Huston, chief executive of Priceline Group (PCLN.O) and its subsidiary Booking.com, told Reuters.

Spanish low-cost carrier Vueling (ICAG.L), for instance, has added more capacity to Spanish destinations from Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland to keep up with demand, though it highlighted that hotel space was running out.

Destinations in North America and the Caribbean are seeing increased demand, while search firm Kayak said Germans were more interested in hotels in their own country this year.

Some in the industry are clinging to hope that tourists will still travel this summer but are holding off on firm bookings longer than usual due to the uncertain security outlook.

""Past experience has shown us that a country that is serious about tourism and has built an infrastructure always bounces back,"" Taleb Rifai, the head of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), told Reuters in an interview.

""Look at Egypt. It has been up and down for the last 10 years. Every time it comes back stronger than before,"" he said.

Four top executives left the company in January, the biggest leadership exodus since co-founder Jack Dorsey returned as chief executive last year.

The departures added to concerns about the company's ability to make its product more engaging and generate more money from advertising.

Twitter has been offering cash bonuses to some employees, ranging from $50,000 to $200,000 as an incentive to keep them around for another six months to a year, the Journal reported on Wednesday.

The company has also granted varying amounts of restricted stock depending on when the employees started working, intending to make up for the value lost since they joined the company, the newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Twitter's shares have lost more than 60 percent of their value over the past 12 months.

""Competitive compensation, strong leadership and a confidence in the direction of the company are all key elements to having top talent,"" a Twitter spokeswoman said in an email.

""We are investing in all three areas to ensure we maintain these employees,"" she said, without providing further details.

Dorsey said in October he would give a third of his stock in the company, a stake of about 1 percent, to the employee equity pool.

Later that month, he spoke about ""hiring and investing in talent"" and the need for ""bold rethinking.""

Twitter showed no growth in users in the fourth quarter. That was the first time that had happened since the company went public in 2013.

Twitter's shares were unchanged at $17.66 in light premarket trading.

IDOMENI, Greece Scores of migrants stranded on Greece's northern border scuffled for free food and water on Thursday, struggling to seize eggs and bread thrown from a truck at the muddy tent city which has become their temporary home.

They were among thousands of people, many fleeing war-torn countries in the Middle East and Africa, braving rain, wind and cold temperatures for days at a camp near the town of Idomeni, hoping border shutdowns throughout the Balkans will be lifted.

No one has crossed into Macedonia this week, Greek authorities say, and at least 12,000 people are stranded in squalid conditions in the camp - nearly eight times its capacity.

More than 40 percent of those are children, aid groups on the ground estimate. Babies, some just weeks old, lie down on cardboard boxes. Scores suffer from respiratory conditions.

""My daughter and my wife are crying all the time for two days,"" said 42-year-old Magir Asfour, who fled fighting in the Syrian city of Aleppo. ""Our tent is wet. We didn't sleep last night. It flooded.""

After two days of rainfall, their flimsy summer tent, like others pitched beside them, is soaked through. Nearby, men try, unsuccessfully, to light fires using anything dry - from plastic bags to old, worn-out clothes and nappies.

""I'm carrying wood in the morning and my wife is waiting two hours in the rain to get a couple of sandwiches and an orange for my child,"" Asfour said.

It is a frequent sight across the camp: A young migrant boy trailing through the thick mud, dragging a blanket full of wet firewood to get him and others through the night.

Others are pushing cartfuls of logs to their family's tent, and men stagger wearily along muddy pools of water, weighed down by heavy tree trunks on their shoulders.

Conditions show little sign of improving. Dozens jostled for supplies this week when a shipment of firewood ordered by non-governmental organizations arrived at the camp.

On Thursday, they climbed onto a truck packed with free supplies - rice, pasta, water, diapers - and tossed eggs and bags of food to fellow migrants.

By the latest count, there were more 41,000 refugees and migrants stranded in Greece on Thursday, a day after Macedonia sealed its razor-wired fence border with Greece to ""illegal migrants"" after Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia announced tight new restrictions on migrant entry.

More than 130,000 people have reached Europe from Turkey this year and despite the Balkan route being closed, arrivals to Greece continued unabated on Thursday, with more than 2,300 arrivals to its eastern Aegean islands by early morning.

WASHINGTON China will be able to project ""substantial offensive military power"" from artificial islands it has built in the South China Sea's disputed Spratly Islands within months, the director of U.S. national intelligence said.

In a Feb. 23 letter to John McCain, chair of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, James Clapper said Chinese land reclamation and construction work in the Spratlys had established infrastructure needed ""to project military capabilities in the South China Sea beyond that which is required for point defence of its outposts.""

""Based on the pace and scope of construction at these outposts, China will be able to deploy a range of offensive and defensive military capabilities and support increased PLAN and CCG presence beginning in 2016,"" Clapper said in the letter released this week, using acronyms for the Chinese navy and coastguard.

""Once these facilities are completed by the end of 2016 or early 2017, China will have significant capacity to quickly project substantial offensive military power to the region,"" Clapper added.

The United States has voiced concerns about China's assertive pursuit of territory in the South China Sea. The sea is one of the world's busiest trade routes and regional countries have rival claims, creating a potential flashpoint.

Visiting Washington in September, Chinese President Xi Jinping responded to U.S. worries by saying that China had no intention to militarize its outposts in the Spratlys.

Beijing has said their military roles will be defensive, but the head of the U.S. Pacific Command said last month China was ""clearly militarising"" the South China Sea with the aim of achieving East Asian hegemony.

The text of Clapper's letter in response to questions from McCain was published on the news portal of the U.S. Naval Institute. U.S. officials confirmed the content.

Clapper said that while the United States had yet to observe deployment of significant Chinese military capabilities in the Spratlys, it had built facilities able to support them, including modern fighter aircraft.

China had already installed military radars at Cuarteron and Fiery Cross Reefs, and the infrastructure could also allow for the deployment surface-to-air missiles, coastal defence cruise missiles and an increased presence of warships, he said.

The United States had not seen Chinese air force activity in the Spratlys, but warships had stopped at its outposts including a guided-missile frigate and a guided-missile destroyer in December and January, Clapper said.

He said tank-landing ships had been employed widely in construction work and the landing of civil aircraft at Fiery Cross Reef in January showed the airstrip there was operational and able to accommodate all Chinese military aircraft.

Clapper said China continued its land reclamation in the Spratlys after Aug. 5, when its foreign minister claimed that it had been halted.

While there was no evidence that China has plans for any significant additional land reclamation in the Spratlys, Clapper said there was sufficient reef area in the Spratlys for it to reclaim more than 1,000 additional acres (400 hectares).

The Pentagon has said that Beijing has sought to bolster its claim to nearly all of the South China Sea with island building projects in the Spratlys that have reclaimed more than 2,900 acres (1,170 hectares) of land since 2013.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 18:49:29+00:00,"Skype co-founder launches ultra-private messaging, with video",['Eric Auchard'],"FRANKFURT A group of former Skype technologists, backed by the co-founder of the messaging platform, has introduced a new version of its own messaging service that promises end-to-end encryption for all conversations, including by video.

Wire, a 50-person start-up mostly made up of engineers, is stepping into a global political debate over encryption that pits privacy against security advocates, epitomized by the standoff between the U.S. government and Apple.

The company said on Thursday it was adding video calling to a package of private communications services that go beyond existing messaging providers.

Rivals such as Facebook's (FB.O) Messenger and WhatsApp, Telegram, Threema and Signal offer encryption on only parts of a message's journey or for a limited set of services, it said.

Wire, which is based in Switzerland and stores user communications on its own computers, delivers privacy protections that are always on, even when callers use multiple devices, such as a phone or desktop PC simultaneously.

This comprehensive approach poses fresh challenges to law enforcers, who often seek to exploit gaps in encryption in criminal or security investigations.

""We believe Wire is unique in the industry with always-on encryption for all conversation(s), in groups or 1:1, with simultaneous support for multiple devices,"" Wire Chief Technology Officer Alan Duric said in a statement.

""Everything is end-to-end encrypted: That means voice and video calls, texts, pictures, graphics - all the content you can send,"" Wire Executive Chairman Janus Friis told Reuters.

The Danish entrepreneur was a co-founder of Skype, first released in 2003, which was later sold to a series of owners and is now a unit of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

Wire launched the first version of its self-titled communications app late in 2014 to limited notice because it offered encrypted calling and text services similar to a dozen other apps, distinguished mainly by crystal-clear voice quality.

The app relies on standard, open-source encryption techniques, which allows outside technical experts to evaluate the security of its products rather than relying on trust.

Technical details can be found at wire.com/privacy/

Wire receives financial backing from Iconical, a group of designers, engineers and executives that act as alternative to traditional venture capital investors. Friis invests in Wire as part of Iconical.

It has not disclosed how much funding it has received. A key selling point for Wire is that it protects users from advertising. Like many start-ups in this area, it is seeking to grow quickly and discover a sustainable business model later.

FRANKFURT The European Central Bank's decision to buy corporate bonds will be a boon for investors but may have a muted impact on inflation given the small size of that market and its tenuous link to the broader economy.

The ECB, which so far bought bonds issued by governments and other public entities, announced on Thursday it would purchase the debt of private companies provided they are based in the euro zone, have an investment grade rating and are not banks.

ECB President Mario Draghi said the move would ease financing conditions in the real economy, presumably by lowering yields on corporate bonds -- effectively making it cheaper for companies to borrow money on the market.

Indeed, yields on bonds issued by euro zone non-financial companies fell sharply on Thursday ITEXO5Y=.

However, the market for such notes is small and is mainly made up of large corporations that have enjoyed low financing costs for years and, in some cases, sit on large cash piles.

The ECB has not said how many bonds it will buy or how large it estimates the market to be.

""Speculation is that it could be in the region of 5 billion euros ($5.59 billion) per month,"" Tanguy Le Saout, head of European fixed-income at Pioneer Investments, said.

This would be a small portion of the ECB's monthly purchases, which were increased to 80 billion euros on Thursday.

It may represent a significant slice of the market for such bonds, however.

In a note earlier this year, Barclays analysts said bonds from non-financial institutions that would meet the ECB criteria amounted to 480 billion euros, adding an ECB move into this market would have negligible effect on credit conditions.

What the ECB will achieve is an expansion the assets it can buy, easing fears it may run out of eligible targets.

It will likely also lead investors currently holding corporate bonds into higher-yielding assets such as stocks.

This process, known by central bankers as portfolio-rebalancing, has been the most visible result of central banks' quantitative easing programmes across the world, fuelling rallies in major markets between 2012 and 2015.

It is supposed to finance corporate investment but its impact on the real economy has been small. Many companies have preferred to buy back shares or even sit on their cash, rather than put money to work while growth prospects remain poor.

""Is it enough to boost inflation? Im not so sure,"" Philippe Gudin, an economist at Barclays, said. ""Its not a silver bullet. Inflation is still low because there are external factors and the recovery is modest.""

The ECB's own staff estimates showed price growth would not reach the bank's target of almost 2 percent for the next two years and economic growth will remain slow.

In the meantime, corporate bond investors may be the real beneficiaries of the ECB's largesse.

""This demand will act as a strong support for current spread levels and should see corporate bonds out-performing their sovereign counter-parts,"" Pioneer's Le Saout said.

O atletismo internacional vive atualmente um dos piores escandalos da historia devido a um esquema de corrupcao e doping na Russia, envolvendo autoridades russas e internacionais.

A Russia, que so fica atras dos Estados Unidos na elite da modalidade, esta atualmente suspensa de todas as competicoes de atletismo e so podera voltar a competir, incluindo na Rio 2016, se provar a Wada que cumpriu uma serie de condicoes antidoping.

WASHINGTON U.S. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump called for raising tariffs on foreign-made goods on Thursday, in a further break from his party's free-trade philosophy ahead of nominating contests in big industrial states that have been hit hard by globalization.

The billionaire businessman has harnessed working-class anxieties about immigration and trade to become the leading Republican vying to be the party's candidate in the November election. His White House bid has driven a wedge between the party's moneyed donors and grassroots voters, alarming party leaders who see him as a dangerous demagogue.

Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich will share the stage at a CNN-hosted debate at the University of Miami, which begins at 8:30 p.m. (0130 GMT on Friday). After a debate last week that degenerated into name-calling and sexual innuendo, Republican strategists were hoping for a more substantive evening.

Trump on Thursday criticized European Union nations and other countries for lowering interest rates, saying the move could cost manufacturing jobs at home. He said the United States should raise tariffs in response.

""We just sit back and do nothing,"" Trump, 69, said on CNBC television. ""That's getting to be very dangerous as far as I'm concerned.""

Though the brash New Yorker has made economic issues a central theme of his presidential bid, he has steered clear of specifics.

He has promised to deport 11 million illegal immigrants, temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country and renegotiate trade deals with countries like China to protect U.S. workers.

Critics have dismissed those plans as unworkable at best, and Trump's Republican presidential rivals have pointed out that his resorts have brought in workers from abroad rather than hiring Americans.

Our Principles PAC, an anti-Trump group, said on Thursday it would spend $1 million on ads in Ohio - where Republicans will vote in a crucial presidential primary next week - that hit him for having ties and shirts made in Asia.

However, nothing that Trump's rivals for the nomination or mainstream Republican leaders have thrown at him so far has made a major dent in his leader-of-the-pack campaign.

After nominating contests in 25 states and Puerto Rico, Trump has amassed 458 delegates, according to the Associated Press, ahead of the 359 won by U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas and the 151 won by U.S. Senator Rubio of Florida. Ohio Governor Kasich trails with 54 delegates.

Trump needs 1,237 delegates to clinch the nomination. Mainstream Republicans say their best bet at this point is to stop him from reaching that number, which could enable a compromise candidate to emerge at the party's July nominating convention in Cleveland.

Rubio and Kasich face make-or-break contests in their home states next Tuesday, and both will face intense pressure to drop out of the race if they lose. Polls show Kasich running competitively with Trump in Ohio, but Rubio lags far behind in Florida.

Trump's trade-sceptical message could help him next Tuesday in Ohio and Illinois, which have lost hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs to foreign competition. Missouri, North Carolina and the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth in the Pacific, also hold nominating contests on that day.

Cruz, 45, aims to knock Rubio, 44, and Kasich, 63, off the campaign trail to position himself as the best Trump alternative.

""From our perspective, we think it's a two-man race, we're the only one with a path."" said Cruz backer Saul Anuzis, a former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party.

Cruz was due to receive the endorsement of U.S. Senator Mike Lee of Utah at a Miami rally on Thursday, according to online news websites Buzzfeed and Politico - the first such endorsement from any of his Senate colleagues.

WASHINGTON China will be able to project ""substantial offensive military power"" from artificial islands it has built in the South China Sea's disputed Spratly Islands within months, the director of U.S. national intelligence said.

In a Feb. 23 letter to John McCain, chair of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, James Clapper said Chinese land reclamation and construction work in the Spratlys had established infrastructure needed ""to project military capabilities in the South China Sea beyond that which is required for point defence of its outposts.""

""Based on the pace and scope of construction at these outposts, China will be able to deploy a range of offensive and defensive military capabilities and support increased PLAN and CCG presence beginning in 2016,"" Clapper said in the letter released this week, using acronyms for the Chinese navy and coastguard.

""Once these facilities are completed by the end of 2016 or early 2017, China will have significant capacity to quickly project substantial offensive military power to the region,"" Clapper added.

The United States has voiced concerns about China's assertive pursuit of territory in the South China Sea. The sea is one of the world's busiest trade routes and regional countries have rival claims, creating a potential flashpoint.

Visiting Washington in September, Chinese President Xi Jinping responded to U.S. worries by saying that China had no intention to militarize its outposts in the Spratlys.

Beijing has said their military roles will be defensive, but the head of the U.S. Pacific Command said last month China was ""clearly militarising"" the South China Sea with the aim of achieving East Asian hegemony.

The text of Clapper's letter in response to questions from McCain was published on the news portal of the U.S. Naval Institute. U.S. officials confirmed the content.

Clapper said that while the United States had yet to observe deployment of significant Chinese military capabilities in the Spratlys, it had built facilities able to support them, including modern fighter aircraft.

China had already installed military radars at Cuarteron and Fiery Cross Reefs, and the infrastructure could also allow for the deployment surface-to-air missiles, coastal defence cruise missiles and an increased presence of warships, he said.

The United States had not seen Chinese air force activity in the Spratlys, but warships had stopped at its outposts including a guided-missile frigate and a guided-missile destroyer in December and January, Clapper said.

He said tank-landing ships had been employed widely in construction work and the landing of civil aircraft at Fiery Cross Reef in January showed the airstrip there was operational and able to accommodate all Chinese military aircraft.

Clapper said China continued its land reclamation in the Spratlys after Aug. 5, when its foreign minister claimed that it had been halted.

While there was no evidence that China has plans for any significant additional land reclamation in the Spratlys, Clapper said there was sufficient reef area in the Spratlys for it to reclaim more than 1,000 additional acres (400 hectares).

The Pentagon has said that Beijing has sought to bolster its claim to nearly all of the South China Sea with island building projects in the Spratlys that have reclaimed more than 2,900 acres (1,170 hectares) of land since 2013.

Protesters participate in a 'die in in front of a McDonald's restaurant during demonstrations asking for higher wages in New York, in this file photo taken April 15, 2015.

NEW YORK A highly anticipated trial over whether McDonald's USA (MCD.N) could be on the hook for its franchisees' alleged retaliation against employees who participated in fast-food worker protests across the United States began on Thursday.

At issue is whether Illinois-based McDonald's is a ""joint employer"" of workers at its independently owned franchises, as the National Labor Relations Board says. That would make the company liable for any labor law violations by the franchisees, which operate 90 percent of McDonald's U.S. restaurants.

The trial before an administrative NLRB judge in New York has attracted national attention because it is expected to show how the board's new standard for joint employment applies to the franchisor-franchisee relationship, although the ruling in the case will apply to McDonald's only.

In his opening statement, NLRB lawyer Jamie Rucker described the level of control McDonalds has over its franchisees, setting everything from cleaning requirements and the number of seconds for order-taking to pre-packaged interview questions for prospective hires.

""If McDonald's is involved in determining working conditions at its franchised operations, it is responsible for what happens to workers subject to those conditions,"" Rucker said.

Workers began filing complaints with the Washington-based NLRB in 2012, saying that McDonald's and some franchisees threatened, surveilled, disciplined and fired them for protesting for higher wages and union rights in the demonstrations.

The NLRBs general counsel issued complaints in 2014, eventually consolidating a case for trial against the company and franchisees in six cities.

McDonald's lawyer Willis Goldsmith said Thursday that the company ""is not now and never has been"" a joint employer and that its franchises are independent.

The company does not control who the franchisees hire or their workers' wages, benefits or schedule, Goldsmith said.

The NLRB expanded its joint employment standard in August in a landmark decision involving a Browning-Ferris Industries Inc waste management facility that used workers from a staffing agency. Under the old standard, a company had to have direct control over employment conditions to be a joint employer, but the new test considers indirect and unexercised control.

Finding that joint employment exists could make it easier for workers and unions to win higher wages and better working conditions since they would be negotiating directly with parent companies.

The International Franchise Association, various companies and Republican lawmakers have cast the new standard as an existential threat to the franchise model on which many businesses rely.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 18:04:06+00:00,ECB pays banks to take its money,"['Francesco Canepa', ""John O'donnell""]","FRANKFURT The European Central Bank will offer to pay banks that borrow money from it in what is the most radical scheme anywhere in the world to boost lending to consumers and companies.

The project would mean that banks qualify for billions of euros of initially free loans from the ECB and would get paid up to 0.4 percent of what they borrow on condition that they lend more to companies or consumers.

The program, the latest attempt to rekindle slow, if improving, lending will see the ECB release four rounds of four-year zero-rate loans to banks from June.

If it works, the plan will make it easier and cheaper for borrowers across the 19-member euro zone, although some critics pointed to the failure of earlier similar ECB schemes and the reluctance of banks to lend as the economy struggles.

Mortgage lending will be excluded.

There will be a de facto upper limit of roughly 1.7 trillion euros ($1.9 trillion) on the size of the scheme, the ECB says, although its actual size will likely be far smaller than that.

Banks will get a chance to borrow in June, September and December as well as in March 2017.

Banks in the euro zone are allowed to borrow up to 30 percent of their existing loans, which are estimated by the ECB at roughly 5.7 trillion euros.

After two years, ECB experts will test whether those banks have increased their loans, using a technical benchmark that reflects how much a bank had been lending previously.

If the banks are proven to be lending 2.5 percent or more than they were when taking the so-called TLTRO (targeted longer-term refinancing operation), then the ECB will pay them up to 0.4 percent of what they borrowed.

That rate is the same as the charge on banks that deposit money with the ECB. This rate is now negative, denoting a charge for deposits.

""Banks will pay the (refi) rate at the time of bidding - so right now, zero - and they may even get a reduction of that rate which increases with the amount of loans they grant,"" ECB President Mario Draghi told journalists at a news conference after a meeting of the bank's governors.

""The maximum reduction will bring the rate ... to the level of the deposit facility rate at the time of bidding,"" he said, as bank cut its deposit rate to -0.4 percent.

""The amount that banks can borrow is linked to the amount of loans they have,"" Draghi said. ""So a bank that is very active in granting loans to the real economy can borrow more than a bank that concentrates on other activities.""

While the announcement resulted in a rise in the shares of banks of southern countries, such as Italy, those of rivals in economically stronger neighbors such as Germany fell.

Spanish bank executives told Reuters they welcomed the move, whereas German banks were caustic in their criticism of the ECB's steps to loosen money supply, saying it would hurt savers.

And some economists are skeptical that the project will succeed, after banks' take-up of earlier similar ultra-cheap ECB loans was far lower than expected.

""They are throwing money at the banks but it's not a game changer,"" ING economist, Carsten Brzeski, said.

""The ECB cannot force the private sector to go to the bank to get money. Loans are already cheap. Have we seen a take-up in credit growth? No.""

WASHINGTON China will be able to project ""substantial offensive military power"" from artificial islands it has built in the South China Sea's disputed Spratly Islands within months, the director of U.S. national intelligence said.

In a Feb. 23 letter to John McCain, chair of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, James Clapper said Chinese land reclamation and construction work in the Spratlys had established infrastructure needed ""to project military capabilities in the South China Sea beyond that which is required for point defense of its outposts.""

""Based on the pace and scope of construction at these outposts, China will be able to deploy a range of offensive and defensive military capabilities and support increased PLAN and CCG presence beginning in 2016,"" Clapper said in the letter released this week, using acronyms for the Chinese navy and coastguard.

""Once these facilities are completed by the end of 2016 or early 2017, China will have significant capacity to quickly project substantial offensive military power to the region,"" Clapper added.

The United States has voiced concerns about China's assertive pursuit of territory in the South China Sea. The sea is one of the world's busiest trade routes and regional countries have rival claims, creating a potential flashpoint.

Visiting Washington in September, Chinese President Xi Jinping responded to U.S. worries by saying that China had no intention to militarize its outposts in the Spratlys.

Beijing has said their military roles will be defensive, but the head of the U.S. Pacific Command said last month China was ""clearly militarizing"" the South China Sea with the aim of achieving East Asian hegemony.

The text of Clapper's letter in response to questions from McCain was published on the news portal of the U.S. Naval Institute. U.S. officials confirmed the content.

Clapper said that while the United States had yet to observe deployment of significant Chinese military capabilities in the Spratlys, it had built facilities able to support them, including modern fighter aircraft.

China had already installed military radars at Cuarteron and Fiery Cross Reefs, and the infrastructure could also allow for the deployment surface-to-air missiles, coastal defense cruise missiles and an increased presence of warships, he said.

The United States had not seen Chinese air force activity in the Spratlys, but warships had stopped at its outposts including a guided-missile frigate and a guided-missile destroyer in December and January, Clapper said.

He said tank-landing ships had been employed widely in construction work and the landing of civil aircraft at Fiery Cross Reef in January showed the airstrip there was operational and able to accommodate all Chinese military aircraft.

Clapper said China continued its land reclamation in the Spratlys after Aug. 5, when its foreign minister claimed that it had been halted.

While there was no evidence that China has plans for any significant additional land reclamation in the Spratlys, Clapper said there was sufficient reef area in the Spratlys for it to reclaim more than 1,000 additional acres (400 hectares).

The Pentagon has said that Beijing has sought to bolster its claim to nearly all of the South China Sea with island building projects in the Spratlys that have reclaimed more than 2,900 acres (1,170 hectares) of land since 2013.

AALEN, Germany German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday around 3,000 migrants were returning to Iraq from Germany every month and that the number was on the rise.

Many are living in shelters and are frustrated with a slow asylum process in a country struggling to work through a backlog of asylum applications after 1.1 million migrants arrived last year.

""At the moment 3,000 are returning to Iraq every month for example - and it's an upward trend - when their cities are liberated from Islamic State,"" Merkel said at a campaign event in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg ahead of a regional election there and in two other states on Sunday.

Merkel, who faces a key test in the first elections since the refugee crisis got into full swing last summer, said it was therefore important to ensure that there was stability and an end to war in Syria and Iraq.

The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), which has gained support among voters unhappy with Merkel's open-door policy for refugees, is expected to win up to a fifth of the vote in the regional elections on March 13.

Merkel has repeatedly said that the number of migrants coming to Europe's largest economy will go down.

""Not every refugee ... will stay here,"" she said on Thursday.

She added that many wanted to return to relatives who ""are not yet here and who cannot come here for a long time"".

Merkel said Syrian peace talks in Geneva were important ""so that there is hope again that the people can go back"".

SAO PAULO Apos um inicio de ano com giro financeiro fraco, a Bovespa comecou marco com forte volume negociado, sustentado principalmente por investidores estrangeiros, mas tambem refletindo ajustes relevantes em posicoes de agentes locais.

Expectativas de mudancas no cenario politico com implicacoes favoraveis nas perspectivas economicas do pais estao por tras desse movimento, que precisa de novas evidencias no sentido de concretizacao de tais especulacoes para se manter.

""O aumento do volume deve persistir enquanto o noticiario politico continuar alimentando as expectativas de uma mudanca no governo federal"", disse o chefe da mesa de renda variavel da corretora de um banco estrangeiro em Sao Paulo.

Ate o dia 9, o giro medio diario no mes estava em quase 10,8 bilhoes de reais. Janeiro e fevereiro fecharam com volume medio de 5,2 bilhoes e 6 bilhoes de reais, respectivamente. A media em marco esta proxima do patamar de outubro do ano passado, quando o quadro politico tambem ditou o tom na bolsa.

""O noticiario politico e policial da semana passada parece indicar uma probabilidade maior de mudanca no futuro e consequentemente quem estava 'underweight' em Brasil e acoes, que era a maior parte, decidiu agir"", disse o chefe da area de acoes e negociacao eletronica de outra relevante corretora de um banco estrangeiro no Brasil.

""Todo mundo operou bem"", disse o profissional, referindo-se a estrangeiros, agentes locais e fundos quantitativos, bem como de varejo, prevendo que volume continuara firme.

As posicoes compradas no fundo de indice (ETF) iShares MSCI Brazil, um dos principais termometros sobre o apetite de estrangeiros por acoes brasileiras, aumentaram cerca de 37 por cento desde o final de fevereiro, de acordo com profissionais do mercado de renda variavel.

O iShares MSCI Brazil tem como lastro acoes brasileiras e, conforme ha interesse dos investidores, a gestora que o administra compra mais papeis no Brasil para emitir mais ETFs. Como os ETFs tem um numero limitado de acoes, a gestora vai criando outros fundos para atender a demanda.

O iShares MSCI Brazil acumula em marco alta de mais de 20 por cento.

Dados de fluxo da BM&Bovespa ratificam a presenca dos estrangeiros, com o saldo positivo em quase 5,7 bilhoes de reais em marco. Apenas no dia 4, quando uma nova fase da operacao Lava Jato teve como alvo o ex-presidente Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, houve entrada liquida de mais de 2 bilhoes de reais.

Para o gestor Eduardo Roche, da Canepa Asset Management, novos desdobramentos da operacao Lava Jato com potencial de fragilizar ainda mais o governo, tendem a atrair tambem o investidor local.

""Em um primeiro momento, os fundos locais apenas desarmaram grandes posicoes vendidas na bolsa. Ha a percepcao que as posicoes compradas deles ainda estao baixas.""

O prognostico de mudancas na cena politica soma-se a niveis relativamente atrativos das acoes brasileiras, apos tocarem minimas desde 2009, conforme expresso pelo indice de referencia do mercado acionario local, o Ibovespa.

No dia 20 de janeiro, o Ibovespa tocou minima intradia desde marco de 2009. Desde entao, chegou a se valorizar 35 por cento, considerando a maxima intradia do ano, de 50.023 pontos no dia 4 de marco. Apenas em marco, considerando os dados de fechamento da vespera, o Ibovespa acumula alta de 14 por cento.

""No nivel em que a bolsa se encontrava e segue e mais facil subir"", afirmou o diretor de Operacoes da Mirae Asset Wealth Management no Brasil, Pablo Stipanicic Spyer, destacando que o mercado acionario brasileiro estava bastante depreciado. E, neste mes, o estrangeiro foi quem mais comprou, disse.

Fighting between Tuareg clans known as the Imghads and Daoussak and their allies broke out in the Gao region in February and residents have reported massacres by gunmen from both sides, sometimes with women and children as victims.

The clashes, fueled by the suspected murder of a Daoussak chief, underscore the challenges faced by the United Nations in implementing a wider peace deal signed in June in order to stop a cycle of rebellions led by the Tuareg minority in the north.

Despite hundreds of millions of dollars pledged by international donors, the deal has stalled partly due to an intensifying Islamist insurgency which has worsened access for U.N. peacekeepers as well as the Malian army.

The clan deal could remove one hurdle to any progress.

""The two communities have agreed as follows: to halt all forms of violence across the area, especially around Menaka and the Ansongo circle,"" an agreement signed by clan leaders showed.

They signed the deal after a meeting in Tinfadimata, about 50 km south of Gao, this week.

Radhia Achouri, spokeswoman for the 10,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission (MINUSMA), confirmed an agreement had been reached, adding that U.N. officials had helped mediate.

""We believe that such local arrangements contribute to efforts aiming at moving forward with the peace process,"" she said.

The United Nations has sent a team of rights experts to the area to investigate but it has not yet released its findings.

Last year, a separate feud between Tuareg clans threatened to undermine the peace deal until a community ceasefire signed in October allayed tensions.

However, the Tinfadimata document made no mention of Fulani communities who are long-standing rivals of the Daoussak and have also been involved in some of the recent violence.

One of the challenges for U.N. peacekeepers and other forces trying to restore order is the difficulty distinguishing between desert jihadists and various secular militants who signed the June peace deal. Both operate in Mali's lawless north.

French troops drove out Islamist militants from northern cities in 2013 but they have since regrouped and stepped up attacks on U.N. and Malian forces, killing at least 20 since the start of the year.

Judge Fabricio Cidade on Thursday found 36-year-old Carlos Peralta guilty of knifing businessman David Fremd late Tuesday in Paysandu, near the border with Argentina.

He told the El Telegrafo newspaper that Peralta would be sent to a psychiatric hospital for tests ahead of sentencing and that there would also be an investigation into whether an outside group was linked to the attack.

""He consistently talked about the religious motivations but did not once recognize committing the crime,"" the judge told the local paper. ""He said his actions were in the hands of Allah.""

Fremd, 54, was head of the Jewish Community of Paysandu.

The judge said an investigation would examine whether Peralta, who had converted to Islam, had been in contact with foreign groups. Peralta's computer had been seized and it appeared he had acted alone, Cidade told El Telegrafo.

""Now it passes into the hands of the intelligence services to investigate any eventual link with some foreign organization,"" he told the paper.

Juan Roballo, a senior official in the presidency, told a local TV channel that he did not want to sound alarm bells but the government had to ""consider all possibilities.""

In the Uruguayan capital Montevideo, the Egyptian Center for Islamic Culture and Israeli Embassy condemned the attack.

Stabbings have been on the rise in Israel, where violence escalated during a visit by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.

In the occupied West Bank, Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian who tried to stab them on Wednesday, the military said. The attacks came a day after an American tourist was killed in Tel Aviv by a Palestinian who went on a stabbing spree while Biden held meetings just blocks away.

Joe Jonas, former lead singer of the Jonas Brothers, is back with new band DNCE, whose adult lyrics and funk-pop tunes are a far cry from his teen boy band days in the Disney Channel pop rock trio. DNCE is made up of Jonas as lead singer, guitarist JinJoo Lee, bassist and keyboardist Cole Whittle and drummer Jack Lawless, all of whom worked with the Jonas Brothers. In an interview with the band, Jonas said that the sound was new to the foursome. They agreed on a funk, dance and rock sound. DNCE's debut single, ""Cake By The Ocean"", reached no.9 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the band is now working on an album. ""It's romantic, it's fun, it's messy, it's party, it's sexual, it's 'Animal House' the band,"" Whittle said, referring to the comedy film. The Jonas Brothers, Kevin, Joe and Nick, formed in 2005 and quickly rose to fame with their upbeat pop rock songs. They split in 2013. Nick has since launched a solo career and stars in drama ""Goat"", which screened at Berlin's film festival last month. Joe Jonas remarked that it is difficult to reinvent yourself and come back with new music - so both he and his brother feel proud. Asked if a potential Jonas Brothers reunion may be on the cards, he said: ""I think if the time found itself in a creative way, maybe.""",[]

The agreement will come into force in July if it receives regulatory approval, and would see the airlines coordinate sales and marketing to offer more flight options and better schedules on trans-Pacific routes, the companies said in a statement.

United Airlines would at the same time launch a flight to Auckland from San Francisco, which would initially run three times a week and increase to a daily flight from November.

New Zealand in the past year has posted record tourism and migration numbers as airlines ramped up flights and introduced new routes to the Pacific nation from the United States, Latin America, China and the United Arab Emirates.

""To have a strong home market carrier like United Airlines working with us to grow this market through its extensive sales and distribution channels in the U.S. will provide a significant boost to inbound tourism,"" said Air New Zealand's CEO Christopher Luxon in a statement.

BRASILIA O governo vai avaliar o cenario politico antes de enviar ao Congresso uma proposta de reforma da Previdencia e pode optar por evitar uma pauta com potencial para aumentar a disputa no Congresso e na sociedade brasileira, disse a Reuters o ministro do Trabalho e Previdencia, Miguel Rossetto.

Um dos pontos centrais da nova agenda do governo para enfrentar problemas estruturais do pais, a reforma da Previdencia nao e um tema de consenso nem mesmo dentro do governo.

A presidente Dilma Rousseff afirmou, no inicio deste ano, que a intencao do Palacio do Planalto era enviar uma proposta pronta ao Congresso ate abril deste ano. Rossetto admite que os prazos e conveniencias podem ser reavaliados.

Nos vamos avaliar, temos que avaliar a dinamica politica da sociedade brasileira"", disse Rossetto a Reuters na noite de quarta-feira, acrescentando que houve ""uma mudanca forte"" a partir da ultima sexta-feira com a conducao coercitiva do ex-presidente Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

""Evidentemente que isso traz um processo permanente de avaliacao das pautas da agenda politica do governo. Nao interessa agendas de natureza tao somente conflitiva com o Congresso e a sociedade, afirmou Rossetto ao ser perguntado se o governo iria enfrentar, em um momento de baixa popularidade, um tema que alienaria a base social que ainda lhe resta --sindicatos e movimentos sociais.

Nos ultimos dias, o processo de impeachment da presidente voltou a ganhar impulso, especialmente depois de noticia com supostas informacoes da delacao premiada do ex-lider do governo no Senado Delcidio do Amaral (PT-MS).

Com a conducao coercitiva de Lula, as bases sociais do governo reagiram em defesa do ex-presidente, mas a simpatia pelo governo Dilma ainda e limitada pela antipatia ao ajuste fiscal e a mudancas que mexem no que e visto como direitos adquiridos.

Em entrevista a Reuters publicada na quarta-feira, o ministro da Fazenda, Nelson Barbosa, havia garantido que o governo vai levar adiante a ideia de ter uma proposta para a reforma da Previdencia pronta ate abril. [nL1N16I0GW]

As posicoes dispares revelam a dificuldade que o proprio governo tem de cerrar fileiras em torno de uma reforma que vai contra boa parte do que o PT, partido da presidente, sempre defendeu.

Ha duas semanas, em um primeiro encontro do forum da Previdencia, formado por representantes de empresarios e trabalhadores, os sindicatos afirmaram que se recusam a aceitar boa parte das propostas que o governo estuda --entre elas, idade minima, cobranca previdenciaria de trabalhadores rurais ou reducao da diferenca no tempo de aposentadoria entre homens e mulheres.

POSICOES EM ABERTO

O governo, afirma Rossetto, nao esta fechado sobre nenhum dos pontos que estao sendo discutidos para tentar chegar a uma proposta comum.

O governo nao tem uma posicao sobre a agenda dos projetos. Varias posicoes existem dentro do governo. Eu penso, por exemplo, que a regra atual 85/95 (que soma a idade com o tempo de servico), com progressividade, e um sistema adequado para a realidade do mercado de trabalho brasileiro, disse.

Ele ressaltou que o sistema previdenciario deve levar em consideracao as diferentes idades com que os brasileiros comecam a trabalhar, alguns muito cedo. Nossa expectativa e buscar pontos de acordo.

O ministro defende que e papel do governo apresentar solucoes para os problemas do pais, e a Previdencia e um dos mais urgentes.

Segundo Rossetto, estatisticas mostram que em 2030, 20 por cento da populacao brasileira tera 60 anos ou mais, estando apta a se aposentar pelas regras atuais, enquanto esse indice e de 10 por cento atualmente.

Em 20 anos, havera uma estabilidade no crescimento do numero de brasileiros, ja que o pais tem uma taxa de fertilidade negativa --abaixo de 2 filhos por mulher-- e deve diminuir o ritmo de aumento da expectativa de vida.

Com as regras atuais, a projecao do ministerio e de um deficit da Previdencia equivalente a 3,52 por cento do Produto Interno Bruto em 2040. Atualmente ele esta em 1,14 por cento.

O Ministerio da Fazenda, no entanto, defende que uma idade minima e o ponto base de qualquer reforma previdenciaria que pretenda ter sucesso, algo que os trabalhadores rejeitam.

O governo caminha para aceitar uma versao mais acelerada da regra atual, que soma os anos de servico com a idade para se chegar a um tempo minimo de contribuicao. Atualmente, de 85 para mulheres e 95 para homens, chegando a 90/100 em 2022. A intencao e antecipar esse indice final.

Rossetto diz que o governo e o PT estao unidos na defesa de uma reforma da Previdencia.

O partido esta unido e tem um compromisso absoluto com a presidente. Nao podemos ficar tangenciando o ajuste fiscal para sempre, afirmou. Mas o PT vem assumindo sua responsabilidade de apresentar a sua agenda.

Parlamentares do partido ja deixaram claro a presidente, em mais de uma reuniao no Palacio do Planalto, que avaliam nao ser essa a hora de lidar com uma reforma da Previdencia.

O proprio ministro admite que pelo menos o ritmo da reforma pode ser revisto, especialmente frente a uma polarizacao crescente na politica do pais e ao que chamou de odio institucional, principalmente depois da conducao coercitiva de Lula, determinada pelo juiz Sergio Moro na ultima sexta-feira.

Vamos avaliar isso. Tem a ver com esse dialogo com sociedade e com o Congresso. O governo vai monitorar e medir na definicao do ritmo da reforma.

DISCURSO DO ODIO

Rossetto nao poupa criticas a oposicao e a midia, acusando partidos como PSDB, PPS e DEM de estimularem o odio e terem um padrao de politica inaceitavel.

Ha uma polarizacao crescente patrocinada por alguns orgaos de imprensa, afirmou, revelando que o governo teme atos de violencia nos protestos de domingo.

O PT pediu a seus diretorios que nao marcassem manifestacoes para esse dia, e sindicatos como a CUT ja avisaram que nao irao a atos em Sao Paulo que estavam sendo programados para o mesmo local dos protestos contra o governo.

Ainda assim, o partido esta programando atos culturais para o mesmo dia, em outros locais.

Acho que ha risco sim (de violencia). Infelizmente tem setores que vem operando com um total sentimento de odio, estimulando esse odio nas redes sociais, disse. Temos que estar atento para os riscos.",[]

Protesters participate in a 'die in in front of a McDonald's restaurant during demonstrations asking for higher wages in New York, in this file photo taken April 15, 2015.

NEW YORK A highly anticipated trial over whether McDonald's USA (MCD.N) could be on the hook for its franchisees' alleged retaliation against employees who participated in fast-food worker protests across the United States began on Thursday.

At issue is whether Illinois-based McDonald's is a ""joint employer"" of workers at its independently owned franchises, as the National Labor Relations Board says. That would make the company liable for any labor law violations by the franchisees, which operate 90 percent of McDonald's U.S. restaurants.

The trial before an administrative NLRB judge in New York has attracted national attention because it is expected to show how the board's new standard for joint employment applies to the franchisor-franchisee relationship, although the ruling in the case will apply to McDonald's only.

In his opening statement, NLRB lawyer Jamie Rucker described the level of control McDonalds has over its franchisees, setting everything from cleaning requirements and the number of seconds for order-taking to pre-packaged interview questions for prospective hires.

""If McDonald's is involved in determining working conditions at its franchised operations, it is responsible for what happens to workers subject to those conditions,"" Rucker said.

Workers began filing complaints with the Washington-based NLRB in 2012, saying that McDonald's and some franchisees threatened, surveilled, disciplined and fired them for protesting for higher wages and union rights in the demonstrations.

The NLRBs general counsel issued complaints in 2014, eventually consolidating a case for trial against the company and franchisees in six cities.

McDonald's lawyer Willis Goldsmith said Thursday that the company ""is not now and never has been"" a joint employer and that its franchises are independent.

The company does not control who the franchisees hire or their workers' wages, benefits or schedule, Goldsmith said.

The NLRB expanded its joint employment standard in August in a landmark decision involving a Browning-Ferris Industries Inc waste management facility that used workers from a staffing agency. Under the old standard, a company had to have direct control over employment conditions to be a joint employer, but the new test considers indirect and unexercised control.

Finding that joint employment exists could make it easier for workers and unions to win higher wages and better working conditions since they would be negotiating directly with parent companies.

The International Franchise Association, various companies and Republican lawmakers have cast the new standard as an existential threat to the franchise model on which many businesses rely.

Judge Fabricio Cidade on Thursday found 36-year-old Carlos Peralta guilty of knifing businessman David Fremd late Tuesday in Paysandu, near the border with Argentina.

He told the El Telegrafo newspaper that Peralta would be sent to a psychiatric hospital for tests ahead of sentencing and that there would also be an investigation into whether an outside group was linked to the attack.

""He consistently talked about the religious motivations but did not once recognize committing the crime,"" the judge told the local paper. ""He said his actions were in the hands of Allah.""

Fremd, 54, was head of the Jewish Community of Paysandu.

The judge said an investigation would examine whether Peralta, who had converted to Islam, had been in contact with foreign groups. Peralta's computer had been seized and it appeared he had acted alone, Cidade told El Telegrafo.

""Now it passes into the hands of the intelligence services to investigate any eventual link with some foreign organization,"" he told the paper.

Juan Roballo, a senior official in the presidency, told a local TV channel that he did not want to sound alarm bells but the government had to ""consider all possibilities.""

In the Uruguayan capital Montevideo, the Egyptian Center for Islamic Culture and Israeli Embassy condemned the attack.

Stabbings have been on the rise in Israel, where violence escalated during a visit by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.

In the occupied West Bank, Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian who tried to stab them on Wednesday, the military said. The attacks came a day after an American tourist was killed in Tel Aviv by a Palestinian who went on a stabbing spree while Biden held meetings just blocks away.

The capture of Sulayman Dawud al-Bakkar, also known as Abu Dawud, ""removed a key ISIL leader from the battlefield,"" the Pentagon said in a statement, referring to the militant group by an acronym. He was transferred to Iraqi government custody earlier on Thursday, it said.

The Pentagon said it learned details about Islamic State's chemical weapon facilities and production, as well as the people involved, from Dawud. The information resulted in several air strikes by a U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, it added.

BEIRUT The head of the Syrian opposition's negotiating team said on Thursday it was not optimistic about peace talks getting under way in Geneva, and has still not confirmed if it will attend the U.N.-backed negotiations.

Asaad al-Zoubi, head of the main opposition council's delegation to the talks, told Al Arabiya al Hadath TV the humanitarian situation and continuing military operations carried out by the Syrian government and its Russian allies gave little cause for optimism.

""There is no optimism ... there is an international conspiracy and a cover-up of Russian massacres and a cover-up for (president) Bashar,"" said Zoubi, who is chief negotiator for the High Negotiations Committee (HNC).

Fighting has slowed considerably since a fragile ""cessation of hostilities agreement"" brokered by the United States and Russia came into force almost two weeks ago.

But the truce does not cover Islamic State or the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, whose fighters are deployed in western Syria, close to rebel groups that have agreed to cease fire, and there have been accusations of violations on all sides.

The HNC had in recent days expressed a degree of optimism about the peace process, saying the agenda proposed by the United Nations was positive and noting a reduction in government violations of the truce.

But Zoubi said there were still serious concerns about the actions of the Syrian government and its Russian allies, and cited fighting in a Damascus suburb on Thursday as an example.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the civil war, said there had been air strikes, shells fired by government forces and clashes between Syrian and rebel forces in the eastern Ghouta suburb on Thursday.

The HNC said on Thursday it had recorded 24 violations of the truce by the Syrian government and its allies on March 9 and 10. Russia also said it had registered violations, saying on Thursday it has noted eight in the past 24 hours.

The Geneva talks will coincide with the fifth anniversary of a conflict that began with protests against President Bashar al-Assad before descending into a multi-sided war that has drawn in foreign governments and allowed the growth of Islamic State.

Democratic U.S. presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton shake hands before the start of the Univision News and Washington Post Democratic U.S. presidential candidates debate in Kendall, Florida March 9, 2016.

U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pauses to look at a demonstrator behind him during a campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, March 9, 2016.

U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina March 9, 2016. Picture taken March 9, 2016.

WASHINGTON Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump called for raising tariffs on foreign-made goods on Thursday, in a further break from his party's free-trade philosophy ahead of nominating contests in big industrial states that have been hit hard by globalization.

The billionaire businessman has harnessed working-class anxieties about immigration and trade to become the leading Republican vying to be the party's candidate in the November election. His White House bid has driven a wedge between the party's moneyed donors and grassroots voters, alarming party leaders who see him as a dangerous demagogue.

Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich will share the stage at a CNN-hosted debate at the University of Miami, which begins at 8:30 p.m. (0130 GMT on Friday). After a debate last week that degenerated into name-calling and sexual innuendo, Republican strategists were hoping for a more substantive evening.

Trump on Thursday criticized European Union nations and other countries for lowering interest rates, saying the move could cost manufacturing jobs at home. He said the United States should raise tariffs in response.

""We just sit back and do nothing,"" Trump, 69, said on CNBC television. ""That's getting to be very dangerous as far as I'm concerned.""

Though the brash New Yorker has made economic issues a central theme of his presidential bid, he has steered clear of specifics.

He has promised to deport 11 million illegal immigrants, temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country and renegotiate trade deals with countries like China to protect U.S. workers.

Critics have dismissed those plans as unworkable at best, and Trump's Republican presidential rivals have pointed out that his resorts have brought in workers from abroad rather than hiring Americans.

Our Principles PAC, an anti-Trump group, said on Thursday it would spend $1 million on ads in Ohio - where Republicans will vote in a crucial presidential primary next week - that hit him for having ties and shirts made in Asia.

However, nothing that Trump's rivals for the nomination or mainstream Republican leaders have thrown at him so far has made a major dent in his leader-of-the-pack campaign.

After nominating contests in 25 states and Puerto Rico, Trump has amassed 458 delegates, according to the Associated Press, ahead of the 359 won by U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas and the 151 won by U.S. Senator Rubio of Florida. Ohio Governor Kasich trails with 54 delegates.

Trump needs 1,237 delegates to clinch the nomination. Mainstream Republicans say their best bet at this point is to stop him from reaching that number, which could enable a compromise candidate to emerge at the party's July nominating convention in Cleveland.

Rubio and Kasich face make-or-break contests in their home states next Tuesday, and both will face intense pressure to drop out of the race if they lose. Polls show Kasich running competitively with Trump in Ohio, but Rubio lags far behind in Florida.

Trump's trade-skeptical message could help him next Tuesday in Ohio and Illinois, which have lost hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs to foreign competition. Missouri, North Carolina and the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth in the Pacific, also hold nominating contests on that day.

Cruz, 45, aims to knock Rubio, 44, and Kasich, 63, off the campaign trail to position himself as the best Trump alternative.

""From our perspective, we think it's a two-man race, we're the only one with a path."" said Cruz backer Saul Anuzis, a former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party.

Cruz was due to receive the endorsement of U.S. Senator Mike Lee of Utah at a Miami rally on Thursday, according to online news websites Buzzfeed and Politico - the first such endorsement from any of his Senate colleagues.

Paul had called Pakistan ""an uncertain ally"" and other lawmakers expressed concerns about Pakistan's nuclear program, commitment to fighting terrorist organizations and cooperation in the Afghanistan peace process.

However, they generally supported the sale, saying the South Asian state needs to modernize its air force and counter-terrorism activities.

The United States identified Pakistan as a key partner in its war against terror following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and spent billions of dollars on military aid to help the country fight insurgents.

But there is growing consternation in Washington about continuing with the same level of assistance unless Pakistan provides evidence it is using the funds effectively to eliminate militants.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 16:34:15+00:00,Indian firms plan to sign oil deals with Rosneft next week - sources,"['Katya Golubkova', 'Nidhi Verma']","The logo of the Russian state oil company Rosneft is pictured behind a pipe at the Samotlor oil field outside the West Siberian city of Nizhnevartovsk, Russia, January 26, 2016.

NEW DELHI/MOSCOW India plans to sign energy deals with Russian oil major Rosneft next week to buy stakes in Siberian fields, two sources privy to the deal said, as New Delhi accelerates a push to secure overseas energy assets.

India, the world's third biggest oil importer, has to ship in three quarters of its oil needs and a substantial fall in oil prices has added an extra incentive to seal purchases of assets that are now relatively cheap to limit its reliance on imports.

Rosneft's Chief Executive Igor Sechin will visit Delhi on March 15-16 to stitch together the deals, the sources said.

Rosneft, the world's biggest listed oil company by output, also stands to benefit as it has been scouting for partners as Western sanctions tied to Russia's annexation of Crimea have limited its access to global funds and technology.

Russia is keen to develop and deepen its economic ties with India, one of the world's fastest-growing economies, when its own economy is stagnant, hit by Western sanctions and a plunge in global oil prices.

During Sechin's visit, a sale purchase agreement is likely to be signed with Indian Oil Corp, Oil India Ltd and Bharat PetroResources Ltd (BPRL) for a 29 percent stake in the Taas-Yuriakh oil field, the sources said.

In December, IOC and Oil India signed a memorandum with Rosneft, which paves the way for acquisition of a stake in Taas-Yuriakh oil assets in East Siberia.

Later BPRL, the exploration arm of Bharat Petroleum Corp, joined the negotiations.

Taas-Yuriakh, which operates the Srednebotuobinsk field in east Siberia, is expected to produce more than 5 million tonnes of oil annually in the medium term.

Rosneft last year sold a 20 percent share in Taas-Yuriakh to BP for $750 million, and based on that valuation a 29 percent stake could be worth around $1 billion.

India also wants to raise its overall stake in the Vankor oil field in Siberia to 49.9 percent from the current 15 percent.

ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) is expected to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Rosneft to raise its stake in the Vankor field in Siberia to 26 percent from the current 15 percent, they said.

IOC, Oil India and BPRL may sign an MoU for buying an additional 23.9 percent stake in the Vankor project, they said.

The sources said the sale purchase agreement for raising the stake in Vankor field will be signed in June at International Economic Forum in St. Petersburg.

Oil India chairman and managing directors of ONGC Videsh and BPRL did not respond to Reuters' phone calls seeking comment, while no comment was available from Rosneft.

CIDADE DO VATICANO O papa Francisco fez nesta quinta-feira alteracoes importantes nos procedimentos financeiros complexos e muitas vezes nebulosos envolvidos nas canonizacoes da Igreja Catolica.

Um decreto pede novos controles sobre os gastos da eleicao de santos, que podem chegar a centenas de milhares de dolares na coleta de indicios e honorarios de advogados. O processo pode levar decadas.

Ja surgiram acusacoes de malversacao e corrupcao e de que o sistema favorece candidatos a santidade vindos de paises ricos.

Em seu livro ""Merchants in the Temple (Mercadores no Templo)"", de 2015, o autor italiano Gianluigi Nuzzi escreveu que uma comissao que investiga as financas do Vaticano descobriu que o escritorio responsavel pela selecao dos santos tem pouca ou nenhuma documentacao dos fundos usados pelos postuladores, os principais promotores das candidaturas.

Nuzzi, que esta sendo julgado no Vaticano por publicar documentos vazados, escreveu que cerca de 1 milhao de euros em fundos suspeitos controlados por um postulador no banco do Vaticano foram congelados em 2014.

O novo decreto estipula que as contribuicoes de fieis e de grupos devem ir para uma conta e ser gerenciadas por um administrador. O ocupante da funcao deve ""respeitar escrupulosamente as intencoes"" dos contribuintes, manter uma documentacao detalhada e apresentar orcamentos a um superior.

Em seu livro, Nuzzi afirmou que uma unica canonizacao pode custar 750 mil euros. As novas normas determinam a criacao de um ""fundo de solidariedade"" para ajudar os candidatos de areas pobres.

O decreto de 21 artigos exige mais vigilancia financeira em cada etapa do processo, que normalmente comeca em uma diocese local apos uma investigacao preliminar.

A Igreja concede santidade postumamente a pessoas que se acredita terem sido suficientemente santas durante suas vidas para estarem atualmente no ceu e poderem interceder junto a Deus para realizar milagres.

Se o Vaticano concordar que alguem e um possivel candidato, anos de investigacoes tem inicio. Se um milagre, normalmente a cura inexplicavel de um doente, for atribuido ao candidato, ele ou ela e beatificado. A etapa final, a canonizacao propriamente dita, exige um segundo milagre.",[]
reuters.com,2016-03-10 20:30:37+00:00,"Iran calls for full access to international banking, sees UK role",['William James'],"Mohammad Nahavandian Chief of Staff of Iran Presidency attends the session ''Next Steps for Iran and the World'' during the Annual Meeting 2016 of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland January 20, 2016.

LONDON Iran needs full access to the international banking system, the chief of staff to President Hassan Rouhani said on Thursday, adding that London has an important role to play following the lifting of sanctions.

Mohammad Nahavandian also said Iran must regain its share of the global oil market before it would participate in any agreement among oil producing countries to restrict supply.

International sanctions against Iran, including banking restrictions, ended in January under a deal with world powers in which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program.

But Nahavandian, speaking at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said there should be greater clarity about the application of secondary U.S. financial sanctions to allow non-U.S. banks to conduct business freely with Iran.

""We need to see facilitation of banking relations as soon as possible and as complete as possible, and London can do that,"" he said.

U.S. measures still in place have left non-U.S. banks and insurers wary of processing transactions with Iran.

""Big banks are still worried about primary sanctions from the United States, I think they have to come with a very clear interpretation drawing the line between primary sanctions and secondary sanctions,"" he said. ""Non-U.S. banks should not be limited in any kind of banking transactions with Iranian banks.""

Nahavandian suggested Britain could have moved faster to capitalize on the lifting of sanctions, adding: ""Those who act quickly get the best results.""

Other European Union countries including Italy, France and Germany have already struck billions of dollars worth of deals with Iran.

British business Secretary Sajid Javid said on Wednesday that he and other European counterparts were working towards easing the impact of banking restrictions, and that he would lead a trade delegation to Iran later this year.

Iran is focused on increasing its oil sales now it can trade more freely, but the oil price collapse since mid-2014 has led some big exporters to suggest an output freeze.

""Of course the oil market has to be managed more wisely,"" Nahavandian. But ""for Iran to participate in supply reduction, the prerequisite is to come to ... the share of the market it had and then from that position help with a decrease in supply.""

Nahavandian said Iran's reliance on oil revenue was now minimal, and it was up to other producers to restrict supply.

Citing unnamed U.S. officials familiar with the investigation, the network said the Justice Department had prepared an indictment and an announcement could come in the next week.

U.S. officials say the hackers gained access only to some back office systems, not the operational system of the Bowman Avenue Dam, a flood control system around 30 miles (50 km) north of New York City, and the attack was not considered sophisticated, CNN said.

A Justice Department spokesman said he had no comment about the report.

Asked about the report at a news briefing, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said: ""We obviously take seriously all such malicious activity in cyberspace. We are going to continue to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent, deter, detect, counter, and mitigate that kind of activity.""

CNN said the attack alarmed Obama administration officials, who said it occurred at a time that Iranian hackers were also conducting ""similar probing attacks on U.S. financial institutions.""

Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz snared his first endorsement from a Senate colleague on Thursday when Senator Mike Lee of Utah backed him for the party's nomination.

""Ted doesnt believe you have to settle, Ted doesnt believe you should settle,"" Lee said at a Florida news conference ahead of Thursday's Republican debate in Miami.

Cruz, who represents Texas, is known for antagonizing senators from his party. In 2013, he spent more than 20 hours speaking on the Senate floor to protest the Affordable Care Act. Lee was among a handful of senators who helped Cruz during the protest.
