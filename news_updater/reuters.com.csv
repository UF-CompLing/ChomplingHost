Mandatory Credit: Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports

CHICAGO The National Hockey League said on Wednesday it has closed its investigation into sexual assault allegations against superstar Blackhawks player Patrick Kane, saying the accusations against him were unfounded.

Prosecutors in New York in November declined to bring charges in the case, saying the accusations made by a woman who had met him at a Buffalo, New York nightclub contained inconsistencies and were not backed up by credible evidence.

The NHL said that the final stage of its review included an in-person meeting between Kane and commissioner Gary Bettman in New York on Monday.

""The League considers the matter closed and will have no further comment,"" the statement said.

The woman had accused the 27-year-old player of raping her at his offseason lakeshore home in Hamburg, a Buffalo suburb, in August last year.

After an investigation, Erie County District Attorney Frank Sedita said in November that DNA evidence did not confirm the woman's allegation she had been raped and that there were inconsistencies between her accounts and those of other witnesses.

Kane is one of the National Hockey League's top stars and has led the Blackhawks to three Stanley Cup championships.

The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury on March 8 and unsealed on Wednesday as the anti-government protesters appeared in a federal court in Portland, supersedes an earlier indictment in the case.

It adds new charges against protest leader Ammon Bundy and other sympathizers who were indicted last month of conspiring to impede federal officers policing the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge during a long-simmering fight over land rights.

The takeover, which began on Jan. 2 with at least a dozen armed men, was sparked by the return to prison of two Oregon ranchers convicted of setting fires that spread to federal property in the vicinity of the refuge.

It also marked the latest flare-up in the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion, a decades-old conflict over federal control of millions of acres in the West.

On Tuesday, a county prosecutor said protest leader Robert ""LaVoy"" Finicum, who was fatally shot by Oregon State Police in late January during a traffic stop, was struck three times in the back during the incident. The prosecutor deemed the slaying ""justified and necessary.""

The superseding indictment lists 26 defendants. Each is charged with the initial charge of conspiring to impede federal agents. It newly accuses some of the protesters of: possession of firearms and dangerous weapons in federal facilities, use and carry of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, and depredation of government property.

That last charge was leveled against protester Sean Anderson and another sympathizer, whose name has been redacted from court documents. It alleges the pair damaged an archeological site considered sacred to the Burns Paiute Tribe through the use of excavation and heavy equipment.

The FBI has said it was working with the Tribe to identify damage to the tribe's artifacts and sacred burial grounds during the 41-day occupation.

Three armed occupiers were also indicted on charges of theft of government property, including a 2012 Ford F-350 Truck and cameras and related equipment.

A lawyer for Ammon Bundy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

NEW DELHI Afghanistan and Zimbabwe reaped the benefit of some tight death bowling to both register 14-run victories on Tuesday and boost their prospects of making the World Twenty20 main draw.

Vusi Sibanda's maiden fifty and Elton Chigumbura's late assault powered Zimbabwe to 158-8 against Hong Kong in the first match of the sixth World Twenty20 event at Nagpur's VCA Stadium.

The Africans then returned to restrict their opponents to 144-6 to kick off their campaign with a triumph.

Afghanistan later posted 170-5 at the same venue and dished out some impressive death bowling to restrict Scotland to 156-5 as they won their Group B clash.

The first wicket to fall in the tournament showed the gap between teams already in the Super 10 second round stage and those aspiring to join them from the first round.

Put in to bat, Zimbabwe skipper Hamilton Masakadza hit three boundaries and a six before a sloppy end to his innings.

Masakadza set out for a single that looked safe until he failed to plant his bat and drag it. His feet and the bat were in the air when the mid-off fielder threw down the stumps.

His opening partner Sibanda (59) showed more responsibility and brought up his fifty with a flat six off Nadeem Ahmed.

Zimbabwe subsequently lost three wickets, including Sibanda's, in eight balls but Chigumbura (30 not out) hit three sixes in his 13-ball cameo to take them past the 150 mark.

For Hong Kong, Jamie Atkinson (53) struck his maiden fifty but did not get much support from his top order colleagues.

Skipper Tanwir Afzal chipped in with a breezy unbeaten 31 but Zimbabwe's bowlers sent down a tidy last two overs.

Hong Kong's 44-year-old Ryan Campbell became the oldest player to make his Twenty20 international debut.

Afghanistan rode half-centuries from Mohammad Shahzad (61) and skipper Asghar Stanikzai (55 not out) to post a total that seemed to justify their decision to bat first.

Scotland offered a robust reply with George Munsey (41) and Kyle Coetzer (40) forging an 84-run opening stand before their chase was derailed.

Once the openers departed, Afghanistan's bowlers stemmed the run flow and then sent down some tight final overs to prevail.

The group winners will join South Africa, England, West Indies and Sri Lanka in the Super 10 stage.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 20:58:33+00:00,Clinton calls for sanctions on Iran after more missile tests,"['Bozorgmehr Sharafedin', 'Sam Wilkin']","DUBAI U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton on Wednesday called for sanctions against Iran after the Islamic Republic brushed off U.S. concerns and test-fired two ballistic missiles that it said were designed to be able to hit Israel.

Iranian state television showed footage of two Qadr missiles being launched from northern Iran, which the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said hit targets 1,400 km (870 miles) away.

Iranian agencies said the missiles were stamped with the Hebrew words, ""Israel should be wiped from the pages of history,"" though the inscription could not be seen on any photographs.

Clinton, a former secretary of state under President Barack Obama, said she was ""deeply concerned"" by the tests, the second round of Iranian missile launches in two days.

""Iran should face sanctions for these activities and the

international community must demonstrate that Iran's threats

toward Israel will not be tolerated,"" said Clinton, who is ahead in the race to be Democratic nominee at the Nov. 8 presidential elections.

Her call for sanctions reflected a tougher line against Iran's recent missile activity than that taken so far by the White House, which said it is aware of and reviewing reports of the Iranian tests, and would determine an appropriate response.

""We know that Iran is in a season of carrying out a number of military activities, and so it certainly would not be a surprise if there are additional launches over the next several days,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

The Iranian move on Wednesday came despite warning from the U.S. State Department after Tuesday's missile tests that Washington continues to ""aggressively apply our unilateral tools

to counter threats from Iran's missile program,"" a possible reference to additional U.S. sanctions.

Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Wednesday with Iran's foreign minister about the test-firing of two ballistic missiles, a State Department spokesman said.

The missile tests underline a rift in Iran between hard-line factions opposed to normalizing relations with the West, and

President Hassan Rouhani's relatively moderate government, which is trying to attract foreign investors to Iran.

ISRAEL IN MIND

Iran's IRGC said the missiles tested on Wednesday were designed with Israel in mind.

""The reason we designed our missiles with a range of 2,000 km is to be able to hit our enemy the Zionist regime from a safe distance,"" Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by the ISNA agency. The nearest point in Iran is around 1,000 km (600 miles) from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon told Israel Radio the tests showed Iran's hostility had not changed since implementing a nuclear deal with world powers in January, despite Rouhani's overtures to the West.

""To my regret there are some in the West who are misled by the honeyed words of part of the Iranian leadership while the other part continues to procure equipment and weaponry, to arm terrorist groups,"" Yaalon said.

Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee, said: Iran is making a mockery of President Obamas vow to confront Irans dangerous and illicit acts.

He urged Obama to ""aggressively enforce all sanctions against Irans missile programs, support for terrorism and human rights abuses. No more looking the other way.

Washington imposed sanctions against businesses and individuals in January over another missile test in October 2015. But the IRGC said it would not bow to pressure.

""The more sanctions and pressure our enemies apply ... the more we will develop our missile program,"" Hajizadeh said on state television.

The IRGC maintains dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles, the largest stock in the Middle East. It says they are solely for defensive use with conventional, non-nuclear warheads.

Tehran has denied U.S. accusations of acting ""provocatively,"" citing the long history of U.S. interventions in the Middle East and its own right to self-defense.

The San Antonio, Texas-based company has been battling with creditors, a group made up mostly of hedge funds, after it moved Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc shares to another subsidiary, Broader Media LLC.

iHeart this week received a default notice from the creditors, arguing the transfer is technically a default, and saying they could call their debt due in 60 days - a sum more than $6 billion - according to a lawsuit iHeart filed in State District Court in Bexar County, Texas.

The lawsuit also claims that the creditors' actions threaten to force the company into bankruptcy.

The restraining order iHeart won expires in 14 days, but the court may extend it, according to a public filing from the company. The order also stops the creditors from issuing additional notices of default.

iHeart said in a prepared statement that it was pleased with the outcome and looks forward to a favorable ruling.

The share move could be used to help the company, struggling with a $21 billion debt load, to find other financing opportunities, Moody's Investors Service said in a research note.

Choking and lifting are latest efforts to stem U.S. shale bust,"['Amrutha Gayathri', 'Swetha Gopinath']","Sunflowers stalks punctuate the snow in a field near dormant oil drilling rigs which have been stacked in Dickinson, North Dakota January 21, 2016.

Something is awry in the beleaguered U.S. shale patch: older wells, which normally gush oil or natural gas in their first few months before rapidly depleting, are not petering out as quickly as they should.

When oil prices began falling a year and a half ago in the deepest rout in a generation, many analysts expected U.S. crude production, especially from fracking in the new shale plays that contributed to a global supply glut, to follow quickly.

Producers, such as Continental Resources Inc (CLR.N) and Whiting Petroleum Corp (WLL.N), have slashed spending on almost everything, in some cases even leaving drilled wells unfinished to conserve cash and wait for a sustained turnaround in prices.

With oilfield activity suddenly contracting, production from a dwindling number of freshly fracked wells would be unable to compensate for the rapid depletion of older wells. Yet that long-anticipated turning point has only just begun to emerge - partly because producers had a couple more tricks in store.

Some drillers are spending a little bit more on measures that are subtly flattening the so-called ""production curve"" of shale wells, either by limiting the initial surge in output or by squeezing a few additional barrels out of older wells, according to industry executives and analysts.

The measures offer differing benefits.

Choking output at newly fracked wells curtails immediate supply and revenue in hopes that prices will be stronger later, whereas maximizing output at old wells with things like ""artificial lift"" is a relatively cheap way to increase volume and immediate revenues.

Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N), the third-largest services company in the U.S. shale patch, cited its artificial lift business as the ""one notable exception"" to a sector-wide slump in its latest quarter, growing by 4 percent even as other shale-related revenues fell 10 percent.

""Companies still want to grow production, they want to generate cash,"" said Wade Welborn, vice president of artificial lift at Baker Hughes. His business offers ""a means to increase that cash flow.""

For oil markets, they amount to the same thing: the long-anticipated fall-off in U.S. shale oil output is still proving slower and more tempered than anticipated, impeding the process of correcting the global glut that has walloped prices.

""Production optimization is going to be the next phase of the shale revolution,"" said Andrew Slaughter, director for the Deloitte Center for Energy Solutions. ""The low price environment will give companies and operators a chance to take stock of the techniques that work.""

LATE PHASE LIFT

The volume of daily production from a new shale well typically declines by 70 percent in the first nine months, according to estimates provided by SunTrust Robinson-Humphrey analyst Neal Dingmann.

Yet, that sharp decline rate has been shockingly slow to translate into lower production across the United States.

While the number of oil rigs collapsed by some 75 percent since the end of 2014, U.S. production has only barely begun to ebb, a disconnect generally attributed to the increasing productivity of the hydraulic fracturing process, with each new well yielding more barrels than the one before.

But other measures are also in play by companies keen to maximize immediate revenues to cover interest and other payments, and avoid the cost and hassle of shutting in wells.

For instance, rather than forking out $3 million to $6 million to drill and frack a new well, a producer can spend just $250,000-$500,000 to reinvigorate an older well with artificial lift - which may involve injecting chemicals or gas into perforations, or using an electrically driven pumping system.

With lift, a well can begin to flow again at 50-75 percent of its initial production rate in most instances, said Evercore ISI analyst James West. That may help extend the life of a well that would otherwise be slated for abandonment.

""Demand is strong because it is not directly correlated to new wells and drilling,"" said Kyle Chapman, president of Weatherford International Plc (WFT.N) production and completion line.

Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) says it is using workovers, refracking, artificial lift and other techniques to make its wells more productive, even as it cuts spending for the year by 75 percent. It expects 2016 output to fall about 10 percent.

Older wells, in production, help companies cover costs and it would cost more to shut them down, said Julius Walker, a senior consultant at JBC Energy in Vienna, noting this was contributing to ""production resilience"" and causing output to outperform the firm's forecasts based on historical models.

For example, in the Bakken - heart of the shale revolution - official data showed production in the fourth quarter was 60,000 bpd - or about 5 percent - higher than what JBC had estimated based on well data and historical decline rates.

CHOKING ON OIL

Other producers are taking a different, and cheaper, approach, by throttling back the initial production (IP) from newly fracked wells, pumping less now but more later and preserving pressure within the underground reservoir.

Most, if not all, recently drilled wells include a choke, a piece of steel placed in the flow path of oil coming out of a producing well, and more companies are now using them to curb early production in ways that can boost overall output from a well by as much as 10 percent, experts say.

""It's like if you take a coke bottle and shake it up and all the drink fizzles up. But if you don't shake it up, you end up getting more to drink - choking has the same effect,"" said Mike Breard, an analyst at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas.

Continental Resources - an industry pioneer that essentially stopped finishing new wells in North Dakota's Bakken shale field - is also applying chokes to manage production from three news wells in Oklahoma's STACK play.

For example, its Compton oil well, which has been producing for 51 days, pumped 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent in its first 41 days online, but has since been restricted to flow at 1,670 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,World News Video,['Thomson Reuters'],"ROUGH CUT - SUBTITLED (NO REPORTER NARRATION) China's renowned artist and activist Ai Weiwei visited the Greek border camp of Idomeni with his film crew on Wednesday (March 9). Some 14,000 people are stranded there after new border restrictions were imposed along the Balkan migration route. Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia said on Tuesday (March 8) they would place new restrictions on the entry of migrants and Macedonia responded on Wednesday by closing its border completely to illegal migrants, a police official said. Ai walked around the makeshift camp speaking with the migrants - seeing for himself the difficult conditions they have to brave as they wait to cross over to Macedonia and continue their trek northwards to wealthier European states. Ai, known for his criticism of China's human rights record, said he was witnessing a ""huge, big violation of human rights"" in the middle of Europe. ""What we have seen here is almost unbelievable, you know. If you say this is in the middle of Europe, all the people stuck here, and there's no hope for them even to be transferred to anywhere else, you know. It's just in the rain, in the cold, and women, children, all the people waiting for some bread, or some dry clothes, and this is a very sad situation and people have no hope because the door is closed, totally shut off. I think this is a huge, big violation of human rights, right in front of us. I don't know what is going to come out from this, but in Lesbos people still come in thousands every day, and here nobody tells them what to do, and they stay here, still having hope to go to Germany or some other location, but I think, as the sky is getting darker and I don't think there's much hope for them,"" he said. People fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and beyond have flooded into the EU since early 2015, most making the perilous sea crossing from Turkey to Greece, then heading north through the Balkans to Germany. But a cascade of border shutdowns in the Balkans has caused the blocking of the so-called 'Balkans corridor' used by more than a million people since the migratory wave started a year ago. More than 34,0000 people are now trapped on Greece's islands and mainland. At an emergency EU-Turkey summit on Monday (March 7), aimed to stem the migrant influx to Europe, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told leaders of the bloc Ankara was willing to take back all migrants who enter Europe from Turkey in future in return for financial aid, faster EU entry talks and quicker visa-free travel for its citizens. EU leaders aim to work out key details with Turkey by the next scheduled summit on March 17-18. European Council President Donald Tusk said the outcome would show migrants that there was no longer a path into Europe for people seeking a better life.",[]

Iranian state television showed footage of two Qadr missiles being launched from northern Iran, which the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said hit targets 1,400 km (870 miles) away.

Iranian agencies said the missiles were stamped with the Hebrew words, ""Israel should be wiped from the pages of history,"" though the inscription could not be seen on any photographs.

Clinton, a former secretary of state under President Barack Obama, said she was ""deeply concerned"" by the tests, the second round of Iranian missile launches in two days.

""Iran should face sanctions for these activities and the

international community must demonstrate that Iran's threats

toward Israel will not be tolerated,"" said Clinton, who is ahead in the race to be Democratic nominee at the Nov. 8 presidential elections.

Her call for sanctions reflected a tougher line against Iran's recent missile activity than that taken so far by the White House, which said it is aware of and reviewing reports of the Iranian tests, and would determine an appropriate response.

""We know that Iran is in a season of carrying out a number of military activities, and so it certainly would not be a surprise if there are additional launches over the next several days,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

The Iranian move on Wednesday came despite warning from the U.S. State Department after Tuesday's missile tests that Washington continues to ""aggressively apply our unilateral tools

to counter threats from Iran's missile program,"" a possible reference to additional U.S. sanctions.

Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Wednesday with Iran's foreign minister about the test-firing of two ballistic missiles, a State Department spokesman said.

The missile tests underline a rift in Iran between hard-line factions opposed to normalizing relations with the West, and

President Hassan Rouhani's relatively moderate government, which is trying to attract foreign investors to Iran.

ISRAEL IN MIND

Iran's IRGC said the missiles tested on Wednesday were designed with Israel in mind.

""The reason we designed our missiles with a range of 2,000 km is to be able to hit our enemy the Zionist regime from a safe distance,"" Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by the ISNA agency. The nearest point in Iran is around 1,000 km (600 miles) from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon told Israel Radio the tests showed Iran's hostility had not changed since implementing a nuclear deal with world powers in January, despite Rouhani's overtures to the West.

""To my regret there are some in the West who are misled by the honeyed words of part of the Iranian leadership while the other part continues to procure equipment and weaponry, to arm terrorist groups,"" Yaalon said.

Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee, said: Iran is making a mockery of President Obamas vow to confront Irans dangerous and illicit acts.

He urged Obama to ""aggressively enforce all sanctions against Irans missile programs, support for terrorism and human rights abuses. No more looking the other way.

Washington imposed sanctions against businesses and individuals in January over another missile test in October 2015. But the IRGC said it would not bow to pressure.

""The more sanctions and pressure our enemies apply ... the more we will develop our missile program,"" Hajizadeh said on state television.

The IRGC maintains dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles, the largest stock in the Middle East. It says they are solely for defensive use with conventional, non-nuclear warheads.

Tehran has denied U.S. accusations of acting ""provocatively,"" citing the long history of U.S. interventions in the Middle East and its own right to self-defense.

The 1.7-metre tall Nadine was created in the likeness of its maker, Nadia Thalmann, a visiting professor and director of Singapore's Nanyang Technological University's Institute of Media Innovation who has spent three decades researching into virtual humans.

Nadine's software allows the robot to express a range of emotions and recall a previous conversation. Nadine is not commercially available, but Thalmann predicted robots could one day be used as companions for people living with dementia.

""If you leave these people alone they will be going down very quickly. So these people need to always be in interaction,"" Thalmann said, adding Nadine could provide conversation, tell a story or play a simple game.

Thalmann and her team are also working on emotive robots that can play with children. The project is still in the early development stage and no prototype is available yet.

The child robot would be able to respond to questions, display emotions and recognize people. Aside from being a social companion, the child robot could supervise unattended children and inform a parent or nanny if something went wrong, Thalmann said.

There are plans to program the child robot to speak different languages so that it can serve as an educational tool for children, she said.

""A child has toys but they are usually passive. This robot will be an active toy which interacts with the child,"" said Thalmann. ""It will be able to remember what the child likes.""

Berlin/Moskau Die Bundesregierung hat die sofortige Freilassung der ukrainischen Kampfpilotin Nadja Sawtschenko aus russischer Haft gefordert.

Der Mordprozess gegen Sawtschenko verstoe gegen Geist und Buchstaben des Waffenstillstandsabkommens von Minsk, kritisierte Regierungssprecher Steffen Seibert am Mittwoch in Berlin. In der Vereinbarung sei zugesagt worden, alle Gefangenen und Geiseln des Konflikts in der Ostukraine auszutauschen.

NEW YORK Tairod Pugh, a U.S. Air Force veteran, was found guilty on Wednesday of attempting to join Islamic State, according to his lawyer.

The conviction marks the first case in more than 75 Islamic State-related prosecutions brought since 2014 by the U.S. Department of Justice to reach a jury verdict.

After a week-long trial in Brooklyn federal court, a jury found Pugh, 48, guilty of attempting to provide material support to a designated terrorist organization, and obstruction for destroying four portable electronic storage devices after his detention in Turkey.

""Of course, we are disappointed with the verdict as we put in great effort to defend the case, but the jury appeared to be fair and genuinely concerned about reaching the correct verdict as they saw it,"" Pugh's lawyer Eric Creizman said.

Pugh will be sentenced in September, Creizman said.

Prosecutors said Pugh immersed himself in violent Islamic State propaganda for months before buying a one-way flight from his home in Egypt to Turkey, where he hoped to cross the Syrian border into territory controlled by the extremist group.

He was detained by Turkish authorities at an Istanbul airport and eventually flown to the United States to face terrorism charges.

Pugh's defense lawyers argued that his only offense was to express ""repugnant"" views about Islamic State in Facebook posts and to watch dozens of the group's slickly produced recruitment videos. They said he traveled to Turkey to find work, not to become a jihadist.

But prosecutors pointed to a letter he drafted to his Egyptian wife, found on his laptop, in which he vowed to fight for Islam and declared he had two options: ""Victory or Martyr."" The letter was written days before he flew to Turkey, though it was unclear whether he ever sent it.

He also took with him to Istanbul a black facemask, a map depicting Islamic State's strongholds in Syria and a chart of the border crossings between Turkey and Syria.

Only one other Islamic State-related U.S. prosecution has reached trial. In Phoenix, Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem is on trial for plotting with others to attack a Prophet Mohammed cartoon contest in Texas. Two of his alleged associates were killed in a shootout with police at the event.

Pugh served as an avionics specialist in the Air Force from 1986 to 1990 and later worked as an Army contractor in Iraq from 2009 to 2010, prosecutors said.

OTTAWA The Bank of Canada held interest rates steady on Wednesday, citing stronger non-energy exports and an economy growing largely as expected, as it awaits this month's federal budget to gauge the impact of the Liberal government's stimulus plans.

The Canadian dollar firmed following the widely expected decision, as the central bank appeared to shrug off a recent rebound in the currency, saying that the rise in the exchange rate and oil prices are in line with what was assumed in January.

Traders had been looking to see what the bank would make of the Canadian dollar's appreciation since its last monetary policy meeting in January, with a weak currency seen essential to boosting the export sector. While the currency has firmed since hitting a 12-year low in January, it is still significantly weaker than a year ago.

""There was some fear that the bank might address some of the strength in the currency, but they ducked that pretty effectively,"" said David Tulk, chief Canada macro strategist at TD Securities.

As widely anticipated, the bank kept its overnight rate at 0.5 percent, where it has been since July 2015. The bank cut rates twice last year to combat the impact of cheaper oil, a major Canadian export.

Low oil prices are expected to continue to dampen growth in Canada, though the U.S. expansion remains on track and recent financial market volatility ""appears to be abating,"" the bank said.

Despite better-than-expected domestic growth in the fourth quarter, the bank said the near-term outlook remained broadly the same as its January assessment.

The economy grew at an annualized 0.8 percent clip in the fourth quarter, topping the bank's expectations for no growth. Economists anticipate this could set the first-quarter up to exceed the bank's 1 percent forecast.

Overall, employment has held up and household spending is supporting demand, while non-energy exports are gaining momentum, particularly in currency-sensitive sectors, the bank said.

An assessment of expected government measures will be included in April's economic projections. The new Liberal government will release its first budget on March 22 and a big deficit is expected.

The bank maintained that inflation is evolving as expected, with the factors that pushed total inflation up to its 2 percent target likely to be unwound in the coming months.

It also reiterated that financial vulnerabilities continue to edge higher due to regional shifts amidst a structural adjustment in the broader economy.

The economy was under siege from the worst drought since 1992, Patrick Chinamasa said on Wednesday, noting that the reforms had the full backing of Mugabe, who has previously attacked the IMF for imposing stringent credit conditions.

Mugabe's government started defaulting on debts to the IMF, World Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB) and several Western lenders in 1999, leading to a freeze in financial aid.

Chinamasa told reporters at the end of a economic review by an IMF team that the government's wage bill would be cut to 52 percent of government spending by 2019 from 82 percent but did not elaborate on how this would be achieved.

The government would also target ten state-owned firms to try to make them profitable and evaluate all land seized from white farmers in a bid to compensate displaced farmers.

Chinamasa said production by black farmers who took over the previously white-owned farms was ""scandalously low"".

He said Harare broke bilateral investment agreements when it seized farms owned by foreigners and that this would be fixed.

Compensation would be paid out of rent from black farmers who benefited from the seizures, a ministry circular said.

Zimbabwe made world headlines in 2000 when thousands of war veterans and Mugabe's supporters started violently evicting white farmers. More than a dozen farmers were killed.

Chinamasa said Zimbabwe had drafted a new financing programme to be presented to the IMF, whose executive board will vote on Harare's plan to repay $1.8 billion (1.2 billion) in arrears on May 2.

Zimbabwe is struggling to emerge from a deep recession in the decade to 2008, which slashed its GDP by nearly half, drove hundreds of thousands abroad in search of better paying jobs and pushed formal unemployment above 85 percent.

The IMF expects the economy to grow by 1.4 percent this year from 1.1 percent in 2015 and to rise 5.6 percent in 2017.

The IMF's head of mission to Zimbabwe, Domenico Fanizza, said Harare met all its targets under a fund monitoring programme, but improving fiscal discipline and re-engaging the international community should be a major priority.

""It will also send strong signals to the international community, reduce the perceived country risk premium and unlock affordable financing for the government and private sector,"" Fanizza said.

Crude oil and U.S. equity prices have been linked for much of 2016 to a degree that has surprised many investors. Wednesday's market action extended that trend, with WTI crude CLc1 rising nearly 5 percent and the S&P 500 energy sector .SPNY up 1.5 percent. Chevron (CVX.N) jumped 4.6 percent to $92.82 and gave the biggest boost to the energy sector.

""It's not about oil being a barometer of the global economy,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. ""A lot of it has to do with psychology.""

U.S. crude and the S&P 500 have been directionally correlated on all but six trading days this year, according to Wunderlich data.

""Stability in that asset class (oil) for a period of time will allow for the correlation to break down,"" said Hogan.

Since Feb. 11, the S&P 500 has gained 8.8 percent, but it is still down 2.7 percent for the year.

The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 36.26 points, or 0.21 percent, to 17,000.36, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 10 points, or 0.51 percent, to 1,989.26 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 25.55 points, or 0.55 percent, to 4,674.38.

In a week with a thin economic data calendar, markets will turn to the European Central Bank, which is expected to further ease monetary policy on Thursday.

Biotechnology stocks came under pressure a day after the U.S. government proposed a test program that would lower incentives to use higher-priced drugs when alternative treatments are available.

The Nasdaq Biotechnology sector .NBI fell 1.2 percent with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN.O) down 5.1 percent to $374.75 as the largest decliner on the Nasdaq 100.

Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) lost 3.4 percent to $506.63. Already reeling from several food-borne illnesses, the company temporarily shut a Massachusetts restaurant after four employees fell sick.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE on a 2.3-to-1 ratio while on the Nasdaq a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 48 new highs and 41 new lows.

About 7.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the average 8.67 billion in the previous 20 sessions.

The Canadian index has rebounded sharply since hitting an almost 3-1/2 year low in January, helped by a recovery in oil, but Zohny warned it may struggle to push on from here given energy companies have jumped and banks are richly valued.

""It wouldn't surprise us to see the Canadian market cool down in the coming months,"" he said.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 20:41:00+00:00,Cleanup of Massachusetts Chipotle complete after norovirus illnesses,"['Lisa Baertlein', 'Brian Snyder']","BILLERICA, Mass./LOS ANGELES A health official on Wednesday commended Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc for its handling of norovirus infections at a Boston-area restaurant, saying employees prevented more problems by calling in sick rather than report to work and that a cleanup of the restaurant was done.

Shares of Chipotle fell as much as 6.1 percent before easing, down 3.5 percent to $506.12 in afternoon trading.

The closure of the Chipotle in Billerica, Massachusetts, was seen as a test of a new food safety system rolled out after a series of illnesses hit the fresh burrito chain last year.

""They did the right thing,"" said Howard Penney, who covers the chain for Hedgeye Risk Management. However, he argued that Chipotle was still a ""broken company"" and that it would take years to return to its peak performance.

One employee was confirmed ill with norovirus and two more are suspected to have the virus, the top health official of the town of Billerica said.

The cleaned restaurant was scheduled to reopen on Thursday, Billerica Public Health Director Richard Berube told reporters, adding that the employees suspected of having the virus did not come to work on Wednesday.

""They called in sick so that was very fortunate,"" he said outside the closed restaurant.

Berube, the company and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health all said no customers were known to be sick.

Chipotle is trying to repair its reputation after a series of food-safety incidents. Those include two E.coli outbreaks linked to its restaurants that sickened more than 50 people in 10 states, as well as separate outbreaks of norovirus, a highly contagious virus known as the ""winter vomiting bug"", in Massachusetts and California that involved more than 350 diners.

Berube said Chipotle has been ""very proactive."" Remaining staff at the burrito restaurant would be screened for norovirus, he added.

Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold said the company closed the restaurant after four employees called in sick. Berube said three employees were sick or suspected of being sick.

The restaurant closure comes as Chipotle has tried to lure back diners with coupons for a free burrito and other food.

Chipotle sales have fallen sharply since the E.coli outbreaks came to light late last year. The stock traded above $750 last summer.

Sales at established Chipotle restaurants tumbled 14.6 percent in the fourth quarter, including a drop of 30 percent in the month of December.

""The publicity around this news announcement will be another negative data-point that may affect consumer demand,"" CRT Capital analyst Lynne Collier said in a client note.

Chipotle temporarily closed all of its U.S. restaurants on Feb. 8 during prime lunch hours to hold staff meetings on food safety.

Up to Tuesday's close of $524.69, the company's stock had fallen about 18 percent since the first E.coli outbreak was reported on Oct. 31.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 17:26:38+00:00,U.S. CDC director calls Puerto Rico his No. 1 Zika priority,['Julie Steenhuysen'],"Thomas Frieden, director of U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attends a news conference in San Juan March 8, 2016.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico In the fight against the Zika virus, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls Puerto Rico his top priority and is expressing worry about how to respond.

Unlike the Ebola virus, which has killed more 10,000 people in West Africa since 2014, ""there's no playbook for Zika,"" Dr. Thomas Frieden said in an interview on Tuesday during a tour of the Caribbean island U.S. territory to assess how to proceed.

Most Zika infections cause only minor illness, but the mosquito-borne virus has been linked to a spike in cases of the birth defect microcephaly in Brazil, the country hardest-hit by Zika as it spreads through Latin America and the Caribbean.

Frieden recalled a similar trip to West Africa in 2014 during the Ebola outbreak in which he toured response operations in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

""I met with each of the presidents, and I could tell them, 'If you do this, you can stop Ebola,'"" Frieden said.

With the Zika virus, he said, ""I don't have that kind of playbook. We're just now figuring out what are the things that could happen.""

Among U.S. states and territories, Puerto Rico is particularly vulnerable because of its Caribbean location and the presence of the main mosquito species that transmits Zika through bites. The World Health Organization last month declared a global public health emergency over Zika.

Although Zika is not a new virus, the evidence that it may cause microcephaly is recent.

""Until a few months ago, no one had any idea that Zika could cause birth defects,"" Frieden told a news conference earlier on Tuesday.

Scientists are urgently trying to confirm whether or not the virus causes microcephaly, a condition in which babies have abnormally small heads, underdeveloped brains and often lifelong developmental problems, amid mounting evidence that it does.

Frieden said it has been 50 years since a new pathogen was discovered that could cause a birth defect and ""we've never before known a mosquito-borne disease that could cause a birth defect.""

ZIKA EMERGENCY FUNDS

The CDC director spent part of last week testifying before the U.S. Congress to make the case for President Barack Obama's request for more than $1.8 billion in emergency funds for responding to the threat posed by Zika. Several top lawmakers have balked, saying he should first draw from funding previously set aside for fighting Ebola.

""I'm worried because what I'm seeing here are really big requirements, really big needs, and the funding request is real,"" Frieden said in the interview, referring to Puerto Rico, home to 3.5 million people.

""Look at what happened with dengue,"" a similar virus carried by the same mosquito as Zika, he said. ""More than 80 percent of adults were infected,"" he added.

Based on that, Frieden said he expects hundreds of thousands of people to be infected in Puerto Rico in the coming months, including thousands of pregnant women.

""We need to do everything possible to reduce the number,"" Frieden said.

Frieden expressed concern over the number of Puerto Rican women who do not want to get pregnant but are not using birth control.

""Clearly, if a woman doesn't want to become pregnant and it's consistent with her religion and beliefs to use contraceptives, she should be on contraception,"" he said.

He said it appears that Puerto Ricans are becoming more familiar with the risks associated with Zika.

""Two weeks ago, we heard that people in Puerto Rico are not worried about this, they are not taking it seriously,"" Frieden said.

But Frieden said that ""every pregnant women we talk with is taking this very seriously. They are all very worried about Zika. They want help and support to protect themselves.""

Palestinian man Tamer Al-Burai shows how he sleeps while using an Oxygen-generating device powered by Solar energy, at his house in Gaza City March 2, 2016.

A Palestinian worker installs solar panels atop the roof of a house in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip March 5, 2016.

A Palestinian woman works inside her kitchen lit by candles during a power cut at her dwelling in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip March 6, 2016.

GAZA Faced with power blackouts lasting anything from eight to 12 hours a day, residents and businesses in Gaza are increasingly turning to the sun to supply their energy needs.

Not only are solar panels more reliable and cheaper in the long run, but in some cases, including that of Tamer al-Burai, they have become essential to staying alive.

""To me, power is not just about lights or entertainment, it's a matter of life and death,"" said Burai, 40, who suffers from a severe sleep disorder that affects his breathing and has to be hooked up to an oxygen ventilator at night.

Burai used to spend around 18,000 shekels ($4,600) a year on fuel to run a generator that helped make sure he could weather the daily blackouts. Now he has invested in solar panels, making the long-run costs much cheaper.

""I paid $5,000 to get solar energy for the entire house and that will provide relief for years to come,"" the father of four told Reuters proudly.

Whereas three or four years ago only a handful of Gaza's 1.95 million people could afford to think about solar panels, in the past couple of years, as prices have come down, it has become a much more accessible option.

Schools, hospitals, shops, banks and even mosques have started to install panels on their roofs across the Gaza Strip, a self-governing Palestinian enclave which suffered considerable damage in 2014 during a seven-week war between Israel and Palestinian armed groups based in the territory.

Nabeel Marouf, the general manager of the Gaza-based Renewable Power Engineering and Contracting Company, said he had been overwhelmed with orders. Two years ago, he might have had a dozen clients, he said, but now it's in the thousands.

""People have lost hope for a solution to the power crisis, and on top of that there's the fuel crisis,"" he said, explaining that the regular power supply, interrupted for years, was a mess and fuel for generators was costly and problematic.

SUNSHINE GALORE

Looking across the rooftops of downtown Gaza City, it is clear solar is catching on, with glinting panels on almost every building. New technology even allows people to hang panels over the edge of their balconies.

Most of the equipment, including batteries and controllers, is imported from China, where they are made by U.S., Canadian or German companies, said Marouf. They are imported via Israel, which allows them into Gaza via one of its crossings.

Costs for a system range from $1,500 to $30,000, depending on the amount of energy people need.

Gaza has three usual sources of power: around 60 MegaWatts generated by the enclave's only power plant, 30MW imported from Egypt and 120MW that is supplied from Israel.

Solar power - abundant the year-round in Gaza, perched as it is on the edge of the southeastern Mediterranean between Israel and Egypt - may provide the territory with a degree of energy independence.

In Khan Younis, a town in the southern Gaza Strip, Mohammad Abu Jayyab watched workers as they installed panels on his home.

""It has become clear that there are no solutions (to the energy crisis) in the near future,"" said Abu Jayyab, a local economist. ""The situation became tragic, so we resorted to an alternative - solar power.""

Michael Horn, speaks at their media reception during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, January 10, 2016.

Michael Horn, President and CEO of Volkswagen America, reacts to being mobbed by the media after he apologized for the Volkswagen diesel scandal at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, United States in a November 18, 2015 file photo.

Michael Horn, President and CEO of Volkswagen America, introduces the new Beetle Dune at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, United States in a November 18, 2015 file photo.

WASHINGTON Volkswagen AG's top U.S. executive is stepping down nearly six months after the German automaker admitted to installing software to allow 580,000 diesel U.S. vehicles to emit excess emissions, the company said on Wednesday.

Michael Horn, who has been president and chief executive officer of Volkswagen Group of America since 2014, is leaving by mutual agreement ""to pursue other opportunities effective immediately,"" VW said.

Horn, 54, could not immediately be reached. A lawyer for Horn did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

The German automaker said on an interim basis, Hinrich J. Woebcken, a former BMW executive who ran global purchasing among other jobs, is filling Horn's job. In January, VW named Woebcken as head of VW's North American region, effective April 1.

Horn sent an email to employees thanking them for supporting him and for pulling together during the crisis.

Horn's departure comes as VW continues to negotiate with California, the Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency on possible fixes or buybacks for the diesel vehicles that emit up to 40 times legally allowable pollution. It faces a March 24 deadline to tell a federal judge whether it has an acceptable fix.

A top California official told state lawmakers Tuesday that VW may only be able to mount a partial fix and may have to pay to mitigate the harm caused by allowing vehicles to remain on the road.

Volkswagen faces an ongoing Justice Department criminal investigation. The Justice Department sued VW in January seeking up to $46 billion for violating environmental regulations and sent VW a civil subpoena under a bank fraud law.

Alan Brown, general manager of Hendrick Volkswagen in Frisco, Texas who is president of the National Volkswagen Dealer Advisory Council, praised Horn's tenure at VW and said he had talked to Horn over the last three days about his departure. Brown told Reuters Horn had been offered other jobs at Volkswagen outside the United States, but declined to take them.

Brown said it was critical VW maintain the strategy of growing U.S. volume and noted dealers have strongly supported the automaker through the crisis.

""We are not working out of gas stations any more,"" Brown said, noting VW's about U.S. 650 dealers have invested $1 billion over the last decade in facilities.

Brown is flying to Germany on Sunday and staying through Wednesday for meetings with VW executives in the aftermath of Horn's departure.

VW brand U.S. sales are down 14 percent this year after falling 5 percent last year. VW still faces a stop sale on all new diesel vehicles.

Brown said it was important VW stick with the business plan it approved to expand U.S. sales by quickly refreshing and redesigning vehicles.

U.S. VW dealers ""don't want a handout. They want a chance to win,"" Brown said. He said VW should scrap the idea of positioning itself as a ""near premium brand"" and return to its roots in the 1960s of selling mass market vehicles like the iconic Beetle.

Dennis Gaudet, a New Hampshire VW dealer, said Brown was ""probably the most popular (head) we've had as long as I've been a dealer"" and added he knew the American market ""better than most.""

During the initial response to the crisis, Horn was VW's public face in the United States, apologizing days after the scandal became public and testifying before Congress.

""Lets be clear about this: our company was dishonest  with the EPA and the California Air Resources Board  and with all of you. And in my German words: We totally screwed up. We must fix those cars,"" Horn said on Sept. 21.

In October, Horn told a U.S. House of Representatives panel that VWs supervisory board and top leadership did not intentionally order the cheating, but said it was the work of a few individuals.

Horn told Congress he had no knowledge of the cheating.

Horn joined VW in 1990 and held a series of jobs, including VW sales for Europe, before he became CEO based at VW's U.S. headquarters in Herndon, Virginia following the resignation of his predecessor, Jonathan Browning who abruptly resigned after VW brand sales fell in 2013. Sales fell despite an aggressive plan announced in 2008 by VW to triple sales in 10 years.

WASHINGTON A U.S. general nominated to lead U.S. forces in the Middle East told lawmakers on Wednesday that he was concerned about the lack of a reliable partner in Syria in the fight against Islamic State and would look carefully at Washington's strategy if confirmed to the post.

Army General Joseph Votel told the Senate Armed Services Committee he would seek to ensure a coherent and well-resourced strategy to go after Islamic State strongholds.

""In Iraq we do have a partner, we do have a government, (but) in Syria we don't and so I am concerned about how we approach this moving forward in Syria without a political element to support that,"" Votel told the committee, which is considering his nomination to head the U.S. Central Command that oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East.

""I do have concerns about our broader strategy against ISIL,"" Votel said, using an acronym for Islamic State, ""about how we are applying resources, about how we are focusing our authorities.""

Votel said operations to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul and the Syrian city of Raqqa would take additional resources.

The committee also is considering the nomination of Army Lieutenant General Raymond Thomas to lead U.S. Special Operations Command. Thomas told the members that U.S.-backed rebels in northeastern Syria had suffered more than 75 casualties fighting Islamic State in the past month.

""They're losing a lot of people to carry the fight against ISIL, so I'm impressed with their tenacity,"" Thomas said.

In response to a comment from Republican Senator John McCain, Thomas said he would support the presence of U.S. special forces in Libya to combat a growing threat from Islamic State there.

The United States launched an air strike on an Islamic State training camp last month and France has conducted surveillance flights and sent military advisers. U.S., French and British special forces also are present in the country, officials and media have said.

""That particular part of ungoverned space requires potentially unique special operations solutions and we're attempting to provide those options to the chain of command,"" Thomas said. ""We've already identified some formative organizations that we hope to be able to work with in the future.""

LONDON - British economic growth slowed in the three months to February, but is likely to be stronger for the first quarter of 2016 as a whole, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said on Wednesday.

NIESR estimated that Britain's economy grew at a quarterly rate of 0.3 percent in the three months to February, down from 0.4 percent in the three months to January.

Britain's economy grew 0.5 percent in the final quarter of 2015, and if growth fell to 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2016, it would be the weakest calendar quarter since late 2012.

NIESR researcher Jack Meaning said this looked unlikely.

""Output growth at the start of 2016 has been subdued,"" he said. ""However, it appears that December 2015 may have been a low point for GDP and ... output growth for the first quarter may strengthen slightly.""

Manufacturing output in January showed a bigger-than-expected rebound after falling in December, official figures showed earlier on Wednesday.

NIESR forecast last month that Britain's economy would grow by 2.3 percent in 2016 as a whole, similar to 2015.

Creative director Karl Lagerfeld's frequently spectacular sets at Paris Fashion Week are well known but the 82-year old designer opted for a paired-down dressing room feel this season, all plush cream carpets and walls of mirrors. The twist was that all the guests were seated on the front row of the lengthy catwalk; gone were the banks of benches to be replaced by rows of gold chairs which brought the people closer to the clothes. Lagerfeld said that people would not complain as they would be able to see every detail. On international women's day, Lagerfeld's women were ready to take on the world -- impractical footwear was banished in favour of flat riding boots, their two sections held together with laces. And with a half-mile march from one end of the runway to the other, the flat shoes came in handy. The designer has also decided that hats are back. His padded boaters were everywhere in colours ranging from fuschia to black, in leather and tweed but Lagerfeld said they were meant to be functional, not fussy. The collection opened with a parade in pink -- hot, fuschia and lavender -- with Chanel's classic tweed suits renewed with deconstructed fringes and denim details. Away from the suits, the collection was not classic Autumn/Winter, with silky floral prints and layered peasant dresses topped with pearls.

reuters.com,2015-09-15 21:57:16+00:00,From ivory tower to incubator: Transforming students and researchers into entrepreneurs,['Reuters Editorial'],"Sample6 is a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based startup with a new way to detect food-borne pathogens such as Listeria and Salmonella. Its technology was conceived in a Boston University lab, and the company was cofounded by Boston University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology PhD students Michael Koeris, Timothy Lu and Tanguy Chau. But they didn't do it on their own - Sample6 had lots of help, advice and $150,000 in convertible notes from Boston University's Office of Technology Development.

Koeris tapped into what Boston University calls a gap fund, created to help university entrepreneurs develop proof-of-concept prototypes. The fund expands on the traditional role of the university technology transfer office, which is to work with its researchers to file patents and license their ideas to the private sector.

""What tech transfer offices historically don't do well is facilitate company formation,"" says Koeris, Sample6's vice president of operations. ""Tech transfer at BU is different.""

Koeris said Boston University's gap fund, plus a staff that has some entrepreneurial experience, helped him and Lu prove that their idea could be commercialized. That enabled their nascent company to attract conventional venture backing.

So far Sample6 has received a total of $25 million in grants and funding from Boston University and about a half-dozen venture-capital firms, such as Canaan Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures and Flybridge Capital Partners. Sample6 now sells two products, a Listeria detector called Sample6 Detect/L and a management tool called Sample6 Control. Next year it is on track to release a Salmonella detector.

Other universities have also begun expanding the role of their technology transfer offices to include investing in homegrown startups. The goal is to give the new companies a better shot at success, with the university standing to gain license revenue if the startup begins making money and shares that would yield a payback if the company goes public or is acquired.

There's also the hope that company founders will make a hefty donation to the university if they hit it big. But few patents and licenses actually create revenue. Most comes from a few big hits, such as the hepatitis B vaccine from the University of California at San Francisco, which has earned close to half a billion dollars.

Technology transfer officials say that in the past couple of years, they've had to develop more expertise in starting companies. ""Part of our role is increasingly supporting the creation of new businesses,"" says William Tucker, executive director for innovations, alliances and services for the University of California system. He says large companies ""don't have much basic research anymore,"" and rely on startups to do commercial proof of concepts.

The California system is one of the leaders in direct investment in startups. It has various incubators and accelerators on its campuses, and has established a $250 million venture capital fund, as well as campus-based seed funds for prototypes.

It has a lot to work with: The California system produced the most patents in 2014 of any university system. That same year it earned $118.3 million in revenue from technology licenses and patents, according to its transfer office's annual report.

Many universities make less than $1 million a year in licensing revenue, according to data from the Association of University Technology Managers, a trade group for technology transfer officials.

""What's happening is that universities have developed whole ecosystems for entrepreneurial research,"" says Donald Siegel, dean of the school of business at the University at Albany, who specializes in the study of university technology transfer.

Siegel says universities offer business development help, make small loans to or investments in companies founded by faculty and students, start incubators and accelerators to help spur companies, and count starting a company toward tenure consideration for faculty.

Technology transfer offices are changing, in part, in order to fill a gap in research funding created by the recession of 2008-2009, after which tech transfer officials say many large companies, especially pharmaceutical companies, became less willing to license basic research. Technology transfer offices will still license basic research, but it typically takes five to 15 years to commercialize, a timeframe too long for most venture capital funds. Universities started setting up investment funds like Boston University's gap fund to help faculty and students commercialize the technology. (The Boston fund is technically not a venture fund because it is not judged by its internal rate of return.)

""It's gotten harder and harder every year to license technology right out of university to an ongoing concern,"" says Carl Gulbrandsen, managing director of the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF). Founded in 1925, it's one of the nation's oldest and most successful technology transfer organizations. Gulbrandsen says the prime industries for licensing are agricultural companies and pharmaceuticals, and the Great Recession made pharmaceuticals in particular more risk averse and less willing to spend on research and development.

Now, Gulbrandsen says, ""they expect universities and small companies to take the risk."" Wisconsin is unusual in that WARF operates separately from the university, does not receive funds from the university, and instead gives university researchers funding from its endowment. In 2014, its endowment reached $2.8 billion last year and WARF provided $60 million in research grants to university researchers.

WARF, which handles technology transfer for all the UW campuses except Milwaukee, has taken a variety of steps to help its academics become entrepreneurs. It brings in 30 paid mentors twice a year to advise faculty and staff on ideas they're trying to commercialize. It provides money to the university's business and law schools to help with legal and accounting needs. It partnered with the State of Wisconsin's pension fund to establish a $30 million seed fund to invest in the university's startups. And in 2014, WARF and the University of Wisconsin-Madison invested $3.2 million to open an accelerator, a shared workspace aimed to help startups, called Discovery to Product.

Technology transfer officials say that they're engaging in startup companies not primarily for the money, but because they see startups as a way to publicize knowledge from their labs. ""I always say we don't even warrant a note in the annual report for our income,"" says Katharine Ku, executive director of Stanford's Office of Technology and Licensing. ""But Stanford has never felt that it was a focus of the office.""

Stanford's technology transfer operation earned $108 million in revenue in 2014 according to its annual report, with its biggest earner pulling in $60 million, and its smallest just $1.18.

Ku, who started at Stanford in 1982, says tech transfer has matured greatly since then, and the push for startups is part of this maturing.

""We all have this mission of transferring technology. The focus around the country and by the university is that startups may be the only way technology will get out there, because it's so early stage,"" she says. ""There's a huge gap between a university lab's results and commercialization of that invention.""

Initial jobless claims  considered by many as the most solid indicator measuring the health of the job market because its a count of real people not a representative survey  are forecast at 275,000 in the week ended March 5, according to a Reuters poll.

That median forecast has sat on the lower end of the spectrum of reported new unemployment benefit claims in each week since the start of 2016, when close to 300,000 people queued up for state assistance.

Jobless claims undercut even the lowest forecast at the start of the year, although for the most part it has stayed within the forecast range.

The top 20 most accurate forecasters on the indicator in Reuters polls are all within a few thousand of 275,000. The most pessimistic is 295,000 from Morgan Stanley.

So long as the needle stays around current levels, past correlations with other data show the economy faces no real danger of a recession.

With the unemployment rate at 4.9 percent and still falling, there are few reasons to worry. The economy added 242,000 jobs in February  50,000 more than forecast. Average earnings fell on the month, but economists say that has more to do with the timing of measuring pay that month than a fundamental downturn.

BofAML economists wrote in a note to clients:

Bears write off the continued labor market strength as a lagging indicator. Yes, over-200,000 payroll growth is unsustainable and will decelerate over time. But a variety of leading indicators do not suggest a recessionary slowdown in employment is looming. The good news is that claims have been quite well-behaved of late. After creeping up to just shy of 300,000 in mid-January  raising red flags among some of the doomsayers  we are back below 280,000.

Jim OSullivan, the most accurate U.S. economic data forecaster in Reuters Polls last year, relies heavily on jobless claims for a reading of how well the economy is doing. He remains optimistic, telling clients in a note this week not to worry too much unless jobless claims trend higher.

That said, claims are well above a four-decade low of 255,000 struck in July of last year, which coincided with annualized economic growth of a relatively modest 2 percent in that quarter. It slowed half that rate in the following quarter.

A surging dollar and weak global trade  weak enough to warrant another warning from the International Monetary Fund this week  has clearly taken a heavy toll, particularly on manufacturing and exports.

Even the non-manufacturing ISM employment index has already dipped below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, a first since February 2014. But most are treating that sudden dip as a blip.

Judging just by the length of past expansions, and how low claims generally go before rising again, the risk of a more substantial increase sometime before long appears likely.

As the chart below shows, once jobless claims start to rise substantially, a recession nearly always follows.

The main difference this time is the U.S. Federal Reserve has only just begun raising interest rates.

Mandatory Credit: Justin Sellers/The Clarion-Ledger via USA TODAY NETWORK

Detroit Allen Angriffen aus den eigenen Reihen zum Trotz lasst sich Donald Trump im Rennen um die Prasidentschaftskandidatur nicht aus der Spur bringen.

Nach erneut prestigetrachtigen Vorwahlsiegen hat der Milliardar die republikanische Konkurrenz weiter abgehangt und zieht gestarkt in die richtungsweisende Abstimmungsrunde am kommenden Dienstag. Anders Hillary Clinton. Sie punkte zwar in Mississippi und liegt bei den Demokraten nach wie vor in Fuhrung. Aber ausgerechnet bei der wichtigsten Vorwahl des Abends in Michigan erlitt die Ex-Auenministerin eine empfindliche Niederlage. Sie muss furchten, dass mit dem Erfolg ihres Widersachers Bernie Sanders der Signalschuss fur eine Aufholjagd des selbst ernannten Sozialisten gefallen ist, wenn es in einer Woche in den bevolkerungsreichen Bundesstaaten Florida, Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina und Missouri besonders viele Stimmen im Kampf um die Kandidatur zu holen gibt.

Groer Gewinner der jungsten Etappe im Vorwahlkampf war einmal mehr Trump. In seiner Siegesserie rief er das Parteiestablishment auf, endlich den Widerstand gegen ihn aufzugeben, sich hinter ihm zu scharen und auf die Ruckeroberung des Weien Hauses bei der Prasidentenwahl im November zu konzentrieren. Schlielich ziehe er schon jetzt neue Wahler auf die Seite der Republikaner. ""Wir haben hier etwas am laufen, das so gut ist, dass wir einander packen und die Partei einen sollten.""

Wie kein anderer Bewerber hat Trump die Republikaner mit populistischen Tiraden gegen Muslime, Einwanderer und Frauen polarisiert. Nach seiner Vorwahl-Siegesserie beim Super Tuesday Anfang Marz riefen etablierte Parteivertreter in mehreren Aktionen offentlich dazu auf, Trump nicht zu wahlen. Lobbygruppen schalteten fur Millionen Dollar Anti-Trump-TV-Spots. Doch bei der Basis fruchtete das offenbar nicht. Sowohl in Michigan als auch in Mississippi erntete der politische Auenseiter am meisten Zuspruch. Umfragen zufolge punktete er bei strengglaubigen Christen genauso wie bei den Wahlern, die vor allem uber die Politiker in Washington wutend sind. Gerade in dem vom wirtschaftlichen Niedergang gezeichneten einstigen Industriezentrum Michigan kam Trumps Versprechen gut an, ins Ausland verloren gegangene Jobs wieder zuruckzuholen.

LETZTE CHANCE FUR RUBIO IN FLORIDA

Dagegen hatte der Liebling des Establishments, Marco Rubio, keine Chance. Der vergleichsweise moderate Senator muss nun dringender denn je in seinem Heimatstaat Florida siegen, sonst durfte er vor dem Aus stehen. Einige Beobachter sind sich jedoch jetzt schon sicher, dass die Nominierung nur noch zwei Bewerber unter sich ausmachen: Trump und der erzkonservative Senator Ted Cruz. Der Texaner siegte am Dienstag in Idaho und zementierte damit seine Position als aussichtsreichster Rivale des New Yorker Unternehmers. Doch Trump gab sich gelassen: ""Ted wird es schwer haben. Er gewinnt nur selten gegen mich.""

Bei den Demokraten sah sich Sanders im Aufwind: Das Ergebnis in Michigan zeige, wie falsch die Demoskopen doch liegen konnten. In Umfragen war Clinton auf einen zweistelligen Vorsprung gekommen, doch am Ende unterlag sie knapp. Sanders werte dies als Beleg, dass seine politische Bewegung gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeit in jedem Teil der USA stark sei. ""Offen gesagt, wir glauben, dass unsere starksten Gebiete erst noch kommen"", sagte der Senator aus Vermont. Im Clinton-Lager durfte die Warnung angekommen sein.",[]

The opinions expressed are his own.

The United States may find technology groups are a riskier tool of foreign policy than banks. America has long used its dominance of international finance to compel foreign lenders to enforce U.S. sanctions. New restrictions on Chinas ZTE are an extension of the principle. But targeting technology has larger ramifications at home.

Until now, overseas banks were the main targets of Americas extraterritorial reach. U.S. officials demanded that foreign lenders help enforce sanctions against unfriendly countries such as Iran and North Korea. When banks disobeyed they faced increasingly large fines, culminating in the $8.9 billion penalty paid by BNP Paribas in 2014. Governments complained that the United States was enlisting foreign firms to fight its diplomatic battles. The banks had little choice, however: no large financial institution can credibly function without a U.S. licence.

Now ZTE is learning the cost of sanctions-busting. The U.S. Commerce Department has slapped an effective export ban on all stateside suppliers to the Chinese telecom equipment firm, massively disrupting its supply chain. The Shenzhen-based firms alleged offense was channeling U.S.-made technology to Iran, in a direct breach of sanctions.

On the face of it, ZTE has been caught red-handed. Alongside its ruling, the Commerce Department released company documents from 2011 which set out how it planned to avoid the restrictions. One states explicitly that ZTE is using U.S. technology in Iran, Sudan, North Korea, Syria and Cuba  in breach of sanctions. Another document, labeled Top Secret, has the revealing title Proposal for Import and Export Control Risk Avoidance. It even includes a flow chart setting out how ZTE can dodge controls.

The Chinese company says it is talking to the U.S. government about a solution. Even if it finds one, however, the latest show of American force could have broader consequences. U.S. suppliers will suffer if ZTE is forced to cancel orders, while Chinese manufacturers are bound to rethink their dependence on U.S.-made hardware and software. China could respond by taking an even tougher approach to foreign tech firms operating in the Peoples Republic.

As long as the U.S dollar is the worlds reserve currency, financial sanctions have few costs for America. Extending the same approach to technology, however, is much more risky.",[]

SEOUL North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast city of Wonsan early on Thursday, flying approximately 500 km (300 miles), South Korea's military said.

North Korea has a large stockpile of short-range missiles and is developing long-range and intercontinental missiles.

Reports of the missiles being fired coincide with already heightened tension on the Korean peninsula after the North conducted its fourth nuclear test in January and launched a long-range rocket last month, leading to new U.N. Security Council and bilateral U.S. sanctions.

The North fired six rockets into the sea last week using a multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) from Wonsan, supervised by leader Kim Jong Un who ordered his military to be prepared to launch pre-emptive attacks against enemies.

Kim said on Wednesday his country has miniaturized nuclear warheads to mount on ballistic missiles and ordered improvements in the power and precision of its arsenal in his first direct comment about nuclear warhead miniaturization.

State Department spokesman John Kirby declined to comment on Kim's claim to have miniaturized nuclear warheads and accused him of ""provocative rhetoric.""

""I'd say the young man needs to pay more attention to the North Korean people and taking care of them than in pursuing these sorts of reckless capabilities,"" Kirby said.

The Pentagon said this week it had not seen North Korea demonstrate a capability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead. But Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the department was working on U.S. ballistic missile defenses to be prepared.

North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 but its claim to have set off a miniaturized hydrogen bomb has been disputed by the U.S. and South Korean governments and many experts.

U.S. and South Korean troops began large-scale military drills this week, which the North called ""nuclear war moves"" and threatened to respond with an all-out offensive.

That would be Tuesday, Mar. 15, when four crucial states  Florida, Ohio, Illinois and Missouri  will hold primaries. Its also the first day when Republican rules allow states, if they choose, to hold winner-take-all contests. Florida, with 99 delegates, and Ohio, with 66, are doing just that. Whoever comes in first wins the whole pot.

Both states have a favorite son in the presidential race  Senator Marco Rubio in Florida and Governor John Kasich in Ohio. But the Republican frontrunner Donald Trump leads the polls in Florida and is closely competitive in Ohio. If Rubio and Kasich lose their home states, they would be finished.

Anti-Trump Republicans are investing heavily to stop Trump. Three different political action committees are expected to spend more than $10 million on anti-Trump ads in Florida.

Trumps response: Go ahead, punks. Make my day. Trumps spokesman called it another desperate attempt by the out-of-touch establishment elites and dark money that control the weak politicians to maintain control of our broken and corrupt system.

For decades, two armies have been at war over the Republican Party. The struggle goes all the way back to 1976, when Ronald Reagan challenged President Gerald Ford and nearly beat the incumbent for his own partys nomination. It has always been the mainstream Republican establishment (Washington and Wall Street) versus the conservative counter-establishment.

The mainstream establishment is pinning its hopes on Rubio. But he seems to be sinking fast. Conservatives are rallying behind Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). Cruz, the Tea Party favorite, won the straw poll at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference. Trump, meanwhile, is leading both of them.

Cruz may be able to hold on for a while. Hes winning low-turnout Republican caucuses, as he did on Saturday in Kansas and Maine. A choice that comes down to Cruz and Trump would leave mainstream Republicans in despair: The old enemy (Cruz and the Tea Party) versus the new enemy (Trump).

We are witnessing history, former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan wrote in her the Wall Street Journal column. Something important is ending.

An army of outsiders is trying to take over the Republican Party. Its cause is anti-establishment populism. The Republican army is supposed to be fueled by hatred of President Barack Obama. But Trumps army is driven by another hatred that appears to be just as intense: hatred of the Republican Party establishment that has failed to stop Obama.

Trumps signature attitude is defiance. His supporters see voting for him as a way to defy the Republican Party establishment. I want to see Trump go up there and do damage to the Republican Party, one Mississippi voter told the New York Times. An Arizona voter said, Were going to use Donald Trump to either take over the GOP or blow it up.

Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, embodies everything Trump voters hate about the Republican establishment. Romney doesnt have a populist bone in his body. Worse, he let Obama beat him in 2012. There was Romney last week, warning Republicans that Trump is a fraud and a phony.

Romney went so far as to insinuate that Trump is an extremist. This is the very brand of anger, he said, that has led other nations into the abyss. Germany for example?

Trump is not an ideologue. And hes not a professional politician. Hes a businessman. His supporters believe government should be run like a business.

Its a deeply held American belief that politics is the enemy of problem-solving. Why cant we deal with the national debt? Too much politics. Why cant we deal with climate change? Politics. Trump, like businessman Ross Perot before him, promises to keep politics out of government and just get things done. Everybody knows theres no politics in business, right?

But theres a reason government cant be run like a business. Business is not a democracy. If business were a democracy, it would look like government: less efficient, more political. Thats why Trump has a taint of undemocratic extremism. He wants to run government like a business. With himself as boss.

The last hope of the anti-Trump forces is to prevent Trump from going to the Republican National Convention in July with the number of delegates needed to nominate him. If Trump doesnt win a on the first ballot, we could see a brokered convention. Then maybe the anti-Trump forces could rally behind another candidate.

Theyre deluding themselves. Suppose Trump goes to the convention with the largest primary vote and the largest number of delegates, even if its not a majority. Does anyone believe Trump would stand by and watch the party nominate a candidate who did worse than he did? Or a candidate who didnt even run in the primaries?

The Trump army would protest that the party establishment is rigging the game and rejecting the peoples choice. That way lies pandemonium. Trump supporters would disrupt the convention and possibly walk out. It would be Chicago 1968 all over again.

Some anti-Trump Republicans are talking about splitting the party and running another GOP candidate in November if Trump becomes the party nominee. Wouldnt that be suicidal? Wouldnt it ensure the election of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, now the likely nominee?

Of course it would. But anti-Trump Republicans may be making a longer-run calculation. If Trump became president, he would destroy the Republican Party. If Clinton became president, she would unite the Republican Party  against her.

And the party would live to fight another day.",[]

reuters.com,2016-03-09 20:14:05+00:00,Exclusive: Teva set to win EU okay for $40.5 billion Allergan deal - sources,['Foo Yun Chee'],"BRUSSELS Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA) is expected to win EU antitrust approval for its $40.5 billion bid for Allergan's (AGN.N) generics unit after agreeing to sell off some of its products to appease regulators, three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

Teva, the world's biggest generic drugsmaker, will divest some drugs already on the market and others in the pipeline to address competition concerns by the European Commission, the people said. The package includes products from both Teva and Allergan.

Other sources had previously told Reuters that assets worth about $1 billion in the United States, Europe and the Middle East would be sold in order to secure the green light from regulators.

Teva will gain bigger economies of scale, a crucial element in the low-margin generic drugs business, with the deal, the largest in Israel's corporate history.

The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the case on Thursday, and Teva declined to comment.

The deal, which requires U.S. approval, has triggered a warning from the American Antitrust Institute that a more concentrated generic market usually comes with higher prices. The think-tank also said divestments may not be enough to ensure competition in the market in a letter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in January.

Dublin-based Botox-maker Allergan in turn is to be acquired by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) in a $160 billion deal creating the world's largest drugmaker.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 20:58:33+00:00,Clinton calls for sanctions on Iran after more missile tests,"['Bozorgmehr Sharafedin', 'Sam Wilkin']","DUBAI U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton on Wednesday called for sanctions against Iran after the Islamic Republic brushed off U.S. concerns and test-fired two ballistic missiles that it said were designed to be able to hit Israel.

Iranian state television showed footage of two Qadr missiles being launched from northern Iran, which the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said hit targets 1,400 km (870 miles) away.

Iranian agencies said the missiles were stamped with the Hebrew words, ""Israel should be wiped from the pages of history,"" though the inscription could not be seen on any photographs.

Clinton, a former secretary of state under President Barack Obama, said she was ""deeply concerned"" by the tests, the second round of Iranian missile launches in two days.

""Iran should face sanctions for these activities and the

international community must demonstrate that Iran's threats

toward Israel will not be tolerated,"" said Clinton, who is ahead in the race to be Democratic nominee at the Nov. 8 presidential elections.

Her call for sanctions reflected a tougher line against Iran's recent missile activity than that taken so far by the White House, which said it is aware of and reviewing reports of the Iranian tests, and would determine an appropriate response.

""We know that Iran is in a season of carrying out a number of military activities, and so it certainly would not be a surprise if there are additional launches over the next several days,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

The Iranian move on Wednesday came despite warning from the U.S. State Department after Tuesday's missile tests that Washington continues to ""aggressively apply our unilateral tools

to counter threats from Iran's missile program,"" a possible reference to additional U.S. sanctions.

Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Wednesday with Iran's foreign minister about the test-firing of two ballistic missiles, a State Department spokesman said.

The missile tests underline a rift in Iran between hard-line factions opposed to normalizing relations with the West, and

President Hassan Rouhani's relatively moderate government, which is trying to attract foreign investors to Iran.

ISRAEL IN MIND

Iran's IRGC said the missiles tested on Wednesday were designed with Israel in mind.

""The reason we designed our missiles with a range of 2,000 km is to be able to hit our enemy the Zionist regime from a safe distance,"" Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by the ISNA agency. The nearest point in Iran is around 1,000 km (600 miles) from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon told Israel Radio the tests showed Iran's hostility had not changed since implementing a nuclear deal with world powers in January, despite Rouhani's overtures to the West.

""To my regret there are some in the West who are misled by the honeyed words of part of the Iranian leadership while the other part continues to procure equipment and weaponry, to arm terrorist groups,"" Yaalon said.

Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee, said: Iran is making a mockery of President Obamas vow to confront Irans dangerous and illicit acts.

He urged Obama to ""aggressively enforce all sanctions against Irans missile programs, support for terrorism and human rights abuses. No more looking the other way.

Washington imposed sanctions against businesses and individuals in January over another missile test in October 2015. But the IRGC said it would not bow to pressure.

""The more sanctions and pressure our enemies apply ... the more we will develop our missile program,"" Hajizadeh said on state television.

The IRGC maintains dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles, the largest stock in the Middle East. It says they are solely for defensive use with conventional, non-nuclear warheads.

Tehran has denied U.S. accusations of acting ""provocatively,"" citing the long history of U.S. interventions in the Middle East and its own right to self-defense.

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said on Wednesday it had signed a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA.N) 767 widebody freighter aircraft to handle more of its own deliveries in the United States.

The deal comes at a time when the world's biggest online retailer is offering ever-faster, and increasingly free, deliveries for millions of online orders.

Amazon, which relies on carriers like United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) to deliver most of its packages, spent $11.5 billion on shipping last year.

In a bid to assume more control over its supply chain and reduce costs, Amazon has rolled out thousands of trailers and launched a program that uses contract drivers to deliver fast orders.

But analysts said the long-rumored plan to build its own air fleet posed little threat to the leading delivery companies.

""This is an incremental negative for FDX and UPS as it will likely remove some higher yielding express freight and parcel volume from each of the respective networks,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst John Barnes wrote in a client note.

UPS, the world's No. 1 package delivery company, operates about 240 large planes while FedEx has a fleet of about 370, Barnes noted. FedEx and UPS shares were down about 1.5 percent.

FedEx said on Wednesday the announcement was not a surprise and called Amazon a valuable customer.

""We work closely with Amazon and have been aware for some time about their need for supplemental air capacity related to inventory management,"" said Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications at FedEx.

The leased planes will start to go into operation on April 1, Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email.

Amazon has been testing deliveries by drones but has not said when they would be in service.

The duration of the leases will be five to seven years, lessor Air Transport Services Group Inc (ATSG.O) said.

As part of the agreement, Amazon has the right to buy up to 19.9 percent of ATSG's stock over five years at $9.73 per share.

ATSG's stock soared almost 27 percent to a record high of $14.90, before paring gains to about 16 percent.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 11:04:57+00:00,Morgan hopes England stay brash and aggressive in India,['Sudipto Ganguly'],"MUMBAI The current England squad has been the most expressive in a long time and players are encouraged to be as brash and aggressive as they can on the field, limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan said on Wednesday as he prepares his side for the World Twenty20.

England have looked a completely different proposition in one-day internationals and Twenty20 cricket in the 12 months since their humiliating group stage exit at last year's 50-over World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.

The team were then roundly criticised for being too old fashioned in their approach to short-format contests but Morgan's youthful side have since displayed the freedom and exuberance England fans had craved for years.

""I would say, it's the most expressive we've been in a long time. The evidence is the significant totals we have put with our bat,"" the 29-year-old Ireland-born cricketer told reporters.

""I think we've scored 350 twice or three times and we've definitely chased it down once. I think we had six consecutive times scoring 300, which is a huge step for us. We've scored 400 once.

""And it's no coincidence. We have a lot of talent within the side, we encourage our players to go out and be as brash and aggressive as they can and take the game to the opposition.""

England defeated Pakistan in a one-day series and three Twenty20 contests on the slow pitches in United Arab Emirates in November and were also impressive in defeat against South Africa in both formats last month.

FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

All-rounder Ben Stokes, a chief exponent of England's fearless cricket, assured the team will continue to play the same brand of cricket during the World Twenty20 in India.

""I mean it's worked. (coach) Trevor (Bayliss) and Morgan gave us that freedom and even (test captain Alistair) Cook in tests,"" Stokes said.

""We are playing this attacking, positive brand we have probably been talking about the last two-three years but we have only started doing that in the last 12-18 months.

""It's obviously worked for us, so why stop doing it? We got a bit a criticism in South Africa for the two (Twenty20) games we lost but we won six before that.""

Morgan said his players would probably be at a slight disadvantage for not playing in the Indian Premier League but hoped they could make up for it with the recent experience of touring the Middle East and Sri Lanka.

""I think it (not playing IPL) just becomes a different challenge,"" Morgan said, while picking hosts India as his favourites for the World Twenty20. ""Not only have our guys not played the IPL a lot of our guys have never been to India.

""But we have guys who have toured Sri Lanka quite a lot, been on a recent tour to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, where we had a little bit of success.""

England open their campaign against 2012 champions West Indies in Mumbai on March 16 before facing South Africa, Sri Lanka and a qualifier in Group 1 of the Super 10 stage. The top two sides will advance to the semi-finals.

Berlin Die groen Gewerkschaften IG Metall, Verdi und IG BCE werben in den Betrieben fur eine Teilnahme an den Landtagswahlen am Sonntag - ausdrucklich auch mit dem Ziel, den Stimmenanteil der rechtspopulistischen AfD klein zu halten.

""Wer nicht zu Wahlen geht, wird anschlieend trotzdem regiert und starkt mit seiner Nicht-Teilnahme in aller Regel rechtspopulistische und rechtsextreme Parteien"", teilte der rheinland-pfalzische IG-Metall-Bezirksleiter Jorg Kohlinger am Mittwoch mit. Damit ziehe man die Konsequenzen aus den jungsten Kommunalwahlen in Hessen mit Blick auf die Landtagswahlen in Rheinland-Pfalz, hie es in der IG Metall. In Hessen hatte die AfD am Sonntag auch wegen der sehr niedrigen Wahlbeteiligung von unter 50 Prozent nach einer ersten Trendmeldung 13,2 Prozent der abgegebenen Stimmen erreicht. Nach weiteren Auszahlungen deutet sich allerdings an, dass das Ergebnis noch nach unten revidiert werden durfte.

Laut Umfragen hat die AfD gute Chancen, am Sonntag in die Landtage von Baden-Wurttemberg, Rheinland-Pfalz und Sachsen-Anhalt einzuziehen. Eine hohe Zahl von Befragten hat bei Umfragen angegeben, nicht zu wissen, ob und was sie wahlen wollen. ""Wir geben keine Wahlempfehlung fur eine bestimmte Partei ab, empfehlen aber klar, demokratisch zu wahlen  was aus unserer Sicht nicht auf die AfD zutrifft"", sagte der IG Metall-Bezirksleiter fur Baden-Wurttemberg, Roman Zitzelsberger, der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters. ""Ziel des Wahlaufrufs ist es naturlich auch zu verhindern, dass durch Nicht-Wahlen rechtspopulistische Parteien gestarkt werden.""

Die Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft Verdi in Baden-Wurttemberg hatte bereits in der vergangenen Woche zur Wahlteilnahme aufgerufen und vor einer Stimmabgabe fur AfD gewarnt. ""Rechtspopulisten bieten unsolidarische Antworten, raus aus dem Euro, weg mit Gefluchteten, Ausgrenzung statt Integration. Diese Antworten sind falsch"", sagte Leni Breymaier, Verdi-Chefin in Baden-Wurttemberg. ""Diese Positionen haben im Landtag von Baden-Wurttemberg nichts verloren."" Die Beschaftigten sollten am 13. Marz wahlen. ""Milliarden Menschen auf dieser Erde beneiden uns um diese Chance.""

In der Chemie- und Pharmaindustrie in Baden-Wurttemberg haben Gewerkschaften und die Arbeitgeber sogar gemeinsam zur Wahlteilnahme aufgerufen. Das Land brauche effiziente und verlassliche Rahmenbedingungen und nach auen freie und partnerschaftliche Handelsbeziehungen.

NEW DELHI Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government on Tuesday dropped a controversial proposal to tax pension withdrawals, caving in after an outcry by salaried workers threatened to undermine his party's prospects in upcoming state elections.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had proposed in his Feb. 29 budget taxing lump-sum withdrawals exceeding 40 percent of an individual's retirement pot in the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), unless the sum is reinvested in an annuity.

At present, withdrawals from the EPF are tax-free.

The tax proposal sparked a backlash from small but vocal professional class, with some calling it a raid on the retirement savings of honest taxpayers. Only around 36 million of the country's 1.3 billion people contribute to the EPF.

The move also drew flak from opposition parties, forcing the government to change tack ahead of elections in five states in April and May in which Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) eyes gains.

""The policy objective is not to get more revenue but to encourage the people to join the pension scheme,"" Jaitley said in a statement to lawmakers.

The climbdown underscores the challenges for vital but politically-sensitive economic reforms in Asia's third-largest economy. Protests by farmers last year forced Modi to abandon a bill to simplify rules for industrial land sales in India.

Critics of the surprise budget announcement say Modi should instead be looking to widen its revenue base and charge lower income tax rates to put the public finances on a steadier footing, rather than milk existing taxpayers for more revenue.

One aide said that Modi had intervened directly in the matter. ""He felt that this will discourage people from using traditional means of saving,"" the official said.

Country's urban middle class, which mostly supported Modi in the 2014 general election, has shown resentment over a rise in its tax burden.

Apart from imposing a levy to fund Modi's clean India initiative, the government has taxed away half the windfall of a slump in oil prices. This year's budget hiked taxes on cars and aviation fuel, and introduced a new tax surcharge to pay for measures to aid the rural poor.

Segundo a entidade, e a primeira vez em mais de 10 anos que o governo devera determinar reajuste anual de precos do setor acima da inflacao oficial. O reajuste devera ser aplicado a partir de 31 de marco.

""O calculo do governo mostra com clareza que ate a industria farmaceutica, normalmente menos prejudicada por crises economicas, esta sendo atingida pelo momento dificil que o Brasil enfrenta"", disse em comunicado a imprensa o presidente-executivo da Interfarma, Antonio Britto.

""We have an absolutely rock-solid opt-out from these things. There's no prospect of Britain joining a common asylum process in Europe. We'll have our own asylum approach, our own way of doing things, keeping our borders,"" Cameron said on arriving for an EU-Turkey summit aimed at stemming the flow of migrants into Europe.

""Even outside the EU, we would be affected by a migration crisis like this. But at the end of the day we maintain our borders and our own way of doing things because we have the best of both worlds,"" he continued.

Under the EU's current asylum system, known as the Dublin rules and which apply to Britain, individual EU countries must register and process asylum claims on a national basis and that responsibility falls to the first EU state a refugee enters.

A future system could see the European Union centrally overseeing asylum applications -- one of several ways proposed to prevent a repeat of countries like Greece and Italy handling hugely disproportionate numbers.

There are concerns in Britain that a revision to the Dublin rules could deprive Britain of the right to deport asylum-seekers to the state where they entered the EU. The EU executive is due to present proposals for reforms of the system next week.

Teva, the world's biggest generic drugsmaker, will divest some drugs already on the market and others in the pipeline to address competition concerns by the European Commission, the people said. The package includes products from both Teva and Allergan.

Other sources had previously told Reuters that assets worth about $1 billion in the United States, Europe and the Middle East would be sold in order to secure the green light from regulators.

Teva will gain bigger economies of scale, a crucial element in the low-margin generic drugs business, with the deal, the largest in Israel's corporate history.

The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the case on Thursday, and Teva declined to comment.

The deal, which requires U.S. approval, has triggered a warning from the American Antitrust Institute that a more concentrated generic market usually comes with higher prices. The think-tank also said divestments may not be enough to ensure competition in the market in a letter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in January.

Dublin-based Botox-maker Allergan in turn is to be acquired by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) in a $160 billion deal creating the world's largest drugmaker.

Por Alexandre Caverni

SAO PAULO A noticia de que Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pode assumir um ministerio da presidente Dilma Rousseff para garantir foro privilegiado e se ver livre das garras do juiz Sergio Moro e um movimento que pode trazer muito mais prejuizo do que ganhos para o ex-presidente e ainda mais para o atual governo.

Se a entrada de Lula no primeiro escalao pode livra-lo efetivamente de uma suposta pretensao de Moro ve-lo atras das grades, sua consumacao tiraria do ex-presidente o discurso de vitima e indignacao que usou tao bem na semana passada, apos ser levado pela Policia Federal para prestar depoimento sob conducao coercitiva.

Alvo da fase da operacao Lava Jato lancada na ultima sexta-feira, Lula disse ter se sentido ""ofendido"", ""magoado"", ""ultrajado"" e ""prisioneiro"". Disse que teria prestado depoimento voluntariamente caso fosse chamado por Moro, como ja tinha feito antes.

Ao mesmo tempo que se colocou como vitima, tambem estimulou a militancia petista e seus apoiadores, dizendo que a partir daquele momento estava disposto a ""andar este pais"".

""Se tentaram matar a jararaca, nao bateram na cabeca, bateram no rabo, a jararaca ta viva como sempre esteve"", disse Lula, deixando clara a intencao de concorrer novamente a Presidencia.

Depois disso, o ex-presidente teria dito a interlocutores: ""A partir de agora, se me prenderem, eu viro heroi. Se me matarem, viro martir. E, se me deixarem solto, viro presidente de novo.

Virar ministro a essa altura dos acontecimentos jogaria por terra praticamente todo esse discurso. Com o cargo, qualquer investigacao ou acao judicial contra Lula teria que passar pelo Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), tirando de Moro a competencia para o caso.

Ainda que Lula pudesse falar em arbitrariedades e perseguicao da Lava Jato, o movimento seria visto como um sinal claro de desespero e, para seus adversarios e nao so eles, como uma forma de assuncao de culpa.

Se fosse para assumir um ministerio, Lula deveria ter feito isso em agosto do ano passado, quando essa possibilidade veio a tona. Na ocasiao, a justificativa oficial era de que sua entrada formal na administracao Dilma, provavelmente no Ministerio das Relacoes Exteriores, seria uma forma de fortalecer a coordenacao politica do governo.

Nao se escondia mesmo naquele momento que o obvio ganho do foro privilegiado seria de certa forma um embaraco, mas pelo menos a Lava Jato ainda se encontrava relativamente distante de Lula, embora muitos de seus aliados ja dissessem que o alvo real da operacao era o petista.

Agora nao se trata mais de simples discurso petista. A Lava Jato esta efetivamente investigando Lula e ha quem diga que sua conducao coercitiva na ultima semana nao passou de um teste para a forca-tarefa de Curitiba no caso de uma futura prisao do ex-presidente.

Para o Palacio do Planalto, o estrago nao seria menor com Lula ministro. Combalido por uma baixissima popularidade em um cenario de desemprego em alta, inflacao elevada e enfrentando um processo de impeachment contra Dilma, o governo passaria mais uma imagem de desrespeito com a coisa publica ao usar a nomeacao para o ministerio como uma forma de fuga da Justica.

No caso de Lula, o movimento nao seria uma garantia definitiva. Primeiro porque se Dilma sofrer o impeachment, Lula perderia o ministerio.

Mais do que isso, se afinal houver provas mesmo contra o ex-presidente, nao ha por que imaginar que o Supremo deixaria de condena-lo, ainda que num ritmo processual muito mais lento do que o de Moro.",[]

reuters.com,2016-03-08 17:36:53+00:00,The World's Most Innovative Research Institutions,['David Ewalt'],"REUTERS TOP 25

Silicon Valleys hoodie-wearing tech entrepreneurs are the poster kids of innovation. But the innovators who are really changing the world are more likely to wear labcoats and hold government-related jobs in Grenoble, Munich or Tokyo. That's the conclusion of Reuters Top 25 Global Innovators  Government, a list that identifies and ranks the publicly funded institutions doing the most to advance science and technology.

Topping the list is France's Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), for its research into areas including renewable power, public health, and information security. Rounding out the top three: Germanys Fraunhofer Society and Japans Science and Technology Agency.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 25 Compare Institutions | Methodology

On a country-by-country basis, the United States leads the list, with six organizations ranked (France and Japan each have four, and Germany has three). The Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) is the top U.S. finisher, placing fourth.

The rankings were compiled by the Intellectual Property & Science division of Thomson Reuters, which used proprietary data and analysis tools to examine patents and research papers from the past eight years to find the governmental organizations most likely to change the world. A separate ranking of similar data from universities was published last year.

It took a government agency to put a man on the moon, and even in the age of the Internet, governments are still moving science and technology forward. They do pure research that private companies often find it hard to justify and afford, and make discoveries that launch entire industries: publicly funded organizations split the atom, invented the Internet, and mapped the human genome.

There are 16,000 technicians, engineers and researchers in 10 government-run centers throughout France working on the next great innovation. Theyre all a part of CEA, a public research institution specializing in nuclear and renewable energies, defense and security, as well as information and health technologies. Established by General Charles de Gaulle at the end of World War II, the organization represents France in the nuclear sector, promoting safe and responsible use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.

CEA ranks first among government research institutes in part because its researchers apply for and receive significantly more patents than most government organizations - an indication that their research has strong potential for commercial value. Those patents are also frequently cited by outside researchers, showing that CEA has a big impact on R&D efforts at other organizations. CEA receives the majority of its funding from the French government, and works closely with national agencies on projects ranging from building nuclear-powered naval vessels to improving the nation's cybersecurity. But it also has more than 500 industrial partners, and its research has led to the creation of 115 spinoff companies since 2000, including Paris-based biopharmaceutical company Theranexus, which is working on advanced treatments for psychiatric disorders.

The second most innovative institution on the Top 25 Global Innovators  Government list also focuses on developing technology that can help fuel private industry. Germanys Fraunhofer Society is Europe's largest applied research institution, with 24,000 staff members in 67 institutes and research units. Public sector funds account for only about a third of its annual budget; most of the Society's research is funded by contracts with industry.

European institutions account for nine out of 25 ranked institutions, more than any other continent. Asia comes in second with eight institutions, including third-place finisher the Japan Science & Technology Agency, or JST. An independent administrative institution under the government's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, it works primarily with academia, industry and other international research institutions. Three JST scientists won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2014 for inventing efficient blue-light-emitting diodes, which have enabled bright, energy-saving white-light sources.

HHS, the top-ranked government innovator in the U.S., is a cabinet-level department of the federal government tasked with protecting the health of American citizens. Although primarily known as a regulatory and service agency, the department's 11 operating divisions include some of the nation's most active centers of scientific research, including the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration. (Patents filed by these institutions list the name of their parent agency, so for the purposes of this list, Thomson Reuters ranked HHS instead of its subsidiaries.)

Also on the list: The United States Navy and the United States Army. Like HHS, these military service organizations arent best known for science, but they perform a wide range of basic and applied research in pursuit of their mission. More than 60 researchers have won a Nobel Prize for work funded by the Office of Naval Research since it was established in 1946. The United States Army Laboratory, established in 1992, has developed products such as advanced coatings to shield vehicles from chemical warfare, which are now used to protect monuments, sculptures and artworks.

To compile the ranking, the IP & Science division of Thomson Reuters began by identifying more than 500 global organizations - including universities, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions - that published the most articles in academic journals. Then they identified the total number of patents filed by each organization and evaluated each candidate on factors including how many patents it filed, how often those applications were granted, how many patents were filed to global patent offices in addition to local authorities and how often the patents were cited by other patents. Candidates were also evaluated in terms of the number of articles published by researchers in academic journals, how often those papers were cited by patents and how many articles featured a co-author from industry. Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included government-run or funded organizations, and then ranked them based on their performance. Click here for the methodology.

reuters.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,A small hand challenge to Trump,"[""Any Opinions Expressed Here Are The Author's Own"", 'Megan Cassella Is A Journalist At Reuters', 'Megan Cassella']","Donald Trump has taken his defense of his hands out onto the campaign trail. Now a 28-year-old Oregon man has formed a new political action committee solely to get the Republican front-runner to prove it.

Henry Kraemer, who works for a nonprofit in Portland, filed the Trump Has Tiny Hands political action committee with the Federal Elections Commission on Monday, a move he said hopes spurs the front-runner Republican candidate to release his official hand measurements from an official doctor.

We felt it was really important for voters to know everything they can about the dangerous smallness of Mr. Trumps hands before they go into the voting booth, Kraemer said in a phone interview.

Trump was first publicly teased for the size of his hands in the late 1980s, when the now-defunct satirical Spy magazine branded Trump a short-fingered vulgarian. Rival candidate Marco Rubio revived the criticism on the campaign trail last week, implying that Trumps hands were small for his more than six-foot frame.

You know what they say about guys with small hands? Rubio said at a rally last week, and then he paused. You cant trust em, he said.

Trump has since defended himself, saying hes been told he has beautiful hands, but Kraemer and what he says is a core team of about 75 volunteers are working to make sure the issue stays on voters minds.

What good is it to give (Trump) the nuclear launch code if his stubby fingers cant even push the button down all the way?, Kraemer said. Say the White House phone rings at 3 a.m.  will his tiny hands even be able to lift the receiver? These are the important questions.

The group has taken to Facebook and Twitter, where it had a combined nearly 1,500 followers by Tuesday morning, to begin spreading its message and reaching out to Trump and some of his advisers, in the hopes that theyll get a response.

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But at a rally in Michigan last week, in response to Rubios initial jabs, Trump dismissed the criticism as crap.

reuters.com,2015-09-15 21:44:53+00:00,The World's Most Innovative Universities,['Reuters Editorial'],"""Innovation"" is one of the most oft-cited buzzwords in both academia and the business world, but its usage isn't consistent. It can mean that an organization regularly produces new ideas or unique products; that its internal policies and practices are significantly different from the competition; or simply that members are encouraged to think creatively and pursue disruptive ideas.

This might sound like a semantic problem. But the confusion means that innovation is hard to measure - and that can be a huge roadblock to economic and technological development. Since World War II, universities around the world have been relied on to convert public funding into knowledge and products that help drive the global economy. So how can potential partners, investors, faculty and students know if an institution is really transforming science and technology and impacting the global economy?

To answer that question, Reuters set out to find and rank the world's top 100 innovative universities empirically, building a methodology that employs 10 different metrics. The criteria focused on academic papers, which indicate basic research performed at a university, and patent filings, which point to an institution's interest in protecting and commercializing its discoveries. Compiled by the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters, the list uses proprietary data and analysis tools. (For a detailed methodology, click here.)

Leading the Reuters Top 100 is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has earned a reputation as a hotbed for innovation in computer hardware and software: its faculty and alumni have founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Hewlett-Packard, Yahoo and Google. A 2012 study by the university estimated that all the companies formed by Stanford entrepreneurs generate total global revenue of $2.7 trillion annually.

Stanford edged out other tech giants (like second-place finisher Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Ivy League stalwarts (like third-place Harvard University), by scoring consistently well across each of our criteria with especially high marks when it came to impactful research: its articles and patents are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in the academic and corporate worlds.

Related Coverage  Compare Universities: How does Stanford stack up against MIT, Cambridge or KAIST?

Other key findings of the Reuters Top 100 include the strong performance of institutions outside the United States. Half of Reuters Top 100 Innovative Universities are located in Canada, Europe or Asia; Japan is home to nine of the Reuters Top 100 innovative universities - more than any other country except the U.S. South Korea also performs well on the list: the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology, or KAIST, is the only non-U.S. school to place in the top 10.

The most innovative university in Europe, Imperial College London, ranked at No. 11 overall. Founded in 1907, it is relatively young compared with the continent's second and third-place universities, Belgium's KU Leuven (No. 16, founded in 1425) and England's University of Cambridge (No. 25, established in 1209). Elsewhere in Europe, the nation of Switzerland stands out: With three schools on the list and a population of just over 8 million people, it has more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in the world.

Whether they're in the top five or near the end of the list, all 100 universities in this ranking are among the best in the world. Thomson Reuters reviewed hundreds of universities to produce this ranking, and the ones that appear here are the most elite. Absence from this list does not indicate an institution is failing to innovate, however. Since the rankings measure innovation on a universitywide (or in some cases, systemwide) basis, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: A small liberal arts school might rank low for overall innovation, but still operate one of the most innovative computer science departments in the world, for instance.

The Reuters Top 100 World's Most Innovative Universities gets to the essence of what it means to be truly innovative; the institutions recognized here most reliably produce original research, create useful technology, and have the greatest economic impact. They are the surest bets for anyone seeking to invest in and create real innovation.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:54:19+00:00,Nasdaq to buy ISE options exchange from Deutsche Boerse,['John Mccrank'],"The Nasdaq logo is displayed at the Nasdaq Market site in New York September 2, 2015.

Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) said on Wednesday it would buy U.S. options exchange operator International Securities Exchange for $1.1 billion from Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1Gn.DE), the latest deal to emerge from a spate of exchange merger talks.

ISE operates three electronic options exchanges which together account for more than 15 percent of U.S. volume, while Nasdaq operates another three. Combined, Nasdaq would command more than 40 percent of the market, extending its lead as the No. 1 U.S. options exchange operator.

""The ability to further that lead gives us advantages as to how we could serve our customers because you have a different volume versus scale arrangement,"" Nasdaq Chief Executive Bob Greifeld said in an interview.

The deal would also free up capital for Deutsche Boerse, which has said it plans to merge with the London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE.L) to create a European trading powerhouse that could better compete against U.S. rivals.

Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) said it may make a rival bid for the LSE, raising the prospects of a takeover battle.

Nasdaq, which plans to move ISE's trading platforms onto Nasdaq technology, said it could strip out $40 million from the two businesses through the transaction.

The deal would also give Nasdaq an additional 20 percent stake in the Options Clearing Corporation, for a total of 40 percent ownership in the world's largest equity derivatives clearing corporation.

Greifeld said he had been looking to buy ISE for years, and talks with Deutsche Boerse CEO Carsten Kengeter picked up over the past three months.

The deal does not include ISE's stake in No. 2 U.S. stock exchange operator BATS Global Markets, or blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings, which will continue to be owned by Deutsche Boerse, the German company said.

Nasdaq said the transaction was expected to be finalized in the second half of the year, pending regulatory approval, and it would likely increase earnings within 12 months of closing.

Nasdaq has made several acquisitions in recent years that have helped boost its profits and share price. These include Chi-X Canada, that country's largest alternative trading system, in a deal that closed last month; and index provider Dorsey, Wright & Associates last year.

The resolution to amend the state's constitution passed 23-9 after the majority Republican caucus used a parliamentary maneuver to end the filibuster, which began at 4:00 p.m. CST on Monday, said Lauren Hieger, communications director for the Missouri Senate Majority Caucus.

READ MORE: Lead in the water: The corrosive dangers lurking in private wells

The amendment must be voted on again in the Senate next week before passing to the lower house, where Republicans have a majority, and then to the state's voters, Hieger said.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, applauded the effort by the Senate minority to block the resolution. ""Rewriting our state's constitution to condone discrimination would be contrary to our values and harmful to our economy,"" Nixon said in a statement on Wednesday.

The legislation is among a series of measures introduced around the country by conservatives in response to last year's U.S. Supreme Court legalization of same-sex marriage. The measures seek to protect religious groups and companies from being fined or punished if they decline to provide services such as wedding cakes or flowers to same-sex couples.



RECOMMENDED: Republicans sue State Department for Clinton emails

Republicans who backed the amendment said it was about religious freedom, but Democrats said it would enshrine discrimination in the state's constitution.

Given their minority position in both chambers of Missouri's General Assembly, Democrats chose to filibuster, debating overnight on Monday and Tuesday to block the initiative.

""Inspired by senators' heroic stand against discrimination in #MO. The nation is watching & cheering you on!"" Nixon tweeted on Tuesday night.

""In our pluralistic society, we should have room to respect the religious freedom of Missourians,"" Republican Senator Bob Onder, who sponsored the bill, told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday morning. He said the language of the bill was modified in a compromise on Tuesday to narrowly define wedding vendors.

The American Civil Liberties Union civil rights group said it would work to fight the bill in Missouri's House of Representatives.

""This amendment raises serious constitutional concerns because it singles out same-sex couples for discrimination,"" Jeffrey Mittman, executive director of ACLU of Missouri, said in a statement.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:46:41+00:00,Signs of life for Apple's stock as Wall St. eyes new iPhone,['Noel Randewich'],"SAN FRANCISCO After months of declines in Apple's (AAPL.O) stock, sentiment appears to be mending as investors focus on steady earnings expectations and bet that the expected launch of a new iPhone will add badly-needed fuel to sputtering sales.

Battered by nearly a year of off-and-on declines from record highs because of fears of a slowdown in iPhone sales, Apple's stock now is valued closer to IBM, which has disappointed Wall Street for the past four years with declining revenue, than to Silicon Valley technology pioneers Alphabet and Tesla Motors.

Apple shares have increased 5 percent in the past two weeks as Wall Street bets the company this month will launch a less expensive iPhone to boost sales in developing countries like China. With U.S. consumers upgrading their smartphones less often, manufacturers have been relying on China for growth.

Shareholders this week pointed to Apple's reliable cash generation, beaten down valuation and its wild card potential for future game-changing products as key reasons for owning it.

""This company has a history of doing better than expectations and surprising people,"" said Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust Company, which holds over 1 million shares of Apple. ""Where else can I go and find a company trading at 10 or 11 times earnings that has had such a great history?""

At $100.97 a share on Wednesday, Apple is selling at 10.7 times its expected earnings per share over the next 12 months. Its average forward price-earnings-ratio has been 13 over the past two years.

By comparison, Internet behemoth Alphabet (GOOGL.O), whose Android mobile platform competes against Apple's iOS, trades at 20 times expected earnings and 13-year old Tesla Motors (TSLA.O) trades at 132 times earnings. International Business Machines (IBM.N), which is struggling to expand into a high-growth business like cloud computing, has a P/E of 10.2, according to Thomson Reuters data.

""Unless something big happens, (Apple) doesn't deserve to trade at 20 to 25 times earnings anymore. It's just too big,"" said David Meier, a portfolio manager at Motley Fool Funds. ""But as a high-quality company, could it trade at 15 times earnings? Certainly.""

A target of 15 times its next 12 months' expected earnings would put Apple at around $138.

In another hint of improving sentiment, Apple's stock has recently moved above its 50-day moving average for the first time since December.

The stock's selloff in recent months has boosted Apple's dividend yield to 2.2 percent from 1.5 percent a year ago.

Analysts' covering Apple have been little help to investors. Ahead of the stock's 20-percent drop that started in December, 41 analysts recommended buying Apple shares while just one recommended selling, according to Thomson Reuters data. Currently, no analysts recommend selling, while 38 recommend buying.

A new iPhone with a smaller 4-inch screen will likely boost volumes by about 5 percent this year, an increase not yet incorporated into Wall Street's expectations, Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski wrote in a report on Monday.

Apple chip supplier Dialog Semiconductor (DLGS.DE) on Tuesday forecast March-quarter revenue below analysts' expectations, but said it still expects single-digit growth for the year. That suggests the March quarter could mark the low-point in iPhone shipments, with demand for new models building later in the year, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a research note.

Jeffrey Carbone, Senior Partner at Cornerstone Financial Partners, said Apple remains a staple holding at his firm but that he has recently turned his attention to Apple suppliers including Skyworks Solutions (SWKS.O), which he believes is undervalued.

""We have a normal weighting on Apple, we like the company, but we think the supply chain could have greater potential,"" Carbone said.

(The Sports Xchange) - D'Angelo Russell scored 27 points and Jordan Clarkson added 24 points, guiding the Los Angeles Lakers to a 107-98 victory over the Orlando Magic on Tuesday night at Staples Center.

Julius Randle collected 23 points and 11 rebounds for the Lakers (14-51), who won a second consecutive game for only the third time this season. Tuesday's win comes on the heels of a rout Sunday of the Golden State Warriors.

The Magic (27-36), who were coming off a 119-113 loss to the Warriors on Monday night, were led by Victor Oladipo's 26 points. Evan Fournier chipped 23 points for Orlando, which lost its third straight.

Lakers forward Kobe Bryant sat out with a sore right shoulder. It marked the fourth time in the past six games Bryant was out of the lineup and the 14th game he missed this season.

A strained right groin kept Magic center Nikola Vucevic out of for the second game in a row.

Los Angeles turned a seven-point lead entering the fourth quarter into a double-digit advantage and dictated for much of the period. Orlando closed within 97-86 with 5:13 remaining in the contest on a jumper by Oladipo but got no closer until the final moments.

The Magic led 51-45 at halftime before the Lakers took control in the third quarter. Los Angeles grabbed a 79-69 lead after a 3-pointer by Marcelo Huertas with 3:20 left, but the Magic cut the deficit to four on two free throws by C.J. Watson with 2:12 remaining.

However, Los Angeles pushed the margin to 84-77 heading into the fourth quarter. Los Angeles outscored Orlando 39-26 in the third, which tied the highest output in a quarter this season for the Lakers.

The Lakers shot 49.4 percent overall to 48.7 percent for the Magic. Los Angeles made nine of 26 (34.6 percent) from 3-point range, while Orlando made five of 18 (27.8 percent).

Los Angeles had a 56-44 edge on points in the paint and also had a 19-8 advantage in second-chance points. The Lakers outrebounded the Magic 45-35.",[]
reuters.com,2016-03-09 15:08:01+00:00,Many athletes used Sharapova drug meldonium during 2015 European Games: study,['Kate Kelland'],"LONDON The use of meldonium - the banned drug taken by Russian tennis champion Maria Sharapova - was widespread among elite athletes competing at the European Games in Baku last year, according to research in the British Journal of Sports Medicine (BJSM).

The study, based on information volunteered by athletes and individual medical teams, and on laboratory data from doping tests from the Games in Azerbaijan, suggested up to 490 athletes may have been taking the drug during the competition.

The findings showed that during the Baku Games, 13 medallists or competition winners were taking meldonium, 66 athletes tested positive for it, and they said meldonium was detected in athletes competing in 15 of the 21 sports in the competition.

""This study highlights the widespread and inappropriate use and prescribing of this prescription drug in a generally healthy athlete population,"" said the researchers, led by Klaus Steinbach and Christian Schneider of the European Olympic Committees Medical and Anti-Doping Commission.

Some 6,000 athletes took part in the Games, the first major multi-sports event for the continent, with qualification spots on offer for August's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

The BJSM said the research, published online on Wednesday, had been shared with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and had contributed to its decision to ban use of meldonium in competitive sport as of Jan. 1 this year.



RECOMMENDED: Fate of lawsuit brought by Trump model to be decided this month

Sharapova tested positive for meldonium, also known by the brand name Mildronate, in a sample taken on Jan. 26, the day of her Australian Open quarter-final defeat to Serena Williams.

She told a news conference her family doctor had first given her the drug 10 years ago after she frequently became sick, had irregular electrocardiogram results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.

The 28-year-old Russian, a five-time grand slam champion, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation said.

Meldonium is marketed as Mildronate by the Latvian pharmaceutical firm Grindeks (GRD1R.RI), which told Reuters the drug could protect athletes from cell damage, but would be unlikely to improve their competitive performance.

The BJSM study said, however, that ""the drug is evidently being used with the intention to either improve recovery or enhance performance - (and) use of a substance with the intention to improve performance is, by WADA's definition, a violation of the spirit of sport"".

Mildronate is registered for sale in Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union, but does not have a license from either the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the EU's European Medicines Agency.

Steinbach and Schneider said since the samples and data from laboratories were ""blinded"" of all personal and demographic details, they could not say which specific countries the athletes who tested positive for meldonium came from.

Athletes' self-reported declarations of meldonium use suggested there is higher use in countries where the drug is registered and prescribed then in countries where meldonium is not registered for medical use, they said.

They added, however, that ""athletes and healthcare providers from any country where the drug is not officially registered for medical use could easily obtain the drug through medicines importation and exportation routes, and even more easily through online purchases"".

reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:48:09+00:00,Trump rebounds in White House race; Sanders surprises Clinton,['Ginger Gibson'],"MONROE, N.C. Republican leaders opposed to Donald Trump becoming the party's U.S. presidential candidate warned on Wednesday that the billionaire businessman could become unstoppable if he wins two crucial nominating contests next week.

One of Trump's fiercest critics in the Republican Party, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, said that if the billionaire businessman extends his winning streak into crucial contests next week, the New Yorker's path to the nomination was all but inevitable.

""I'm worried that if we lose Florida and Ohio he may be unstoppable,"" said Graham, a former Republican candidate who was among the party's large field of early White House hopefuls.

With victories in nominating contests on Tuesday in three out of four states, Trump maintained his lead over the three remaining challengers in the race to be the Republican candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election.

On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton's surprise loss to Bernie Sanders in the important Michigan primary laid bare growing voter anger over trade, raising warning flags for her ahead of a possible election showdown against Trump.

On Wednesday, the often-combative Trump struck a more conciliatory tone toward the Republican establishment that has fiercely resisted his advance - first by backing favourite candidates who failed to win votes, then by pouring money into campaigns against him.

""If we embrace what is happening and everyone came together, instead of spending all this money on these ads ...,"" Trump told Fox News. ""If everyone came together, no one could beat the Republican Party. We would walk into Washington.""

He also praised U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan after speaking with him by phone this week, calling the Republican leader a ""good man.""

Trump, 69, fended off a week of attacks from the party's establishment and defied predictions his campaign might be losing steam with his primary wins on Tuesday in Michigan, the biggest prize of the night, as well as Mississippi and Hawaii. His closest challenger, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, won Idaho.

Trump's convincing win in Michigan narrowed prospects for the party's anti-Trump forces to stop him before next Tuesday's contests, which also include Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri.

Trump now has 458 of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination, with Cruz second with 359 delegates, according to the Associated Press. Rival Marco Rubio trails with 151 delegates, while John Kasich is far behind with 54.

ENDORSEMENTS: ANY ONE BUT TRUMP

Cruz, with enough primary victories to present himself as a viable Trump alternative, won the endorsement of former Republican rival Carly Fiorina on Wednesday and appealed to anti-Trump Republicans to back him.

""If you don't want to see Donald Trump as the nominee, if you don't want to hand the election on a silver platter to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, then I ask you to join us,"" Cruz said.

Trump, a former reality TV show host, has peppered his campaign with put-downs of rivals and critics. Many mainstream Republicans have been offended by his statements on Muslims, immigrants and women and alarmed by his threats to international trade deals.

But Cruz, 45, is a hard alternative for some of the mainstream Republican leadership to get behind. A fiscal and social conservative, he is unpopular with fellow senators who were targets of his personal attacks and who blame him for orchestrating a government shutdown in 2013 in a failed attempt to derail President Barack Obama's healthcare reforms.

In January, Graham called a choice between Trump and Cruz like ""being shot or poisoned."" But the senator softened his tone on Wednesday, saying it had become increasingly clear that ""Ted Cruz is the most viable alternative to Donald Trump.""

An aide to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who dropped out of the race last month, said Bush would meet with Cruz, fellow Floridian Rubio, and Kasich, governor of Ohio, in Miami before the March 15 contests. It was not clear if he planned to make an endorsement.

Clinton, 68, won in Mississippi, but the victory in Michigan by her opponent from Vermont was expected to prolong the fight to pick a candidate.

Clinton holds a sizable delegate lead, with 1,221 compared with Sanders' 571. She has been helped by winning Southern states by big margins and keeping most of her losses narrow.

Clinton's campaign has been dogged by questions over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and - in a sign the issue will not go away - the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit on Wednesday seeking emails between Clinton and her aides.

Trump could open a sizable delegate lead if he is able to win next Tuesday in Florida, Ohio, or Illinois, states that allot all their delegates to the winner.

Kasich, 63, of Ohio, and Rubio, 44, of Florida, could throw a wrench into Trump's delegate stash if they win in their home states next week.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 13:19:51+00:00,Mumbai women fighting for Right to Pee want men to join campaign,['Rina Chandran'],"A cubicle is seen at the Oxford Circus lavatories as they re-open to the public in London, May 20, 2005.

MUMBAI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Activists and charities campaigning for better access to public toilets for women in Mumbai are asking men to join the movement, saying greater gender sensitivity can solve the problem faster.

The Right to Pee campaign, a collaborative effort of 33 non-profits, is calling attention to the lack of free, clean and safe public toilets for women in Mumbai.

In the city of more than 22 million, only about one-third of the 11,000 or so pay-to-use toilets are for women.

""There is a huge disparity between facilities for men and women, largely due to the gender insensitivity of the authorities,"" said Supriya Sonar, an activist with the Right to Pee campaign. ""Which is why we are telling men who pee in the open: you too don't have adequate facilities, so why don't you join our campaign.""

The lack of adequate sanitation costs India the equivalent of more than 6 percent of its gross domestic product every year, according to non-profit Dasra, an Indian foundation promoting social change.

The issue is particularly important to slum dwellers - more than half Mumbai's population - and to those who work on construction sites and on the streets.

Public toilets for women are often dirty, with broken doors and no running water or lights. Where there are no public toilets, the search for a suitable place comes with the constant threat of sexual harassment or rape.

Women who lack access to clean, safe sanitation tend to drink less water and control their bladders for as many as 13 hours a day. This has significant, long-term effects on their reproductive, sexual and overall health, Dasra said in a report released last week.

In Mumbai, where men can often be seen urinating at street corners and near dumpsters, almost 100 sites have been identified for the construction of toilets for women.

""But nothing has been built, and the funds have lapsed,"" said activist Sonar, who on Monday returned an award the Mayor's office gave to the campaign last year, saying there had been no progress.

""This is about a woman's dignity,"" she said. ""We urge the Mumbai corporation to think about that. And we urge men who pee in the open to also join this campaign to bring more pressure on the authorities.""

The shortage of toilets is a nationwide issue: more than half India's adolescent girls, about 63 million, have no access to a private toilet, according to Dasra.

Girls tend to miss school for an average of six days a month because of the lack of safe toilets there, leading to almost a quarter of them dropping out of education on reaching puberty. This ""sharply degrades their potential as individuals and future workers,"" Dasra said.

The United Nations said in a 2014 report that it was a ""tragic irony"" that there were more mobile phones per 100 people in India than toilets.

In economic terms, the importance of tackling the problem is that there is a return of between $3 and $34 for every dollar spent on sanitation, through reduced poverty and health costs, and higher productivity, the United Nations said.

The ""Clean India Mission"" launched in 2014 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi aimed to improve sanitation and increase funding for public toilets to end open defecation.

A separate $7.5 billion renovation of 20 Indian cities is under way with the aim of making them ""Smart Cities"" by upgrading roads, utilities and sanitation .

reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:28:37+00:00,Pennsylvania gun control advocates challenge law on city gun rules,['Daniel Kelley'],"PHILADELPHIA Pennsylvania gun control advocates on Wednesday asked the state's top court to knock down a 2014 law allowing gun-rights lobbying groups to sue cities that adopt gun restrictions and recoup legal costs if they prevail.

Firearms advocates, including the National Rifle Association, contend the law is necessary to prevent gun owners from becoming ensnared by a patchwork of municipal ordinances that violate their right to bear arms.

Gun control advocates challenged the law on a technicality - that it passed as part of what they called an unrelated piece of legislation.

""These two bills were cobbled together for political expediency at the end of the legislative session,"" Martin Black, representing five Democratic lawmakers who sued to overturn the law, told the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.More than 80 towns across Pennsylvania repealed gun laws - ranging from requirements that owners report lost or stolen firearms to bans on guns in public parks - rather than face hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal bills to defend ordinances that were seldom enforced. Five municipalities, including Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, have faced lawsuits under the law.

The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the right to bear arms, and efforts to regulate gun ownership are often fiercely contested.

Wednesday's arguments focused on the tortured legislative history of the bill and whether its passage violated a provision of the state's Constitution that specifies that laws must focus on a single issue.

A lower court found last June that the passage was unconstitutional because Republican lawmakers tucked the firearms legislation into a bill dealing with scrap metal.

That bill passed on the final day of the 2014 legislative session and was so rushed that Republican Governor Tom Corbett signed the wrong bill.

Republican legislators said at the time that the language was necessary because towns were ignoring laws that made it a criminal offense for towns to pass gun restrictions.

""What does suing the city over a firearms matter have to do with the theft of copper wire?"" asked a skeptical Justice David Wecht.

Attorney Nick Orloff, arguing on behalf of Republican legislators, said both bills dealt with crime prevention.

""It's meant to deter crime,"" Orloff said.

But Shira Goodman, executive director of CeaseFire PA, scoffed at that idea.

""Say the city of Philadelphia passes a soda tax,"" Goodman said. ""If I don't drink soda, I don't get to sue because I didn't pay the tax.""

reuters.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,1.3 million euros a minute,"['Economics Editor For Reuters Based In London', ""Any Opinions Expressed Here Are The Author's Own"", 'Mark John', 'European Politics']","A year ago today, the European Central Bank began its programme of quantitative easing  money printing to buy assets  with a view to lifting sub-zero inflation back up towards the target of just under 2 percent. One year on, it has spent over 700 billion euros buying assets  mainly sovereign bonds, but also debt issued by some European institutions, as well as asset-backed securities (ABS) and covered bonds  at a pace of 1.3 million euros a minute.

As shown in this graphic, it has failed to bring euro zone inflation (now at -0.2 percent) anywhere near the target rate as a host of external factors from the slump in the price of oil to the Chinese slowdown exert bigger influence. Similar experiments around the world have also fallen short of the mark, prompting much hand-wringing about whether central bankers are still the safekeepers of the global economy that some had once thought they were. Its against this backdrop that ECB President Mario Draghi will step up for the Banks latest rate-setting meeting tomorrow. Expectations are firmly for more stimulus; less sure is whether it will make much of a difference.

The bill is intended to make it easier for employers to shed workers and negotiate everything from maximum working hours to holidays and pay on rest breaks. It has already sown dissent in his ruling Socialist party and sparked talk that Hollande will throw in the towel for re-election next year. Today is a key day with youth groups and unions planning a demo and a rail strike.

Today marks the official start of what could be a very brief Portuguese co-habitation, with the centre-rightist Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa being inaugurated as president alongside a shaky Socialist-led coalition propped up by far-left allies. The new government has set about reversing the austerity-based reforms of the previous conservative incumbent, but is also seeing investment start to fall and past declines in joblessness peter out. The point is that Rebelo de Sousa will from April have powers to sack the government and call new elections: his inaugural speech today will be watched closely for clues as to how keen he is to do that.",[]

NEW DELHI Liquor baron Vijay Mallya, under pressure from banks to repay more than $1 billion of debt owed by his collapsed airline, left the country last week, a lawyer for the lenders told the Supreme Court.

More than a dozen state-run banks - led by the country's largest, State Bank of India, - had appealed to the Supreme Court asking that Mallya be stopped from leaving as they step up pressure on the one-time billionaire.

On Wednesday, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, representing the banks, told the Supreme Court he had been told by police that Mallya left India on March 2, and asked the court to demand his return. Mallya's exact whereabouts are not known.

The court has asked Mallya to reply to a notice issued to him within two weeks, after which it will hear the case again. Details of the notice were not made public.

Mallya, an extravagant, larger-than-life personality who billed himself as the ""King of Good Times"", has become one of India's most famous errant borrowers, with newspapers closely following the fortunes of his yacht, jet and properties.

The debt at the heart of his troubles is owed by his Kingfisher Airlines, but was personally guaranteed by Mallya.

A spokesman for Mallya's UB Group did not respond to calls and email seeking comment.

In a statement on Sunday, Mallya said he had no intention of running away from creditors and was in talks with them for a one-time settlement of the Kingfisher debt.

Mallya was last month ousted as the chairman of top Indian spirits maker United Spirits, a unit of British spirits giant Diageo Plc.

A separate tribunal on Monday temporarily blocked a $75 million settlement Mallya is due to receive from Diageo.

Kingfisher, once India's second-biggest airline, collapsed in 2013, leaving creditors, suppliers and employees unpaid. The airline owed banks 69.63 billion rupees ($1.03 billion) as of the end of January 2014.

Including interest and other expenses, its liability is about 90 billion rupees ($1.34 billion), Rohatgi told the Supreme Court.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 14:11:38+00:00,Markets betting on near-zero interest rates for another decade,['Jamie Mcgeever'],"Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) March 4, 2016.

LONDON World markets may have recovered their poise from a torrid start to the year, but their outlook for global growth and inflation is now so bleak they are betting on developed world interest rates remaining near zero for up to another decade.

Even though the U.S. Federal Reserve has already started what it expects will be a series of interest rate rises, markets appear to have bought into a ""secular stagnation"" thesis floated by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.

The idea posits that the world is entering a peculiarly prolonged period in which structurally low inflation and wage growth - hampered by ageing populations and slowing productivity growth - means the inflation-adjusted interest rate needed to stimulate economic demand may be far below zero.

As there's likely a lower limit to nominal interest rates just below zero - because it's cheaper to hold physical cash and bank profitability starts to ebb - then even these zero rates do not gain traction on demand.

For all the debate about the accuracy of that view, it's already playing out in world markets, with long-term projections from the interest rate swaps market showing developed world interest rates stuck near zero for several years.

Take overnight interest rate swaps. They imply European Central Bank policy rates won't get back above 0.5 percent for around 13 years and aren't even expected to be much above 1 percent for at least 60 years.

Japan's main interest rate won't reach 0.5 percent for at least 30 years, they suggest, and even U.S. and UK rates are set to remain low for years. It will be six years before U.S. rates return to 1 percent, and a decade until UK rates reach that level.

""Although interest rates are low, they're not accommodative,"" said Harvinder Sian, global rates strategist at Citi in London. ""The era of zero rates will be with us for years and years, it wouldn't surprise me if we're looking at another five to 10 years.""

The five countries or economic blocs currently with negative deposit rates have yields below zero on all their bonds from a minimum of five years' maturity (Denmark) to a maximum of 20 years (Switzerland). ( tmsnrt.rs/1YvXLBq)

FAR FETCHED?

While some claim market pricing is far-fetched, similar doubts were expressed about zero interest rate policy and quantitative easing as the 2007/2008 crisis broke. Yet both are still being used and 46 central banks have eased policy since the start of last year, nine of whom have rates below 1 percent.

The ECB and Bank of Japan have already adopted negative interest rates on bank deposits, and are expected to loosen policy further via a mix of deeper negative rates and more asset-buying QE.

If the central banks guarding two of the four main world reserve currencies are easing, the exchange rate impact will tend to strengthen the other two, dragging on exports limit any interest rate rises there.

Japan's prolonged fight to escape deflation is instructive. As the economy reeled from the collapse of the stock and housing markets, the Bank of Japan entered zero-interest rate territory in 1995 when it cut rates to a then record low of 0.5 percent.

More than two decades on, they've never been higher than that, despite near full employment and the largest debt burden in the world.

""Today's risks of embedded low inflation tilting towards deflation ... are at least as serious as the inflation problem of the 1970s. They too will require shifts in policy paradigms if they are to be resolved,"" Summers wrote last week.

For many, Japan shows that huge monetary stimulus from the central bank doesn't always lift inflation or inflation expectations, consumer or business demand, and ultimately overall growth - what's known as the ""liquidity trap"".

Joseph Gagnon, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington and former Federal Reserve Board economist, warns against comparing every country to Japan.

Core inflation and employment in the United States are close to the Fed's targets, and even in Japan the latest round of QE looks finally be bearing fruit in consumer prices, Gagnon said.

Still, he says there was little for policy complacency.

""Unless Japan and the euro area ease policy much more aggressively, they will likely be stuck with zero or negative interest rates for years,"" Gagnon said.

That would be Tuesday, Mar. 15, when four crucial states  Florida, Ohio, Illinois and Missouri  will hold primaries. Its also the first day when Republican rules allow states, if they choose, to hold winner-take-all contests. Florida, with 99 delegates, and Ohio, with 66, are doing just that. Whoever comes in first wins the whole pot.

Both states have a favorite son in the presidential race  Senator Marco Rubio in Florida and Governor John Kasich in Ohio. But the Republican frontrunner Donald Trump leads the polls in Florida and is closely competitive in Ohio. If Rubio and Kasich lose their home states, they would be finished.

Anti-Trump Republicans are investing heavily to stop Trump. Three different political action committees are expected to spend more than $10 million on anti-Trump ads in Florida.

Trumps response: Go ahead, punks. Make my day. Trumps spokesman called it another desperate attempt by the out-of-touch establishment elites and dark money that control the weak politicians to maintain control of our broken and corrupt system.

For decades, two armies have been at war over the Republican Party. The struggle goes all the way back to 1976, when Ronald Reagan challenged President Gerald Ford and nearly beat the incumbent for his own partys nomination. It has always been the mainstream Republican establishment (Washington and Wall Street) versus the conservative counter-establishment.

The mainstream establishment is pinning its hopes on Rubio. But he seems to be sinking fast. Conservatives are rallying behind Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). Cruz, the Tea Party favorite, won the straw poll at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference. Trump, meanwhile, is leading both of them.

Cruz may be able to hold on for a while. Hes winning low-turnout Republican caucuses, as he did on Saturday in Kansas and Maine. A choice that comes down to Cruz and Trump would leave mainstream Republicans in despair: The old enemy (Cruz and the Tea Party) versus the new enemy (Trump).

We are witnessing history, former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan wrote in her the Wall Street Journal column. Something important is ending.

An army of outsiders is trying to take over the Republican Party. Its cause is anti-establishment populism. The Republican army is supposed to be fueled by hatred of President Barack Obama. But Trumps army is driven by another hatred that appears to be just as intense: hatred of the Republican Party establishment that has failed to stop Obama.

Trumps signature attitude is defiance. His supporters see voting for him as a way to defy the Republican Party establishment. I want to see Trump go up there and do damage to the Republican Party, one Mississippi voter told the New York Times. An Arizona voter said, Were going to use Donald Trump to either take over the GOP or blow it up.

Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, embodies everything Trump voters hate about the Republican establishment. Romney doesnt have a populist bone in his body. Worse, he let Obama beat him in 2012. There was Romney last week, warning Republicans that Trump is a fraud and a phony.

Romney went so far as to insinuate that Trump is an extremist. This is the very brand of anger, he said, that has led other nations into the abyss. Germany for example?

Trump is not an ideologue. And hes not a professional politician. Hes a businessman. His supporters believe government should be run like a business.

Its a deeply held American belief that politics is the enemy of problem-solving. Why cant we deal with the national debt? Too much politics. Why cant we deal with climate change? Politics. Trump, like businessman Ross Perot before him, promises to keep politics out of government and just get things done. Everybody knows theres no politics in business, right?

But theres a reason government cant be run like a business. Business is not a democracy. If business were a democracy, it would look like government: less efficient, more political. Thats why Trump has a taint of undemocratic extremism. He wants to run government like a business. With himself as boss.

The last hope of the anti-Trump forces is to prevent Trump from going to the Republican National Convention in July with the number of delegates needed to nominate him. If Trump doesnt win a on the first ballot, we could see a brokered convention. Then maybe the anti-Trump forces could rally behind another candidate.

Theyre deluding themselves. Suppose Trump goes to the convention with the largest primary vote and the largest number of delegates, even if its not a majority. Does anyone believe Trump would stand by and watch the party nominate a candidate who did worse than he did? Or a candidate who didnt even run in the primaries?

The Trump army would protest that the party establishment is rigging the game and rejecting the peoples choice. That way lies pandemonium. Trump supporters would disrupt the convention and possibly walk out. It would be Chicago 1968 all over again.

Some anti-Trump Republicans are talking about splitting the party and running another GOP candidate in November if Trump becomes the party nominee. Wouldnt that be suicidal? Wouldnt it ensure the election of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, now the likely nominee?

Of course it would. But anti-Trump Republicans may be making a longer-run calculation. If Trump became president, he would destroy the Republican Party. If Clinton became president, she would unite the Republican Party  against her.

And the party would live to fight another day.",[]

Republican leaders opposed to Donald Trump becoming the party's U.S. presidential candidate warned on Wednesday that the billionaire businessman could become unstoppable if he wins two crucial nominating contests next week.

One of Trump's fiercest critics in the Republican Party, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, said that if the billionaire businessman extends his winning streak into crucial contests next week, the New Yorker's path to the nomination was all but inevitable.

""I'm worried that if we lose Florida and Ohio he may be unstoppable,"" said Graham, a former Republican candidate who was among the party's large field of early White House hopefuls.

With victories in nominating contests on Tuesday in three out of four states, Trump maintained his lead over the three remaining challengers in the race to be the Republican candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election.

On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton's surprise loss to Bernie Sanders in the important Michigan primary laid bare growing voter anger over trade, raising warning flags for her ahead of a possible election showdown against Trump.

On Wednesday, the often-combative Trump struck a more conciliatory tone toward the Republican establishment that has fiercely resisted his advance - first by backing favourite candidates who failed to win votes, then by pouring money into campaigns against him.

""If we embrace what is happening and everyone came together, instead of spending all this money on these ads ...,"" Trump told Fox News. ""If everyone came together, no one could beat the Republican Party. We would walk into Washington.""

He also praised U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan after speaking with him by phone this week, calling the Republican leader a ""good man.""

Trump, 69, fended off a week of attacks from the party's establishment and defied predictions his campaign might be losing steam with his primary wins on Tuesday in Michigan, the biggest prize of the night, as well as Mississippi and Hawaii. His closest challenger, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, won Idaho.

Trump's convincing win in Michigan narrowed prospects for the party's anti-Trump forces to stop him before next Tuesday's contests, which also include Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri.

Trump now has 458 of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination, with Cruz second with 359 delegates, according to the Associated Press. Rival Marco Rubio trails with 151 delegates, while John Kasich is far behind with 54.

ENDORSEMENTS: ANY ONE BUT TRUMP

Cruz, with enough primary victories to present himself as a viable Trump alternative, won the endorsement of former Republican rival Carly Fiorina on Wednesday and appealed to anti-Trump Republicans to back him.

""If you don't want to see Donald Trump as the nominee, if you don't want to hand the election on a silver platter to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, then I ask you to join us,"" Cruz said.

Trump, a former reality TV show host, has peppered his campaign with put-downs of rivals and critics. Many mainstream Republicans have been offended by his statements on Muslims, immigrants and women and alarmed by his threats to international trade deals.

But Cruz, 45, is a hard alternative for some of the mainstream Republican leadership to get behind. A fiscal and social conservative, he is unpopular with fellow senators who were targets of his personal attacks and who blame him for orchestrating a government shutdown in 2013 in a failed attempt to derail President Barack Obama's healthcare reforms.

In January, Graham called a choice between Trump and Cruz like ""being shot or poisoned."" But the senator softened his tone on Wednesday, saying it had become increasingly clear that ""Ted Cruz is the most viable alternative to Donald Trump.""

An aide to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who dropped out of the race last month, said Bush would meet with Cruz, fellow Floridian Rubio, and Kasich, governor of Ohio, in Miami before the March 15 contests. It was not clear if he planned to make an endorsement.

Clinton, 68, won in Mississippi, but the victory in Michigan by her opponent from Vermont was expected to prolong the fight to pick a candidate.

Clinton holds a sizable delegate lead, with 1,221 compared with Sanders' 571. She has been helped by winning Southern states by big margins and keeping most of her losses narrow.

Clinton's campaign has been dogged by questions over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and - in a sign the issue will not go away - the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit on Wednesday seeking emails between Clinton and her aides.

Trump could open a sizable delegate lead if he is able to win next Tuesday in Florida, Ohio, or Illinois, states that allot all their delegates to the winner.

Kasich, 63, of Ohio, and Rubio, 44, of Florida, could throw a wrench into Trump's delegate stash if they win in their home states next week.

His brother, Charlie (Rod Steiger), lieutenant to a powerful mobster, has ruined Terrys promising boxing career  instructing him to throw a crucial bout so the mob could bet on his opponent. It proved to be the end of Terrys hopes. Near tears, Terry confronts his brother: I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am.

Its a speech Donald Trump will not have to utter. Those who are nominally his mob  that apparently powerless entity called the Republican establishment  tried to get him to throw the bout. He hasnt. And it now seems too late to get him out of the ring. Super Tuesdays results, in which Trump won seven of 11 states, mean he is a contender. Certainly no bum. Class, though, is more debatable.

Trump achieved this through bile, prejudice, insults and money. That was Act I. Act II has followed hard on its heels: No interval. It opened with his news conference in Palm Beach, Florida, as the Super Tuesday results rolled in. Like Benedick in Shakespeares Much Ado about Nothing, who has railed to all who would listen against the entanglements of desire for women, hes suddenly ready for love of Beatrice.

Trump is ready now for love of all. Hes a reacher-out, a generous foe, a unifier. Hes not a bum at all: How could we have thought so?

If a substantial number of Americans view this with trepidation, it cannot match the horror of Europeans. I can think of no major news organization that expresses anything but fear of a Trump presidency. If Democrat Hillary Clinton falters, or the blitz against her that Trump has promised works (shes the one great heretic in his unification church), Europeans and others, who still depend on the United States for stability, protection and a basic shared morality in world affairs, will likely be even more fearful than they are already.

The view has been much rehearsed in the primary season that Trumps mastery of reality TV, his showmanship, his Youre fired! ease of dealing with any and all problems have endeared him to millions determined to see politicians as a lost, even a malign cause. The entertainment-ization of politics has proved overwhelming and pulled the most serious of politicians onto the vaudeville stage.

Look, for an illustration, at a roast of Trump, broadcast by Comedy Central in 2011. It was a dinner devoted to comic insults  harsh, libelous and hilarious  of Trump. The comedian and actor Seth McFarlane issued a stream of putdowns of Trumps monstrous ego  the funniest claimed that, even when having sex with a beautiful woman, Trump was fantasizing about himself. Trump had volunteered for the roasting and, sitting a few feet from MacFarlane, maintained a look of amusement.

In his 1987 autobiography The Art of the Deal  now a necessary read  Trump wrote, Good publicity is preferable to bad, but from a bottom-line perspective, bad publicity is sometimes better than no publicity at all. Controversy, in short, sells.

One reason Trump accepted to be roasted was that he was considering running for president in 2012. He didnt. But that was just a postponement.

In March 2014, President Barack Obama, perhaps following the same thinking, appeared on the popular web program Between Two Ferns. Host Zach Galifianakis conducted a mocking interview. He asked Obama, for example, how he would feel when he left the presidency and people wouldnt let him win at basketball any more. Galifianakis made an elaborate display of boredom when the president spoke about the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. (Is this what they mean by drones?) Both Fox News on the right and Stephen Colbert on the left accused Obama of demeaning the presidency. Meanwhile, the program has gotten (to date) 13.5 million views on YouTube. This is what matters to the White House communications people.

Trump knew  and the White House learned  that ritual, high-profile disrespect can work to the advantage of the disrespected. It shows they can take a joke, and so are rounded people. In a way, its a tribute to their status. It makes them look cool, especially to the young.

Norman Mailer, in his 1963 book The Presidential Papers, wrote, Politics is arithmetic, but politics is also rhetoric, passion and an occasional idea to fire the imagination of millions. He expressed despair that then-President John F. Kennedy (not the least charismatic of the occupiers of the Oval Office, one would think), was too wedded to arithmetic. Mailer was probably not thinking about someone like Trump. (He would be thinking, as ever, more about himself.) But Trump is the one who fits his bill.

Trump has expressed passion  or at least convincingly acted passionately  about a number of ideas: deporting what he calls criminal, rape-inclined Mexicans; temporarily barring Muslims from entering the United States; repealing Obamacare and bringing in something much better.

In The Art of the Deal, he writes, I play to peoples fantasies ... a very effective form of promotion.

This is why he appeals to people. He is where he is because people vote for him  sometimes tongue in cheek, but often because it seems that his aggression, desire to be the best and wealth will be at their service. Trump isnt a politician, has no experience in elected office and enjoys the support of President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Yay! Hes not one of them.

As one Trump supporter, Ken Magno of Everett, Massachusetts, said: This isnt about whether hes going to do a better job or not. More or less, its the statement: Listen, were sick and tired of what you people do. And were going to put somebody in there  now that its our choice, were going to put somebody in there that basically you dont like.

A sizable part of America, many millions strong, is putting the finger up to the political class  right and left. They are responding to what Mailer thought he was calling for  passion, rhetoric, new ideas, firing the imagination of millions.

Having done all that, the nomination is Trumps to lose. Its more and more likely that hell be in a face-off with a woman who can do the arithmetic but finds showmanship far harder.",[]

MOGADISHU Islamist group al Shabaab said it fought off an attack on one of its bases in southern Somalia early on Wednesday that was launched by foreign commandos who flew in on two helicopters, leaving one al Shabaab fighter dead in the gun battle.

Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaabs military operations spokesman, did not identify the nationality of the troops who launched the assault at about 1 a.m. in the Awdigle district of Lower Shabelle area, about 50 km (30 miles) south of Mogadishu.

Several foreign nations have been supporting the Somali government's efforts to combat al Shabaab's insurgency.

The AMISOM peacekeeping force is made up of troops from several African nations which has been fighting alongside the Somali army. An AMISOM spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.

U.S. officials said in 2014 that U.S. military advisers had secretly operated in Somalia since around 2007. They also said at that time that Washington planned to deepen its security assistance to help Somalia fend off the Islamist threat.

Washington said it launched air strikes on another al Shabaab base on Saturday killing more than 150 Islamist fighters. Al Shabaab said the number was exaggerated.

It was not immediately possible to obtain any U.S. comment.

Al Shabaab's military operations spokesman told Reuters the two helicopters landed on the banks of the River Shabelle and commandos from the aircraft advanced on the base.

""They were masked and spoke foreign languages which our fighters could not understand,"" Abu Musab told Reuters. ""We do not know who they were but we foiled them.""

He said the commandos carried rocket launchers and M16 rifles - referring to a weapon used by U.S. forces although Abu Musab did not mention any nationality.

Residents in the area confirmed there had been a gun battle and said they saw helicopters in the area. They said the mobile phone network did not work during fighting.

""We were awoken by exchange of heavy guns,"" said resident Ahmed Farah speaking by phone later on Wednesday. ""We could see the helicopters land and fly.""

He said al Shabaab later sealed the area so it was not possible to know if there were any casualties.

Al Shabaab, which wants to topple the Western-backed Somali government, has launched a spate of bombings in Mogadishu and elsewhere in the past two weeks, killing dozens of people. A car bomb killed at least three police officers on Wednesday.

Although the Queen of England is featured predominantly on Canada's currency, the new note will showcase a Canadian - either by birth or naturalization - who has shown leadership or achievement in the service of the country.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau in making the announcement noted that, with the exception of the queen, women have ""largely been unrepresented"" on Canada's bank notes.

Celine Dion need not apply - to the chagrin of at least one Twitter commentator - because candidates also must have been deceased for at least 25 years.

Nominations submitted to the Bank of Canada will be reviewed by an independent advisory council made up of academics and other experts that will draw up a short list to be submitted to the finance minister. The new note will be issued in 2018.

Following the announcement, which coincided with International Women's Day, the Bank of Canada tweeted that the first name submitted was Canadian suffragist Nellie McClung, who died in 1951.

The Bank of Canada did not specify which bank note would feature the iconic woman.

The move follows in the footsteps of the United States, which last year announced it would feature the face of a woman on a redesigned $10 bill to be unveiled in 2020.

Shares of Chipotle fell as much as 6.1 percent before easing, down 3.5 percent to $506.12 in afternoon trading.

The closure of the Chipotle in Billerica, Massachusetts, was seen as a test of a new food safety system rolled out after a series of illnesses hit the fresh burrito chain last year.

""They did the right thing,"" said Howard Penney, who covers the chain for Hedgeye Risk Management. However, he argued that Chipotle was still a ""broken company"" and that it would take years to return to its peak performance.

One employee was confirmed ill with norovirus and two more are suspected to have the virus, the top health official of the town of Billerica said.

The cleaned restaurant was scheduled to reopen on Thursday, Billerica Public Health Director Richard Berube told reporters, adding that the employees suspected of having the virus did not come to work on Wednesday.

""They called in sick so that was very fortunate,"" he said outside the closed restaurant.

Berube, the company and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health all said no customers were known to be sick.

Chipotle is trying to repair its reputation after a series of food-safety incidents. Those include two E.coli outbreaks linked to its restaurants that sickened more than 50 people in 10 states, as well as separate outbreaks of norovirus, a highly contagious virus known as the ""winter vomiting bug"", in Massachusetts and California that involved more than 350 diners.

Berube said Chipotle has been ""very proactive."" Remaining staff at the burrito restaurant would be screened for norovirus, he added.

Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold said the company closed the restaurant after four employees called in sick. Berube said three employees were sick or suspected of being sick.

The restaurant closure comes as Chipotle has tried to lure back diners with coupons for a free burrito and other food.

Chipotle sales have fallen sharply since the E.coli outbreaks came to light late last year. The stock traded above $750 last summer.

Sales at established Chipotle restaurants tumbled 14.6 percent in the fourth quarter, including a drop of 30 percent in the month of December.

""The publicity around this news announcement will be another negative data-point that may affect consumer demand,"" CRT Capital analyst Lynne Collier said in a client note.

Chipotle temporarily closed all of its U.S. restaurants on Feb. 8 during prime lunch hours to hold staff meetings on food safety.

Up to Tuesday's close of $524.69, the company's stock had fallen about 18 percent since the first E.coli outbreak was reported on Oct. 31.

Teva, the world's biggest generic drugsmaker, will divest some drugs already on the market and others in the pipeline to address competition concerns by the European Commission, the people said. The package includes products from both Teva and Allergan.

Other sources had previously told Reuters that assets worth about $1 billion in the United States, Europe and the Middle East would be sold in order to secure the green light from regulators.

Teva will gain bigger economies of scale, a crucial element in the low-margin generic drugs business, with the deal, the largest in Israel's corporate history.

The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the case on Thursday, and Teva declined to comment.

The deal, which requires U.S. approval, has triggered a warning from the American Antitrust Institute that a more concentrated generic market usually comes with higher prices. The think-tank also said divestments may not be enough to ensure competition in the market in a letter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in January.

The San Antonio, Texas-based company has been battling with creditors, a group made up mostly of hedge funds, after it moved Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc shares to another subsidiary, Broader Media LLC.

iHeart this week received a default notice from the creditors, arguing the transfer is technically a default, and saying they could call their debt due in 60 days - a sum more than $6 billion - according to a lawsuit iHeart filed in State District Court in Bexar County, Texas.

The lawsuit also claims that the creditors' actions threaten to force the company into bankruptcy.

The restraining order iHeart won expires in 14 days, but the court may extend it, according to a public filing from the company. The order also stops the creditors from issuing additional notices of default.

iHeart said in a prepared statement that it was pleased with the outcome and looks forward to a favorable ruling.

The share move could be used to help the company, struggling with a $21 billion debt load, to find other financing opportunities, Moody's Investors Service said in a research note.

Silicon Valleys hoodie-wearing tech entrepreneurs are the poster kids of innovation. But the innovators who are really changing the world are more likely to wear labcoats and hold government-related jobs in Grenoble, Munich or Tokyo. That's the conclusion of Reuters Top 25 Global Innovators  Government, a list that identifies and ranks the publicly funded institutions doing the most to advance science and technology.

Topping the list is France's Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), for its research into areas including renewable power, public health, and information security. Rounding out the top three: Germanys Fraunhofer Society and Japans Science and Technology Agency.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 25 Compare Institutions | Methodology

On a country-by-country basis, the United States leads the list, with six organizations ranked (France and Japan each have four, and Germany has three). The Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) is the top U.S. finisher, placing fourth.

The rankings were compiled by the Intellectual Property & Science division of Thomson Reuters, which used proprietary data and analysis tools to examine patents and research papers from the past eight years to find the governmental organizations most likely to change the world. A separate ranking of similar data from universities was published last year.

It took a government agency to put a man on the moon, and even in the age of the Internet, governments are still moving science and technology forward. They do pure research that private companies often find it hard to justify and afford, and make discoveries that launch entire industries: publicly funded organizations split the atom, invented the Internet, and mapped the human genome.

There are 16,000 technicians, engineers and researchers in 10 government-run centers throughout France working on the next great innovation. Theyre all a part of CEA, a public research institution specializing in nuclear and renewable energies, defense and security, as well as information and health technologies. Established by General Charles de Gaulle at the end of World War II, the organization represents France in the nuclear sector, promoting safe and responsible use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.

CEA ranks first among government research institutes in part because its researchers apply for and receive significantly more patents than most government organizations - an indication that their research has strong potential for commercial value. Those patents are also frequently cited by outside researchers, showing that CEA has a big impact on R&D efforts at other organizations. CEA receives the majority of its funding from the French government, and works closely with national agencies on projects ranging from building nuclear-powered naval vessels to improving the nation's cybersecurity. But it also has more than 500 industrial partners, and its research has led to the creation of 115 spinoff companies since 2000, including Paris-based biopharmaceutical company Theranexus, which is working on advanced treatments for psychiatric disorders.

The second most innovative institution on the Top 25 Global Innovators  Government list also focuses on developing technology that can help fuel private industry. Germanys Fraunhofer Society is Europe's largest applied research institution, with 24,000 staff members in 67 institutes and research units. Public sector funds account for only about a third of its annual budget; most of the Society's research is funded by contracts with industry.

European institutions account for nine out of 25 ranked institutions, more than any other continent. Asia comes in second with eight institutions, including third-place finisher the Japan Science & Technology Agency, or JST. An independent administrative institution under the government's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, it works primarily with academia, industry and other international research institutions. Three JST scientists won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2014 for inventing efficient blue-light-emitting diodes, which have enabled bright, energy-saving white-light sources.

HHS, the top-ranked government innovator in the U.S., is a cabinet-level department of the federal government tasked with protecting the health of American citizens. Although primarily known as a regulatory and service agency, the department's 11 operating divisions include some of the nation's most active centers of scientific research, including the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration. (Patents filed by these institutions list the name of their parent agency, so for the purposes of this list, Thomson Reuters ranked HHS instead of its subsidiaries.)

Also on the list: The United States Navy and the United States Army. Like HHS, these military service organizations arent best known for science, but they perform a wide range of basic and applied research in pursuit of their mission. More than 60 researchers have won a Nobel Prize for work funded by the Office of Naval Research since it was established in 1946. The United States Army Laboratory, established in 1992, has developed products such as advanced coatings to shield vehicles from chemical warfare, which are now used to protect monuments, sculptures and artworks.

To compile the ranking, the IP & Science division of Thomson Reuters began by identifying more than 500 global organizations - including universities, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions - that published the most articles in academic journals. Then they identified the total number of patents filed by each organization and evaluated each candidate on factors including how many patents it filed, how often those applications were granted, how many patents were filed to global patent offices in addition to local authorities and how often the patents were cited by other patents. Candidates were also evaluated in terms of the number of articles published by researchers in academic journals, how often those papers were cited by patents and how many articles featured a co-author from industry. Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included government-run or funded organizations, and then ranked them based on their performance. Click here for the methodology.

The coalition denounced Amadou's detention and justified its decision to withdraw by saying the constitutional court had not followed procedure when it announced definitive first-round results on Tuesday and had also not proven its independence.

The coalition, which unites about 20 political parties including Amadou's MODEN, also asked its deputies to cease activities at the National Assembly.

Issoufou fell just short of outright victory in the first round on Feb. 21 and was expected to win the run-off as several smaller parties have said they will support him.

He campaigned on a promise to clamp down on Islamist militants and revive the economy in Niger, one of the world's poorest countries.

The Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which is based in Nigeria, has staged a series of cross-border attacks in Niger's southeastern Diffa region, forcing the government to impose a state of emergency there.

Niger produces uranium and oil but is ranked last in the United Nations' Human Development Index and has one of the world's highest fertility rates.

It ranks 114th out of 142 countries in the 2015 prosperity index run by the British-based Legatum Institute.

MONTREAL Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) Chief Executive Officer Hunter Harrison on Wednesday said CSX Corp (CSX.O) has several strengths as a merger target, but stressed that he never made a formal offer for the U.S. railroad.

CP, which launched a $28 billion bid in November to merge with U.S. railroad Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N), could make an equal case for CSX, Harrison told the J.P. Morgan Aviation, Transportation & Industrials Conference in New York.

""They would both work for us.""

Harrison acknowledged that CP had made mistakes in its bid for Norfolk Southern, which the railroad's board of directors has repeatedly rejected.

""One of the things that I'm wrestling with is clearly we made some mistakes along the way,"" he said, without identifying any specific errors.

CP has filed a shareholder proposal for Norfolk Southern's annual general meeting that calls for talks to be held between the two railroads. A date for the meeting has not been announced, although previous ones have been held in May.

""Presently this is kind of our last effort, the last thing we know to do and we hope it will work,"" Harrison said. ""If not we're going to go back and run our railroad.""

Earlier this month, CP said it was looking at all legal options in response to what it described as concerted efforts by certain U.S. railroads to block the proposed merger.

As a potential merger target, CSX, like Norfolk Southern, has a lot of strengths from a fiscal standpoint and because of the markets it serves, he said. Harrison said he had held a 90-minute meeting with CSX in 2014, but had not made a formal offer at the time, explaining that a merger would not work ""culturally.""

Harrison did not discuss a report in the Wall Street Journal that the two railroads met again in January 2016, where CSX was said to have rebuffed CP's merger approach..

A CP spokesman could not comment Wednesday on the reported meeting, but noted that Harrison did not personally meet with CSX in January.

She's asking for $225,000 (USD) in back pay. The lawsuit alleges that the agency, Trump Model Management, employed Palmer using an H1-B visa, which allows U.S. employers to hire so-called ""specialized"" foreign labor. The agency listed Palmer's salary as ""at least $75,000 per year"" for three years on the application. But the model says she received less than $4000 during that time. Trump, who's had to fend off a number of accusations during his bid for president, is not named in the suit. But his attorney argues that the $75,000 a year figure was simply a guess, not a guarantee. And that the contract required Palmer ""to promptly reimburse"" the agency ""for any and all costs and expenses"". Palmer says those reimbursements amounted to 80 percent of her earnings, which were deducted by the agency. A decision is expected by the end of March.",[]

The resolution to amend the state's constitution passed 23-9 after the majority Republican caucus used a parliamentary maneuver to end the filibuster, which began at 4:00 p.m. CST on Monday, said Lauren Hieger, communications director for the Missouri Senate Majority Caucus.

READ MORE: Lead in the water: The corrosive dangers lurking in private wells

The amendment must be voted on again in the Senate next week before passing to the lower house, where Republicans have a majority, and then to the state's voters, Hieger said.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, applauded the effort by the Senate minority to block the resolution. ""Rewriting our state's constitution to condone discrimination would be contrary to our values and harmful to our economy,"" Nixon said in a statement on Wednesday.

The legislation is among a series of measures introduced around the country by conservatives in response to last year's U.S. Supreme Court legalization of same-sex marriage. The measures seek to protect religious groups and companies from being fined or punished if they decline to provide services such as wedding cakes or flowers to same-sex couples.



RECOMMENDED: Republicans sue State Department for Clinton emails

Republicans who backed the amendment said it was about religious freedom, but Democrats said it would enshrine discrimination in the state's constitution.

Given their minority position in both chambers of Missouri's General Assembly, Democrats chose to filibuster, debating overnight on Monday and Tuesday to block the initiative.

""Inspired by senators' heroic stand against discrimination in #MO. The nation is watching & cheering you on!"" Nixon tweeted on Tuesday night.

""In our pluralistic society, we should have room to respect the religious freedom of Missourians,"" Republican Senator Bob Onder, who sponsored the bill, told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday morning. He said the language of the bill was modified in a compromise on Tuesday to narrowly define wedding vendors.

The American Civil Liberties Union civil rights group said it would work to fight the bill in Missouri's House of Representatives.

""This amendment raises serious constitutional concerns because it singles out same-sex couples for discrimination,"" Jeffrey Mittman, executive director of ACLU of Missouri, said in a statement.

Por 10 votos a 1, o Supremo acolheu os argumentos feitos em acao movida pelo PPS com base na Constituicao de 1988, alegando que proibe integrantes do Ministerio Publico, como e o caso de Wellington Cesar, de assumirem outros cargos publicos, exceto os de professor.

Os ministros Edson Fachin, Luis Roberto Barroso, Teori Zavascki, Rosa Webber, Luiz Fux, Dias Toffoli, Carmen Lucia, Celso de Mello e Ricardo Lewandowski acompanharam o voto do relator do caso, ministro Gilmar Mendes, no qual afirmou que membros do Ministerio Publico nao podem exercer cargos publicos, exceto os de professor.

Apenas o ministro Marco Aurelio Mello votou contra a acao proposta pelo PPS e, ainda assim, por entender que o partido escolheu o instrumento juridico incorreto para questionar a nomeacao de Wellington Cesar.

Em seu voto, Mendes argumentou que, ao atuar no Poder Executivo, um integrante do MP se torna subordinado ao chefe de um outro Poder, o que, na avaliacao do magistrado, fere a independencia do Ministerio Publico.

A decisao do Supremo e mais um golpe para o governo Dilma, que ja sofre com a possibilidade de abertura de um processo de impeachment e com acoes que pedem sua cassacao junto ao Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF).

Wellington Cesar tomou posse no ministerio ha menos de uma semana em substituicao a Jose Eduardo Cardozo, que asumiu o comando da Advocacia-Geral da Uniao.

Cardozo, na estreia na tribuna do STF a frente do novo cargo, negou que houvesse incompatibilidade e argumentou que a harmonizacao e total entre o Ministerio Publico e o Ministerio da Justica.

O ministro da Secretaria de Governo, Ricardo Berzoini, afirmou apos julgamento do STF que ainda nao ha uma decisao sobre um novo ministro e alegou que e necessario aguardar a opcao de Wellington Cesar.

Mobile payments company Square Inc's revenue beat analysts' estimates in its first quarterly results since going public in November, easing pressure on CEO Jack Dorsey who is also leading turnaround efforts at Twitter Inc.

Square's shares rose as much as 7 percent after market on Wednesday, before giving up some of the gains. The stock had closed up 4.8 percent at $12.03 during the day.

The company's gross payment volume (GPV)  the total dollar amount of all card payments processed by sellers  rose 47 percent to $10.2 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31.

""Historically, the fourth quarter has been our strongest revenue quarter as sellers typically generate additional GPV during the holiday season,"" Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said on a conference call.

Transaction revenue  earned from businesses processing payments through Square's devices  grew 44.7 percent to $298.5 million.

The company, founded in 2009, has built a substantial customer base with a credit card reader that turns a mobile device into a payment terminal. The company also makes point-of-sale registers, and contactless and chip-enabled card readers.

Hardware revenue more than tripled to $6 million in the quarter.

However, Square is facing rising competition in the payments market from Apple Inc's Apple Pay and startups such as Stripe Inc.

Also, Dorsey's dual role as CEOs at Twitter and Square has been a sore point with investors at both companies. On his part, Dorsey has looked to play down the concerns.

Since his return to Twitter in July, Dorsey has unleashed a series of big changes at the micro-blogging service provider, looking to draw more users.

Square's total net revenue rose 49.2 percent to $374.4 million in the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $343.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company forecast adjusted revenue of $600 million-$620 million for 2016, above the $452 million it reported a year earlier.

However, net loss attributable to common stockholders widened to $80.5 million, or 34 cents per share, from $37.1 million, or 25 cents per share.

Square has been investing heavily in new hardware and building out its lending business, Square Capital.

The company's shares have mostly stayed below the first trading close of $13.07 and even slipped below the deeply discounted IPO price of $9 for a brief period, hitting a low of $8.06 on Feb. 3.

Since then, the stock had risen nearly 50 percent through Wednesday's close.

Teva, the world's biggest generic drugsmaker, will divest some drugs already on the market and others in the pipeline to address competition concerns by the European Commission, the people said. The package includes products from both Teva and Allergan.

Other sources had previously told Reuters that assets worth about $1 billion in the United States, Europe and the Middle East would be sold in order to secure the green light from regulators.

Teva will gain bigger economies of scale, a crucial element in the low-margin generic drugs business, with the deal, the largest in Israel's corporate history.

The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the case on Thursday, and Teva declined to comment.

The deal, which requires U.S. approval, has triggered a warning from the American Antitrust Institute that a more concentrated generic market usually comes with higher prices. The think-tank also said divestments may not be enough to ensure competition in the market in a letter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in January.

Dublin-based Botox-maker Allergan in turn is to be acquired by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) in a $160 billion deal creating the world's largest drugmaker.

Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) said on Wednesday it would buy U.S. options exchange operator International Securities Exchange for $1.1 billion from Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1Gn.DE), the latest deal to emerge from a spate of exchange merger talks.

ISE operates three electronic options exchanges which together account for more than 15 percent of U.S. volume, while Nasdaq operates another three. Combined, Nasdaq would command more than 40 percent of the market, extending its lead as the No. 1 U.S. options exchange operator.

""The ability to further that lead gives us advantages as to how we could serve our customers because you have a different volume versus scale arrangement,"" Nasdaq Chief Executive Bob Greifeld said in an interview.

The deal would also free up capital for Deutsche Boerse, which has said it plans to merge with the London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE.L) to create a European trading powerhouse that could better compete against U.S. rivals.

Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) said it may make a rival bid for the LSE, raising the prospects of a takeover battle.

Nasdaq, which plans to move ISE's trading platforms onto Nasdaq technology, said it could strip out $40 million from the two businesses through the transaction.

The deal would also give Nasdaq an additional 20 percent stake in the Options Clearing Corporation, for a total of 40 percent ownership in the world's largest equity derivatives clearing corporation.

Greifeld said he had been looking to buy ISE for years, and talks with Deutsche Boerse CEO Carsten Kengeter picked up over the past three months.

The deal does not include ISE's stake in No. 2 U.S. stock exchange operator BATS Global Markets, or blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings, which will continue to be owned by Deutsche Boerse, the German company said.

Nasdaq said the transaction was expected to be finalized in the second half of the year, pending regulatory approval, and it would likely increase earnings within 12 months of closing.

Nasdaq has made several acquisitions in recent years that have helped boost its profits and share price. These include Chi-X Canada, that country's largest alternative trading system, in a deal that closed last month; and index provider Dorsey, Wright & Associates last year.

Michael Horn, speaks at their media reception during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, January 10, 2016.

Michael Horn, President and CEO of Volkswagen America, reacts to being mobbed by the media after he apologized for the Volkswagen diesel scandal at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, United States in a November 18, 2015 file photo.

Michael Horn, President and CEO of Volkswagen America, introduces the new Beetle Dune at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, United States in a November 18, 2015 file photo.

WASHINGTON Volkswagen AG's top U.S. executive is stepping down nearly six months after the German automaker admitted to installing software to allow 580,000 diesel U.S. vehicles to emit excess emissions, the company said on Wednesday.

Michael Horn, who has been president and chief executive officer of Volkswagen Group of America since 2014, is leaving by mutual agreement ""to pursue other opportunities effective immediately,"" VW said.

Horn, 54, could not immediately be reached. A lawyer for Horn did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

The German automaker said on an interim basis, Hinrich J. Woebcken, a former BMW executive who ran global purchasing among other jobs, is filling Horn's job. In January, VW named Woebcken as head of VW's North American region, effective April 1.

Horn sent an email to employees thanking them for supporting him and for pulling together during the crisis.

Horn's departure comes as VW continues to negotiate with California, the Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency on possible fixes or buybacks for the diesel vehicles that emit up to 40 times legally allowable pollution. It faces a March 24 deadline to tell a federal judge whether it has an acceptable fix.

A top California official told state lawmakers Tuesday that VW may only be able to mount a partial fix and may have to pay to mitigate the harm caused by allowing vehicles to remain on the road.

Volkswagen faces an ongoing Justice Department criminal investigation. The Justice Department sued VW in January seeking up to $46 billion for violating environmental regulations and sent VW a civil subpoena under a bank fraud law.

Alan Brown, general manager of Hendrick Volkswagen in Frisco, Texas who is president of the National Volkswagen Dealer Advisory Council, praised Horn's tenure at VW and said he had talked to Horn over the last three days about his departure. Brown told Reuters Horn had been offered other jobs at Volkswagen outside the United States, but declined to take them.

Brown said it was critical VW maintain the strategy of growing U.S. volume and noted dealers have strongly supported the automaker through the crisis.

""We are not working out of gas stations any more,"" Brown said, noting VW's about U.S. 650 dealers have invested $1 billion over the last decade in facilities.

Brown is flying to Germany on Sunday and staying through Wednesday for meetings with VW executives in the aftermath of Horn's departure.

VW brand U.S. sales are down 14 percent this year after falling 5 percent last year. VW still faces a stop sale on all new diesel vehicles.

Brown said it was important VW stick with the business plan it approved to expand U.S. sales by quickly refreshing and redesigning vehicles.

U.S. VW dealers ""don't want a handout. They want a chance to win,"" Brown said. He said VW should scrap the idea of positioning itself as a ""near premium brand"" and return to its roots in the 1960s of selling mass market vehicles like the iconic Beetle.

Dennis Gaudet, a New Hampshire VW dealer, said Brown was ""probably the most popular (head) we've had as long as I've been a dealer"" and added he knew the American market ""better than most.""

During the initial response to the crisis, Horn was VW's public face in the United States, apologizing days after the scandal became public and testifying before Congress.

""Lets be clear about this: our company was dishonest  with the EPA and the California Air Resources Board  and with all of you. And in my German words: We totally screwed up. We must fix those cars,"" Horn said on Sept. 21.

In October, Horn told a U.S. House of Representatives panel that VWs supervisory board and top leadership did not intentionally order the cheating, but said it was the work of a few individuals.

Horn told Congress he had no knowledge of the cheating.

Horn joined VW in 1990 and held a series of jobs, including VW sales for Europe, before he became CEO based at VW's U.S. headquarters in Herndon, Virginia following the resignation of his predecessor, Jonathan Browning who abruptly resigned after VW brand sales fell in 2013. Sales fell despite an aggressive plan announced in 2008 by VW to triple sales in 10 years.

Mildronate (Meldonium) medication capsules are pictured on the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, in this November 23, 2010 file photo.

A manufacturing operator works at the Mildronate (Meldonium) medication packaging process in the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, November 23, 2010. Picture taken November 23, 2010.

LONDON, March 9 The medicine Maria Sharapova says she has taken for 10 years due to a family history of heart issues and diabetes is an old drug sold in just a few Eastern European countries that can also boost exercise tolerance.

The tennis star tested positive for the banned drug meldonium, or Mildronate, in a sample taken on January 26, the day of her Australian Open quarter finals defeat to Serena Williams.

RECOMMENDED: Trump's foreign labor practices in the spotlight

She said her family doctor had first given her the drug 10 years ago after she frequently became sick, had irregular electrocardiogram results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.

The 28-year old Russian, a five-time grand slam champion and the highest paid woman in sports, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said.

For the health conditions Sharapova says she has, however, doctors say the scientific evidence for Mildronate is limited compared with many medicines widely available in Europe and the United States, where Sharapova trains, which have full regulatory backing and years of robust safety and efficacy data.

LATVIAN DRUG

Meldonium is cheap and available over the counter without a prescription in some eastern European countries, where it is marketed as Mildronate by the Latvian pharmaceutical firm Grindeks (GRD1R.RI).

The drug, originally developed by scientists at the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, is not licensed by two of the world's biggest medicines regulators: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States where Sharapova trains, and the EU's European Medicines Agency.

RECOMMENDED: Iran tests more missiles, says capable of reaching Israel

A spokeswoman for Grindeks said the firm had not applied for a license for Mildronate from either the FDA or the EMA, but said the drug is registered in Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union.

She said it is designed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular diseases, including angina, chronic heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other cardiovascular disorders.

Grindeks' also promotes it for people with reduced working capacity from physical or psycho-emotional ""overload"", and during recovery from cerebrovascular disorders, head injury and encephalitis. It is not indicated for diabetes.

Tim Chico, a consultant cardiologist at Britain's Sheffield University, said it was unlikely that such a young and extremely fit woman would be suffering from a serious heart condition like angina, or would be able to play top level tennis if she were.

Asked how long the drug should be given to a patient, the Grindeks spokeswoman said in an emailed statement: ""Depending on the patient health condition, treatment course of meldonium preparations may vary from 4 to 6 weeks"". Such courses could be repeated two or three times in a year.

In an emailed reply to questions from Reuters about her medical reasons for using the drug, Sharapova's lawyer John Haggerty said: ""While I cannot go into detail out of respect for the ITF process, I can confirm that Ms Sharapova had abnormal EKG tests in 2006 and was also diagnosed with asthenia (a lack of energy or strength), decreased immunity and diabetes indicators.""

""She also had a family history of heart conditions,"" Haggerty said. ""The Mildronate and the other medicines recommended by her doctor treated these conditions.""

Munir Pirmohamed, a professor of molecular and clinical pharmacology at Britain's University of Liverpool, said the crucial issue with Mildronate for him is its lack of approval from EU and U.S. regulators.

""As a physician, this is not something I have, or would ever, prescribe,"" he said.

Others noted it was rare for a doctor treating illness to prescribe a drug that is unavailable in the country where the patient lives.

""Sharapova has been a U.S. resident since early in her career, which does bring in a question of how or why she is using a drug that is not licensed there,"" said Tom Bassindale, a lecturer in forensic science at Sheffield Hallam University.

Sharapova's agent Max Eisenbud was not available at his Miami office and did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

HELPS MUSCLES COPE

Whatever its medical benefits, research suggests Mildronate may have potential as a performance-enhancing drug for sports.

It reduces the level of a metabolite called carnetine in muscles, and by doing that helps muscles cope better with high levels of stress and low oxygen levels.

""Because it effects the cellular metabolism, it would increase energy production within cells and therefore make oxygen utilization more efficient,"" said Pirmohamed.

In a 2010 academic paper published in a review journal called Seminars in Cardiovascular Medicine and cited on the Grindeks company website, it has been shown to improve exercise tolerance in patients with heart problems.

The World Anti-Doping Agency, which banned the drug in January after previously having it on a ""watch list"", ranks it as a prohibited metabolic modulator and cites ""evidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance.""

Grindeks says the drug could protect athletes from cell damage, but says it would be unlikely to improve their competitive performance.

It would be ""reasonable to recommend (sports people) to use meldonium as a cell protector to avoid heart failure or muscle damage in case of unwanted overload,"" the spokeswoman said.

Athletes ""should not expect increase of physical capacity, but, for sure, they will be protected against ischemic damages of cells in case of overload.""

U.S. banks and money funds would face difficulties if the Federal Reserve were to adopt negative interest rates as a policy tool to fight recession or to avert deflation, the bank's analysts said.

German, French, Italian and Spanish banks hold more loans than securities as a portion of their overall assets than their U.S. and Japanese counterparts.

""This leaves core banks potentially more exposed to a negative rate environment than others in the periphery or in comparison to Japanese or U.S. banks,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a research report published on Wednesday.

German banks have the highest percentage of loans among the four core euro zone groups at 58 percent. This compared with 47 percent among Japanese banks and 55 percent among U.S. banks.

In June 2014, the European Central Bank cut policy rates into negative territory, which essentially charges banks for leaving reserves at the ECB.

BEIJING China's February trade performance was far worse than economists had expected, with exports tumbling the most in over six years, days after top leaders sought to reassure investors that the outlook for the world's second-largest economy remains solid.

Exports fell 25.4 percent from a year earlier, twice as much as markets had feared as demand skidded in all of China's major markets, while imports slumped 13.8 percent, the 16th straight month of decline.

The export drop was the biggest since May 2009, but economists said it may not necessarily point to a significant worsening in economic conditions due to sharply reduced business activity during the long Lunar New Year holidays, which fell in early February this year.

Still, January-February exports on a combined basis, which should iron out some of the holiday effect, fell 17.8 percent and imports 16.7 percent, pointing to persistently weak demand at home and abroad that is weighing on the economy of the world's largest trading nation.

""Exports were very strong last year in February because the Lunar New Year started so late and much of the usual disruption from the holiday was pushed into March. So the implication is that we'll probably see a significant reversal and a stronger number next month,"" said Julian Evans-Prichard, China Economist at Capital Economics in Singapore.

""We suspect that overall exports remain weak but we dont see much evidence of marked deterioration, for instance there was no sudden drop-off in export orders in the Markit PMI (activity survey), and they generally do a pretty good job of adjusting for seasonality.""

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected February exports to fall by 12.5 percent, with imports seen down 10.0 percent.

China posted a trade surplus of $32.59 billion for the month, down from $63.29 billion in January, the General Administration of Customs said on Tuesday.

NEW 2016 GROWTH TARGET ALREADY AT RISK?

After missing trade goals repeatedly in recent years, China's leaders did not give an estimate for trade growth in 2016 when they set out key economic targets in parliament on Saturday, reflecting deep uncertainty about global demand.

Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng said last month that he was confident that China's trade conditions would stabilize and improve in 2016, though most analysts see no improvement in sight.

""The sharp drop in imports also shatters the hope that China is rolling out a stimulus package that would boost the demand for commodities,"" said Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank in Singapore.

""The recent rally in bulk commodities, led by iron ore, might be only short-lived.""

Spot iron ore prices rocketed nearly 20 percent to the highest in more than eight months on Monday, buoyed by expectations that Chinese steel mills are planning an output boost ahead of an expected crackdown on air pollution.

China's iron ore imports rose 6.4 percent in Jan-Feb, though anti-dumping measures are squeezing steelmakers who are trying to keep mills running by increasing sales overseas.

Goldman Sachs, however, said the iron ore rally would not last in the absence of a significant improvement in Chinese domestic steel demand, sticking to its bearish take on one of this year's biggest commodity comebacks.

China's leaders set an economic growth target of 6.5 percent to 7 percent for 2016 as they opened the annual session of parliament last week, compared with 6.9 percent last year, the country's slowest expansion in a quarter of a century.

As part of efforts to stimulate activity, policymakers have proposed raising the 2016 fiscal deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product, from 2015's budgeted 2.3 percent.

Economists also expect further reductions this year in interest rates and the amount of money that banks must hold in reserve, extending a year-long stimulus blitz. In late February, the central bank cut bank reserve ratio requirements, releasing an estimated $100 billion in cash for lending.

""Overall, today's trade data, together with high-frequency data and leading indicators, suggest that growth momentum weakened further in January-February,"" economists from Japanese bank Nomura said in a research note.

""We maintain our forecast of real GDP growth slowing to 5.8 percent in 2016 from 6.9 percent in 2015.""

Premier Li Keqiang acknowledged in parliament on Saturday that leaders face ""a tough battle"" to keep the economy growing by at least 6.5 percent over the next five years, while pushing hard to create more jobs and restructuring state-owned enterprises.

Having grown up in an educated family in cosmopolitan Karachi, her life couldnt have been more different than the subject of her latest documentary, the Oscar-winning A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness.

The documentary, which premiered on HBO Monday night, follows the story of 19-year-old Saba Qaiser from rural Punjab, whose father and uncle tried to kill her after she married a man without their approval.

The film and the award prompted lots of conversation in Pakistan on honour killings, where brothers, fathers or uncles murder women to protect their family honour.

I think this Oscar and the recognition that comes with it is the first step towards driving the conversation in the right direction, said Obaid-Chinoy, 37, speaking by telephone from Karachi.

More than 500 men and women died in honour killings in 2015, according to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. Most of these killings did not result in prosecutions.

After the win, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who screened the movie at his home, reiterated that his government was pushing a law to stop such killings.

As a filmmaker, thats the biggest reward  to see the tremendous change you can bring about in your country, said Obaid-Chinoy, who won her first Academy award in 2012 for directing Saving Face a film on the horrors endured by women who suffer acid attacks in Pakistan.

The director came across Sabas story in a local newspaper. She found the victim, who was recuperating from a bullet wound in a hospital in Gujranwala. In interviews with Sabas family, the documentary reveals how the teenager had no support from anyone, including her mother and sister. They think Saba got what she deserved for bringing dishonour upon their family and making them outcasts.



The biggest challenge I had in making this documentary was not in dealing with the authorities or the police. It was countering the mindset of the people in Pakistani society who think its OK to kill someone in the name of honour, Obaid-Chinoy said.

Sabas father and uncle, who were in jail when Obaid-Chinoy was filming, were defiant. Maqsood, her father, repeatedly defends himself in Punjabi. Im an honorable man. I was obliged to do it. Maqsood says he would have tried to kill Sabas husband had their paths crossed.

Obaid-Chinoy argues with Maqsood. In that powerful moment, she emerges as a woman first and a journalist second  as someone who cannot stand by as Maqsood justifies his action on honour and on Islam. Its a reminder of how far some people in some nations have to go toward acknowledging that women should be able to fall in love and marry without fearing for their lives, and an especially potent one as the world marks International Womens Day on Tuesday.

SKOPJE Macedonia has closed its border completely to illegal migrants after Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia announced tight new restrictions on migrant entry, a police official said on Wednesday.

Thousands of migrants have built up on the Greek side of the Macedonian border. Macedonia had been allowing small numbers of Syrians and Iraqis through but stopped this after its neighbours tightened up their policies.

""We have completely closed the border,"" the police official, who declined to be named, told Reuters.

According to the Macedonian Interior Ministry, no migrants entered from Greece on Tuesday.

""Macedonia will act according to the decisions taken by other countries on the Balkan route,"" an Interior Ministry spokesman said, referring to the main routes taken by more than a million migrants to reach the European Union over the last year.

Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia said on Tuesday they would place new restrictions on the entry of migrants. The decisions were announced hours after EU leaders outlined an agreement intended to end a mass movement to reach wealthy countries in Europe from war zones.

Croatia's Interior Minister Vlaho Orepic told a news conference on Wednesday in Zagreb that the new decision meant reestablishing of a ""regular border regime"".

""The essence of this is to firmly stick to a regular border regime and to be ready to react to any exceptional circumstances,"" Orepic said. He added that talks were proceeding on return of 408 migrants, currently stranded in a camp in Croatia, to Greece.

Around 1,000 migrants remain stranded in a refugee camp on the Macedonian side of the Serbian border while more than 400 are stranded in ""No Man's Land"" between Serbia and Macedonia. They refuse to go back to Macedonia and are not being allowed to cross in to Serbia.

Florida lawmakers on Wednesday gave the thumbs-up to living together without being married, sending to the governor a bill repealing the state's Reconstruction-era ban on cohabitation by unmarried couples.

The old law made it illegal to ""lewdly and lasciviously"" live together without being married to each other - language that presumably differentiated between romantic couples sharing a bed and non-romantic roommates splitting the rent.

In either case, sponsors said, it is a law that is impossible to enforce but dangerous to have on the books.

""You shouldn't have statutes that are not being enforced,"" said state Representative Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda, a Tallahassee Democrat and bill sponsor. ""You'd have to arrest a half-million people, if we enforced this.""

The repeal statute leaves in place a section of the 1868 law making it a misdemeanor to engage ""in open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior,"" regardless of marital status.

It is difficult to determine if anyone gets arrested for cohabitation, since the offense is combined in the state with public lewdness, said Rehwinkel Vasilinda, a law school instructor.

But the law ""could be used in a discriminatory manner"" if a jealous ex-spouse or prosecutor wanted to harass a person or unmarried couple, she said.

The cohabitation ban is the latest in a string of antiquated and rarely-if-ever-enforced sex laws being repealed across the country - either by new laws, referendum, or court action, the most notable being bans on same-sex intercourse struck down by the courts in recent years.

If Florida's repeal passes the governor's muster, only Mississippi and Michigan will be the holdouts on laws requiring couples to marry before sharing roof and bed, according to a staff analysis of the Florida bill.

The bill was also sponsored by state Senator Eleanor Sobel, a Hollywood Democrat.

The repeal earned the overwhelming support of the Florida lawmakers, with a unanimous vote in the state Senate and five dissenters in the House.

Among them was Representative Jennifer Sullivan, a Republican from Mount Dora, who said she ""ran on a pro-family platform"" and could not vote to legalize cohabitation.

""Based on my own faith and what I believe, I voted accordingly,"" she said. ""My faith affects everything I do and who I am, so I'm just being consistent with who I said I was as a candidate.""

Creative director Karl Lagerfeld's frequently spectacular sets at Paris Fashion Week are well known but the 82-year old designer opted for a paired-down dressing room feel this season, all plush cream carpets and walls of mirrors. The twist was that all the guests were seated on the front row of the lengthy catwalk; gone were the banks of benches to be replaced by rows of gold chairs which brought the people closer to the clothes. Lagerfeld said that people would not complain as they would be able to see every detail. On international women's day, Lagerfeld's women were ready to take on the world -- impractical footwear was banished in favour of flat riding boots, their two sections held together with laces. And with a half-mile march from one end of the runway to the other, the flat shoes came in handy. The designer has also decided that hats are back. His padded boaters were everywhere in colours ranging from fuschia to black, in leather and tweed but Lagerfeld said they were meant to be functional, not fussy. The collection opened with a parade in pink -- hot, fuschia and lavender -- with Chanel's classic tweed suits renewed with deconstructed fringes and denim details. Away from the suits, the collection was not classic Autumn/Winter, with silky floral prints and layered peasant dresses topped with pearls. Also joining Williams at the show were Willow Smith and her mother Jada Pinkett Smith, as well as French actress Isabelle Huppert.",[]

Adopting a single IT platform marks a further step in the integration of the two companies, allowing them and individual client brands to monitor available stocks online and in-store as well as facilitate deliveries.

Yoox Net-a-Porter said IBM's Order Management software would help it deliver the stock synergies announced when the merger was agreed, which in turn would lead to higher sell-though and retail margins.

However, the IBM deal, whose financial details were not disclosed, is partly why Net-a-Porter (NAP) has lost key IT staff in recent months to rivals such as Amazon and Farfetch, sources close to the company told Reuters.

NAP technology chief Hugh Fahy, for example, left last month to become chief technology officer at Internet retailer Not-on-the-high-street.

The sources said that while IBM's technology allowed for the creation of a harmonized IT platform, it was also available to all retailers and therefore hardly a differentiating factor in what has become a highly competitive market.

Some of the IT people who left NAP said IBM systems did not allow them to be as creative in terms of applications and functionalities as the company's in-house systems. It also meant the job in the coming months was going to be more about integrating existing systems than creating new ones.

""It is like hiring carpenters to put together an Ikea cupboard,"" one of the sources said.

NAP said the departures were part of the normal process associated with mergers.

Yoox NAP said the IBM platform would free up time for IT services team to focus on innovation and the development of bespoke e-commerce solutions.

""This will enable us to speed up innovation and create a group level platform,"" said Alex Alexander, Yoox NAP's chief information officer, a systems integration specialist who worked at Barclays bank and joined last year from retailer Wal-Mart, where he designed an omni-channel strategy for its UK unit Asda.

Yoox NAP said it was hiring more than 100 staff, split between Bologna and London to expand its IT team.

SHANGHAI China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) on Thursday said it has signed a deal for a $3 billion five-year loan, which will help the e-commerce giant as it snaps up stakes in companies within China and overseas.

Alibaba, led by founder Jack Ma, has been expanding in areas beyond its core e-commerce base, such as online video, as volume growth in its online shopping business slows.

The firm said in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it had signed the syndicated loan deal with a group of eight lead arrangers. It added that the amount could increase if there was steep demand.

""The loan, which is subject to upsize through oversubscriptions in syndication, has a five-year bullet maturity and is priced at 110 basis points over LIBOR,"" the company said in the filing, referring to the benchmark interest rate used by many global banks when making loans.

Alibaba added that the loan would be used for ""general corporate purposes"", without expanding on what this meant.

The Wall Street Journal cited sources last month saying Alibaba was in talks with several banks to borrow up to $4 billion to fund expansion plans, including acquisitions.

NEW YORK Oil prices rose as much as 5 percent on Wednesday, with U.S. crude hitting three-month highs after a big gasoline inventory drawdown amid improving demand overshadowed growing record high crude stockpiles.

Speculation that top producers might agree soon to an output freeze also supported crude oil.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled up $1.42, or about 4 percent, at $41.07 a barrel.

U.S. crude futures CLc1 finished up $1.79, or 5 percent, at $38.29 a barrel after hitting a three-month high of $38.51.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude stockpiles USOILC=ECI rose 3.9 million barrels last week to reach nearly 522 million barrels, in its fourth week of building to record highs.[EIA/S]

But gasoline inventories USOILG=ECI fell 4.5 million barrels, nearly triple forecasts, in the largest weekly draw in almost two years.

U.S. gasoline demand over past four weeks was 7 percent higher than a year ago, the EIA said.

""Gasoline is the star of the show today,"" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at New York-headquartered energy data provider ClipperData. ""Ongoing strength in demand has yielded a large draw to gasoline inventories despite a rebound in refinery runs.""

U.S. gasoline futures RBc1 hit six-month highs, rallying 6 percent. The crack spread for gasoline 1RBc1-CLc1, a measure of profit margin refiners get for turning a barrel of crude into the motor fuel, scaled seven-month highs.

Oil has gained about 50 percent from 12-year lows hit less than two months ago, since OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Venezuela, along with non-OPEC exporter Russia, pledged to leave supply at January's levels if others cooperated.

Some analysts said the rally was excessive.

""We feel that values could consolidate well into next week or longer, prior to enough momentum shift to force an ultimate $9-10 crude price cut,"" said Jim Ritterbusch at Chicago-based oil advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates.

Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said it expected this year's average price of crude to be lower than last year's, reflecting the glut.

Oil rallied earlier in the day after an Iraqi oil official told a state newspaper that producers in and outside of OPEC plan to meet in Moscow on March 20 to discuss the output freeze. Russia's energy ministry, however, said no date or place had been set.

Credit ratings agency Moody's warned of more output declines if oil producers defaulted on debt because of low prices. Reuters exclusively reported that Saudi Arabia was seeking its first significant foreign borrowing in over a decade to help cover a record budget deficit from weak crude prices.

Skopje/Budapest/Didim Zwei Tage nach dem EU-Turkei-Gipfel zur Losung der Fluchtlingskrise haben mehrere Balkan-Staaten den Weg fur Hilfesuchende nach Norden vollstandig versperrt.

Gleichzeitig registrierten turkische Behorden am Mittwoch an der Agais-Kusteeinen Ansturm von Fluchtlingen, die offenbar vor Inkrafttreten des Abkommens nach Griechenland ubersetzen wollten. In Deutschland und im Europa-Parlament hielt die Kritik an den geplanten Vereinbarungen zwischen der Europaischen Union und der Turkei an, die kommende Woche besiegelt werden sollen.

Mazedonien schloss nach Angaben eines Mitarbeiters der Polizei seine Grenzen vollstandig fur Fluchtlinge, nachdem es in den Tagen zuvor noch eine kleine Anzahl von Syrern und Irakern ins Land gelassen hatte. Das Land folgte dem Beispiel Sloweniens und Serbiens, die keine Durchreise von Fluchtlingen auf dem Weg nach Deutschland oder anderen nordeuropaischen Staaten mehr zulassen wollen.

UNGARN ERWAGT BAU EINES NEUEN GRENZZAUNS IM SUDEN

Auch Ungarn verscharfte seine Fluchtlingspolitik und kundigte an, mehr Soldaten und Polizisten an seine Sudgrenze zu schicken. Die Regierung werde Vorbereitungen treffen, um an der Grenze zu Rumanien, das im Sudosten an Ungarn stot, notfalls rasch einen Zaun errichten zu konnen, sagte Innenminister Sandor Pinter. Ungarn hatte vor einigen Monaten bereits an der Grenze zu Serbien und Kroatien einen Zaun gezogen.

In Brussel dankte EU-Ratsprasident Donald Tusk fur die Schlieung der Grenzen. ""Der irregulare Strom von Migranten uber die Westbalkanroute ist zu einem Ende gekommen"", twitterte er. ""Das ist keine Frage einseitiger Manahmen, sondern von gemeinsamen Beschlussen der 28 EU-Staaten."" Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel hatte allerdings gemahnt, es durfe nicht Ziel sein, mit einseitigen Grenzschlieungen nur einigen Landern zu helfen. Ziel musse vielmehr sein, mit dem Schutz der EU-Auengrenzen allen Mitgliedstaaten nachhaltig zu helfen. Tusk erklarte nun, er danke den Landern des Westbalkans dafur, die gemeinsame Strategie der EU in Teilen umzusetzen, um mit der Fluchtlingskrise umzugehen.

Die Turkei hatte bei dem EU-Gipfel in Brussel angeboten, alle in Griechenland ankommenden Migranten zuruckzunehmen. Fur jeden zuruckgefuhrten Syrer soll ein anderer syrischer Fluchtling von der EU direkt aus der Turkei aufgenommen werden. Als Gegenleistung erwartet die Regierung in Ankara mehr Geld von der EU, Visa-Freiheit fur seine Burger und deutlich schnellere Beitrittsverhandlungen zur EU.

VIELE FLUCHTLINGE SUCHEN WEG NACH GRIECHENLAND

Die Plane brachten offenbar viele Menschen dazu, in Richtung Griechenland aufzubrechen, um dem erwarteten Inkrafttreten des Abkommens zuvorzukommen. Die turkische Kustenwache nahm mehrere Dutzend Fluchtlinge in Gewahrsam, die in Hohlen an der Kuste auf die Uberfahrt warteten. Eine Gruppe von 42 Migranten, darunter uber ein Dutzend Kinder, war bereits auf ein Gelande der Kustenwache im Ferienort Didim gebracht und mit Decken versorgt worden. An einem anderen Kustenabschnitt wurde eine groe Anzahl von Fluchtlingen von Polizisten bewacht, wahrend sie auf Busse warteten, die sie wegbringen sollten. Auf See fing ein Boot der Kustenwache einen kleinen Frachter ab, der offenkundig Fluchtlinge nach Griechenland bringen sollte. Noch wahrend die Fluchtlinge festgenommen wurden, erreichten neue Hilfesuchende Didim per Taxi.

In Deutschland pochte die CSU darauf, die geplante Visa-Befreiung fur Turken an die Einstufung des Landes als sicheren Herkunftsstaat koppeln. Das wurde die Abschiebung turkischer Fluchtlinge in ihr Heimatland erleichtern. Im EU-Parlament erklarte der Vorsitzende der Liberalen-Fraktion, Guy Verhofstadt, er empfinde das geplante Abkommen als grotenteils problematisch. Kritik kam auch von Grunen und Linken. ""Wir schlieen einen Deal mit einem Land, das bereit ist, Menschen im eigenen Land zu toten"", sagte Linken-Fraktionschefin Gabi Zimmer mit Blick auf das Vorgehen der turkischen Armee gegen kurdische Rebellen. Die Menschenrechtsorganisation Amnesty International kritisierte das geplante Abkommen als Todessto fur das Recht auf Asyl.",[]

WASHINGTON The director of the Google self-driving car project and auto industry executives will testify before Congress next week on efforts to develop safe and effective autonomous cars.

Senator John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, said on Tuesday that Chris Urmson, director of self-driving cars at Alphabet Inc unit Google, will testify at on March 15.

Urmson will testify alongside executives from General Motors Co, Delphi Automotive PLC and privately held ride-hailing service Lyft Inc to talk about ""advancements in autonomous vehicle technology and its anticipated benefits for Americans,"" the committee said.

In January, Detroit-based GM said it would invest $500 million in Lyft Inc and laid out plans to develop an on-demand network of self-driving cars with the ride-sharing service.

The committee wants witnesses' views ""on the appropriate role of government in promoting innovation including removing unnecessary hurdles, and their strategy to grow consumer adoption of this new technology.""

Major automakers and technology companies are racing to develop and sell vehicles that can drive themselves, but they have complained that state and federal safety rules are impeding testing and ultimate deployment of such vehicles.

In January, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it may waive some vehicle safety rules to allow more driverless cars to operate on U.S. roads as part of a broader effort to speed up development of self-driving vehicles.

Safety regulators will write guidelines for self-driving cars within six months, Transporation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in January.

On Feb. 4, NHTSA said the artificial intelligence system piloting a self-driving Google car could be considered the driver under federal law, a major step toward ultimately winning approval for autonomous vehicles on the roads.

But Google said last month it bears ""some responsibility"" after one of its self-driving cars struck a municipal bus in Mountain View, California on Feb. 14.

The crash may be the first case of one of its autonomous cars hitting another vehicle and the fault of the self-driving car. The Mountain View-based Internet search leader said it made changes to its software after the crash to avoid future incidents.

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir delivers a statement after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry at the State Department in Washington, February 8, 2016.

CAIRO/RIYADH A Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said on Wednesday it had exchanged prisoners with its Houthi opponents and also welcomed a pause in combat on the border, prompting hopes of a push to end the year-long war that has killed some 6,000 people.

Riyadh's confirmation of a rare confidence-building measure in the conflict came a day after senior Yemeni officials said a delegation from the Houthis, who are allies of the kingdom's arch foe Iran, was in Saudi Arabia for talks to end the war.

However, both the Saudi Arabian and Yemeni foreign ministers later said any formal negotiations to end the fighting could only take place under the auspices of the United Nations and must include Yemen's internationally recognized government.

Riyadh and a coalition of Arab states entered Yemen's civil war a year ago in an attempt to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi after the Houthis and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh ousted him from power.

The Saudi state news agency SPA said Yemeni tribal mediators had facilitated the exchange of a Saudi lieutenant captured by the Houthis for seven Yemeni prisoners held in the kingdom.

The agency gave no further details, but some Yemeni media have reported that the exchange happened on the border between the two countries earlier this week.

Quoting a Saudi statement, SPA also said: ""The leadership of the coalition forces welcomed the continuation of a state of calm along the border ... which contributes to arriving at a political solution.""

After meeting his Gulf Arab and Yemeni counterparts, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said he backed U.N. special envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed's efforts to resolve the crisis based on U.N. resolution 2216, which calls on the Houthis to return power to Hadi's government.

However, he added in a news conference that the lull was important to deliver aid and medical supplies to people in northern regions of Yemen.

Saleh's General People's Congress party said in a statement it supported any efforts to bring peace to Yemen.

HOUTHIS SNUB IRAN

Yemen's conflict has fallen into a stalemate, in which the Houthis still control the capital Sanaa and other major cities in central Yemen, while its guerrilla forces have shelled and harassed Saudi forces along the rugged northern frontier.

In what could be a goodwill message to Saudi Arabia, a senior Houthi official sought to distance his group from Riyadh's main regional foe Tehran, telling Iranian officials in a Facebook posting to stay out of Yemen's conflict.

""Officials in the Islamic Republic of Iran must be silent and leave aside the exploitation of the Yemen file,"" said Yousef al-Feshi, a member of the Revolutionary Committee which runs areas of Yemen held by the Houthis.

Asked about the posting, Jubeir said he had not seen it but that it appeared to be a ""positive"" statement.

Sunni power Saudi Arabia has long accused Shi'ite Iran of trying to expand its influence in Yemen by helping the Houthis, who hail from the Zaydi branch of Shi'ite Islam.

The comments by Feshi, who is seen as close to the Houthis' overall leader Abdel-Malek al-Houthi, were the first snub by the group to Iran, long seen as its main supporter.

On Tuesday, Brigadier General Masoud Jazayeri, deputy chief of staff of Iran's armed forces, suggested that Tehran could send military advisers to help the Houthis in Yemen just as it has done in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad's forces.

The coalition spokesman, Brigadier General Ahmed al-Asseri, said Yemeni tribal chiefs had asked for a period of calm to let humanitarian supplies pass through but he declined to be drawn into commenting on the reported visit by a Houthi delegation.

""It is too early to focus on those who are carrying out this role,"" Asseri told the Saudi-owned al-Arabiya TV. ""Let's focus on the result, that there be benefit to our brothers who are affected by what the Houthi militias are carrying out. We do not want to talk about individuals.""

Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdelmalek al-Mekhlafi said the talks in Saudi Arabia were ""on the intelligence level about prisoners and other issues"", adding that peace talks could only happen in accordance with the U.N. resolution.

""This is the only way forward with political negotiations. Anything else is operational and not political,"" Mekhlafi said after the meeting with his Gulf Arab counterparts in Riyadh.

reuters.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,Do you suffer from Russophobia? The Kremlin thinks you might.,"['Posted Smarynakurskaya', 'Posted Paulharper', 'Lucian Kim Is A Berlin-based Journalist Who Has Covered The Ukraine Conflict For Slate Newsweek Buzzfeed He Previously Worked As A Correspondent For Bloomberg News In Moscow The Christian Science Monitor In Berlin', 'Posted No_apartheid', 'Posted Radfo', 'Posted Laster', 'Lucian Kim', ""Any Opinions Expressed Here Are The Author's Own"", 'Posted Danram', 'Posted Jundi']","If Russian officials are to be believed, the reason people worry about what Russia might do next is because they suffer from Russophobia, an irrational fear of all things Russian.

In February, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov assailed the fashion of Russophobia in certain capitals during a visit to Germany. Then Russias defense ministry accused General Philip Breedlove of Russophobia. The commander of U.S. forces in Europe had testified that the United States and its allies were deterring Russia now and preparing to fight and win if necessary following the Kremlins military adventures in Ukraine and Syria.

Russophobe has become a convenient label for anyone who disagrees with Russian President Vladimir Putins aggressive behavior at home and abroad. You are not criticizing an authoritarian leader and his erratic policies; you are instead attacking the Russian nation.

Russias state media churns out reports on how enemies are tirelessly seeking to isolate the country  when in fact it is Putins own actions that are closing off Russia.

When I first visited Moscow as a college student 25 years ago, the Soviet Union was in its last year of existence. Kremlin reformer Mikhail Gorbachev was opening up the country after more than seven decades of communism, and Russians were hungry to rejoin the world. Goodwill, curiosity and hope were the overriding feelings among Russians and Americans alike. My host parents in Moscow even displayed a picture of then-President George H.W. Bush in their living room.

The Cold War was finally over. I was fascinated by the parallel world that had existed behind the Iron Curtain and shocked by the deprivations that people endured. Later, as a journalist based in Moscow, I would encounter dozens of Russians who welcomed me into their homes and hearts. It helped, of course, that I tried my damnedest to speak Russian. But it never hurt to be American. Often it was an advantage.

My initial interest in Russia led me to explore other countries that had belonged to the Soviet empire: Ukraine, Poland, the Baltic states, the Central Asian republics. Although anti-Russian rhetoric has cheapened the political discourse in those places, the Russian language is still widely understood, if not actively used. Given their difficult history with Russia, eastern European countries viewed membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a prudent defensive measure. Putins surprise attack on Ukraine proved them right.

To me, the folly of Russophobia became most obvious in Ukraine. Most of my Ukrainian friends speak Russian as their first language, and many have parents or grandparents from Russia. They arent afraid of Russia but of its revanchist, autocratic government.

The crux of the problem between Russia and its former satellites is that nationalism was the driving force behind the independence movements that split apart the Soviet Union. Estonians, Lithuanians and Georgians knew who they were and what they wanted: their own countries.

But from Russians perspective, it looked like their neighbors were abandoning them. Russians never had to liberate themselves from the Soviet Union: They just woke up one day in its ideological ruins. Not surprisingly, Russian nationalism today ties together a jumble of monarchist, Orthodox Christian and communist strands.

The appeal of Russophobia isnt just based on resentment about the breakup of an empire. Its also rooted in the frustration that the Western model of governance proved a more attractive way of running a country.

Putin, now in his 17th year of ruling Russia, is preoccupied with regime survival. Thats one reason the Kremlin is working so hard to discredit liberal democracy as a system of government. Telling Russians to fear the West because the West hates Russia is a way of distracting the population from the deficiencies of one-man rule.

Ever since my first visit to Russia in 1991, Russians have asked me why I decided to learn their language and travel to their country. People were incredulous that an American without any Russian roots could be so interested in their country.

My answer was simple: the mellifluous Russian language, the richness of Russian literature, the vastness of the countrys geography and the diversity of its peoples. It was all about what Russians themselves call the Russian soul  a generosity of spirit and a knack for improvisation amid adversity.

In their bluster about a brave new Russky Mir (Russian world) to redeem the perceived humiliations of the past, Russias current rulers are putting their own insecurities on full display. In the process, they have squandered the countrys greatest resource, which isnt oil and gas but Russias enormous soft power.

Ironically, the biggest Russophobes inhabit Russias highest political offices. They are the people who believe the essentialist argument that the Russian people are too immature for real democracy and can only be ruled by a strong leader.

Russophobia isnt an international problem. Its a domestic one.",[]

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said on Wednesday it had signed a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA.N) 767 widebody freighter aircraft to handle more of its own deliveries in the United States.

The deal comes at a time when the world's biggest online retailer is offering ever-faster, and increasingly free, deliveries for millions of online orders.

Amazon, which relies on carriers like United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) to deliver most of its packages, spent $11.5 billion on shipping last year.

In a bid to assume more control over its supply chain and reduce costs, Amazon has rolled out thousands of trailers and launched a program that uses contract drivers to deliver fast orders.

But analysts said the long-rumored plan to build its own air fleet posed little threat to the leading delivery companies.

""This is an incremental negative for FDX and UPS as it will likely remove some higher yielding express freight and parcel volume from each of the respective networks,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst John Barnes wrote in a client note.

UPS, the world's No. 1 package delivery company, operates about 240 large planes while FedEx has a fleet of about 370, Barnes noted. FedEx and UPS shares were down about 1.5 percent.

FedEx said on Wednesday the announcement was not a surprise and called Amazon a valuable customer.

""We work closely with Amazon and have been aware for some time about their need for supplemental air capacity related to inventory management,"" said Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications at FedEx.

The leased planes will start to go into operation on April 1, Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email.

Amazon has been testing deliveries by drones but has not said when they would be in service.

The duration of the leases will be five to seven years, lessor Air Transport Services Group Inc (ATSG.O) said.

As part of the agreement, Amazon has the right to buy up to 19.9 percent of ATSG's stock over five years at $9.73 per share.

ATSG's stock soared almost 27 percent to a record high of $14.90, before paring gains to about 16 percent.

The contract is the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement, which divided up most of the Arab lands that had been under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. The world that document created exists now only on yellowed maps, and the issues left unsettled  primarily the need for separate Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish territories  have come home begging. War is not fixing this; diplomacy might.

In November 2014, I wrote the only solution to Islamic State was to use American peacekeepers to create a stable, tri-state solution to the Sunni-Shiite-Kurd divide inside Iraq.

However, in the intervening 15 months, Turkey and Russia entered the fight, and the Saudis may soon join the fray. Meanwhile, the United States and its allies  as well as Iraq, Islamic State and Iran  never left. Only a massive diplomatic effort, involving all parties now on the playing field, including Islamic State, has any potential of ending the bloodshed. That means a redivision of the region along current ethnic, tribal, religious and political lines.

A new Sykes-Picot Agreement, if you will.

The old Sykes-Picot Agreement was enforced by the superpowers of the day, Britain and France, with buy-in from Russia. The immediate aim was colonialism; the long-term goal stability, following the massive realignment of power that was World War One. The lines were literally drawn for the next nine decades.

Another important goal of the era, creating Kurdistan, never actually happened. The 1920 Treaty of Sevres left an opening for a referendum on Kurdish independence. Problem one: the referendum only included plans for Kurds outside of Syria and Iraq. Problem two: the referendum never happened, a victim of fighting that saw the Turkish people separate themselves from the remains of the Ottoman Empire and fight for two years to prevent the dismantling of what is now modern Turkey. The result was 20 million Kurds scattered across parts of modern Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Syria.

From a geopolitical perspective, heres what we have now: the 2003 invasion of Iraq blew open the struggle among the Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. It unleashed the forces behind some of the Arab Spring-driven chaos in Syria, and drew Iran deep into the Iraqi conflict. Shiite militia and Iraqi government attacks on Sunnis opened the door for Islamic State to step in as their protector.

The struggle metastasized into the ongoing, broader conflict. The Kurds are expanding the land they control, out of Iraq, and into Turkish and Syrian territory. The Turks look to repel that effort, and perhaps seize some territory to tidy up their own border with Syria. Russia has re-entered the region as a military force. The Saudis may yet send in troops. Iran is already there via proxy forces. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad still holds territory, but only alongside Islamic State. The United States is training, assisting and equipping groups often fighting each other.

That all has led to human suffering on a genocidal scale, including refugee flows no one seems sure how best to handle. The ongoing effort to bomb away the problems has resulted in destroying cities like Ramadi, Kobane, Homs, and soon Mosul, in order to save them. Four American presidents have made war in the region without concrete results, and Obamas successor will be number five.

The only answer left, the one not yet tried, is to negotiate a comprehensive resolution that addresses all of the issues, borders and struggles now underway. That resolution will need to be enforced with military power coordinated by the United States, Russia and Iran, with each speaking for, and agreeing to corral, its proxies.

It will mean giving Islamic State a seat at the table, as the British were forced to do with the Irish Republican Army in the 1990s to resolve the troubles in Northern Ireland. One, by definition, must negotiate peace with ones enemies. That is why, in part, the current ceasefire in Syria, which excluded Islamic State, has little chance of achieving any long-term progress.

Out of the new negotiations will have to emerge a Kurdistan, with land from Turkey, Iraq, perhaps Iran, and Syria. Assad will stay in power as a Russian proxy. Irans hold on Shiite Iraq will strengthen. A Sunni homeland, to include the political entity Islamic State will morph into, will need to be assured via a strict hands-off policy by Baghdad.

That Sunni homeland offers the first real way to geographically contain Islamic State. There obviously is risk in overtly allowing Islamic State to continue to exist, though that lives alongside the questions of whether it can be militarily destroyed, or if another group will simply take its place, as Islamic State did with al Qaeda in Iraq. These groups are symptoms of the broader Sunni-Shiite problem, not problems of their own per se.

The payoff of such a broad resolution will be a measure of stability, and a framework to enforce it. American efforts will shift from fanning the flames (American weapons are as ubiquitous as iPhones in the region) to putting out fires.

At risk for not acting: an empowered Islamic State, thriving on more chaos. An explosive dissolution of Iraq. A Russian-Turkish fight that could involve NATO. The shift from a Saudi-Iranian proxy war to a straightforward conflict between the two countries. A spark that forces Israel to act. A mini-world war, in the worlds most flammable region, that will create its own unexpected and uncontrolled realignment of power, and leave behind a warehouse of the dead.

Yes, I hate it, too. It is a very imperfect resolution. But an elegant solution is no longer viable.",[]

IDOMENI, Greece Six-day-old Asima lies on her back a few metres away from a line of public toilets used by crowds of refugees and migrants stranded at a muddy border outpost in northern Greece.

She is one of the youngest of thousands of children trapped in what aid workers say is a petri dish of filth and festering infections, as European leaders work out what to do with the growing masses fleeing conflict zones and heading to Europe.

Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) says there are at least 40 pregnant women in Idomeni camp on the Macedonian border, and 40 percent of its population are children.

There are many babies at the camp, and they are vulnerable to respiratory infections, said Christian Reynders, deputy coordinator for MSF at Idomeni.

""Refugees set fires at night to keep their families warm. They burn everything, wood, plastic bags, old clothes. The smoke is toxic and we are afraid that respiratory infection especially for newborn babies might create permanent problems to their breathing system,"" he added.

MSF doctors see about 60 children a day suffering from the results of the humidity and smoke, he said.

By the latest count, there were about 36,000 refugees and migrants stranded in Greece on Wednesday, their plans to travel further north blocked by border shutdowns throughout the Balkans.

Asimas Syrian mother gave birth in the town of Kilkis, about 40 km (25 miles) away from the camp which has sprouted up in muddy meadows.

But she then promptly returned, waiting with at least 13,000 others to cross a frontier which now appears permanently shut.

A nurse from the 'Arsis' charity changes Asimas nappy, saying she knows of at least five infants stuck in squalid conditions.

""I few minutes ago we had a three-month-old baby in who only weighed three kilos, the nurse said, less than half the usual weight for that age.

""A few days after giving birth their parents bring them back to the camp. They are afraid of losing their place to cross the borders. Many are malnourished.

Sarala, in her early twenties, has been living there for 19 days, in a tiny tent covered in mud. She fled Idlib in Syria with her daughter, then 15 days old. She crossed into Greece about a month ago and wants to go to Germany.

The baby is wearing a pink babygrow also spattered with mud.

""Ill stay at the camp until Macedonia open the borders,"" she told Reuters. She wouldnt contemplate leaving for better conditions elsewhere. ""I was one of the first to arrive at Idomeni. I don't want to lose an opportunity to pass"".

Its just that he wanted to be president  so she was going to do her utmost to make sure Ronnie got the chance.

In their 50-plus-year marriage, they never stopped dating. It was a lifelong continuation of their first meeting. For they met on a blind date, when he was the president of the Screen Actors Guild and her name had mistakenly showed up on a list of suspected communists in Hollywood.

Since her death on Sunday at age 94, many have commented they never saw any two people more in love than Nancy and Ronald Reagan. I thought the same. Their love and devotion constituted one of the great marriages of the American presidency. They always slept together in the same bed  and would have scoffed had someone suggested otherwise. They wrote love letters to each other. They served as a great balm to each other, becoming better people as each drew strength in the others presence.

She saw herself as his strongest advocate. Yet the serious advice she gave was invariably in private. One key reason that would prompt her to act was if she felt her husband was being ill-served by those around him. She felt his sunny optimism might keep him from grasping dangers around him.

It was pragmatic matters of personnel, rather than policy, that most often drew her attention. Nancy Reagan had originally suggested, for example, that her husband hire the Republican strategist John Sears, who had worked with President Richard M. Nixon. But when she decided that Sears was ineffective as Reagans 1980 presidential campaign manager, she began trying, at first tentatively, to fire him.

Later, as she developed more confidence in her judgment, Nancy Reagan played a major role in the ouster of Donald Regan from his job as White House chief of staff. As the Iran-Contra scandal played out during Reagans second term, she saw Regans actions as hurting rather than helping her husband.

She looked out for her husbands interests  personal as well as professional. Particularly after the 1981 assassination attempt, Nancy Reagan was vigilant when it came to her husbands health. And her efforts were proactive, as well as reactive.

For she knew that her husbands optimistic outlook might cause him to overlook physical dangers as well as professional. She worried even as Reagan enjoyed working at their California ranch well into his 70s. He would clear brush and often wanted, for example, to climb up onto the roof to fix it, or just clear it off. No matter how strongly she would caution him against it.

One afternoon, she needed to go into Santa Barbara, California, the nearest town, for some groceries. She warned Ronnie to stay safe while she was gone. She even told their ranch hand, Dennis Le Blanc, who was an old family friend, to make sure to keep Ronnie off the roof. Yet, she returned several hours later to find him, shirtless, up on the roof repairing tiles.

After Ronnie was stricken by Alzheimers, she tried to protect him here as well. She raised millions for Alzheimers research and fought to institute more stem-cell studies.

Perhaps her greatest role was in being her husbands protector and guide, as he descended into the abyss of Alzheimers. There was no glory in this, no media attention, no cheers of the crowd. Just a loving and tender wife caring for her loving and tender husband as he slipped inexorably away, away from the limelight.

Meanwhile, she was taking steps to make sure he was not forgotten, particularly with the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, which has served to host many Republican presidential debates. She co-operated on books about him and encouraged the lectures and talks that celebrated Ronnies achievements.

At the last, though, they simply wanted to be alone, together.

And now they are.

Nancy Reagan, RIP.",[]

Some 14,000 people are stranded there after new border restrictions were imposed along the Balkan migration route. Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia said on Tuesday (March 8) they would place new restrictions on the entry of migrants and Macedonia responded on Wednesday by closing its border completely to illegal migrants, a police official said. Ai walked around the makeshift camp speaking with the migrants - seeing for himself the difficult conditions they have to brave as they wait to cross over to Macedonia and continue their trek northwards to wealthier European states. Ai, known for his criticism of China's human rights record, said he was witnessing a ""huge, big violation of human rights"" in the middle of Europe. ""What we have seen here is almost unbelievable, you know. If you say this is in the middle of Europe, all the people stuck here, and there's no hope for them even to be transferred to anywhere else, you know. It's just in the rain, in the cold, and women, children, all the people waiting for some bread, or some dry clothes, and this is a very sad situation and people have no hope because the door is closed, totally shut off. I think this is a huge, big violation of human rights, right in front of us. I don't know what is going to come out from this, but in Lesbos people still come in thousands every day, and here nobody tells them what to do, and they stay here, still having hope to go to Germany or some other location, but I think, as the sky is getting darker and I don't think there's much hope for them,"" he said. People fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and beyond have flooded into the EU since early 2015, most making the perilous sea crossing from Turkey to Greece, then heading north through the Balkans to Germany. But a cascade of border shutdowns in the Balkans has caused the blocking of the so-called 'Balkans corridor' used by more than a million people since the migratory wave started a year ago. More than 34,0000 people are now trapped on Greece's islands and mainland. At an emergency EU-Turkey summit on Monday (March 7), aimed to stem the migrant influx to Europe, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told leaders of the bloc Ankara was willing to take back all migrants who enter Europe from Turkey in future in return for financial aid, faster EU entry talks and quicker visa-free travel for its citizens. EU leaders aim to work out key details with Turkey by the next scheduled summit on March 17-18.

Facebook Inc is acquiring Masquerade Technologies Inc, creator of the popular face-swapping app MSQRD, as part of efforts by the world's largest social network operator to build its video services.

NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Mesfin Getahun, an Ethiopian living in a remote refugee camp on Kenya's northern border, earns $10,000 a month from his wholesale and retail business and employs more than 30 people.

After arriving in the camp 15 years ago, he worked as a restaurant cleaner, slowly saving money for his own business, which sells food and household goods.

""Being a refugee is not a reason for being unsuccessful in business and life,"" he told the United Nations, which profiled him as one of several successful entrepreneurs in the huge camp of Kakuma, home to some 180,000 refugees from the region.

""All it takes is dedication and the will to work hard to achieve one's dream.""

Mesfin is part of what aid workers hope will become a new breed of refugees who can provide for themselves, boost local economies and relieve the pressure on an aid system buckling under the unprecedented number of global emergencies.

The United Nations is appealing for $20 billion in humanitarian aid in 2016, five times the amount it sought a decade ago, for crises stretching from Syria to a dozen African nations hit by drought.

""It's not the case that finance and humanitarian resources to respond don't exist,"" said Pete Manfield, regional representative for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

""It's that we are not adequately working with others, particularly at the local level, to find where capacities exist that are not being used.""

Manfield was speaking at the launch on Tuesday of an online platform linking the private sector in East Africa with aid agencies and local government to improve the response to emergencies.

Aid groups hope greater private sector involvement will cut costs and improve access to conflict zones like Somalia.

""If Coke has access to deliver Coke and we can't get vaccines in, surely theres a discussion (to be had),"" said Manfield.

NEW MODEL

The United Nations is piloting the new model for private sector-refugee cooperation in Kalobeyei, a 15 square kilometre (5.8 square mile) extension planned for Kakuma, which has become congested since civil war broke out in South Sudan in 2013.

Permission to extend Kakuma came with conditions attached, said Raouf Mazou, country representative for the United Nations refugee agency.

""The challenge that was given to us by the governor of Turkana was to say: 'Don't do another refugee camp... Do something which will serve both the host population and the refugee population',"" Mazou said.

The United Nations has replaced some of the food aid ration with cash so that local businesses can sell their products to the refugees.

It hopes Kalobeyei will become an urban settlement, not a camp, where both refugees and locals can live, do business and get services like electricity, Mazou said.

Solar lighting company D.light, which sells lights for as little as $5, has joined the East Africa platform.

""There's an opportunity to really create a sustainable market for renewable energy in these places,"" said Kate Montgomery, the company's director of global partnerships, adding that $2.1 billion a year is spent on fuel for displaced people around the world.

Companies like Unilever and Safaricom, Kenya's leading mobile phone service provider, are already making a good profit in Kenya's camps.

The Kakuma branch of Equity Bank, the Kenyan bank which has the largest number of depositors in East Africa, has 50,000 customers, both refugees and locals.

RIGHT TO WORK

The East African initiative reflects the global challenge of providing for refugees at a time when a record 60 million people have fled their homes because of violence, oppression or drought.

Kenya hosts the second largest number of refugees on the African continent, some having arrived as long as 25 years ago. Legally, all refugees must live in camps and they cannot work.

With limited funding for protracted displacements, the United Nations has repeatedly cut food rations for refugees in Kenya.

There have been tensions between poor locals living around the camps, who often suffer drought and hunger, and the refugees who receive free food, healthcare and education.

""The majority of refugees if given an opportunity... could fend for themselves,"" said Mazou. ""The support we provide to refugees has to be limited and has to lead to self-reliance.""

Refugees who set up businesses are usually better at rebuilding their lives when they return home than those who have depended on aid for 20 years, he said.

The Kenyan government remains cautious, fearing the initiative could encourage refugees to settle permanently in Kenya, competing with locals for jobs and government services.

""When you create permanence, the whole mentality and psychology of being in a place is entrenched,"" Tom Amolo, Political and Diplomatic Secretary in the Foreign Affairs Ministry, said at the launch.

""We will work with you... but it will also not detract or remove the primary responsibility of international organisations to do their part.""

Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports

A manufacturing operator works at the Mildronate (Meldonium) medication packaging process in the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, November 23, 2010.

LONDON, The medicine Maria Sharapova says she has taken for 10 years due to a family history of heart issues and diabetes is an old drug sold in just a few Eastern European countries that can also boost exercise tolerance.

The tennis star tested positive for the banned drug meldonium, or Mildronate, in a sample taken on Jan. 26, the day of her Australian Open quarter finals defeat by Serena Williams.

She said her family doctor had first given her the drug 10 years ago after she frequently became sick, had irregular electrocardiogram results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.

The 28-year-old Russian, a five-time grand slam champion and the highest paid woman in sports, will be provisionally suspended from March 12, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said.

For the health conditions Sharapova says she has, however, doctors say the scientific evidence for Mildronate is limited compared with many medicines widely available in Europe and the United States, where Sharapova trains, which have full regulatory backing and years of robust safety and efficacy data.

LATVIAN DRUG

Meldonium is cheap and available over the counter without a prescription in some eastern European countries, where it is marketed as Mildronate by the Latvian pharmaceutical firm Grindeks (GRD1R.RI).

The drug, originally developed by scientists at the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, is not licensed by two of the world's biggest medicines regulators: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States and the EU's European Medicines Agency.

A spokeswoman for Grindeks said the firm had not applied for a licence for Mildronate from either the FDA or the EMA, but the drug is registered in Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union.

She said it is designed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular diseases, including angina, chronic heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other cardiovascular disorders.

Grindeks' also promotes it for people with reduced working capacity due to physical or psycho-emotional ""overload"", and during recovery from cerebrovascular disorders, head injury and encephalitis. It is not indicated for diabetes.

Tim Chico, a consultant cardiologist at Britain's Sheffield University, said it was unlikely that such a young and extremely fit woman would be suffering from a serious heart condition like angina, or would be able to play top level tennis if she were.

Asked how long the drug should be given to a patient, the Grindeks spokeswoman said in an emailed statement: ""Depending on the patient health condition, treatment course of meldonium preparations may vary from 4 to 6 weeks"". Such courses could be repeated two or three times in a year.

In an emailed reply to questions from Reuters about her medical reasons for using the drug, Sharapova's lawyer John Haggerty said: ""While I cannot go into detail out of respect for the ITF process, I can confirm that Ms Sharapova had abnormal EKG tests in 2006 and was also diagnosed with asthenia (a lack of energy or strength), decreased immunity and diabetes indicators.""

""She also had a family history of heart conditions,"" Haggerty said. ""The Mildronate and the other medicines recommended by her doctor treated these conditions.""

Latvia expressed sadness over the banning of the drug.

""It's sad that there is such a situation, that this drug has been banned,"" said a spokesman for Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis. ""Especially given that is one of the most significant accomplishments of Latvian scientists in general.""

Ivars Kalvins invented the drug in the 1970s when Latvia was still a Soviet republic. He told a local newspaper in 2009 that it had been used to boost troops' fighting stamina in the 1980s. At that time Soviet forces were in Afghanistan.

Kirovs Lipmans, chairman of Grindeks, said use of the drug did not constitute doping and criticised the government for not defending its reputation.

Munir Pirmohamed, a professor of molecular and clinical pharmacology at Britain's University of Liverpool, said the crucial issue with Mildronate for him is its lack of approval from EU and U.S. regulators.

""As a physician, this is not something I have, or would ever, prescribe,"" he said.

Others noted it was rare for a doctor treating illness to prescribe a drug that is unavailable in the country where the patient lives.

""Sharapova has been a U.S. resident since early in her career, which does bring in a question of how or why she is using a drug that is not licensed there,"" said Tom Bassindale, a lecturer in forensic science at Sheffield Hallam University.

Sharapova's agent Max Eisenbud was not available at his Miami office and did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

HELPS MUSCLES COPE

Whatever its medical benefits, research suggests Mildronate may have potential as a performance-enhancing drug for sports.

It reduces the level of a metabolite called carnetine in muscles, and by doing that helps muscles cope better with high levels of stress and low oxygen levels.

""Because it effects the cellular metabolism, it would increase energy production within cells and therefore make oxygen utilisation more efficient,"" said Pirmohamed.

In a 2010 academic paper published in a review journal called Seminars in Cardiovascular Medicine and cited on the Grindeks company website, it has been shown to improve exercise tolerance in patients with heart problems.

The World Anti-Doping Agency, which banned the drug in January after previously having it on a ""watch list"", ranks it as a prohibited metabolic modulator and cites ""evidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance"".

Grindeks says the drug could protect athletes from cell damage, but it would be unlikely to improve their competitive performance.

It would be ""reasonable to recommend (sports people) to use meldonium as a cell protector to avoid heart failure or muscle damage in case of unwanted overload,"" the spokeswoman said.

Athletes ""should not expect increase of physical capacity, but, for sure, they will be protected against ischemic damages of cells in case of overload.""

He was considered the most successful music producer ever, cited in the Guinness Book of Records for having more than 50 No. 1 hit records over five decades in the United States and Britain alone.

He helped score, arrange, and produce many of the band's biggest hits, including ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand,"" ""A Day in the Life"", Yesterday, ""Eleanor Rigby"" and ""Love Me Do"".

""Im so sad to hear the news of the passing of dear George Martin,"" Beatle Paul McCartney said in a statement on Wednesday.

""If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle it was George.""

A statement from Martin's family confirmed he had died peacefully at his home on Tuesday evening.

Earlier, Ringo Starr, the Beatles' drummer, had announced his death on Twitter: ""God bless George Martin peace and love to Judy and his family... George will be missed.""

Starr followed the message by posting a black and white photo of the Fab Four with Martin, saying ""Thank you for all your love and kindness George.""

Martin served as producer, collaborator and mentor to Beatles John Lennon, George Harrison, McCartney and Starr.

Lennon was shot dead in New York in 1980. Harrison died of cancer in 2001.

Tributes from the music world poured in on Twitter. ""RIP to my musical brother George Martin. We were friends since 1964, & I am so thankful 4 that gift,"" said American music producer Quincy Jones.

Lenny Kravitz said: ""The legends are really going home!"" Boy George said: ""George Martin. Gentleman and legend"", while Mark Ronson said Martin was ""the greatest British record producer of all time.""

Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron said on Twitter: ""George Martin was a giant of music - working with the Fab Four to create the world's most enduring pop music.""

""YESTERDAY""

During his seven-decade career in the music industry, Martin produced almost all of the Beatles' recordings and also worked with Gerry & the Pacemakers, Shirley Bassey, Cilla Black, Jeff Beck, America, Cheap Trick and other acts.

Martin started work at Abbey Road Studios in 1950 producing records for EMI's Parlophone label.

He was noted for his comedy recordings with the likes of Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Beyond the Fringe and got his first Number 1 with The Temperance Seven in 1961. He signed The Beatles in 1962

The young band members were rough around the edges, but Martin saw their commercial promise and with them helped revolutionise the art of popular music recording.

His 1979 autobiography, ""All You Need Is Ears"", chronicles his discovery of the Beatles and their creative process.

Martin was knighted in 1996. In 2006, working with his son, Giles Martin, he helped develop the Beatles-inspired Cirque du Soleil show ""Love"" in Las Vegas, which went on to reap his two most recent Grammys.

LONDON The UK Supreme Court has ruled a ""contrived"" scheme used by Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and UBS UBSG.S> to allow the banks and their bankers to escape 135 million pounds ($192 million)in tax on bonuses was unlawful.

The arrangement, which dated back to 2004, involved bankers receiving bonuses in the form of shares in specially created companies, rather than cash, the UK's tax authority, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), said on Wednesday.

By making the bonus awards in this way, the banks hoped their employees would avoid making national insurance payments and benefit from an income tax break in a way which the Supreme Court said parliament had not intended it to be used.

""This is an important victory and confirmation from the UK's highest court that tax avoidance is simply unacceptable,"" junior finance minister David Gauke said in a statement.

""The UK is home to some of the worlds most successful banks and we have been clear we expect them and their employees to pay their fair share of tax,"" he added.

Revelations about how some very wealthy individuals and major corporations pay little tax on vast earnings  often legally -- has sparked public anger in recent years, putting pressure on the government and on HMRC, which lawmakers frequently say is too lenient on both tax evaders and avoiders.

A spokesman for Deutche Bank said it noted the decision and that all tax and national insurance relating to the scheme had already been paid.

UBS said it was disappointed by the ruling.

""This matter concerns a disagreement over the interpretation of highly technical tax legislation and dates back to a one-off compensation plan for 2003,"" a spokesman said.

OTTAWA Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday said he would neither fight Donald Trump, nor support him, but understood the Republican's appeal for people fed up with politics, who he said had also voted for controversial Toronto mayor Rob Ford.

Trudeau - who will visit Washington this week for talks with President Barack Obama - took office last November and will be in power when the next occupant of the White House takes over in January 2017.

Trudeau also suggested Trump might not be serious about policy platforms such as tearing up the North American Free Trade Agreement, which could badly damage Canada's economy.

""I'm not going to pick a fight with Donald Trump right now. I'm not going to support him either, obviously,"" Trudeau told a live forum hosted by the Huffington Post when pressed to condemn the Republican.

Trudeau said he was watching the United States closely ""to see how it deals with what is obviously a very real set of issues around frustration toward the body politic"" which had been seen around the world.

He cited the case of Ford, the former populist mayor of Toronto who gained global notoriety for admitting to smoking crack while in office.

""We had a mayor called Rob Ford here for a while and there's a lot of people who didn't get it. But he tapped into a very real and legitimate sense that people had around who politicians were,"" said Trudeau.

The prime minister seemed less concerned when asked about Trump's proposals to temporarily bar Muslims from the United States and deport millions of illegal immigrants.

""Let's see if the things that he needed to say in order to secure the Republican nomination are the same things he chooses to say in order to win the Presidency, if that's what happens,"" he said.

WASHINGTON Technology companies could face civil penalties for refusing to comply with court orders to help investigators access encrypted data under draft legislation nearing completion in the U.S. Senate, sources familiar with continuing discussions told Reuters on Wednesday.

The long-awaited legislation from Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, may be introduced as soon as next week, one of the sources said.

It would expose companies like Apple Inc, which is fighting a magistrate judge's order to unlock an iPhone connected to the mass-shooting in San Bernardino, California, to contempt of court proceedings and related penalties, the source said.

Senators are expected to circulate the draft bill among interested parties next week and hope to introduce it soon after, though a timetable is not final, the source said.

The Senators' proposal would not seek criminal penalties, as some media reports have stated, the sources said.

The controversial proposal faces an uphill climb in a gridlocked Congress during an election year and would likely be opposed by Silicon Valley.

Tech companies have largely supported Apple in its legal fight against the Justice Department, which is seeking access to a phone used by Rizwan Farook, one of two shooters in the San Bernardino attack last December in which 14 were killed and 22 wounded.

It is particularly unlikely the proposal will gain traction in the U.S. House of Representatives, which staked out positions strongly supporting digital privacy in the wake of revelations about government-sanctioned surveillance of communications by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.

Last year, amid stiff private sector opposition, the White House backed away from pushing for legislation to require U.S. technology firms to provide investigators with mechanisms to overcome encryption protections.

But the issue found renewed life after the shootings in San Bernardino and Paris. An August email from Robert Litt, the top U.S. intelligence community lawyer, obtained by the Washington Post, noted that momentum on the issue ""could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement.""

Separately, Democratic Senator Mark Warner and Republican Representative Michael McCaul last week introduced legislation to create a national commission to further explore solutions to the so-called going dark problem, where strong encryption has made it more difficult for law enforcement to access communications belonging to criminal suspects.

The contract is the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement, which divided up most of the Arab lands that had been under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. The world that document created exists now only on yellowed maps, and the issues left unsettled  primarily the need for separate Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish territories  have come home begging. War is not fixing this; diplomacy might.

In November 2014, I wrote the only solution to Islamic State was to use American peacekeepers to create a stable, tri-state solution to the Sunni-Shiite-Kurd divide inside Iraq.

However, in the intervening 15 months, Turkey and Russia entered the fight, and the Saudis may soon join the fray. Meanwhile, the United States and its allies  as well as Iraq, Islamic State and Iran  never left. Only a massive diplomatic effort, involving all parties now on the playing field, including Islamic State, has any potential of ending the bloodshed. That means a redivision of the region along current ethnic, tribal, religious and political lines.

A new Sykes-Picot Agreement, if you will.

The old Sykes-Picot Agreement was enforced by the superpowers of the day, Britain and France, with buy-in from Russia. The immediate aim was colonialism; the long-term goal stability, following the massive realignment of power that was World War One. The lines were literally drawn for the next nine decades.

Another important goal of the era, creating Kurdistan, never actually happened. The 1920 Treaty of Sevres left an opening for a referendum on Kurdish independence. Problem one: the referendum only included plans for Kurds outside of Syria and Iraq. Problem two: the referendum never happened, a victim of fighting that saw the Turkish people separate themselves from the remains of the Ottoman Empire and fight for two years to prevent the dismantling of what is now modern Turkey. The result was 20 million Kurds scattered across parts of modern Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Syria.

From a geopolitical perspective, heres what we have now: the 2003 invasion of Iraq blew open the struggle among the Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. It unleashed the forces behind some of the Arab Spring-driven chaos in Syria, and drew Iran deep into the Iraqi conflict. Shiite militia and Iraqi government attacks on Sunnis opened the door for Islamic State to step in as their protector.

The struggle metastasized into the ongoing, broader conflict. The Kurds are expanding the land they control, out of Iraq, and into Turkish and Syrian territory. The Turks look to repel that effort, and perhaps seize some territory to tidy up their own border with Syria. Russia has re-entered the region as a military force. The Saudis may yet send in troops. Iran is already there via proxy forces. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad still holds territory, but only alongside Islamic State. The United States is training, assisting and equipping groups often fighting each other.

That all has led to human suffering on a genocidal scale, including refugee flows no one seems sure how best to handle. The ongoing effort to bomb away the problems has resulted in destroying cities like Ramadi, Kobane, Homs, and soon Mosul, in order to save them. Four American presidents have made war in the region without concrete results, and Obamas successor will be number five.

The only answer left, the one not yet tried, is to negotiate a comprehensive resolution that addresses all of the issues, borders and struggles now underway. That resolution will need to be enforced with military power coordinated by the United States, Russia and Iran, with each speaking for, and agreeing to corral, its proxies.

It will mean giving Islamic State a seat at the table, as the British were forced to do with the Irish Republican Army in the 1990s to resolve the troubles in Northern Ireland. One, by definition, must negotiate peace with ones enemies. That is why, in part, the current ceasefire in Syria, which excluded Islamic State, has little chance of achieving any long-term progress.

Out of the new negotiations will have to emerge a Kurdistan, with land from Turkey, Iraq, perhaps Iran, and Syria. Assad will stay in power as a Russian proxy. Irans hold on Shiite Iraq will strengthen. A Sunni homeland, to include the political entity Islamic State will morph into, will need to be assured via a strict hands-off policy by Baghdad.

That Sunni homeland offers the first real way to geographically contain Islamic State. There obviously is risk in overtly allowing Islamic State to continue to exist, though that lives alongside the questions of whether it can be militarily destroyed, or if another group will simply take its place, as Islamic State did with al Qaeda in Iraq. These groups are symptoms of the broader Sunni-Shiite problem, not problems of their own per se.

The payoff of such a broad resolution will be a measure of stability, and a framework to enforce it. American efforts will shift from fanning the flames (American weapons are as ubiquitous as iPhones in the region) to putting out fires.

At risk for not acting: an empowered Islamic State, thriving on more chaos. An explosive dissolution of Iraq. A Russian-Turkish fight that could involve NATO. The shift from a Saudi-Iranian proxy war to a straightforward conflict between the two countries. A spark that forces Israel to act. A mini-world war, in the worlds most flammable region, that will create its own unexpected and uncontrolled realignment of power, and leave behind a warehouse of the dead.

Yes, I hate it, too. It is a very imperfect resolution. But an elegant solution is no longer viable.",[]

The Federal Reserve should remain on track to raise interest rates later this year despite the U.S. economy's weak start to the year and a stock market sell-off...

BOSTON The perpetrators of a $100 million digital heist at Bangladesh's central bank had deep knowledge of the institution's internal workings, likely gained by spying on bank workers, security experts said.

Unknown hackers breached Bangladesh Bank in early February, stole credentials for payment transfers and then ordered transfers out of a Federal Reserve Bank of New York account held by Bangladesh Bank, according to Bangladesh Bank officials.

Bangladesh government officials blamed the Fed for the attack when they disclosed the loss. The New York Fed responded on Tuesday saying there was no evidence its systems were compromised in the attack, one of the biggest bank thefts in history.

The Fed said it followed normal procedures when responding to requests that appeared to be from Bangladesh Bank, which were made and authenticated over SWIFT. Belgian-based SWIFT, a member-owned cooperative that banks use for account transfer requests and other secure messages, declined to comment on specifics of the case.

Security experts said that to pull off the attack, cyber criminals had to first gather information about Bangladesh Bank's procedures for ordering transfers, so that the fraudulent requests would not raise red flags.

In addition to stealing credentials for processing transfers, the hackers likely spied on Bangladesh Bank staff to get a deep understanding of the central bank's operations, according to experts in banking fraud.

Kayvan Alikhani, a senior director with security firm RSA, said that in addition to user names and passwords for accessing SWIFT, the hackers likely needed to obtain cryptographic keys that authenticated the senders.

Such certificates can be copied and used by impostors if they are not properly secured, he said.

You are only as good as your weakest link when getting access to the SWIFT network and doing a transfer, Alikhani said.

In a round of robberies disclosed last year, a group dubbed the Carbanak gang hacked into a number of banks around the world, seized control of computers that access SWIFT, then ordered fraudulent transfers.

They siphoned money through SWIFT after observing how bank employees crafted their messages so they could follow correct protocols, said Juan Guerrero, a researcher with Kaspersky Lab, which studied the campaign.

""The genius of the attacker in the Carbanak case is taking the time to learn directly from the victim and thus bypass fraud prevention measures through sheer mimicry, Guerrero told Reuters.

Another hacking method that could have been used is known as ""social engineering,"" where attackers play on human psychology to manipulate victims.

They get that information by hacking email accounts of employees who process transfers, said Tom Kellermann, a former member of the World Bank's security team.

""They sit and watch regular communications to understand when somebody would be most receptive to a specially crafted social-engineering email instructing them to make the transfer,"" said Kellermann, now chief executive of investment firm Strategic Cyber Ventures.

The opinions expressed are her own.

Raghuram Rajan is too important to lose. Under the Indian central bank governors watch, the countrys economy has been hailed as a bright spot in a turbulent world. Yet one of Rajans biggest tasks is far from complete. Confidence will take a hit if he doesnt stick around when his three-year term ends in September.

When Rajan took charge of the Reserve Bank of India in 2013, inflation was nearing double digits. Now it has almost halved. The governor has enshrined price stability as the central banks primary objective. Last month, the government formally proposed handing responsibility for setting interest rates to a monetary policy committee. The result will be a more credible institution that is less dependent on a strong chief.

The former University of Chicago professor may be less dispensable in other areas, however. Most notably, the RBI is leading a fight to fix Indias bad debt problem. Rajan has made waves by criticising tycoons who use their influence to keep rolling over loans even though they have little intention of repaying banks, many of which are state-owned.

Though lenders are recognising more of their loans as troubled, the true extent of the problem is not yet clear. There are also doubts whether the Indian governments 1.8 trillion rupee ($26.8 billion) plan to recapitalise state banks to meet global capital requirements by 2019 will be sufficient.

Its hard to identify equally qualified successors who could fill Rajans shoes. A new governor may find it harder to keep up the pressure on lenders. If banks go back to ignoring bad loans as they have done in the past, the countrys growth will suffer.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has the power to extend Rajans tenure by two years. Many of the governors predecessors served five-year terms. Though the two men have their differences  Rajan has lectured the government about the need to promote tolerance, for example  they appear to agree on key financial issues. Its not clear if Rajan wants to stay on. But Modi should certainly try to pin him down.",[]

MONROE, EUA Donald Trump ficou mais proximo de conquistar a nomeacao para ser o candidato republicano a presidente dos Estados Unidos em 2016 com as suas ultimas vitorias em primarias e, nesta quarta-feira, pediu para que as forcas dentro do partido contrarias a sua campanha o apoiem ou corram o risco de perder para os democratas em novembro.

O magnata do setor imobiliario adotou um tom mais conciliador em relacao a corrente principal republicana que tem resistido bastante ao seu avanco, apoiando primeiro candidatos favoritos que fracassaram nas votacoes e, depois, colocando dinheiro em campanhas contra ele.

""Se nos aceitarmos o que esta acontecendo e todo mundo se unir, em vez de gastar todo esse dinheiro nesses anuncios que, francamente, sao equivocados, e eles sao apenas anuncios falsos, disse Trump ao canal de TV Fox News. Se todo mundo se unir, ninguem pode derrotar o Partido Republicano. Nos seguiriamos para Washington.

Trump, o favorito para ganhar a nomeacao do partido para as eleicoes de 8 de novembro, elogiou o presidente da Camara dos Deputados, Paul Ryan, depois de falar com ele pelo telefone nesta semana, chamando o lider republicano de um bom homem. O gabinete de Ryan disse que o parlamentar esta telefonando para todos os candidatos republicanos para discutir uma pauta de politicas conservadoras.

Com as vitorias em previas na terca-feira, levando a importante Michigan e tambem Mississippi e Havai, o bilionario de Nova York, de 69 anos, se contrapos a uma semana de ataques vindos da corrente principal republicana e a previsoes de que a sua campanha poderia estar perdendo ritmo.

A vitoria convincente em Michigan restaurou o impeto da sua campanha, limitando o prospecto de as forcas anti-Trump do partido o pararem, no momento em que varias disputas relevantes se aproximam em 15 de marco.

Com as vitorias da terca-feira, Trump aumentou a sua vantagem em numeros de delegados, na busca dos 1.237 necessarios para levar a nomeacao. Trump tem agora 446 delegados, com o senador Ted Cruz, do Texas, em segundo lugar com 347, de acordo com o The New York Times.

Cruz, de 45 anos, que ganhou disputas suficientes para se apresentar como uma alternativa viavel a Trump, ganhou o apoio da ex-rival republicana Carly Fiorina nesta quarta-feira e fez um apelo para que republicanos anti-Trump facam o mesmo.

Se voce nao quer Donald Trump como candidato, se voce nao quer entregar a eleicao numa bandeja de prata para Hillary Clinton e os democratas, entao eu peco para que voce se junte a nos, disse Cruz em Miami.

Trump, ex-astro de um reality show, tem apimentado a sua campanha com ataques a rivais e criticos. Muitos republicanos tradicionais tem se ofendido com as suas declaracoes sobre muculmanos, imigrantes e mulheres, ao mesmo tempo que tem ficado alarmados pelas suas ameacas a tratados de comercio internacional.

Na disputa do Partido Democrata, Bernie Sanders surpreendeu a favorita Hillary Clinton numa vitoria apertada em Michigan, dando a sua campanha nova energia. Hillary venceu em Mississippi, mas a vitoria de Sanders em Michigan foi vista como um resultado que provavelmente resultara numa luta prolongada pela candidatura.

A campanha de Hillary Clinton tem sido afetada por causa do seu uso de um e-mail privado quando ela era secretaria de Estado. Num sinal de que o tema nao vai sair de pauta, o Comite Nacional Republicano entrou com um processo nesta quarta-feira para obter registros de Hillary e seus assessores.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 21:34:12+00:00,"Exclusive: Obama committed to Pacific trade deal, even as opposition spreads - Rice",['Roberta Rampton'],"U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice (C) joins President Barack Obama as he participates in a bilateral meeting at the State House in Nairobi, in this July 25, 2015 file photo.

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama is fully committed to pushing for Congress to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal despite anti-trade sentiment gaining steam on the presidential election campaign trail, National Security Adviser Susan Rice said on Wednesday.

Voter anxiety and anger over international trade and the 12-nation Pacific trade pact have helped propel the campaign of Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, as well as Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.

""The president remains fully committed to working to achieve ratification on the U.S. side and encouraging all of our TPP partners to move through their domestic processes to do the same,"" Rice told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.

For Obama, the TPP is a legacy issue, and standing firm on the pact reassures other nations with high expectations for the deal. At the same time, it highlights a division with Clinton, a close political ally, who has been grappling with Democratic anxiety about trade on the campaign trail.

Obama's commitment to the trade deal means that it will likely remain a hot campaign issue and exposes Clinton to trade-bashing rhetoric ahead of the Nov. 8 vote to elect Obama's successor.

Sanders has accused Clinton of backing ""disastrous"" trade policies that moved manufacturing jobs overseas, and questioned the sincerity of her opposition to the TPP since she became a presidential candidate.

Clinton had supported the trade pact when she was secretary of state during Obama's first term, but later said she was worried the deal would not do enough to crack down on currency manipulation or protect consumers from excessively high drug prices.

Sanders' unexpected victory in the Democratic primary in Michigan on Tuesday suggests that his criticism is resonating with some voters, and could spell trouble ahead for Clinton in states such as Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

Trump's anti-free trade rhetoric and promise to slap taxes on cars and parts shipped in from Mexico have also found support among Republican voters, helping him score a big victory in the party' primary in Michigan on Tuesday.

""There have been times - and this is one of them - where anti-trade sentiment has attained some salience in our domestic politics as well as in other countries,"" Rice said.

""There's been an evolution over the decades in the nature of trade agreements and in the caliber of trade agreements. And I'm not sure that that has fully been absorbed in the public mindset or the political discourse,"" she said.

Obama has repeatedly said that the TPP will expand markets for U.S. exporters and has high standards on labor and the environment that were not part of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.

Rice said policy makers face the challenge of being able to articulate the benefits of TPP and ""to not allow the sort of traditional 'old saws' of the critical narrative about trade to go unchallenged, when to a considerable extent they're based on agreements of the past.""

Rice made her comments ahead of a summit between Obama and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, a nation also wrestling with the merits of the TPP. The economy of Canada, the largest market for U.S. exports, is heavily reliant on open trade with the United States.

Gli altri due - Fausto Piano e Salvatore Failla - erano stati uccisi precedentemente in uno scontro a fuoco.

Britain's Queen Elizabeth attends the formal unveiling of the new logo for Crossrail, which is to be named the Elizabeth line, at the construction site of the Bond Street station in central London, February 23, 2016.

LONDON Buckingham Palace said it had launched an official complaint with Britain's press watchdog on Wednesday over a newspaper report that Queen Elizabeth backs a British exit from the European Union, saying the monarch remains politically neutral.

Under the front-page headline ""Queen backs Brexit"", The Sun newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying that Elizabeth had made her opposition to British membership of the EU clear on at least two occasions over the past decade.

""The Queen remains politically neutral, as she has for 63 years,"" the palace said in a statement. ""We will not comment on spurious, anonymously sourced claims. The referendum is a matter for the British people to decide.""

It said aides had taken the rare step of writing to the chairman of the Independent Press Standards Organisation to complain, citing a clause of the editors' code of conduct relating to accuracy.

Opinion polls show voters are divided over membership ahead of a June 23 referendum so even the perception that Elizabeth, who must remain above politics under Britain's unwritten constitution, may favor an exit from the 28-member bloc could be damaging for the campaign to keep Britain in.

The Sun, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, said the queen had told then Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg at a Windsor Castle lunch in 2011 that the EU was heading in the wrong direction.

Clegg called the report nonsense. ""I've no recollection of this happening & its not the sort of thing I would forget,"" he said on Twitter.

The newspaper, British's best selling daily which has repeatedly criticized Britain's EU membership, also said the monarch told lawmakers at a separate meeting that she did not understand Europe.

""The Sun stands by its story, which was based upon two impeccable sources and presented in a robust, accessible fashion. The Sun will defend this complaint vigorously,"" a spokesman said.

Less than a week before the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Elizabeth said she hoped Scots would think carefully about the future, a comment which was interpreted as giving support to those seeking to preserve the United Kingdom.

The queen is not the first royal to have been pulled into the increasingly febrile EU debate.

Her grandson Prince William was criticized by some papers, including the Sun, over a speech he gave to British diplomats last month about the importance of Britain working with other nations.

CAPE TOWN South Africa's Eskom will increase its capital expenditure by 44 percent to 324 billion rand ($21 billion) over the next five years to build new power stations, the state-owned company said on Wednesday.

The cash-strapped state-owned utility also said it had 85 billion rand of funding, representing nearly all of the capital needed, for 2016 and 2017 in a presentation to parliament.

""There is a significant amount of the funding that will be required over the next two years that is relatively committed already in terms of signed facilities that we can draw on as and when projects require the funding,"" said Anoj Singh, Eskom's chief financial officer.

Eskom is building three new power plants to help shore up power reserves in Africa's most industrialised country, and expects to add 5,620 megawatts (MW) to the network by 2018 when units at Medupi and Kusile's coal-fired plants come online.

Eskom, which was granted a lower tariff than it had requested of 9.4 percent by the electricity regulator, said it had significantly reduced the amount it spent on diesel to 40 million rand in February from 854 million rand in October, its CEO Brian Molefe said.

The company had also managed to save 9 billion rand and increased net profit 22 percent to 11.3 billion rand at the end of September and was not in danger financially, he said.

""Our liquidity position has improved. We are nowhere near bankruptcy as was said a few years ago,"" Molefe told parliament.

Reiterating his support for South Africa's proposed nuclear build plan, Molefe said the sole nuclear plant, Koeberg near Cape Town, provided the cheapest form of energy.

Speaking to reporters after Eskom's presentation, a senior energy official said government would request for proposals at the end of the month to add 9,600 MW of new nuclear power to the grid.

To meet its targeted nuclear generation capacity, South Africa's government has said it plans to build six new nuclear power plants by 2030 at a cost estimated between 400 billion rand and 1 trillion rand ($34-$84 billion).

Iranian state television showed footage of two Qadr missiles being launched from northern Iran, which the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said hit targets 1,400 km (870 miles) away.

Iranian agencies said the missiles were stamped with the Hebrew words, ""Israel should be wiped from the pages of history,"" though the inscription could not be seen on any photographs.

Clinton, a former secretary of state under President Barack Obama, said she was ""deeply concerned"" by the tests, the second round of Iranian missile launches in two days.

""Iran should face sanctions for these activities and the

international community must demonstrate that Iran's threats

toward Israel will not be tolerated,"" said Clinton, who is ahead in the race to be Democratic nominee at the Nov. 8 presidential elections.

Her call for sanctions reflected a tougher line against Iran's recent missile activity than that taken so far by the White House, which said it is aware of and reviewing reports of the Iranian tests, and would determine an appropriate response.

""We know that Iran is in a season of carrying out a number of military activities, and so it certainly would not be a surprise if there are additional launches over the next several days,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

The Iranian move on Wednesday came despite warning from the U.S. State Department after Tuesday's missile tests that Washington continues to ""aggressively apply our unilateral tools

to counter threats from Iran's missile program,"" a possible reference to additional U.S. sanctions.

Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Wednesday with Iran's foreign minister about the test-firing of two ballistic missiles, a State Department spokesman said.

The missile tests underline a rift in Iran between hard-line factions opposed to normalizing relations with the West, and

President Hassan Rouhani's relatively moderate government, which is trying to attract foreign investors to Iran.

ISRAEL IN MIND

Iran's IRGC said the missiles tested on Wednesday were designed with Israel in mind.

""The reason we designed our missiles with a range of 2,000 km is to be able to hit our enemy the Zionist regime from a safe distance,"" Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by the ISNA agency. The nearest point in Iran is around 1,000 km (600 miles) from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon told Israel Radio the tests showed Iran's hostility had not changed since implementing a nuclear deal with world powers in January, despite Rouhani's overtures to the West.

""To my regret there are some in the West who are misled by the honeyed words of part of the Iranian leadership while the other part continues to procure equipment and weaponry, to arm terrorist groups,"" Yaalon said.

Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee, said: Iran is making a mockery of President Obamas vow to confront Irans dangerous and illicit acts.

He urged Obama to ""aggressively enforce all sanctions against Irans missile programs, support for terrorism and human rights abuses. No more looking the other way.

Washington imposed sanctions against businesses and individuals in January over another missile test in October 2015. But the IRGC said it would not bow to pressure.

""The more sanctions and pressure our enemies apply ... the more we will develop our missile program,"" Hajizadeh said on state television.

The IRGC maintains dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles, the largest stock in the Middle East. It says they are solely for defensive use with conventional, non-nuclear warheads.

Tehran has denied U.S. accusations of acting ""provocatively,"" citing the long history of U.S. interventions in the Middle East and its own right to self-defense.

La CGT, Force ouvriere et une vingtaine de mouvements de jeunesse avaient appele a cette journee d'action qui s'est egalement traduite par le blocage de 90 lycees sur quelque 2.500 etablissements, selon les chiffres de l'Education nationale.

Parallelement a une greve des cheminots, dont les revendications portent sur les conditions de travail, 176 rassemblements ou defiles ont ete organises.

Les organisateurs evaluent le nombre de participants a 400.000, voire un demi-million d'apres le syndicat etudiant Unef, dont environ 100.000 a Paris, 20.000 a Toulouse, plus de 10.000 a Lyon, 6.000 a Rennes ou 15.000 a Bordeaux.

Le ministere de l'Interieur parle de 224.000 manifestants sur tout le territoire francais, dont 27.000 a 29.000 pour le cortege parisien, environ 10.000 a Toulouse, 7.000 a Lyon, 4.500 a Rennes et 9.000 a Bordeaux.

Les manifestants entendaient adresser un coup de semonce a l'executif, a cinq jours de la conclusion des consultations menees par le gouvernement sur ce projet de reforme, dont une partie de la gauche et des syndicats ne veut pas.

""Derriere moi et partout en France, c'est une premiere grosse mobilisation. On demarre fort et il faut donc continuer a elargir"", a declare Philippe Martinez, secretaire general de la CGT, interroge en tete du cortege parisien.

""Il appartient maintenant au gouvernement de prendre conscience du rejet de son projet et den tirer les consequences"", peut-on lire dans un communique de FO, qui promet de ""maintenir la pression"".

SOULAGEMENT AU GOUVERNEMENT

Mais le gouvernement peut pousser un soupir de soulagement, les jeunes ne s'etant, a ce stade, pas massivement mobilises.

""Nous regardons les choses avec serenite"", a dit sur iTELE le secretaire d'Etat aux Relations avec le Parlement, Jean-Marie Le Guen, qui a ajoute ""avoir vu des mobilisations plus fortes"".

A Lyon, le defile a donne lieu a des heurts entre manifestants et policiers, qui ont essuye des jets de pierre et riposte au moyen de gaz lacrymogenes. Trois personnes ont ete interpellees.

A Nantes, Marseille ou Rennes, des lyceens et des etudiants ont participe a ce mouvement, lance a l'origine par des organisations de jeunesse comme les syndicats Unef, Fidl et UNL et le Mouvement des jeunes socialistes (MJS).

""La jeunesse a un role a jouer pour entrainer le monde du travail avec elle car avec la loi El Khomri, on a atteint le point de non-retour et c'est tout le systeme qu'il faut remettre en cause"", disait Marine, une etudiante bordelaise.

Les organisations de jeunes ont prevu une autre journee d'action le 17 mars, nouveau test avant la vaste mobilisation du 31 mars, sous la forme de manifestations et de greves, a laquelle appellent a la fois les syndicats etudiant et lyceens et la CGT, FO ou la FSU.

L'humeur de la jeunesse est suivie attentivement par le gouvernement, dix ans apres le mouvement qui a contraint le Premier ministre d'alors, Dominique de Villepin, a retirer le contrat premiere embauche (CPE) sous la pression de la rue.

La CFDT, principal syndicat reformiste, n'est pas partie prenante a la mobilisation actuelle mais menace de durcir sa position si elle n'obtient pas une reecriture du texte, et notamment le retrait de l'article fixant un plafond pour les indemnites prud'homales en cas de licenciement abusif.

""J'invite (le gouvernement) a faire des arbitrages consequents avec des modifications substantielles, sinon la CFDT se mobilisera"", a dit Laurent Berger mercredi matin sur BFM TV.

Parallelement, la greve des cheminots a fortement perturbe le trafic, avec un train sur trois sur certains axes TGV et les lignes TER, Intercites, Transiliens. Le trafic est en revanche demeure quasiment normal pour le metro parisien.

MONTEE EN PUISSANCE ?

Le taux de participation a ce mouvement unitaire organise par la CGT, l'UNSA, la CFDT et SUD Rail s'elevait parmi les personnel a 35,5% selon la direction de la SNCF, et a environ 50% selon la Federation CGT des cheminots.

Pour Philippe Martinez, le report du 9 au 24 mars de la presentation du projet de loi en conseil des ministres pour rattraper l'absence de concertation en amont ne suffira pas.

""La CGT a presente un projet (...) On a des propositions tres concretes on peut en discuter des que ce texte-la est retire"", a-t-il declare sur France Inter.

Son homologue de FO, Jean-Claude Mailly, a reitere sur RTL sa demande de suspension du projet de reforme pour le remettre a plat : ""Maintenant ils veulent discuter mais 15 jours de report, (...) ca ne sert a rien.""

Il a predit une montee en puissance du mouvement de contestation si le texte est maintenu.

Selon l'entourage de Manuel Valls et ses interlocuteurs des derniers jours, le gouvernement est pret a ""bouger des curseurs"" mais sans remettre en cause l'equilibre general du texte.

Le president du Medef, Pierre Gattaz, a demande mardi au Premier ministre de ne pas ""denaturer"" un projet de loi considere par l'organisation patronale comme une ""rupture"" salutaire susceptible de relancer les embauches.

RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO A alta dos precos de alimentacao, transportes e habitacao mostrou algum alivio em fevereiro e a inflacao oficial brasileira desacelerou para o nivel mais baixo em quatro meses, em um reflexo da recessao que pode ajudar o Banco Central na tarefa de domar o avanco dos precos.

O Indice Nacional de Precos ao Consumidor Amplo (IPCA) registrou alta de 0,90 por cento em fevereiro, apos avancar 1,27 por cento no mes anterior, informou nesta quarta-feira o Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica (IBGE).

Em 12 meses, a alta acumulada do indice ate fevereiro foi a 10,36 por cento, desacelerando sobre os 10,71 por cento de janeiro.

Em ambos os casos, os resultados sao os mais baixos desde outubro do ano passado, quando o IPCA avancou 0,82 por cento na base mensal e 9,93 por cento em 12 meses, ultima vez em que ficou abaixo dos dois digitos.

Assim, os numeros comecam a dar algum folego as expectativas de que os precos comecariam a ceder depois de a economia brasileira ter registrado o pior desempenho em 25 anos no ano passado.

""A queda da atividade economica, com o aumento da taxa de desemprego, tem esse efeito sobre a inflacao, e ja observamos essa dinamica"", destacou o economista da Austin Rating Wellington Ramos.

Os resultados ficaram abaixo das expectativas em pesquisa da Reuters de avanco de 1,0 por cento na comparacao mensal e de 10,47 por cento em 12 meses.

ALIMENTOS

O maior destaque em fevereiro ficou para Educacao, com alta de 5,90 por cento como reflexo dos reajustes de inicio de ano, apos avancar 0,31 por cento em janeiro. Ja Alimentacao e Bebidas desacelerou o avanco em fevereiro a 1,06 por cento, de 2,28 por cento.

""Itens importantes como refeicao fora de casa, carne e cafe moido estao apresentando decrescimo. O que vemos e...uma limitacao do consumo por conta da conjuntura economica"", destacou a economista do IBGE Eulina Nunes dos Santos.

Apesar do alivio nos precos dos alimentos, que tem importante peso sobre a renda das familias, esse grupo mais Educacao responderam por 60 por cento do IPCA do mes, ou 0,54 ponto percentual.

Tambem apresentaram desaceleracao importante Transportes, para uma alta de 0,62 por cento sobre 1,77 por cento em janeiro, e Habitacao, cujos precos passaram a cair 0,15 por cento depois de subirem 0,81 por cento no primeiro mes do ano.

Ajudou nesse resultado de Habitacao o recuo de 2,16 por cento nas contas de energia eletrica diante da reducao no valor da bandeira tarifaria vermelha.

""A energia vai comecar a ajudar a inflacao uma vez que em marco a bandeira passou para amarela e em abril a bandeira tarifaria sera verde"", completou Eulina.

Apesar da forte recessao que o pais enfrenta, a inflacao deve terminar 2016 bem acima do teto da meta --de 4,5 por cento pelo IPCA, com margem de tolerancia de 2 pontos percentuais para mais ou menos-- pela segunda vez. A expectativa em pesquisa Focus do BC e de alta do IPCA de 7,59 por cento no final do ano.

Mesmo com a fraqueza da economia, diante da inflacao elevada, o BC manteve a Selic em 14,25 por cento ao ano pela quinta vez seguida, deixando claro que nao deve cortar a taxa basica de juros tao cedo.

A expectativa agora gira em torno da divulgacao da ata dessa reuniao, na quinta-feira. Mas o resultado do IPCA levou as taxas dos contratos de juros futuros a recuarem com forca nesta sessao, ja que a desaceleracao da inflacao alimenta expectativas de corte na taxa basica de juros para estimular a economia.

""Vemos o BC terminando este ano com reducao da Selic pelo fato de a recessao segurar a inflacao"", disse Ramos, da Austin Rating, calculando a Selic em 11,50 por cento ao final de 2016. Ja a pesquisa Focus aponta para Selic a 14,25 por cento no final do ano.",[]

SINGAPORE Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) is seeking 35,000 tonnes of Euro 4 diesel in a rare move to fill a supply void, traders said on Wednesday.

The tender, which closes on March 14, is for a 20,000-tonne cargo to be discharged at Paradeep port on April 9-13, and the remaining 15,000 tonnes to be discharged at Ennore port during the same period.

It is too early to determine whether BPCL will become a regular importer of the Euro 4 grade diesel, traders said, as it depends on price.

But this mirrored an unusual move by Indian Oil Corp (IOC) early last year when it sought to import petrol to cater to growing demand as the fuel was more expensive to buy from local refiners.

IOC, India's top refiner by capacity, went on to become a regular importer of petrol in 2015, adding to the supply tightness that affected the fuel last year.

But its imports have slowed this year following the start-up of its Paradip refinery.

Diesel supply, depending on grades, has been aplenty from Asia to Europe since last year, traders said.

India plans to go straight to Euro 6 diesel (and petrol) by 2020 from the current Euro 4 fuels in major cities and Euro 3 fuels across the rest of the country in a move to combat pollution.

BPCL owns refineries in Kochi and Mumbai.

reuters.com,2015-09-15 22:32:07+00:00,Big Investors on Campus: Why VCs are scouting student startups,['Reuters Editorial'],"For decades, venture capital firms followed a standard playbook: target promising startups as they hit their stride and invest up to $10 million or so for a series A round. But the rules were changing in 2009, when Sequoia Capital helped raise $2 million for use by Y Combinator, a seed funder gaining a high-profile reputation for making small $20,000 bets on startups such as Dropbox and Scribd, both of which were conceived of by college kids.

To identify other promising investments, VCs began paying attention to the earliest point in the tech life cycle: the moment when company founders were still developing ideas in dorm rooms.

The rest of Silicon Valley's Sand Hill Road, the preferred address for top venture firms, has followed suit. By 2011, Xfund, a collaboration between New Enterprise Associates, Accel Partners and Breyer Capital, launched a $100 million fund and set up two offices, one on Brattle Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts (home to MIT and Harvard) and the other in Menlo Park, California, down the street from Stanford's campus. ""It's a kind of embedded situation that is unique,"" says Patrick Chung, co-founder and general partner at Xfund.

Xfund has to compete with two other Stanford-focused funds: StartX, an accelerator directly affiliated with the university, and Dorm Room Fund, which has outposts in four cities, including the Bay area. Students run the latter fund and it's backed by First Round Capital, a San Francisco VC which has funded Uber, Gigya and TaskRabbit.

Whereas most VCs prefer founders with engineering or computer science degrees, Xfund partner Chung seeks out liberal arts majors, often from Harvard.

Building an innovative product often doesn't come down to technical chops, he argues, but the ability to perform cross-discipline thinking. ""There is a whole class of entrepreneurs who are being ignored,"" Chung says. Harvard startups have comprised about 25 percent of Xfund's investments, with 20 percent coming from MIT, 10 percent from Stanford and another 7 percent from University of California, Berkeley.

At Lightspeed Venture Partners, another Sand Hill Road firm, the partners founded a summer fellowship program in 2007 that grants nascent student-run companies up to $50,000 to work on their product in Silicon Valley for three months. Lightspeed manages $3 billion and its recent successes include Snapchat, Nest and GrubHub. Pinterest is the best known product to come out of Lightspeed's summer fellowship. Stanford provides the program more entrepreneurs than any other school, and Lightspeed associate partner David Dubick says that's due to his firm's across-the-street proximity to Stanford's campus, as well as word-of-mouth marketing that gives the fellowship program more visibility on campuses where alumni already exist. Last summer's program included student teams from Stanford, MIT, UCLA and the University of Illinois.

Related Coverage  Special Report: At Stanford, venture capital reaches into the dorm

It's not necessarily true that the students at Stanford make better entrepreneurs, says Dubick. ""But investors latch onto patterns that have worked in the past."" Sometimes, Dubick notes, the best entrepreneurs come from out-of-the-way schools ""where not everybody is mining the waters.""

In that spirit, one of Lightspeed's newer portfolio companies, Handshake, comes from graduates of Michigan Tech, a school so far north that it's a nine-hour drive from Detroit. The career services startup helps businesses find and hire talented university students, and after drawing $3.5 million in seed funding, has more than 60 university clients and 20,000 employers on board.

For other VCs, regional preferences play a role. St. Louis's Cultivation Capital, which manages $105 million, watches Midwest schools where big West Coast investors have blind spots. Cultivation looks to Washington University in St. Louis for life sciences startups. One of Cultivation's partners is a senior lecturer at Wash U, and the firm's full-time recruiter also works on the school's placement staff, helping Cultivation pick up early leads.

Brian Matthews, managing partner for Cultivation's tech funds, stays tight with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, a place whose alumni have produced hits such as Netscape, PayPal, Yelp and YouTube. Matthews or his principals talk to engineering professors or staff in the commercialization office at least once a month. He also speaks regularly with two venture funds based at UIUC.

In San Diego, far down the coast from Sand Hill Road, Avalon Ventures scouts the University of California San Diego for life sciences companies and development. The firm, which has $750 million under management, has completed three deals with UCSD companies in the past several years, with two exits, one of them an IPO. ""It's about having those relationships with faculty and the tech transfer offices,"" says Jay Lichter, Avalon's managing director. ""But you have to do more than stop by once a month, it's about your reputation at the school. When you say you're going to do a deal, you have to follow through and do the deal.""

Sequoia has gone even farther, bringing on ""student ambassadors"" at 8 to 10 campuses across the country. These tech and entrepreneurially focused students let Sequoia know when interesting startups take root on campus-and they also make recommendations on the kinds of activities Sequoia should participate in to build a name at the school. Says Sequoia partner Bryan Schreier: ""We try to do just a few things on campus, but we want them to really count.""

reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:27:52+00:00,Exclusive: Bank of America hiring bankers for new middle-market push - sources,"['Dan Freed', 'Olivia Oran']","Bank of America Corp is hiring a new team of investment bankers who cater to mid-size companies, four years after dismantling a similar business, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The precise number of middle-market bankers it plans to add could not be determined, but one person said it would be fewer than 10.

The hiring comes as Bank of America is reducing staff more broadly, while also trying to grow in areas where it believes it can gain market share. As the second-biggest U.S. lender with a large commercial banking business, executives believe Bank of America can make inroads in advising mid-sized companies on mergers and stock and bond offerings, the sources said. Middle-market deals are generally considered transactions worth less than $500 million.

The bank also hopes the push will lead to additional business such as managing money for executives at mid-sized companies. Sources asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media about matters that have not been made public.

Bank of America announced internally last year that Vice Chairman Mark Stephanz would create a group that provides investment banking services to mid-size companies. The hiring is part of that effort. His team will work together with counterparts in the commercial bank who provide traditional loans and cash management services, sources said.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender previously launched a middle-market business in 2007, with over 30 investment bankers who focused on mergers and acquisitions. It abandoned the effort in 2012 to focus on larger clients and bigger deals, sources said.

In 2015, Bank of America ranked fourth in global M&A league tables, according to Thomson Reuters data. It ranked 23rd globally for middle-market deals.

Bank of America generated around 17 percent of its M&A fees from middle market deals, the lowest percentage of any big Wall Street bank except Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Last year, M&A hit a record volume of nearly $5 trillion, due to mega deals like Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA's $106 billion acquisition of SABMiller Plc and oil firm Royal Dutch Shell Plc's $70 billion purchase of BG Group Plc.

But some Wall Street executives predict blockbuster deals will slow down this year. In January, JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said she expects to see fewer giant mergers and more mid-sized deals.

Bank of America has been hiring salespeople to drum up business, even as it has cut support staff and underperformers as part of a multi-year cost-cutting initiative. Last year alone, it cut more than 10,000 jobs.

The bank laid off a number of investment bankers on Tuesday because of weak markets, one of the sources said.

International Cricket Council (ICC) Chief Executive David Richardson gestures as he speaks during a news conference in New Delhi, India, March 9, 2016.

NEW DELHI The most anticipated match of the World Twenty20 between hosts India and arch-rivals Pakistan was shifted to Kolkata on Wednesday over concerns about security in the original venue for the March 19 clash at Dharamsala.

The marquee contest between the neighbours ran into trouble with Indian war veterans in the state of Himachal Pradesh, where Dharamsala is located, opposing the hosting of a match against Pakistan after militants killed seven security personnel in a Jan. 2 attack on the Indian Air Force base at nearby Pathankot.

Pakistan said on Wednesday it had arrested several members of the Jaish-e-Mohammad militant group, which is suspected of masterminding the attack near Dharamsala and 25 km (16 miles) from the Pakistan border.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) delayed the departure of the men's and women's teams and sent a delegation to review security at Dharamsala, which boasts one of India's most beautiful stadiums with snow-capped mountains in the background.

After Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh's warning of possible disruption, the organisers took the ""difficult decision"" to shift the contest from the picturesque sleepy hill town to Kolkata's usually boisterous Eden Gardens.

""We looked at the security situation and we agreed in the end that the level of uncertainties that exist around that match was too great to take a risk,"" International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive David Richardson told reporters.

""The safety and security of the event is of paramount importance to the ICC and we've taken into consideration the concerns shared with us by our security advisors as well as the Pakistan Cricket Board.""

Richardson, however, all but ruled out a sanction against the state cricket association in Himachal Pradesh.

""We had to make this decision for safety and security reasons. I don't think it's reasonable to suggest that we'll be taking disciplinary action against the state association in that province.""

The ICC official said the organisers were still awaiting an absolute assurance from Pakistan of their participation in the sixth edition of the tournament.

""The decision has just been conveyed to them... We are now obviously very hopeful that they would now board the plane and come to the event.""

BITTER NEIGHBOURS

Top cricket countries have refused to tour Pakistan since 2009 when gunmen attacked a bus carrying a visiting Sri Lanka team near Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium.

Shaharyar Khan, the PCB chairman, had said on Monday that there was no question of the country not playing in the tournament but that other venues needed to be considered to replace Dharamsala.

Pakistan and India have fought three wars since becoming separate countries in 1947, two of them over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.

Bilateral cricketing ties between the neighbours remain suspended after gunmen killed 166 people in Mumbai in a three-day rampage in 2008 which India blames on a Pakistani militant group.

Pakistan's cricket team have in the past received a hostile reception in Mumbai, venue of the second semi-final of the World Twenty20 which got underway on Tuesday, where members of a regional political party dug up a pitch in 1991 on the eve of a test match.

Richardson said if Pakistan reached the last four they would play their semi-final in New Delhi on March 30.

""If Pakistan makes the semi-finals, their semi-final won't be played in Mumbai,"" Richardson said.

""We've chosen the venues where Pakistan is due to play very carefully, taking into account safety and security issues.""

Pakistan open their tournament on March 16 against a qualifying team in Kolkata before the match against India three days later. They will also face New Zealand on March 22 and Australia on March 25, with both of those matches in Mohali.

As this Reuters graphic shows, once debt is factored in, the Verizon acquisition is just the 13th biggest global deal so far this year. A number of the top 10 deals arent as much mergers as piecemeal purchases of desirable parts of one companys business, and its unclear whether AOL will be kept intact or disassembled for parts.

So far, Verizon hasnt done much to telegraph its intentions for AOL, though cannibalizing and/or relaunching some of the companys components seems an option. AOL has discussed spinning off The Huffington Post, which is valued at as much as $1 billion, and many analysts see AOLs mobile advertising capabilities as the companys main asset.

AOLs 2000 merger with Time Warner is generally regarded as a catastrophe, but those who bet on the company when it was subsequently spun back off look have made out pretty well.

""We have a love affair with the UK. I mean we've had it since 1964 ... they [British fans] understand our music, they understand us,"" Gordy told Reuters, when asked about Motown's appeal across the Atlantic.

""UK is fabulous, we have so many great memories here.""

Gordy, 86, was accompanied by Robinson to the London premiere, and both received a standing ovation from the audience at curtain call.

Asked what was the secret behind Motown's success, Gordy said: ""Probably love ... and great poetry and music by this guy right here,"" pointing to Robinson.

From rhythm and blues, soul music as well as pop later on, the Motown Sound features a string of popular hits made famous by the label's African-American stars, who also influenced U.S. culture during the civil rights era with their songs.

On Broadway, the musical opened to strong box office sales and got four Tony Award nominations. The London show is taking bookings to February 2017.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 00:08:10+00:00,"No Obama meeting with Fidel Castro, dissident talks on track: White House","['Matt Spetalnick', 'Jeff Mason']","A picture of former Cuban President Fidel Castro is seen inside a private shop under refurbishment in Havana, February 24, 2016.

WASHINGTON The White House has ruled out an encounter between President Barack Obama and revolutionary leader Fidel Castro in Cuba this month and is confident the Cuban government will not create obstacles to a meeting between Obama and dissidents in Havana, a top adviser said on Wednesday.

Despite the goal of improving ties between former Cold War foes, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Obama would not use his trip to meet Cuba's demands that he shutter Radio and TV Marti, U.S. broadcasters created to transmit anti-communist programing to the island nation.

Obama plans to hold talks with Cuban President Raul Castro during his historic March 20-22 visit but will not meet with Castro's brother, a legendary figure who took power in a 1959 revolution and led Cuba for 49 years.

""We've had no discussion about that meeting taking place, and we certainly wouldn't seek it,"" Rhodes, who was one of the negotiators in secret talks that led to a thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations, told Reuters in an interview.

Asked if a meeting was ruled out, Rhodes said: ""Yes.""

A meeting with the elder Castro could overshadow a trip that is meant to focus on the future of the U.S.-Cuba relationship rather than its troubled past. Castro, 89, stepped down from power after a series of health problems and rarely leaves his Havana home, though he occasionally meets visiting dignitaries.

The White House has said previously it did not expect a Fidel Castro meeting to occur but did not say it was ruled out.

The administration made clear when it set up Obama's trip that he would meet with anti-government dissidents in Havana despite the Cuban leadership's objections to what it sees as meddling in the country's internal affairs.

Rhodes said the list of participants had not been finalized and the meeting would take place in a U.S. facility, which suggests the U.S. embassy or ambassador's residence.

That meeting would take place after official events with Raul Castro.

Cuban dissidents in the past have reported being detained in their homes or picked up by police en route to major international events such as summits or papal visits, but Rhodes said he did not anticipate that happening for Obama's trip.

""We haven't worked out the logistics, but ... they have not suggested that they will throw up those types of obstacles,"" he said, adding the United States would be watching whether Cuba detained or harassed activists in connection with the visit.

Two of Cuba's most prominent dissidents, Berta Soler and Jose Daniel Ferrer, were detained on Tuesday, according to dissident groups.

Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, on Wednesday met with Cuban-American activists and U.S. human rights advocates and told them Obama would meet Cuban ""independent civil society"" representatives chosen by his aides, the White House said.

OUTSTANDING DIFFERENCES

Obama's Republican critics have accused him of playing down human rights concerns in order to pursue rapprochement with Cuba, which began in December 2014 and is now seen as a major piece of his foreign policy legacy.

The Cuban government has done little to reciprocate for a series of U.S. measures that eased restrictions on U.S.-Cuba travel and trade. It is unclear whether it will make any large gestures during Obama's visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president since 1928.

Rhodes countered that the outreach to Cuba was aimed at helping the local population while opening up commercial opportunities for Americans.

The administration plans to roll out further measures next week to chip away at decades-old restrictions to commerce.

Obama also wants to lift the embargo on Cuba, which is only possible through congressional action. Republican leaders in Congress oppose such a move.

Other differences remain. The Obama administration is not considering returning the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay to the Cuban government, and Rhodes said it would not make changes to the Radio and TV Marti broadcasters at this time.

Both issues are irritants that the Cubans consider obstacles to full normalization with Washington.

""The Cubans don't like Radio Marti and TV Marti for sure,"" Rhodes said. ""There's only so much you can get to.""

The U.S. government launched Radio Marti in 1983 and later added TV Marti to transmit anti-communist news and information into Cuba, where the government has a monopoly on the media.

A decision on whether to put an end to a U.S. program that encourages Cuban doctors and nurses on overseas assignments to defect was not tied to the trip either, Rhodes said.

STILL AND MOVING IMAGE MONTAGE OF CHARLIE HEBDO AND PARIS NOVEMBER ATTACKS AND TRIBUTES WITH ENGLISH CAPTIONS STORY: A year after Islamist militants attacked satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket in Paris, France has been commemorating the victims with eulogies, memorial plaques and another cartoon lampooning religion. Heavy security has been planned for the ceremonies honouring the 17 victims of the January 7-9, 2015 gunfire sprees in the French capital, which proved to be a grim forerunner of the suicide bombings and shootings in the city 10 months later in which 130 people died. Charlie Hebdo, known for its satirical covers gleefully ridiculing political and religious leaders, lost many of its top editorial staff when two Islamist militants broke into an editorial meeting on January 7, 2015 and fired bullets at them. Another militant murdered a policewoman the next day, took hostages at the HyperCacher supermarket on January 9, 2015 and killed four of them before police shot him dead. Other police cornered the escaped Charlie Hebdo gunmen in a printing plant north of Paris and killed them that same afternoon. Charlie Hebdo put out a special edition with a cover cartoon showing an angry God with blood on his hands and a Kalashnikov automatic rifle strapped to his back with the headline reading ""One year later, the assassin is still on the run"". An editorial, released before publication on Wednesday, said the magazine would continue despite religious extremists who wanted to muzzle it. ""They won't be the ones to see Charlie die - Charlie will see them kick the bucket,"" it declared. The attacks prompted a worldwide solidarity movement, with the ""Je Suis Charlie"" (I am Charlie) slogan going viral on social media. In the second wave of attacks on November 13, 2015, Islamist militants killed people in Paris cafes and a concert hall and attacked a stadium in what was the nation's worst post-war atrocity. On Tuesday (January 5), President Francois Hollande attended a low-key ceremony unveiling commemorative plaques at the main sites of the January 2015 attacks. He is due to unveil another plaque in memory of the murdered policewoman on Saturday (January 9). On Sunday (January 10), a more public ceremony is planned at Place de la Republique, the square in eastern Paris that attracted mass rallies in favour of free speech and democratic values after the attacks and became an informal memorial.",[]
reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:48:09+00:00,Trump rebounds in White House race; Sanders surprises Clinton,['Ginger Gibson'],"MONROE, N.C. Republican leaders opposed to Donald Trump becoming the party's U.S. presidential candidate warned on Wednesday that the billionaire businessman could become unstoppable if he wins two crucial nominating contests next week.

One of Trump's fiercest critics in the Republican Party, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, said that if the billionaire businessman extends his winning streak into crucial contests next week, the New Yorker's path to the nomination was all but inevitable.

""I'm worried that if we lose Florida and Ohio he may be unstoppable,"" said Graham, a former Republican candidate who was among the party's large field of early White House hopefuls.

With victories in nominating contests on Tuesday in three out of four states, Trump maintained his lead over the three remaining challengers in the race to be the Republican candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election.

On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton's surprise loss to Bernie Sanders in the important Michigan primary laid bare growing voter anger over trade, raising warning flags for her ahead of a possible election showdown against Trump.

On Wednesday, the often-combative Trump struck a more conciliatory tone toward the Republican establishment that has fiercely resisted his advance - first by backing favourite candidates who failed to win votes, then by pouring money into campaigns against him.

""If we embrace what is happening and everyone came together, instead of spending all this money on these ads ...,"" Trump told Fox News. ""If everyone came together, no one could beat the Republican Party. We would walk into Washington.""

He also praised U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan after speaking with him by phone this week, calling the Republican leader a ""good man.""

Trump, 69, fended off a week of attacks from the party's establishment and defied predictions his campaign might be losing steam with his primary wins on Tuesday in Michigan, the biggest prize of the night, as well as Mississippi and Hawaii. His closest challenger, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, won Idaho.

Trump's convincing win in Michigan narrowed prospects for the party's anti-Trump forces to stop him before next Tuesday's contests, which also include Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri.

Trump now has 458 of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination, with Cruz second with 359 delegates, according to the Associated Press. Rival Marco Rubio trails with 151 delegates, while John Kasich is far behind with 54.

ENDORSEMENTS: ANY ONE BUT TRUMP

Cruz, with enough primary victories to present himself as a viable Trump alternative, won the endorsement of former Republican rival Carly Fiorina on Wednesday and appealed to anti-Trump Republicans to back him.

""If you don't want to see Donald Trump as the nominee, if you don't want to hand the election on a silver platter to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, then I ask you to join us,"" Cruz said.

Trump, a former reality TV show host, has peppered his campaign with put-downs of rivals and critics. Many mainstream Republicans have been offended by his statements on Muslims, immigrants and women and alarmed by his threats to international trade deals.

But Cruz, 45, is a hard alternative for some of the mainstream Republican leadership to get behind. A fiscal and social conservative, he is unpopular with fellow senators who were targets of his personal attacks and who blame him for orchestrating a government shutdown in 2013 in a failed attempt to derail President Barack Obama's healthcare reforms.

In January, Graham called a choice between Trump and Cruz like ""being shot or poisoned."" But the senator softened his tone on Wednesday, saying it had become increasingly clear that ""Ted Cruz is the most viable alternative to Donald Trump.""

An aide to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who dropped out of the race last month, said Bush would meet with Cruz, fellow Floridian Rubio, and Kasich, governor of Ohio, in Miami before the March 15 contests. It was not clear if he planned to make an endorsement.

Clinton, 68, won in Mississippi, but the victory in Michigan by her opponent from Vermont was expected to prolong the fight to pick a candidate.

Clinton holds a sizable delegate lead, with 1,221 compared with Sanders' 571. She has been helped by winning Southern states by big margins and keeping most of her losses narrow.

Clinton's campaign has been dogged by questions over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and - in a sign the issue will not go away - the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit on Wednesday seeking emails between Clinton and her aides.

Trump could open a sizable delegate lead if he is able to win next Tuesday in Florida, Ohio, or Illinois, states that allot all their delegates to the winner.

Kasich, 63, of Ohio, and Rubio, 44, of Florida, could throw a wrench into Trump's delegate stash if they win in their home states next week.

ATLANTA Bobbi Kristina Brown's former boyfriend Nick Gordon has been wrongly targeted in the criminal probe of her 2015 death despite his efforts to save her life after finding her unresponsive in a bathtub in her Georgia home, his lawyers said on Tuesday.

The lawyers called on prosecutors to end speculation that the death of late pop singer Whitney Houston's daughter resulted from any criminal behaviour on Gordon's part.

""The truth is that Nick tried to save Bobbi Kristina's life. The truth is that Nick cooperated with law enforcement since day one,"" said lawyers Joe Habachy and Jose Baez.

""The Fulton County District Attorney's office has tried to make Nick a murderer despite having clear and convincing evidence that Bobbi Kristina's death was nothing more than a tragic accident,"" they added in a joint statement.

Fulton County prosecutors have said the investigation into Brown's death is ongoing but have not named any targets of their probe. The office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.

Brown was the only child of R&B singer Bobby Brown and Houston, who drowned in a hotel bathtub in Beverly Hills, California in 2012 at age 48. Bobbi Kristina Brown was 22 at the time of her death.

Autopsy results released last week did not say whether her death resulted from an accident or an intentional act such as suicide or homicide.

The circumstances under which she entered a bathtub in her north Atlanta home were unknown, the autopsy report said, leading the medical examiner to classify her manner of death as undetermined.

The autopsy showed evidence of recent cocaine use, as well as other drugs and alcohol in her system.

Gordon and Bobbi Kristina referred to each other as husband and wife, but Bobby Brown said they never legally married. Gordon said he was barred from visiting her during the six months she spent in a coma before her death last July.

In a lawsuit filed by the conservator of Bobbi Kristina Brown's estate, Gordon has been accused of causing her death and stealing from her bank account while she was in the coma.

""The truth is that no one loved Bobbi Kristina more than Nick and no one has suffered more as a result of her death then Nick,"" his lawyers said.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 19:34:05+00:00,Government loses parliamentary vote on longer Sunday trading hours,['Reuters Editorial'],"EDINBURGH/LONDON British Prime Minister David Cameron was rebuffed in parliament on Wednesday when members of his own party joined with opposition lawmakers to block government plans to allow shops to open for longer on a Sunday.

In sometimes angry exchanges, lawmakers from all sides said there was little demand for such changes, which would put pressure on shop staff to work longer hours.

Cameron's party is already divided over a June 23 vote on whether Britain should remain in the European Union.

Despite the proposed changes referring to England and Wales, the Scottish National Party voted with the rebels.

""Sunday is still special for many and the government should ... ensure that there is a proper place for Sundays, for families, for businesses and for workers,"" Conservative lawmaker David Burrowes, who led the rebellion, said during a three-hour debate.

Under current laws, large stores in England and Wales can open for only six hours on a Sunday. The rules were suspended during the London Olympics in 2012, a change the government said had led to a surge in sales.

The government had planned to give local authorities the power to relax the rules on Sunday trading in their area, and tried to stave off a rebellion by offering a pilot scheme first in a small number of areas.

Many anticipated a domino effect as neighbouring areas had to follow suit or lose business.

The government says the boom in online shopping means high street retailers should be able to open longer to compete.

The SNP, which runs Scotland's devolved government, says it is not opposed to extended Sunday opening as it already exists in Scotland, but objected to the potential loss of income for shop staff who work for employers operating throughout the UK, with UK-wide employment conditions.

More generous pay for working on a Sunday in Scotland could be in jeopardy, they argue.

""As someone who works 9-5, Monday to Friday, I appreciate being able to shop at the weekend. But it would be a shame if people here (in Scotland) have their pay cut because it's been extended to the rest of the country,"" said Anna Grant, 36, a design studio manager, shopping in central Edinburgh.

A report from economic consultancy Biggar Economics said Scotland's workforce could lose 74 million pounds per year because of Sunday trading changes south of the border, with each Scottish worker losing around 1,300 pounds annually.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:58:56+00:00,Myanmar on edge as long wait for new president ends,['Timothy Mclaughlin'],"Myanmar's National League for Democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi arrives for the opening of the new parliament in Naypyitaw February 1, 2016.

NAYPYITAW Four months after Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won a crushing electoral victory over a government made up of former generals, Myanmar's citizens should finally find out who their new president will be on Thursday.

It won't be Suu Kyi. The NLD leader and Nobel peace prize laureate is barred from holding the office under a junta-drafted 2008 constitution because her children are not Myanmar citizens.

The wildly popular Suu Kyi has said that she will run the country regardless through a proxy she would name as president. But she and the NLD leadership have kept the identity of their nominee a closely guarded secret even from rank-and-file MPs.

They have done so partly out of fear a rushed and overly enthusiastic reaction to the election victory could put the sensitive transition at risk. In 1990, the military tossed out results of an election that the NLD won and remained in power.

Suu Kyi has repeatedly said she hoped to reach a compromise with the armed forces that would allow her to assume the presidency.

But talks since the election to bridge the differences failed, sources in her camp said, leading to a deepening rift between Suu Kyi and the military.

The secrecy has fueled a presidential guessing game in a country keen to see the NLD, many of whose members were jailed during years of military rule, complete its transition from democracy movement to ruling party.

Lawmakers from the NLD-dominated parliament that sat for the first time on Feb. 1, said on Wednesday they were eager for the nomination process to get under way.

""It is a very big change, like the Magna Carta,"" said Myint Lwin, a lower house lawmaker from the NLD. ""I'm proud to be involved in this history.""

Speculation on the NLD presidential nominee has ranged from Suu Kyi's personal physician to her chief-of-staff. In recent days, it has focused on her close friend Htin Kyaw. He runs the Daw Khin Kyi Foundation, a charity to assist people in Myanmar's poorest areas founded by Suu Kyi and named after her mother.

RECONCILIATION GESTURE

Three presidential candidates will be nominated on Thursday - one by the lower house, one by the upper house, and one by the military bloc in parliament. The constitution gives the armed forces a quarter of seats in both houses.

""We will propose the vice presidential candidates tomorrow in both Pyithu and Amyotha Hluttaw,"" said NLD spokesman Dr Zaw Myint Maung referring to Myanmar parliament's lower and upper house chambers.

Because the NLD has a comfortable majority in both chambers it will effectively control two of the nominations, with the party's second pick widely expected to be a representative of one of Myanmar's ethnic minorities.

The two losing nominees become vice presidents, meaning that a nominee from an ethnic party would be proposed with that role in mind in line with Suu Kyi's goal of forming a government for national reconciliation.

Local media have named Thet Swe, a former navy chief who stepped down last year to run in the election representing the far flung Coco Islands, as one of the possible nominees for the military.

The three nominees do not need to be lawmakers, but they will be vetted by a parliamentary commission.

After that, both houses of parliament will come together for a joint session to vote on the presidency.

The NLD's huge majority means that whichever candidate it backs as president will win.

The president picks the cabinet that will take over from President Thein Sein's outgoing government on April 1, with the exception of the heads of the home, defense and border security ministries who will be appointed by the armed forces chief.

There was confusion among members of parliament on Wednesday over how soon the presidential vote would take place.

A director from the parliament told Reuters that the vote would not be held until at least Monday.

New NLD members of parliament said they remained in the dark over who would be nominated.

""We only have the news from Facebook,"" said Sein Mya Aye, a lower house NLD lawmaker.

U.N. mediator for Syria, Staffan de Mistura talks to Reuters during an interview at the U.N. in Geneva, Switzerland March 1, 2016.

BEIRUT/GENEVA The Syrian opposition said on Wednesday there had been fewer breaches of a truce agreement by the government and its allies in the past day as a U.N. envoy unveiled plans to resume peace talks next week.

The ""cessation of hostilities agreement"" brokered by the United States and Russia has slowed the war considerably despite accusations of violations on all sides, preparing the ground for talks which the United Nations plans to convene in Geneva.

The talks will coincide with the fifth anniversary of a conflict that began with protests against President Bashar al-Assad before descending into a multi-sided war that has drawn in foreign governments and allowed the growth of Islamic State.

U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura said he planned to launch substantive peace talks on Monday, focusing on issues of Syria's future governance, elections within 18 months, and a new constitution.

While the opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC) has yet to declare whether it will attend, spokesman Salem al-Muslat said it was positive that the talks would ""start ... with discussion of the matter of political transition"".

He said the HNC would announce its decision very soon.

The Syrian government, its position strengthened by more than five months of Russian air strikes, has also yet to say whether it will attend. There was no immediate response from Damascus to de Mistura's remarks. The Syrian foreign minister is due to give a news conference on Saturday at noon (1000 GMT).

Peace talks convened in Geneva two years ago collapsed as the sides' were unable to agree an agenda: Damascus wanted a focus on fighting terrorism - the term it uses for the rebellion - while the opposition wanted talks on transitional government.

TALKS ABORTED

De Mistura aborted a previous attempt to hold talks on Feb. 3 and urged countries in the International Syria Support Group, led by the United States and Russia, to do more preparatory work.

The result was the cessation of hostilities which Western governments say has largely held since it came into effect on Feb. 27. It has been accompanied by more aid deliveries to opposition areas besieged by government forces, though fighting has continued in some important areas of northwestern Syria.

Rebel groups fighting to topple Assad had initially said they would support a two-week halt to the fighting. De Mistura said on Wednesday however that it was an ""open-ended concept"".

The next round of talks would not run beyond March 24. There would then be a break of a week or 10 days before resuming.

Asked if the talks could be delayed further from an original start date of March 7, de Mistura said the format gave him a lot of flexibility.

Jan Egeland, who chairs the Syria humanitarian task force, said the United Nations had delivered aid to 10 of 18 besieged areas across the country in the last four weeks, and was working to overcome obstacles and reach remaining areas.

The truce agreement, accepted by Assad's government and many of his enemies, was the first of its kind in a war that has killed more than 250,000 people and caused a major refugee crisis.

The agreement has not been directly signed by the warring parties and is less binding than a formal ceasefire. It does not cover Islamic State or the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, whose fighters are deployed in western Syria in close proximity to rebel groups that have agreed to cease fire.

Russia says it has recorded opposition violations including supplies of weapons via Turkey to rebels in Syria.

FEWER VIOLATIONS

Muslat of the HNC said: ""The violations of the truce were great at the start, but yesterday they were much fewer. There are perhaps some positive matters that we are seeing.""

Speaking to Reuters, he said a government blockade of the Damascus suburb of Daraya must be lifted in order to ""pave the way to the start of negotiations"". He added this was not a condition for the attending talks but a humanitarian requirement.

Despite the relative success of the cessation of hostilities, the peace talks face great challenges, including the question of Assad's future.

The opposition says Assad must be removed from power at the start of a transition, while some of his Western enemies have backed away from that position, saying he must go at some point.

Russia has said that the matter should not be predetermined and Syrians should be left to choose. Assad has meanwhile ruled out anything that contravene the constitution, including the idea of a transitional governing body sought by the opposition.

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-JubeIr reiterated his government's tough line on Assad, who has also been boosted by Iranian military support. Saudi Arabia, which is in conflict with Iran across the region, has been a major sponsor of the Syrian insurgency.

""The choice for Bashar al-Assad is to either leave through a political process or the Syrian people will continue to fight until militarily they oust him,"" Jubeir said.

A police officer keeps watch near a cemetery where the bodies of soldiers and civilians who were killed during Monday's attack on army and police posts by Islamist fighters will be buried in the town of Ben Guerdan, Tunisia, near the Libyan border March 9, 2016.

TUNIS Tunisian troops have killed 10 Islamist militants around Ben Guerdan on the Libyan border after an Islamic State attack on Monday that killed at least 55 people.

In military raids late on Tuesday and into Wednesday morning around the town, one soldier was also killed. Two of the militants were killed after being tracked to a construction site, the defense and interior ministries said.

About 50 Islamic State militants launched a dawn attack on army and police posts in Ben Guerdan on Monday, Tunisia's government said, in one of the insurgent group's largest assaults on Tunisia. The army killed 36 of the attackers.

Twelve soldiers and seven civilians were also killed.

""Most of the attackers were Tunisians, and the majority of them were already in Ben Guerdan except for a few who infiltrated from Libya or maybe crossed over at the Ras Jdir border point,"" government spokesman Khaled Chaouket said.

Prime Minister Habib Essid blamed the attack on Islamic State, which has grown in strength just over the border in Libya, taking advantage of the chaos there to expand its presence and draw in foreign recruits.

Since its 2011 uprising against autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia has moved toward democracy. But it has also been battling a growing Islamist militancy at home and more than 3,000 Tunisians have left to fight for Islamic State and other jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq.

Tunisian security officials say Tunisians are taking more and more command positions in Islamic State in Libya and Tunisian fighters are returning from Iraq and Syria to join the group there.

A U.S. air strike last month on the Libyan town of Sabratha near Tunisia's border targeted a Tunisian Islamic State commander. At least 40 militants were killed in that strike on an Islamic State training base.

Growing security turmoil in Libya, where two rival governments and armed factions vie for control, has allowed Islamic State to thrive just over Tunisia's border, and Western governments are considering air strikes and special forces operations against the group there.

The new Global Asset Management Group will help boost the investment banking coverage of these alternative asset managers, which will also include pension funds and some family offices.

A Citi spokesman confirmed the contents of the memo.

Ahmad, vice chairman of Citi's institutional clients group, and Coleman, global head of Citi's alternative assets group, will co-head this new group while maintaining their previous responsibilities.

Ahmad and Coleman will also review ""client prioritization"" and make sure the corporate and investment banking teams have the right structure, resources and capital to serve these asset managers, according to the memo.

This increased coverage should help the bank execute more deals for these asset managers, who have previously been served by teams of bankers spread out across the bank.

The newly formed group will work closely with the Financial Institutions Group to bank these clients, and also the markets business, the memo said.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 00:08:10+00:00,"No Obama meeting with Fidel Castro, dissident talks on track: White House","['Matt Spetalnick', 'Jeff Mason']","A picture of former Cuban President Fidel Castro is seen inside a private shop under refurbishment in Havana, February 24, 2016.

WASHINGTON The White House has ruled out an encounter between President Barack Obama and revolutionary leader Fidel Castro in Cuba this month and is confident the Cuban government will not create obstacles to a meeting between Obama and dissidents in Havana, a top adviser said on Wednesday.

Despite the goal of improving ties between former Cold War foes, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Obama would not use his trip to meet Cuba's demands that he shutter Radio and TV Marti, U.S. broadcasters created to transmit anti-communist programing to the island nation.

Obama plans to hold talks with Cuban President Raul Castro during his historic March 20-22 visit but will not meet with Castro's brother, a legendary figure who took power in a 1959 revolution and led Cuba for 49 years.

""We've had no discussion about that meeting taking place, and we certainly wouldn't seek it,"" Rhodes, who was one of the negotiators in secret talks that led to a thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations, told Reuters in an interview.

Asked if a meeting was ruled out, Rhodes said: ""Yes.""

A meeting with the elder Castro could overshadow a trip that is meant to focus on the future of the U.S.-Cuba relationship rather than its troubled past. Castro, 89, stepped down from power after a series of health problems and rarely leaves his Havana home, though he occasionally meets visiting dignitaries.

The White House has said previously it did not expect a Fidel Castro meeting to occur but did not say it was ruled out.

The administration made clear when it set up Obama's trip that he would meet with anti-government dissidents in Havana despite the Cuban leadership's objections to what it sees as meddling in the country's internal affairs.

Rhodes said the list of participants had not been finalized and the meeting would take place in a U.S. facility, which suggests the U.S. embassy or ambassador's residence.

That meeting would take place after official events with Raul Castro.

Cuban dissidents in the past have reported being detained in their homes or picked up by police en route to major international events such as summits or papal visits, but Rhodes said he did not anticipate that happening for Obama's trip.

""We haven't worked out the logistics, but ... they have not suggested that they will throw up those types of obstacles,"" he said, adding the United States would be watching whether Cuba detained or harassed activists in connection with the visit.

Two of Cuba's most prominent dissidents, Berta Soler and Jose Daniel Ferrer, were detained on Tuesday, according to dissident groups.

Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, on Wednesday met with Cuban-American activists and U.S. human rights advocates and told them Obama would meet Cuban ""independent civil society"" representatives chosen by his aides, the White House said.

OUTSTANDING DIFFERENCES

Obama's Republican critics have accused him of playing down human rights concerns in order to pursue rapprochement with Cuba, which began in December 2014 and is now seen as a major piece of his foreign policy legacy.

The Cuban government has done little to reciprocate for a series of U.S. measures that eased restrictions on U.S.-Cuba travel and trade. It is unclear whether it will make any large gestures during Obama's visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president since 1928.

Rhodes countered that the outreach to Cuba was aimed at helping the local population while opening up commercial opportunities for Americans.

The administration plans to roll out further measures next week to chip away at decades-old restrictions to commerce.

Obama also wants to lift the embargo on Cuba, which is only possible through congressional action. Republican leaders in Congress oppose such a move.

Other differences remain. The Obama administration is not considering returning the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay to the Cuban government, and Rhodes said it would not make changes to the Radio and TV Marti broadcasters at this time.

Both issues are irritants that the Cubans consider obstacles to full normalization with Washington.

""The Cubans don't like Radio Marti and TV Marti for sure,"" Rhodes said. ""There's only so much you can get to.""

The U.S. government launched Radio Marti in 1983 and later added TV Marti to transmit anti-communist news and information into Cuba, where the government has a monopoly on the media.

A decision on whether to put an end to a U.S. program that encourages Cuban doctors and nurses on overseas assignments to defect was not tied to the trip either, Rhodes said.

In a long editorial on Wednesday in Communist Party newspaper Granma and other official media, Cuba demanded Washington cease meddling in its internal affairs and said Obama could do more to change U.S. policy.

The White House brushed off the piece and defended the president's trip next month as an opportunity to engage both with Cuba's government and its citizens.

Obama will visit on March 20-22, 15 months after he and Cuban President Raul Castro agreed to end more than five decades of Cold War-era animosity.

They have restored diplomatic ties, and Obama has relaxed a trade sanctions and travel restrictions, leading Republican opponents and some of the president's fellow Democrats to question whether Washington was offering too much without reciprocation from Havana.

But the editorial made it clear that Cuba still has a long list of grievances with the United States, starting with the comprehensive trade embargo. Obama wants to rescind the embargo but Republican leadership in Congress has blocked the move.

Cuba also objected to U.S. support for its political dissidents, whom some Americans consider champions of human rights but whom the Cuban government views as an unrepresentative minority funded by U.S. interests.

""(The United States) should abandon the pretense of fabricating an internal political opposition, paid for with money from U.S. taxpayers,"" the nearly 3,000-word editorial said.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters that Obama's ""long agenda includes visiting with political opposition of the Cuban government and standing up for, in a very tangible way, the universal human rights of the Cuban people.""

Obama visit will be only the second by a U.S. president and the first since the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro that overthrew a pro-American government.

The editorial said Cuba no one should assume Cuba had to ""renounce any of its principles or cede the slightest bit in its defense"" to do so.

The two countries have also negotiated greater cooperation on law enforcement and environmental issues and agreed to resume scheduled commercial flights and postal services. Obama has removed Cuba from a list of state sponsors of terrorism.

The editorial acknowledged Obama had taken positive steps but criticized their ""limited nature and the existence of other regulations and intimidation caused by the overall blockade that has been in force for more than 50 years.""

reuters.com,2016-03-05 16:43:50+00:00,Newly-weds Rupert Murdoch and Jerry Hall blessed in London church,['James Davey'],"LONDON Media mogul Rupert Murdoch and actress and model Jerry Hall celebrated their marriage with a blessing service on Saturday at St. Bride's church on London's Fleet Street, the spiritual home of British journalism.

A star-studded guest list included actor Michael Caine, Irish rockstar Bob Geldof, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and British Justice Secretary Michael Gove, a senior figure among those who want the UK to leave the European Union.

But conspicuous by their absence were Prime Minister David Cameron and finance minister George Osborne, who want Britain to stay in the 28-member bloc.

Murdoch and Hall wed on Friday in a private ceremony in central London, after which the now four-times married 84-year-old said he was the happiest man in the world.

Murdoch, executive chairman of News Corp (NWSA.O) and owner of 21st Century Fox Inc, and Hall, 59, posed for photographs after the service at the historic church, which is famed for its wedding-cake spire, but simply smiled and made no comment to the waiting media.

Texan model and actress Hall was wearing a pale blue chiffon and silk wedding gown, reported to have been designed by Vivienne Westwood, while Murdoch was dressed in a navy suit, white shirt and brown shoes. He sported a single white rose in his breast pocket.

GUEST LIST

The couple's 10 children from previous relationships attended the service, as did Rebekah Brooks, who returned to run Murdoch's British newspapers in September, and Robert Thomson, CEO of News Corp.

Other guests included former Rolling Stone Bill Wyman, artist Tracey Emin, photographer David Bailey and UK employment minister Priti Patel, who like Gove is backing Brexit.

Murdoch is an influential figure in Britain through his ownership of a clutch of newspapers.

Last month his Sun on Sunday publication said Cameron had failed to get a proper deal for Britain from other EU leaders and on Thursday he tweeted that the UK government had made false claims about the implications of Brexit aimed at scaring voters.

Murdoch and Hall began dating last summer after being introduced while in Australia and were first seen in public together at the Rugby Union World Cup Final in London in October. They got engaged in January.

Hall was previously in a long-term relationship with Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger.

St. Bride's is located on Fleet Street, where Britain's major newspapers were located from the 1700s to the 1980s.

Murdoch had an instrumental role in Fleet Street's demise as a press hub when he moved his print works to east London.

""Within months the printing dinosaur that was Fleet Street was dead. By 1989 all the national newspapers had decamped as other proprietors followed Murdoch's lead,"" the church's own website says.

SEOUL North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast city of Wonsan early on Thursday, flying approximately 500 km (300 miles), South Korea's military said.

North Korea has a large stockpile of short-range missiles and is developing long-range and intercontinental missiles.

Reports of the missiles being fired coincide with already heightened tension on the Korean peninsula after the North conducted its fourth nuclear test in January and launched a long-range rocket last month, leading to new U.N. Security Council and bilateral U.S. sanctions.

The North fired six rockets into the sea last week using a multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) from Wonsan, supervised by leader Kim Jong Un who ordered his military to be prepared to launch pre-emptive attacks against enemies.

Kim said on Wednesday his country has miniaturized nuclear warheads to mount on ballistic missiles and ordered improvements in the power and precision of its arsenal in his first direct comment about nuclear warhead miniaturization.

State Department spokesman John Kirby declined to comment on Kim's claim to have miniaturized nuclear warheads and accused him of ""provocative rhetoric.""

""I'd say the young man needs to pay more attention to the North Korean people and taking care of them than in pursuing these sorts of reckless capabilities,"" Kirby said.

The Pentagon said this week it had not seen North Korea demonstrate a capability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead. But Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the department was working on U.S. ballistic missile defenses to be prepared.

North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 but its claim to have set off a miniaturized hydrogen bomb has been disputed by the U.S. and South Korean governments and many experts.

U.S. and South Korean troops began large-scale military drills this week, which the North called ""nuclear war moves"" and threatened to respond with an all-out offensive.

Florida legislators on Wednesday approved abortion restrictions that include requirements for physicians similar to a Texas law currently under review by the Supreme Court and prohibited state funding for routine care at abortion clinics.

The measure imposes regulations that could force clinics to close, provider Planned Parenthood said. Supporters argue it aims to protect women's health, while opponents called it an attack on groups assisting women in terminating pregnancies.

Lets get Florida out of the abortion business, said State Senator Aaron Bean, a Republican from Jacksonville, during a heated debate. Thats what this bill does.

The legislation passed largely along party lines in the Florida House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans. Republican Governor Rick Scott did not immediately say if he will sign it.

Florida is among many states adopting new abortion laws as conservatives seek to chip away at the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision to legalize abortion. Another Florida law passed last year requiring women to wait 24 hours before getting an abortion recently took effect.

The newly passed legislation requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, a type of formal affiliation that can be difficult to obtain, while tightening rules on disposal of aborted fetal tissue.

Clinics would have to meet the more stringent safety standards of ambulatory surgery centers and also face annual inspections.

The legislation blocks state funding for low-income women receiving routine care, such as sexually transmitted disease screening and birth control, at clinics that perform abortions.

What were doing is pulling the rug out from under women who have enough problems in life, said State Senator Gwen Margolis, a Miami Democrat.

The bill is similar to a 2013 Texas law that included admitting privilege requirements for doctors and stringent regulations for clinic buildings. It is under review by the Supreme Court, considering its first major abortion case in years. A ruling is expected by late June.

""Florida would, in one bill, do the damage it took Texas years to inflict on women,"" said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a statement.

The high court has temporarily blocked a similar Louisiana law that had closed clinics in the state.

The Florida legislation would not stop anyone from ending a pregnancy, argued state senator Kelli Stargel, a Republican from Lakeland.

This legislation makes certain that our limited taxpayer dollars are not being used to support organizations that provide elective abortions, she said.

SHANGHAI China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) on Thursday said it has signed a deal for a $3 billion five-year loan, which will help the e-commerce giant as it snaps up stakes in companies within China and overseas.

Alibaba, led by founder Jack Ma, has been expanding in areas beyond its core e-commerce base, such as online video, as volume growth in its online shopping business slows.

The firm said in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it had signed the syndicated loan deal with a group of eight lead arrangers. It added that the amount could increase if there was steep demand.

""The loan, which is subject to upsize through oversubscriptions in syndication, has a five-year bullet maturity and is priced at 110 basis points over LIBOR,"" the company said in the filing, referring to the benchmark interest rate used by many global banks when making loans.

Alibaba added that the loan would be used for ""general corporate purposes"", without expanding on what this meant.

The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury on March 8 and unsealed on Wednesday as the anti-government protesters appeared in a federal court in Portland, supersedes an earlier indictment in the case.

It adds new charges against protest leader Ammon Bundy and other sympathizers who were indicted last month of conspiring to impede federal officers policing the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge during a long-simmering fight over land rights.

The takeover, which began on Jan. 2 with at least a dozen armed men, was sparked by the return to prison of two Oregon ranchers convicted of setting fires that spread to federal property in the vicinity of the refuge.

It also marked the latest flare-up in the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion, a decades-old conflict over federal control of millions of acres in the West.

On Tuesday, a county prosecutor said protest leader Robert ""LaVoy"" Finicum, who was fatally shot by Oregon State Police in late January during a traffic stop, was struck three times in the back during the incident. The prosecutor deemed the slaying ""justified and necessary.""

The superseding indictment lists 26 defendants. Each is charged with the initial charge of conspiring to impede federal agents. It newly accuses some of the protesters of: possession of firearms and dangerous weapons in federal facilities, use and carry of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, and depredation of government property.

That last charge was leveled against protester Sean Anderson and another sympathizer, whose name has been redacted from court documents. It alleges the pair damaged an archeological site considered sacred to the Burns Paiute Tribe through the use of excavation and heavy equipment.

The FBI has said it was working with the Tribe to identify damage to the tribe's artifacts and sacred burial grounds during the 41-day occupation.

Three armed occupiers were also indicted on charges of theft of government property, including a 2012 Ford F-350 Truck and cameras and related equipment.

In his strongest intervention so far in the politically charged debate about Britain's EU referendum, Carney said he was not making any recommendation about how to vote.

But his comments, in an often heated exchange with eurosceptic lawmakers, are likely to be welcomed by Cameron who is battling to swing voters behind the ""In"" campaign.

Britain is due to vote on June 23 on whether to remain in the bloc, raising the possibility of years of uncertainty for the world's fifth-biggest economy if it decides to leave.

Last month, Cameron asked the BoE to set out ""the facts"" about Britain's EU membership.

Carney said the BoE would not assess the long-term implications of the referendum for the economy. But a vote for Brexit, as leaving is widely called, would deliver a short-term hit to growth and sterling, and foreign investment would probably also diminish.

Asked about the implications of an exit for Britain's huge banking industry, Carney said some big financial firms might move business out of Britain if the country did not secure the same kind of access it currently has to the EU. That kind of negotiation could take ""a very long time"", he said.

""One would expect some activity to move,"" Carney told lawmakers in the British parliament. ""I'd say a number of institutions are contingency planning for that possibility.""

Carney, a Canadian, has sought to avoid giving explicit support for either side of the referendum battle.

But a BoE report last year that highlighted benefits to Britain's economy from being in the EU was attacked as political interference by some ""Out"" campaigners.

Jacob Rees-Mogg, a member of the ruling Conservative Party, said on Tuesday it was ""beneath the dignity"" of the BoE to make ""speculative"" comments about the benefits of EU membership and that Carney was damaging the BoE's reputation.

In 2014, Carney made comments that put the economic implications of Scottish independence high in the minds of voters who decided to remain in Britain at a referendum.

Speaking on Tuesday, Carney recognized there were risks from remaining inside the EU due to the greater integration planned by the 19-member euro zone. But he praised a deal struck by Cameron last month that set out the terms of Britain's membership of the EU, saying it would help the BoE do its job.

British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) director general, John Longworth, resigned late on Sunday after he breached the group's neutral stance on the in-out referendum to be held on June 23 by saying that the EU was incapable of meaningful reform and Britain could have a bright economic future outside the bloc.

After his resignation was announced, Longworth criticized Cameron, who argues that Britain's national security and economic stability would be at risk if it votes to leave the 28-nation EU, though his ruling Conservative Party is deeply split.

""It is highly irresponsible of the government of the country to be peddling hyperbole,"" Longworth told the Daily Telegraph newspaper in an interview published on Monday.

""If the government keeps peddling the line that it will be a disaster if we leave, which it actually won't be, they are going to put the country in a position where it will be damaged if we do.""

Longworth's comments mark the latest spat in what is becoming an increasingly divisive battle over Britain's future in the EU. Polls show public opinion is finely balanced and the issue has split senior members of Cameron's cabinet, pitting him against popular London Mayor Boris Johnson.

Announcing Longworth's resignation, BCC president Nora Senior said his personal views on the referendum were ""likely to create confusion regarding the BCC's neutral stance"".

Cameron's office rejected media reports which cited people close to Longworth as saying that it had pressured the BCC to remove him from his position.

""No pressure was applied,"" Cameron's spokeswoman said.

""OUT"" CAMP FURIOUS

The BCC's Senior also said ""no external factors"" had been involved.

""No politician or interest group had any influence on the BCC board decision to suspend Mr Longworth. His subsequent resignation was agreed mutually between Mr Longworth and the BCC,"" she said.

Johnson, the 'Out' campaign's most high-profile backer, said on Sunday it was ""scandalous"" that Longworth had been forced to step aside for what he said was a ""a passionate optimistic view"" on Britain's future prospects outside the EU.

Conservative lawmaker and former defense secretary Liam Fox, who is also campaigning for 'Out', said it was inappropriate to use ""the apparatus of the state"" to put pressure on those expressing their personal views.

The BCC represents thousands of British businesses and its own research indicates a majority of them favor Britain remaining in the EU.

Prominent British companies such as BP and GlaxoSmithKline have cautioned that Britain's $2.9 trillion economy could face years of uncertain negotiations if voters chose to leave the EU. ""Out"" campaigners say such warnings are overblown.

The Republican National Committee filed two lawsuits on Wednesday seeking to obtain emails related to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's tenure as U.S. secretary of state.

Clinton, front-runner to be her party's candidate in November's general election, has faced questions about her emails since it emerged a year ago that she used a private email account and a private server during her time in the post from 2009-2013.

Clinton has apologized for the email arrangement, which is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but has said she did nothing wrong and believes the government will vindicate her.

The RNC said it filed the lawsuits after the State Department failed to respond in a timely manner to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted in December. It sought the information to ensure the public has information to decide if Clinton is ""fit to serve"" as president, the RNC said in a statement.

The first lawsuit seeks emails, BlackBerry Messenger or text messages between then-Secretary of State Clinton and several key senior aides, including her chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, and director of policy planning, Jake Sullivan.

The second lawsuit seeks emails and other electronic exchanges between nearly a dozen State Department officials and any Clinton associate using one of more than a dozen different internet domain names. It covers the period between Feb. 1, 2013, when Clinton left the job, and Dec. 4, 2015.

The request includes any emails to the State Department officials from Clinton's campaign website, HillaryClinton.com, or the website of former President Bill Clinton's foundation, ClintonFoundation.org.

The suit also targets emails from domains like MediaMatters.org, a liberal non-profit group that seeks to counter what it believes is misleading conservative information in the U.S. media.

SAO PAULO Former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva could join Brazil's government if he wishes, the minister in charge of legislative affairs, Ricardo Berzoini, said on Wednesday, a move that would give him some protection from prosecution.

Lula was briefly detained for questioning by police on Friday, after investigators said they had evidence he was among the main political beneficiaries of a kickback scheme at state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro, commonly known as Petrobras.

Brazilian media reported on Wednesday that members of the ruling Workers Party (PT) were pressuring Rousseff to offer Lula a ministerial portfolio in President Dilma Rousseff's cabinet that would shield him from possible detention.

If Lula were appointed to a ministry, he could only be tried in the Supreme Court, placing him out of the reach of the judge in Curitiba pursuing the investigation into kickbacks at Petrobras.

""The ball is in his court,"" Berzoini told Reuters. ""The government is good with it. Which government would not want to have Pele on the field,"" he said, comparing Lula to the legendary Brazilian football player.

According to two sources close to the former president, he is reluctant to join the government but pressure from the Workers Party is having some effect.

""The best chance that he has is to accept a ministry and for the trial to go to the Supreme Court so he receives a fair hearing,"" said one source close to the former president.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 18:16:00+00:00,Big U.S. banks to take on tech rivals with instant payments,['David Henry'],"A sign outside the headquarters of JP Morgan Chase & Co in New York, September 19, 2013.

NEW YORK Depositors at some of the largest U.S. banks are finally going to get the chance to do something quick and simple: send money to another person's account instantaneously by mobile phone.

The idea has been in the works for at least five years, and in the meantime, Silicon Valley has made incursions into the industry's role as a payment intermediary. But now, big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Wells Fargo & Co and U.S. Bancorp are starting to plug into a system they jointly own, called clearXchange, that will allow each others' customers to transfer money in a flash when they split a dinner check, rent payment or vacation bill.

""What we are doing now is delivering payments in real time, which is what our customers have asked for,"" Mary Harman, managing director for payments at Bank of America, said in an interview. The bank is one of two that have started rolling out the system to customers.

While technology companies like PayPal Holdings and Facebook Inc already offer snazzy payment apps that appeal to young consumers, the banking industry has a crucial advantage because it controls how quickly money actually moves between bank accounts. Individuals transferred some $200 billion to one another using mobile phones and computers last year, according to Javelin Strategy & Research.

Bank executives and analysts who closely track payment systems say that if clearXchange is fast, functional and user-friendly, banks can make up for lost ground.

Bank of America plans to announce on Wednesday that its customers can transfer funds instantly through clearXchange with customers of U.S. Bancorp, which said last week that it was plugged into the speediest part of the network. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Capital One Financial Corp representatives told Reuters they plan to offer the service later this year.

Wells Fargo & Co said on Wednesday that it is working to roll out instant payments in the middle of this year.

Analysts expect PNC Financial Services Group Inc will also start this year. A representative declined to comment.

Those six banks are among the seven largest by deposits in the United States. Regional bank BB&T Corp is also one of the seven owners of the network, but is not ready to announce its plans, a spokesman said.

Citigroup, which has the fourth most U.S. deposits, has not joined clearXchange. A spokeswoman declined to say why. Citigroup uses an older network called Popmoney, which is owned by Fiserv Inc, for person-to-person payments.

SLOW TO ADAPT

Today, if a customer wants to transfer cash to another person digitally  whether on an app like Paypal's Venmo, or through an individual bank's payment transfer system, like Chase's QuickPay  it usually takes one to three days for money to move to an account at another institution. On clearXchange, the cash can move instantaneously with the tap of a finger.

The initiative is particularly important for banks as their customer base shifts from a generation that cashed paper checks and got mortgages by walking into a branch, to one that goes online first to transact and borrow. It's important for banks to cater to 18-to-34-year-old Americans in the so-called Millennial generation as they enter their prime years for borrowing and saving.

But adapting to these behavioral changes was a low priority for U.S. banks after the financial crisis, as they grappled with losses, fines, new regulations and slow revenue growth. In short order, financial technology startups filled the void  not just in payments, but in areas ranging from student loans to financial planning. If banks don't catch up quickly, they may end up losing some young customers altogether, analysts said.

""There is a short window of opportunity for the banks,"" said Michael Moeser, director of payments for Javelin.

For clearXchange to be successful, it needs to reach a critical mass of participants so that depositors will be able to transfer funds among most of their friends, relatives and colleagues. Until more banks connect to provide immediate service, the network has little value.

Any U.S. bank or credit union can participate in clearXchange, and its owners hope many more will. The network says its members represent two-thirds of U.S. deposits.

Banks in other parts of the world are making similar moves. In the U.K., for instance, there is an app called Paym that allows individuals to transfer up to 250 pounds ($355) to another user's bank account. Nordic countries are leading the way toward a cashless society, with mobile payment apps Swish in Sweden and MobilePay in Denmark.

Analysts expect the mobile banking market to keep growing as consumers become more aware of apps, and as the technology improves.

VIRAL NATURE

Venmo, which launched in 2012, handled $7.5 billion of person-to-person payments last year. In January, the company moved $1 billion between individuals  up tenfold in two years, said Bill Ready, PayPal's global head of product and engineering, who brought Venmo to PayPal as part of a 2013 deal.

Those figures track well below the $22 billion of cash swapped digitally by Bank of America customers last year, or the $20 billion Chase QuickPay handled. But Venmo is growing rapidly, and its popularity has come almost entirely by word of mouth, as friends ask friends to sign up, said Ready. Facebook's Messenger app offers a similar service.

While these apps send immediate alerts that money is on the way, they still rely on banks to make sure cash is available and move it. And, unlike banks, they have no control over the speed at which that occurs.

""As a Bank of America customer, when I hit send, a couple of seconds later the U.S. Bank customer will see the money in their account,"" said Bank of America's Harman.

Even so, Ready, the senior PayPal executive, said he is skeptical clearXchange will be a success. ""The banks have a hard time working with one another,"" he said, adding that it would be difficult for them to ""recreate the viral nature of Venmo.""

Facebook representatives declined to comment on the banks' plan, but said the company is continuing to improve Messenger's payment functions.

The banking industry's advantage could be short-lived, though. The network that Venmo and others often use to transfer funds will begin phasing in daily settlement in September. That network, called the Automated Clearing House Network, is a not-for-profit association whose members are financial firms.

""If Venmo becomes real-time,"" said Javelin's Moeser, ""then the banks have no differentiator anymore.""

Banks that are part of clearXchange realize they must overcome the buzz and momentum that existing apps have gathered. They are working to come up with a catchier name than clearXchange, and hope to launch a marketing campaign around the middle of this year, said Harman.

""The important thing,"" she said, ""is that we are acting now.""

CAPE TOWN The Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) has provisionally suspended executive committee member Edzai Kasinauyo over allegations he was involved in an attempt to fix an African Nations Cup qualifier scheduled for later this month.

The 40-year-old, who played for Zimbabwe at the Nations Cup finals in 2006, is being investigated over a Group L away game against Swaziland on March 25, ZIFA said in a statement on Wednesday.

Kasinauyo has denied any wrongdoing and said that there was evidence that would exonerate him.

""This is very sensitive issue with far-reaching consequences because it gets to the heart of my integrity, not only as a person but also as a football leader,"" he told Zimbabwe's Herald newspaper, saying that he was in ""total shock"".

""The only relief that I have right now is that I'm being told there is evidence and that will paint the correct picture and help set me free.""

The Confederation of African Football (CAF) issued a statement on Wednesday saying it would liaise with soccer's world ruling body FIFA to ""activate the mechanisms necessary"" to ensure other Nations Cup qualifiers were not open to manipulation.

ZIFA's recent history has been littered with problems and in 2012, after several years of investigation, 13 players and officials were banned for life for match-fixing in what became known as the ""Asiagate"" scandal.

A further 69 were suspended for their part in fixing friendly internationals that Zimbabwe played in Asia, where games were manipulated under the instruction of a Singapore-based betting syndicate.

The last of those suspensions for administrators, match officials, players and coaches were lifted this year as an investigation by FIFA into the matter stalled.

Swaziland and Zimbabwe are top of Africa Nations Cup qualification Group L on four points after two games, with the winners gaining automatic entry to next year's tournament in Gabon. Malawi and Guinea are the other teams in the group.

Place settings and floral arrangements for the State Dinner welcoming Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau are seen during a press preview in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington March 9, 2016.

WASHINGTON The White House is eager to turn the page on the years-long fight over a crude oil pipeline with Canada and celebrate its close economic and security ties with its northern neighbor, U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said on Wednesday.

Trade between the United States and Canada and joint efforts to curb climate change will loom large on the agenda for the meeting between President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Washington on Thursday.

It will be followed by a star-studded state dinner meant to recognize the importance of the bilateral relationship, the first state dinner to honor Canada in 19 years.

Trudeau's Liberals came to power in November by ousting right-wing Conservative leader Stephen Harper, whose ties with Washington deteriorated as he hectored Obama over the Keystone XL pipeline.

President Barack Obama blocked the project last year, a victory for environmentalists who had campaigned against the pipeline.

The spat is in the past, Rice said.

""In any bilateral relationship, there are going to be issues of difference and occasional friction,"" she told Reuters in an interview.

""The complexity and the breadth and the depth of the U.S-Canada relationship is such that no single issue can overshadow the totality of the relationship,"" she said.

Obama and Trudeau will discuss the next steps for the ""Beyond the Border"" initiative, a plan to speed travel and trade, Rice said.

""With the longest peaceful border and $2 billion a day in trade in both directions, we have an enormous shared stake in a border that is open for business and open for travel - and safe,"" Rice said.

Trudeau campaigned to strengthen ties with the United States, but also promised he would pull out six fighter jets from the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

Rice said the White House is satisfied with steps that Trudeau took to beef up training, surveillance and other support to the coalition.

""Taken as a whole, we view the Canadian stepped-up contribution to the counter-ISIL campaign as being very, very valuable and welcome,"" Rice said, using an acronym for Islamic State.

The White House has also watched closely as Trudeau welcomed 25,000 Syrian refugees to Canada in four months.

""We've seen thus far that Canada is taking very seriously its responsibility to its own citizens and to our common security to be vigilant as it welcomes these new refugees,"" Rice said.

NIESR estimated that Britain's economy grew at a quarterly rate of 0.3 percent in the three months to February, down from 0.4 percent in the three months to January.

Britain's economy grew 0.5 percent in the final quarter of 2015, and if growth fell to 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2016, it would be the weakest calendar quarter since late 2012.

NIESR researcher Jack Meaning said this looked unlikely.

""Output growth at the start of 2016 has been subdued,"" he said. ""However, it appears that December 2015 may have been a low point for GDP and ... output growth for the first quarter may strengthen slightly.""

Manufacturing output in January showed a bigger-than-expected rebound after falling in December, official figures showed earlier on Wednesday.

NIESR forecast last month that Britain's economy would grow by 2.3 percent in 2016 as a whole, similar to 2015.

GENEVA Syria's cessation of hostilities is open-ended, U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said on Wednesday, brushing off a perception that the truce needs renewing this weekend.

He told reporters he would now press on with more peace talks - though neither the Syrian government nor the opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC) have confirmed they will attend.

De Mistura said he had heard some of the warring sides had indicated the ceasefire, which started at midnight Feb. 27, would expire in two weeks.

""From the U.N. point of view and the Geneva meetings we have been having on the task force and certainly (the) Munich understanding, there was an open-ended concept regarding the cessation of hostilities,"" he said after a meeting on Syrian humanitarian issues in Geneva.

The Munich meeting in February was a key point in Syrian peace process, when De Mistura asked its international backers, led by the United States and Russia, to do more to make the warring sides come to the table to negotiate.

They hatched a plan for a ceasefire, and the opposition High Negotiations Committee said it would support a two-week halt to the fighting.

De Mistura plans to launch substantive peace talks on Monday, and said they will focus on the core issues of governance, elections within 18 months and a new constitution.

The round of talks would not run beyond March 24, and there would then be a break before resuming, he said, without giving details.

Asked if the talks could be delayed further from an original start date of March 7, De Mistura said the format gave him a lot of flexibility.

The United Nations, which has delivered aid to 10 of 18 besieged areas across Syria in the last four weeks, is working to overcome obstacles and reach remaining areas, said Jan Egeland who chairs the humanitarian task force.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 04:05:25+00:00,ANALYSIS - Sharapova fallout shows sponsors have no tolerance for banned drugs,['Ben Klayman'],"In the day following Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova's admission that she failed a drug test, sponsors Nike, Porsche and Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer dropped her like a hot potato.

Before social media demanded instant responses, sponsors often waited weeks or months before severing ties with an athlete - giving them the benefit of the doubt.

With so much invested in a global sponsorship industry IEG estimates at $60 billion, sponsors now scramble to avoid the taint of scandal so athletes caught doping at the Olympics this summer should also expect a quick end to their lucrative contracts.

""Given the attention that use of performance-enhancing drugs in just about all sports has garnered over the last several years, sponsors are going to cut as quickly as they can,"" said Brian Socolow, head of the sports practice group at Loeb & Loeb law firm, which has represented both athletes and companies in endorsement deals.

""They don't want to get caught sponsoring the next Lance Armstrong,"" he added, referring to the disgraced cyclist who was stripped of seven Tour de France titles and banned for life in 2012 after a U.S. anti-doping probe. Armstrong later admitted using performance-enhancing drugs in a television interview.

While Armstrong's story took years to play out as he initially denied reports of his drug use, Sharapova quickly called a press conference on Monday to say she had tested positive for meldonium, which she said she was taking to treat diabetes and low magnesium. The drug was only banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency as of Jan. 1. [nL1N16F1IE][nL5N16G3S3]

Sports apparel giant Nike Inc (NKE.N) and German carmaker Porsche, a Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) unit, responded by suspending their sponsorship deals, while Tag Heuer, owned by French luxury goods group LVMH (LVMH.PA), ended talks to extend a contract that had expired in December.

Sponsor decisions on whether to stick with a spokesperson or team are driven by money, industry officials said. If they feel the sponsorship can still work, companies stand by their man, woman or sports group, like many have done with soccer's world governing body FIFA or the International Olympic Committee through their respective scandals.

Industry executives agreed Sharapova was smart to get in front of the news, announcing the positive test herself and apologising for her mistake.

As a result, she will likely get a second chance with the public and sponsors alike, industry executives said. However, a lengthy suspension could in effect end her playing career and damage her status as one of the highest paid off-field female athletes. Forbes estimates her off-court career earnings at more than $200 million.

""In many ways, she's the ideal spokesperson for a brand. She's very attractive, highly successful and very competitive,"" said San Diego State University marketing professor George Belch, who has used a Harvard case study about her in his classes to tout her ability as a spokesperson.

Sharapova's failed drug test at January's Australian Open, one of four annual Grand Slam events, will likely lead to a ban for the 28 year old. Still ranked among the top players, she has won five Grand Slam titles in her career.

While some critics argue a double standard exists for female athletes, several industry officials said Tiger Woods' sex scandal or the rape allegations against Kobe Bryant in the past would both play out differently in today's social media-driven culture.

Issues companies may have waited out not long ago, now demand immediate attention, and some believe it being an Olympic year only raises the pressure to move fast.

Consumer products companies like those associated with Sharapova have even more reason to move quickly to distance themselves from bad news, industry officials said.

""It takes a lot of time and money to build a lifestyle brand,"" said Gary Fechter, an attorney at McCarter & English who has represented companies in sponsorship deals for almost four decades.

And for sponsors that may have felt they were overpaying Sharapova, her positive drug test offers a ""back-door out,"" he said.

A source close to the tennis star said her team was encouraged that Nike and Porsche simply suspended their deals rather than terminating them, suggesting the door may be open to reopening them in the future.

In the short term, however, Sharapova's standing will surely take a hit.

Her ""trust"" scores in an index created by the Marketing Arm for clients to measure celebrity influence will likely take a significant dip, managing director Matt Delzell said.

Sharapova currently ranks in the top third, in the range of former New York Yankee all-star shortstop Derek Jeter, comedian Seth Myers and singer Demi Lovato, according to the unit of the Omnicom Group Inc (OMC.N), which books sports personalities for companies.

reuters.com,,Modernist architecture in Eritrea,['Thomas Mukoya'],"Advertisement

In an often forgotten corner of the Horn of Africa, Eritrea's capital boasts one of the worlds finest collections of early 20th century architecture and the authorities want it declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

When Italy's colonial experiment in Eritrea ended in 1941, it left behind an array of Rationalist, Futurist, Art Deco and other Modernist styles in Asmara, a city whose historic heart has changed little since the Italians lived and worked there.

In following decades, conflict ravaged Eritrea, leaving the nation isolated and stifling development. But the violence by-passed the city, and the capital has never been swamped by the kind of construction that raced ahead elsewhere in Africa. Elegant avenues are flanked by the Art Deco Cinema Impero, the imposing lines of the Education Ministry that once housed the Fascist party headquarters and the Futurist Fiat Tagliero garage with gravity-defying concrete cantilevered wings, extending 15 metres either side without the support of pillars.

Fiat Tagliero building designed by the Italian architect Giuseppe Pettazzi. Italian architects used what had been an amalgamation of highland villages centuries earlier as ""an ideal blank canvas"", according to UNESCO's description, to practise what were, at the time, some of the world's most avant garde designs.

Roma Cinema on Samatat Avenue. Italians nicknamed it ""La Piccola Roma"" or ""Little Rome"". ""The city is very intact and maintains its original character,"" said Medhanie Teklemariam, coordinator for the Asmara Heritage Project, which has drawn up an inventory of about 4,300 buildings in Asmara's historic perimeter. The nomination dossier for World Heritage Site status was submitted to UNESCO this year, with a decision expected in 2017.

Faithful sit outside the Nda Mariam Orthodox Cathedral. If approved, Asmara would benefit from technical assistance, helping renovate and preserve the historic buildings, which include offices, government buildings and homes. World Heritage Site status could also draw visitors to a barely trodden tourist trail. Eritrea has soaring mountains and a long Red Sea coast, but no international hotel chains.

Albergo Italia Hotel, built in 1899, stands on Nakfa Avenue. The authorities have also carefully protected the architectural assets, adhering to 1938 building regulations. New planning regulations are being drawn up but some rules, such as limiting buildings to 60 metres high, are likely to remain. ""If we are going to exceed above this height, I think we are going to destroy the skyline of Asmara,"" said Medhanie.

A 52-metre-high bell tower is seen at St. Joseph's Catholic Cathedral on Liberation Avenue. The Italians left their mark in other ways. Pizza and pasta are almost national dishes - and expertly cooked. Italians also brought cycle racing to Eritrea and it has become a national passion - images of Eritrean cyclist Daniel Teklehaimanot, who wore the King of the Mountains jersey in the 2015 Tour de France, are plastered in hotels and shops. Street-side cafes are filled with the grumble and hiss of polished coffee machines serving up espressos and macchiatos.

Seeking to mirror the bigger and older empires of Britain and France, Eritrea was Italy's route ""to enter the big business of imperialism,"" said Federico Niglia, a history professor at Luiss University in Rome. Coinciding with a period when there was an ""explosion of art"" in Italy, Asmara's architecture was one way to show off Italy's approach to colonial management, he added. But Italy's ambitions lay beyond Eritrea, which was seen as simply the starting point of a far grander empire in East Africa. It had long had its eyes on Ethiopia next door, a nation it briefly occupied from 1936 until it was ejected in 1941. Unlike Asmara, a city Italians shaped during several decades there, Addis Ababa's soaring skyline and rapid expansion have overshadowed the few reminders of Ethiopia's brush with Italian rule.",[]

Somali policemen look at the wreckage of a car at the scene of an explosion following an attack in Somalia's capital Mogadishu, March 9, 2016.

MOGADISHU Islamist militants in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, set off a vehicle packed with explosives next to a cafe near a police building on Wednesday, killing at least three police officers.

The Islamist al Shabaab group, which wants to topple the Western-backed government, claimed responsibility. A spokesman for the group told Reuters that 10 police officers were killed, a figure that was higher than the three deaths police reported.

Al Shabaab often cites a higher death toll than the figure given by officials.

""Three police officers died in this car bomb,"" Ali Mohamed Hirsi, the commander of Mogadishu police, told reporters at the scene, where blood was visible near the tea shop frequented by officers. ""The police officers were among police being trained.""

Police said a second device went off, but caused no casualties after police spotted it beforehand and caught two men in the small, three-wheeled vehicle.

In the past two weeks, al Shabaab has launched mortar bomb attacks near the presidential palace, blown up a car bomb near a busy park in Mogadishu, and set off twin blasts in a town northwest of the capital. Dozens of people have been killed.

U.S. air strikes targeted an al Shabaab facility on Saturday and U.S. officials said more than 150 fighters were killed. Al Shabaab confirmed an attack on an area they controlled but said the U.S. casualty figure was exaggerated without giving their own number.

A member of the media, wearing a protective suit and a mask, looks at the No. 3 reactor building at Tokyo Electric Power Co's (TEPCO) tsunami-crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Okuma town, Fukushima prefecture, Japan in this February 10, 2016 file photo.

The robots sent in to find highly radioactive fuel at Fukushima's nuclear reactors have died; a subterranean ""ice wall"" around the crippled plant meant to stop groundwater from becoming contaminated has yet to be finished. And authorities still dont how to dispose of highly radioactive water stored in an ever mounting number of tanks around the site.

Five years ago, one of the worst earthquakes in history triggered a 10-metre high tsunami that crashed into the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station causing multiple meltdowns. Nearly 19,000 people were killed or left missing and 160,000 lost their homes and livelihoods.

Today, the radiation at the Fukushima plant is still so powerful it has proven impossible to get into its bowels to find and remove the extremely dangerous blobs of melted fuel rods.

The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) 9501.t, has made some progress, such as removing hundreds of spent fuel roads in one damaged building. But the technology needed to establish the location of the melted fuel rods in the other three reactors at the plant has not been developed.

It is extremely difficult to access the inside of the nuclear plant,"" Naohero Masuda, Tepco's head of decommissioning said in an interview. ""The biggest obstacle is the radiation.

The fuel rods melted through their containment vessels in the reactors, and no one knows exactly where they are now. This part of the plant is so dangerous to humans, Tepco has been developing robots, which can swim under water and negotiate obstacles in damaged tunnels and piping to search for the melted fuel rods.

But as soon as they get close to the reactors, the radiation destroys their wiring and renders them useless, causing long delays, Masuda said.

Each robot has to be custom-built for each building.It takes two years to develop a single-function robot, Masuda said.

IRRADIATED WATER

Tepco, which was fiercely criticized for its handling of the disaster, says conditions at the Fukushima power station, site of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in Ukraine 30 years ago, have improved dramatically. Radiation levels in many places at the site are now as low as those in Tokyo.

More than 8,000 workers are at the plant at any one time, according to officials on a recent tour. Traffic is constant as they spread across the site, removing debris, building storage tanks, laying piping and preparing to dismantle parts of the plant.

Much of the work involves pumping a steady torrent of water into the wrecked and highly radiated reactors to cool them down. Afterward, the radiated water is then pumped out of the plant and stored in tanks that are proliferating around the site.

What to do with the nearly million tonnes of radioactive water is one of the biggest challenges, said Akiro Ono, the site manager. Ono said he is deeply worried the storage tanks will leak radioactive water in the sea - as they have done several times before - prompting strong criticism for the government.

The utility has so far failed to get the backing of local fishermen to release water it has treated into the ocean.

Ono estimates that Tepco has completed around 10 percent of the work to clear the site up - the decommissioning process could take 30 to 40 years. But until the company locates the fuel, it wont be able to assess progress and final costs, experts say.

The much touted use of X-ray like muon rays has yielded little information about the location of the melted fuel and the last robot inserted into one of the reactors sent only grainy images before breaking down.

ICE WALL

Tepco is building the worlds biggest ice wall to keep groundwater from flowing into the basements of the damaged reactors and getting contaminated.

First suggested in 2013 and strongly backed by the government, the wall was completed in February, after months of delays and questions surrounding its effectiveness. Later this year, Tepco plans to pump water into the wall - which looks a bit like the piping behind a refrigerator - to start the freezing process.

Stopping the ground water intrusion into the plant is critical, said Artie Gunderson, a former nuclear engineer.

The reactors continue to bleed radiation into the ground water and thence into the Pacific Ocean, Gunderson said. ""When Tepco finally stops the groundwater, that will be the end of the beginning.

While he would not rule out the possibility that small amounts of radiation are reaching the ocean, Masuda, the head of decommissioning, said the leaks have ended after the company built a wall along the shoreline near the reactors whose depth goes to below the seabed.

I am not about to say that it is absolutely zero, but because of this wall the amount of release has dramatically dropped, he said.

SEOUL North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast city of Wonsan early on Thursday, flying approximately 500 km (300 miles), South Korea's military said.

North Korea has a large stockpile of short-range missiles and is developing long-range and intercontinental missiles.

Reports of the missiles being fired coincide with already heightened tension on the Korean peninsula after the North conducted its fourth nuclear test in January and launched a long-range rocket last month, leading to new U.N. Security Council and bilateral U.S. sanctions.

The North fired six rockets into the sea last week using a multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) from Wonsan, supervised by leader Kim Jong Un who ordered his military to be prepared to launch pre-emptive attacks against enemies.

Kim said on Wednesday his country has miniaturized nuclear warheads to mount on ballistic missiles and ordered improvements in the power and precision of its arsenal in his first direct comment about nuclear warhead miniaturization.

State Department spokesman John Kirby declined to comment on Kim's claim to have miniaturized nuclear warheads and accused him of ""provocative rhetoric.""

""I'd say the young man needs to pay more attention to the North Korean people and taking care of them than in pursuing these sorts of reckless capabilities,"" Kirby said.

The Pentagon said this week it had not seen North Korea demonstrate a capability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead. But Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the department was working on U.S. ballistic missile defenses to be prepared.

North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 but its claim to have set off a miniaturized hydrogen bomb has been disputed by the U.S. and South Korean governments and many experts.

U.S. and South Korean troops began large-scale military drills this week, which the North called ""nuclear war moves"" and threatened to respond with an all-out offensive.

MILANO/LONDRA Ferrari ha collocato oggi il suo primo bond, a 7 anni da 500 milioni di euro, destinato al rifinanziamento del debito.

L'operazione, attesa gia da qualche tempo e preparata da un roadshow a cui ha partecipato il presidente Sergio Marchionne, ha incassato la buona risposta del mercato con ordini per circa 2,7 miliardi, anche se Ferrari ha dovuto comunque pagare un premio legato alla scelta di emettere senza rating.

Secondo il servizio Ifr di Thomson Reuters, l'obbligazione, senior unsecured con scadenza 16 marzo 2023 e cedola 1,5%, e stata prezzata a reoffer 99,977, per un rendimento a scadenza dell'1,656%, pari ad un premio di 140 pb su midswap. La prima guidance era in area 160 pb, poi rivista in area 145 (+/- 5 pb).

PREMIO DI 70 PB SU EMISSIONE UNRATED

Un operatore ricorda che i lead manager hanno indicato come 'comparable' del bond diverse scadenze (tra 2019 e 2026) di Bmw (rating A+ per S&P), Lvmh (A+), Luxottica (A-) e Adidas (unrated), che oggi scambiano sensibilmente sotto il rendimento di Ferrari.

""Il premio per l'emissione senza rating lo valuto una settantina di punti: tenendo conto di cio il pricing a 140 e stato 'fair'. Altri 20 punti di premio andavano per il fatto che si trattava di una prima emissione, ma questi sono stati riassorbiti in mattinata col book"" afferma l'operatore.

Joint bookrunner dell'operazione sono stati Bnp Paribas, Citi e Jp Morgan, affiancate da Imi, BofA Merrill Lynch, Credit Agricole, Mediobanca, SocGen, Ubs e UniCredit.

'STAND ALONE'

Come preannunciato dalla societa l'emissione andra in particolare a rifinanziare il prestito 'ponte' da 500 milioni concesso dalle banche in seguito alla separazione da Fca, nell'ambito di una linea sindacata da 2,5 miliardi.

""Quella e la cifra che interessava a Ferrari e dunque non si e andati oltre i 500 milioni, anche se il collocamento e andato molto bene"", commenta un lead manager, aggiungendo che l'emissione odierna e probabilmente destinata a rimanere un 'una tantum': ""il business di Ferrari genera cassa e resta sostanzialmente di nicchia, grandi esigenze non ce ne sono"".

A fine 2015 il debito lordo di Ferrari ammontava a 2,26 miliardi, quello netto a 1,938; per il 2016 e previsto un Ebitda adjusted di 770 milioni e un debito netto di 1,950 miliardi [nL8N15H2F2]. Marchionne ha recentemente dichiarato l'intenzione di azzerare il debito netto della societa entro il 2019.

U.S.-based Uber plans to expand in Tanzania, Uganda and Ghana this year and will focus on convincing...

NAIROBI U.S.-based Uber plans to expand in Tanzania, Uganda and Ghana this year and will focus on convincing traditional taxi drivers to work for the ride-hailing service, Alon Lits, Uber's general manager for sub-Saharan Africa, said.

Traffic-clogged roads, high rates of urban crime and a lack of credit card are big challenges Uber faces in sub-Saharan Africa, where it operates in seven cities in South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya.

But its biggest problem is the one it faces from Rome to Rio; the friction with traditional taxi drivers who see Uber as a threat to their livelihoods.

In the Kenyan capital Nairobi, Uber's fastest growing market in sub-Saharan Africa, an Uber driver was attacked and his car torched last month after the government rejected calls by Kenya's taxi association to ban the company.

""Part of our strategy when we launch in new markets will be that engagement up front with taxi operators,"" Lits told Reuters in an interview in Nairobi. ""We will be doing a better job of engaging.""

That strategy will involve convincing traditional taxi drivers to work for Uber, showing them they can continue working on their own, but when they don't have a fare they can also choose to use the Uber smartphone app to pick up passengers and make extra money.

Lits said Uber, which operates in more than 400 cities worldwide, will set up East and West Africa ""hubs"" in Nairobi and Lagos to act as launchpads for forays into Tanzania, Uganda and Ghana, and would begin operating in a second city each in Nigeria and Kenya.

""We feel we are at a point now where we have a strong sense for what it takes to build a successful Uber business in Africa,"" Lits said.

In Europe and North America, Uber accounts are tied to a customer's credit card, eliminating the need for cash. But in sub-Saharan Africa, where only about a third of people own a bank account, low credit cards usage has presented another obstacle to Uber's growth.

Lits said Uber's experiment in Kenya to let riders pay fares with cash or via mobile money had boosted growth in Nairobi, where about 100,000 people open the Uber app once a month.

""It's definitely going to be part of our strategy as we push across Africa,"" he said.

Lits said Uber's overtures to prospective full-time Uber drivers in sub-Saharan Africa - where the company launched in 2013 - will be mainly financial. As with traditional taxis, most Uber drivers rent their vehicles, which eats into their income.

In Kenya and Nigeria, the company is looking to make it cheaper for Uber drivers to rent vehicles.

In South Africa, the company has teamed up with a financing company to help drivers obtain car loans based on their work history with Uber, including the customer ratings they received on the app.

reuters.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,The candidate and the spelling bee,"[""Any Opinions Expressed Here Are The Author's Own"", 'Jonathan Allen']","Is Hillary Clinton a bad speller or just well-versed in the language of diplomacy? In a story on Sunday analyzing the Democratic candidates sending of classified information through her private email server while serving as the nations most senior diplomat, the Washington Post seems to think its the former.

Reported the Post:For example, Clinton wrote an email in July 2012 to Deputy Secretary of State William Burns and other top department officials with the subject line Agrement [sic] for Egypt, the Post writes. Sic is the Latin shorthand newspapers use to denote that they are accurately quoting someone elses grammatical error.

If Clinton had intended to write Agreement then she certainly missed the mark and earned the Posts schoolmarmish [sic]. A more generous reading is that she was using a bit of obscure diplo-speak: agrement is the name given to the process of one country asking another to accept a new ambassador. And both the State Department and the United Nations often render it agrement, dropping the French words accent even when not apparently typing it out on a smartphone.

Matt Lee, an Associated Press journalist and the eminence grise of the U.S. State Departments press corps, drew attention to the Washington Posts possibly erroneous belief that Clinton was in error on his Twitter account, and devoted some of his Sunday to badgering the Post to strike out what he views as an unfair sic.

As of Sunday evening, to Lees irritation, the Posts story online still read: Agrement [sic] for Egypt [sic].",[]

As a Canadian who has lived and worked in the United States for more than 15 years, Ive always felt like a bit of an outsider, with my strangely pronounced words and a deep knowledge of maple syrup.

But with Donald Trumps commanding lead in delegates and polls for the Republican presidential nomination, Im finding that a new dynamic is developing: Americans are coming up to me, shyly and sweetly, and asking how exactly to get out.

In classroom terms, its as if the quirky nerd in the corner suddenly became Homecoming King.

When one friend first raised the question, I laughed. After all, people always make these kind of dramatic proclamations during election season.

So I thought she was kidding. She wasnt.

Im 100 percent serious, she said. Im going to wait until around June to see if hes winning in the polls  and then Im going to ask you what to do.

No wonder Google data editor Simon Rogers reported that, as Super Tuesday results rolled in, searches for How can I move to Canada spiked by 350 percent in just a few hours (later rising by more than 1,000 percent).

The prospect of a Trump-branded White House truly scares some people. Enough to make them actually consider a frosty future north of the 49th parallel, filled with hockey pucks, Tim Hortons coffee and Montreal bagels.

Some of my Canadian compatriots in the United States are even foreseeing some ripe romantic possibilities. One New York City lawyer I know has just seen her value on the dating market skyrocket  she has a Canadian passport and can move back to Vancouver whenever she wants.

As such, she is willing to consider the right American gentleman. But rest assured: The standards just got raised.

For the right offer, I will consider giving my hand in marriage to a smart, funny, catch of an American man looking to flee to Canada, she said, tongue-in-cheek. And by the right offer, I mean we need to fall in love. Wed better get started.

An added bonus: The countrys immigration minister recently said he is planning a new policy of offering permanent residency status to all spouses of Canadians, immediately upon arrival.

Other Canuck friends are noticing the trend, too. One recently attended a literary conference in Arizona. A hot topic among attendees? Moving to Canada if Trump got elected, she marvels. Republicans didnt like him any better than Democrats!

It should be noted, though: My American friends seem to assume, because of my mere Canadian-ness, that I somehow hold magic keys to the country, and can open doors for them. They envision simply walking through those doors, and then skating happily along Ottawas Rideau Canal with Justin Trudeau and a piping mug of hot chocolate.

So let me be clear: I do not run the immigration department. I dont know Justin. I am a freelance writer who lives in Brooklyn with a beagle.

There is a process  a path to citizenship, one might say  just as there is in America, involving countless forms and background checks and waiting periods. (Memo to self: Perhaps build a wall?)

As Trump continues to rack up more states, Canadians are starting to sense the rising panic south of the border. One Nova Scotian even did some expert trolling on social media recently, inviting those frightened of a Trump future to come start a new life in Cape Breton (http://cbiftrumpwins.com/).

But for my frantic American friends, I did feel it was my moral obligation to ask the Canadian government whether these masses of Trump refugees could get some special dispensation, and move to the front of the line.

Sorry, hosers  no dice. All applicants who apply to Canadas immigration programs are treated equally no matter where they are from, a government spokesman replied dryly, pointing potential applicants to the Come to Canada website.

Anyway, maybe none of this shall come to pass. Maybe Trump will lose the election and return to Celebrity Apprentice to fire Dennis Rodman or Gary Busey, and we can all go back to our regularly scheduled programming.

But maybe not, eh?",[]

The opinions expressed are his own.

American courts are taking aim at assault weapons  and putting a freer market in sight. Several federal judges recently upheld bans on the guns, which their makers call modern sporting rifles, adding heft to a Connecticut lawsuit that tests rules shielding firearms manufacturers from liability. The case is still a stretch, but growing recognition of limits on gun rights may eventually force the likes of Remington Arms and Smith & Wesson to compete without unfair legal protection.

The deadly 2012 shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school prompted New York, Maryland and other states to prohibit sales of semi-automatic high-capacity weapons like the AR-15 used in the massacre. Families of the victims targeted the gunmakers themselves, testing a loophole in the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.

That law bars most lawsuits but allows claims of negligent entrustment  supplying a product used to inflict harm. The suit alleges Remington, a gun distributor and a seller owned at the time by private equity firm Cerberus, negligently and willfully entrusted the public with a military-style rifle that was never meant for civilians.

The families face an uphill battle proving the dealer knew or should have known the gun would be used for nefarious purposes, as the law requires. The protections for manufacturers like Remington are even tougher. Yet a judge is hearing the case only about 20 miles from the tragedy, and she seemed receptive to the families arguments at a hearing last month.

Developments beyond Connecticut may also help their case. On Friday, a federal appeals court gave Marylands assault-weapons ban a reprieve, just days before opponents of New Yorks conceded defeat and declined to seek Supreme Court review  citing the death of gun-rights champion Justice Antonin Scalia as a factor. Other appellate judges have let prohibitions on these weapons stand, acknowledging there are highly lethal firearms that even the right to bear arms may not cover.

Thats potentially powerful support for a ruling in favor of the Newtown families. And if their case succeeds, gunsmiths might join virtually every other U.S. company in being legally accountable for selling an unreasonably dangerous product. As things stand now, the likes of Remington, Smith & Wesson and Sturm Ruger can engage in risky behavior that other firms must avoid.

Gun-rights advocates say thats just the price of freedom under the Constitutions Second Amendment. It sounds, however, a lot more like blatantly unfair competition.",[]

The Federal Reserve should remain on track to raise interest rates later this year despite the U.S. economy's weak start to the year and a stock market sell-off...

BOSTON The perpetrators of a $100 million digital heist at Bangladesh's central bank had deep knowledge of the institution's internal workings, likely gained by spying on bank workers, security experts said.

Unknown hackers breached Bangladesh Bank in early February, stole credentials for payment transfers and then ordered transfers out of a Federal Reserve Bank of New York account held by Bangladesh Bank, according to Bangladesh Bank officials.

Bangladesh government officials blamed the Fed for the attack when they disclosed the loss. The New York Fed responded on Tuesday saying there was no evidence its systems were compromised in the attack, one of the biggest bank thefts in history.

The Fed said it followed normal procedures when responding to requests that appeared to be from Bangladesh Bank, which were made and authenticated over SWIFT. Belgian-based SWIFT, a member-owned cooperative that banks use for account transfer requests and other secure messages, declined to comment on specifics of the case.

Security experts said that to pull off the attack, cyber criminals had to first gather information about Bangladesh Bank's procedures for ordering transfers, so that the fraudulent requests would not raise red flags.

In addition to stealing credentials for processing transfers, the hackers likely spied on Bangladesh Bank staff to get a deep understanding of the central bank's operations, according to experts in banking fraud.

Kayvan Alikhani, a senior director with security firm RSA, said that in addition to user names and passwords for accessing SWIFT, the hackers likely needed to obtain cryptographic keys that authenticated the senders.

Such certificates can be copied and used by impostors if they are not properly secured, he said.

You are only as good as your weakest link when getting access to the SWIFT network and doing a transfer, Alikhani said.

In a round of robberies disclosed last year, a group dubbed the Carbanak gang hacked into a number of banks around the world, seized control of computers that access SWIFT, then ordered fraudulent transfers.

They siphoned money through SWIFT after observing how bank employees crafted their messages so they could follow correct protocols, said Juan Guerrero, a researcher with Kaspersky Lab, which studied the campaign.

""The genius of the attacker in the Carbanak case is taking the time to learn directly from the victim and thus bypass fraud prevention measures through sheer mimicry, Guerrero told Reuters.

Another hacking method that could have been used is known as ""social engineering,"" where attackers play on human psychology to manipulate victims.

They get that information by hacking email accounts of employees who process transfers, said Tom Kellermann, a former member of the World Bank's security team.

""They sit and watch regular communications to understand when somebody would be most receptive to a specially crafted social-engineering email instructing them to make the transfer,"" said Kellermann, now chief executive of investment firm Strategic Cyber Ventures.

The New Zealand dollar NZD=D4 nursed losses after tumbling more than a cent after the RBNZ's decision early on Wednesday to cut its official cash rate by 25 basis points to 2.25 percent, citing a material decline in a range of inflation expectation measures. The central bank also signaled at least one more rate cut to come.

The New Zealand currency was last steady around a one-week low at $0.6655, after tumbling from the overnight high of $0.6809.

The ECB is expected to cut the deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.40 percent, announce more asset purchases and possibly introduce tiered interest rates like the Bank of Japan in a bid to boost inflation, according to a Reuters poll published on Monday.

""This is probably not a consensus view, but the market is almost pricing in the entire kitchen sink from the ECB, and I think it's setting itself up for disappointment,"" said Jennifer Vail, head of fixed-income research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon.

While tighter financial conditions a month ago may have warranted more drastic easing steps, some of those conditions have showed signs of improvement, she said, and therefore she expects only a further cut to interest rates into negative territory and a modest increase in purchases under the quantitative easing program.

""The size of their response has to be directly related to stress in the market,"" Vail said, adding that the euro could get a bump higher after the policy meeting outcome.

The common currency was down 0.1 percent at $1.0986 EUR= and slipped about 0.2 percent against the yen to 124.39 EURJPY=.

The dollar was steady against its Japanese counterpart at 113.26 yen JPY=.

Pershing Square, run by activist investor Bill Ackman, bought a stake in Valeant last year when the drugmaker's shares were on the rise. They have fallen 68 percent since.

Valeant said later on Wednesday it had jointly ended litigation with R&O Pharmacy with both sides asking the court to dismiss case. R&O was not immediately available for comment on the settlement.

While Valeant did not disclose the terms of the settlement, it said the resolution included a payment by R&O to Valeant. [nPn3vWq4v]

R&O sued Valeant in federal court in California on Oct. 6, after receiving a demand letter from Valeant for more than $69 million, money that R&O said it did not owe. [nL1N12P0OC]

Valeant later countersued R&O, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Last fall, the company became the target of two U.S. state investigations into its drug pricing practices, and its relationship with Philidor RX Services, a pharmacy selling its dermatology products, came under scrutiny and was dissolved. [nL3N12U450]

During the last two weeks, the company delayed its annual financial filing with regulators, postponed a preliminary earnings announcement, and said it would restate financials. Chief Executive Officer Michael Pearson returned from a two-month medical leave and a top dermatology executive left. It also disclosed an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Stephen Fraidin, a veteran Wall Street lawyer who is vice chairman at Pershing Square, joined the board, Valeant said. He previously worked at the Kirkland & Ellis law firm before joining Pershing last year.

Fred Eshelman, a drug executive who founded Furiex Pharmaceuticals Inc, and Thomas Ross, an academic who is a fellow at Duke University and president emeritus of the University of North Carolina, also joined the board.

Anders Lonner, former CEO of Swedish specialty drug company Meda AB (MEDAa.ST), stepped down from the board, Valeant said. The board now has 14 members.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has an ""underperform"" rating on the stock, said in a research note that Pershing Square had proposed Eshelman for the board at Allergan during its and Valeant's failed hostile bid for the company.

Maris said investors will likely have reservations about Ross as well, given his ties to Duke University, to which CEO Pearson has donated $45 million.

Valeant plans to report preliminary fourth-quarter earnings and hold a conference call on March 15.

On Tuesday, Ackman said the company will reveal ""messy"" fourth- and first-quarter results, and said Valeant needed to stabilize soon. If not, new management will be brought in or the company will be sold, he said.

Valeant's board set up a committee last year to look into the relationship between Valeant and Philidor. As a result of that ongoing investigation, it is restating financials. The committee is advised by Mark Filip, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis.

On Wednesday, its shares rose 6.6 percent to $67.20.

Police fired tear gas around midday, about 150-200 migrants and activists threw stones, and three makeshift shelters were set ablaze, according to a Reuters photographer at the site. Earlier, one person was arrested for trying to stop a group of about 20 workers under heavy police protection from clearing the site, where about 3,000 people are staying. ""The migrants are just going to run and hide in the woods and the police are going to have to go after them,"" said activist Francois Guennoc of the Auberge des Migrants migrant support group. Regional Prefect Fabienne Buccio had said the police presence was needed because ""extremists"" could try to intimidate migrants into turning down housing offers or buses to reception centers. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said last week that authorities would work with humanitarian organizations to relocate the migrants to a nearby park of converted shipping containers or other reception centers around France. On Thursday, a judge upheld a government order to evict migrants living in the southern part of the camp, although a few makeshift buildings of social importance such as a school and a theater are to remain untouched. Thousands of migrants fleeing war and poverty, from Afghanistan to Syria, have converged on the northern port over the past year. Many attempt to climb illegally onto trains using the Channel Tunnel or into lorries heading to Britain where they hope to settle.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:48:09+00:00,Trump rebounds in White House race; Sanders surprises Clinton,['Ginger Gibson'],"MONROE, N.C. Republican leaders opposed to Donald Trump becoming the party's U.S. presidential candidate warned on Wednesday that the billionaire businessman could become unstoppable if he wins two crucial nominating contests next week.

One of Trump's fiercest critics in the Republican Party, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, said that if the billionaire businessman extends his winning streak into crucial contests next week, the New Yorker's path to the nomination was all but inevitable.

""I'm worried that if we lose Florida and Ohio he may be unstoppable,"" said Graham, a former Republican candidate who was among the party's large field of early White House hopefuls.

With victories in nominating contests on Tuesday in three out of four states, Trump maintained his lead over the three remaining challengers in the race to be the Republican candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election.

On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton's surprise loss to Bernie Sanders in the important Michigan primary laid bare growing voter anger over trade, raising warning flags for her ahead of a possible election showdown against Trump.

On Wednesday, the often-combative Trump struck a more conciliatory tone toward the Republican establishment that has fiercely resisted his advance - first by backing favourite candidates who failed to win votes, then by pouring money into campaigns against him.

""If we embrace what is happening and everyone came together, instead of spending all this money on these ads ...,"" Trump told Fox News. ""If everyone came together, no one could beat the Republican Party. We would walk into Washington.""

He also praised U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan after speaking with him by phone this week, calling the Republican leader a ""good man.""

Trump, 69, fended off a week of attacks from the party's establishment and defied predictions his campaign might be losing steam with his primary wins on Tuesday in Michigan, the biggest prize of the night, as well as Mississippi and Hawaii. His closest challenger, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, won Idaho.

Trump's convincing win in Michigan narrowed prospects for the party's anti-Trump forces to stop him before next Tuesday's contests, which also include Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri.

Trump now has 458 of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination, with Cruz second with 359 delegates, according to the Associated Press. Rival Marco Rubio trails with 151 delegates, while John Kasich is far behind with 54.

ENDORSEMENTS: ANY ONE BUT TRUMP

Cruz, with enough primary victories to present himself as a viable Trump alternative, won the endorsement of former Republican rival Carly Fiorina on Wednesday and appealed to anti-Trump Republicans to back him.

""If you don't want to see Donald Trump as the nominee, if you don't want to hand the election on a silver platter to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, then I ask you to join us,"" Cruz said.

Trump, a former reality TV show host, has peppered his campaign with put-downs of rivals and critics. Many mainstream Republicans have been offended by his statements on Muslims, immigrants and women and alarmed by his threats to international trade deals.

But Cruz, 45, is a hard alternative for some of the mainstream Republican leadership to get behind. A fiscal and social conservative, he is unpopular with fellow senators who were targets of his personal attacks and who blame him for orchestrating a government shutdown in 2013 in a failed attempt to derail President Barack Obama's healthcare reforms.

In January, Graham called a choice between Trump and Cruz like ""being shot or poisoned."" But the senator softened his tone on Wednesday, saying it had become increasingly clear that ""Ted Cruz is the most viable alternative to Donald Trump.""

An aide to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who dropped out of the race last month, said Bush would meet with Cruz, fellow Floridian Rubio, and Kasich, governor of Ohio, in Miami before the March 15 contests. It was not clear if he planned to make an endorsement.

Clinton, 68, won in Mississippi, but the victory in Michigan by her opponent from Vermont was expected to prolong the fight to pick a candidate.

Clinton holds a sizable delegate lead, with 1,221 compared with Sanders' 571. She has been helped by winning Southern states by big margins and keeping most of her losses narrow.

Clinton's campaign has been dogged by questions over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and - in a sign the issue will not go away - the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit on Wednesday seeking emails between Clinton and her aides.

Trump could open a sizable delegate lead if he is able to win next Tuesday in Florida, Ohio, or Illinois, states that allot all their delegates to the winner.

Kasich, 63, of Ohio, and Rubio, 44, of Florida, could throw a wrench into Trump's delegate stash if they win in their home states next week.

UNITED NATIONS The United States and Iraq on Wednesday hosted a meeting of senior diplomats and U.N. officials to discuss the possible collapse of the Mosul hydro-electric dam, which U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power said would create a catastrophe of ""epic proportions.""

Mosul dam has sustained structural flaws since its construction in the 1980s. If it collapsed, a wall of water would flood the heavily populated Tigris River valley.

Wednesday's meeting at the United Nations included Power and her Iraqi counterpart, Mohamed Ali Alhakim, experts from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, officials from the U.N. Development Program and Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and other senior diplomats.

""The briefings on the Mosul dam today were chilling,"" Power said in a statement issued by the U.S. mission to the United Nations. ""While important steps have been taken to address a potential breach, the dam could still fail.""

""In the event of a breach, there is the potential in some places for a flood wave up to 14 meters (15 yards) high that could sweep up everything in its path, including people, cars, unexploded ordnance, waste and other hazardous material, further endangering massive population centers,"" she said.

Power said all U.N. member states should be prepared to help prevent what would be ""a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions.""

Approximately 500,000 to 1.47 million Iraqis live in the flood path, the U.S. statement said.

Iraq has signed a contract with Italy's Trevi Group worth 273 million euros (US$296 million) to reinforce and maintain the Mosul dam for 18 months.

Italy has said it planned to send 450 troops to protect the site of the dam, which is 3.6 km (2.2 miles) long and close to territory held by Islamic State militants.

Islamic State militants seized the dam in August 2014, raising fears they might blow it up. It was taken two weeks later by Iraqi government forces backed by U.S.-led coalition air strikes.

The Iraqi government has said it is taking precautions against the dam's collapse, while seeking to play down the risk.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:54:04+00:00,Peru bars Fujimori's biggest rival from presidential race,['Mitra Taj'],"Peru's presidential candidate Julio Guzman attends a news conference after the Special Jury of Elections, which approves presidential tickets, accepted a citizen's petition to declare Guzman's candidacy 'inadmissible' for the upcoming April elections, in Lima March 4, 2016....

LIMA Peru's electoral board kicked the main rival to presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori out of the race on a technicality on Wednesday, removing the front-runner's biggest obstacle to winning the office once held by her jailed father.

Fujimori, a center-right career politician and daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori, looks all but certain to win the April 10 first round after the board's 3-2 decision against centrist technocrat Julio Guzman but she cannot be sure of securing the 50 percent needed to win outright.

The National Jury of Elections ruled Guzman cannot take part in the elections because his party failed to comply with electoral procedures when registering its presidential ticket.

Guzman had been the only candidate seen coming close to tying with Fujimori in a run-off vote, but voters could still punish her in the second round if they feel Guzman and another candidate, Cesar Acuna, were pushed unfairly from the race.

The election winner would replace President Ollanta Humala, whose five year term ends this year.

Guzman, little known just months ago, vowed to keep campaigning while exhausting all legal avenues to get reinstated. He also heaped pressure on the electoral board to bar four other candidates, including Fujimori, from the contest, citing similar questions over compliance with election rules.

""If their cases are not treated with the same criteria, the current election and potential elected authorities will be illegitimate,"" Guzman said in a statement.

Fujimori's opponents accuse her and her running mate of illegally dishing out gifts and prizes to voters while campaigning - accusations she called ""absurd.""

The electoral board also rejected wealthy former governor and center-left populist Acuna's appeal to stay in the race after he gave cash to poor voters while campaigning, in violation of a new law.

Acuna, who had sunk to fourth place amid allegations of plagiarism, said he accepted the decision even though he thought it was undemocratic. Unlike Guzman, Acuna's party can still take part in elections and win congressional seats.

Recent opinion polls indicated the quarter of votes that Guzman and Acuna expected to draw in the first round would be split among several candidates, with Fujimori and former prime minister Pedro Pablo Kuczynski benefiting most.

'HORRIBLE PRECEDENT'

Guzman said he would launch an ""extraordinary"" appeal before the electoral board, a move constitutional lawyers said was unlikely to succeed. Guzman said a delegation from the Organization of American States was traveling to Peru on Monday.

He said he would also seek the intervention of the local courts as well as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, processes that could take months.

Guzman's candidacy bounced between electoral boards for more than a month, exasperating many Peruvians and stoking suspicions of foul play. The electoral board chief, who voted in favor of admitting Guzman, said last month he had received death threats.

Peru's electoral board has not sparked so much controversy since 2000, when it let Alberto Fujimori run for a third term despite a constitutional ban. Fujimori is now serving a 25-year jail sentence for ordering death squads to conduct massacres in the fight to quash a leftist insurgency and for corruption.

""No modern democracy excludes major presidential candidates...for breaking minor rules,"" said Harvard University political scientist Steve Levitsky. ""It's a horrible precedent.""

On the streets of Lima, many voters said Guzman and Acuna deserved to be excluded for breaking rules, but their supporters said that they felt cheated and would spoil their ballots. Voting is mandatory in Peru.

""It's not fair. Supposedly this is a democracy and everyone can take part,"" said Carlos Ortega, a 39-year-old engineer who had intended to vote for Acuna. ""If this continues, the only one left will be Keiko.""

reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:28:37+00:00,Pennsylvania gun control advocates challenge law on city gun rules,['Daniel Kelley'],"PHILADELPHIA Pennsylvania gun control advocates on Wednesday asked the state's top court to knock down a 2014 law allowing gun-rights lobbying groups to sue cities that adopt gun restrictions and recoup legal costs if they prevail.

Firearms advocates, including the National Rifle Association, contend the law is necessary to prevent gun owners from becoming ensnared by a patchwork of municipal ordinances that violate their right to bear arms.

Gun control advocates challenged the law on a technicality - that it passed as part of what they called an unrelated piece of legislation.

""These two bills were cobbled together for political expediency at the end of the legislative session,"" Martin Black, representing five Democratic lawmakers who sued to overturn the law, told the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.More than 80 towns across Pennsylvania repealed gun laws - ranging from requirements that owners report lost or stolen firearms to bans on guns in public parks - rather than face hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal bills to defend ordinances that were seldom enforced. Five municipalities, including Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, have faced lawsuits under the law.

The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the right to bear arms, and efforts to regulate gun ownership are often fiercely contested.

Wednesday's arguments focused on the tortured legislative history of the bill and whether its passage violated a provision of the state's Constitution that specifies that laws must focus on a single issue.

A lower court found last June that the passage was unconstitutional because Republican lawmakers tucked the firearms legislation into a bill dealing with scrap metal.

That bill passed on the final day of the 2014 legislative session and was so rushed that Republican Governor Tom Corbett signed the wrong bill.

Republican legislators said at the time that the language was necessary because towns were ignoring laws that made it a criminal offense for towns to pass gun restrictions.

""What does suing the city over a firearms matter have to do with the theft of copper wire?"" asked a skeptical Justice David Wecht.

Attorney Nick Orloff, arguing on behalf of Republican legislators, said both bills dealt with crime prevention.

""It's meant to deter crime,"" Orloff said.

But Shira Goodman, executive director of CeaseFire PA, scoffed at that idea.

""Say the city of Philadelphia passes a soda tax,"" Goodman said. ""If I don't drink soda, I don't get to sue because I didn't pay the tax.""

Pershing Square, run by activist investor Bill Ackman, bought a stake in Valeant last year when the drugmaker's shares were on the rise. They have fallen 68 percent since.

Valeant said later on Wednesday it had jointly ended litigation with R&O Pharmacy with both sides asking the court to dismiss case. R&O was not immediately available for comment on the settlement.

While Valeant did not disclose the terms of the settlement, it said the resolution included a payment by R&O to Valeant. [nPn3vWq4v]

R&O sued Valeant in federal court in California on Oct. 6, after receiving a demand letter from Valeant for more than $69 million, money that R&O said it did not owe. [nL1N12P0OC]

Valeant later countersued R&O, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Last fall, the company became the target of two U.S. state investigations into its drug pricing practices, and its relationship with Philidor RX Services, a pharmacy selling its dermatology products, came under scrutiny and was dissolved. [nL3N12U450]

During the last two weeks, the company delayed its annual financial filing with regulators, postponed a preliminary earnings announcement, and said it would restate financials. Chief Executive Officer Michael Pearson returned from a two-month medical leave and a top dermatology executive left. It also disclosed an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Stephen Fraidin, a veteran Wall Street lawyer who is vice chairman at Pershing Square, joined the board, Valeant said. He previously worked at the Kirkland & Ellis law firm before joining Pershing last year.

Fred Eshelman, a drug executive who founded Furiex Pharmaceuticals Inc, and Thomas Ross, an academic who is a fellow at Duke University and president emeritus of the University of North Carolina, also joined the board.

Anders Lonner, former CEO of Swedish specialty drug company Meda AB (MEDAa.ST), stepped down from the board, Valeant said. The board now has 14 members.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has an ""underperform"" rating on the stock, said in a research note that Pershing Square had proposed Eshelman for the board at Allergan during its and Valeant's failed hostile bid for the company.

Maris said investors will likely have reservations about Ross as well, given his ties to Duke University, to which CEO Pearson has donated $45 million.

Valeant plans to report preliminary fourth-quarter earnings and hold a conference call on March 15.

On Tuesday, Ackman said the company will reveal ""messy"" fourth- and first-quarter results, and said Valeant needed to stabilize soon. If not, new management will be brought in or the company will be sold, he said.

Valeant's board set up a committee last year to look into the relationship between Valeant and Philidor. As a result of that ongoing investigation, it is restating financials. The committee is advised by Mark Filip, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis.

On Wednesday, its shares rose 6.6 percent to $67.20.

Kaufman, who wrote the screenplays for ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", has not been a presence in the cinema since he made his directorial debut with the highly regarded but quirky ""Synecdoche, New York"" (2008). He is making his return with this 90-minute film focusing on a motivational speaker named Michael, who flies into Cincinnati from Britain on a soul-sapping business trip. Suffering from the type of identity crisis for which Kaufman characters are famous, Michael meets up during his one-night visit with an old flame, who has never gotten over him dumping her, and a woman named Lisa, who has come to hear him speak and who gives Michael new inspiration for life. Kaufman told Reuters that this was ""another experiment."" Having not worked with stop motion animation before, he described it as ""exciting and scary and fun."" Jennifer Jason Leigh (""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"") is Lisa, whom Michael decides to rechristen Anomalisa when he falls for her. David Thewlis (Remus Lupin in ""Harry Potter"") voices Michael and Tom Noonan (""12 Monkeys"" TV series) is everyone else -- from the taxi driver who drives Michael to his hotel, to the receptionist, to everyone, male and female, in the hotel bar and so on. Kaufman said that the idea of Noonan voicing all the other characters was inspired by a psychotic belief called the Fregoli delusion where you think that ""everyone else in the world is the same person."" ""Anomalisa"" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, a Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film, and five Annie Awards. It became the first animated film to win the Grand Jury Prizeat the 72nd Venice International Film Festival, after premiering at the Telluride Film Festival.

He was considered the most successful music producer ever, cited in the Guinness Book of Records for having more than 50 No. 1 hit records over five decades in the United States and Britain alone.

He helped score, arrange, and produce many of the band's biggest hits, including ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand,"" ""A Day in the Life"", Yesterday, ""Eleanor Rigby"" and ""Love Me Do"".

""Im so sad to hear the news of the passing of dear George Martin,"" Beatle Paul McCartney said in a statement on Wednesday.

""If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle it was George.""

A statement from Martin's family confirmed he had died peacefully at his home on Tuesday evening.

Earlier, Ringo Starr, the Beatles' drummer, had announced his death on Twitter: ""God bless George Martin peace and love to Judy and his family... George will be missed.""

Starr followed the message by posting a black and white photo of the Fab Four with Martin, saying ""Thank you for all your love and kindness George.""

Martin served as producer, collaborator and mentor to Beatles John Lennon, George Harrison, McCartney and Starr.

Lennon was shot dead in New York in 1980. Harrison died of cancer in 2001.

Tributes from the music world poured in on Twitter. ""RIP to my musical brother George Martin. We were friends since 1964, & I am so thankful 4 that gift,"" said American music producer Quincy Jones.

Lenny Kravitz said: ""The legends are really going home!"" Boy George said: ""George Martin. Gentleman and legend"", while Mark Ronson said Martin was ""the greatest British record producer of all time.""

Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron said on Twitter: ""George Martin was a giant of music - working with the Fab Four to create the world's most enduring pop music.""

""YESTERDAY""

During his seven-decade career in the music industry, Martin produced almost all of the Beatles' recordings and also worked with Gerry & the Pacemakers, Shirley Bassey, Cilla Black, Jeff Beck, America, Cheap Trick and other acts.

Martin started work at Abbey Road Studios in 1950 producing records for EMI's Parlophone label.

He was noted for his comedy recordings with the likes of Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Beyond the Fringe and got his first Number 1 with The Temperance Seven in 1961. He signed The Beatles in 1962

The young band members were rough around the edges, but Martin saw their commercial promise and with them helped revolutionise the art of popular music recording.

His 1979 autobiography, ""All You Need Is Ears"", chronicles his discovery of the Beatles and their creative process.

Martin was knighted in 1996. In 2006, working with his son, Giles Martin, he helped develop the Beatles-inspired Cirque du Soleil show ""Love"" in Las Vegas, which went on to reap his two most recent Grammys.

Teva, the world's biggest generic drugsmaker, will divest some drugs already on the market and others in the pipeline to address competition concerns by the European Commission, the people said. The package includes products from both Teva and Allergan.

Other sources had previously told Reuters that assets worth about $1 billion in the United States, Europe and the Middle East would be sold in order to secure the green light from regulators.

Teva will gain bigger economies of scale, a crucial element in the low-margin generic drugs business, with the deal, the largest in Israel's corporate history.

The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the case on Thursday, and Teva declined to comment.

The deal, which requires U.S. approval, has triggered a warning from the American Antitrust Institute that a more concentrated generic market usually comes with higher prices. The think-tank also said divestments may not be enough to ensure competition in the market in a letter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in January.

Dublin-based Botox-maker Allergan in turn is to be acquired by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) in a $160 billion deal creating the world's largest drugmaker.

Migrants wave the German flag as they protest at a makeshift camp on the Greek-Macedonian border, near the village of Idomeni, Greece March 9, 2016.

BRUSSELS For the second time since Europe's migration crisis began last year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has stunned her European Union partners by staking her political capital on a unilateral initiative and demanding their support.

After rolling out the welcome mat in September for Syrian refugees streaming into Europe, to the alarm of many European leaders who were not consulted, she has now gambled on a last-minute deal with Turkey to stop the migrant flow.

Whether that tentative bargain - improvised in the middle of the night a week before German regional elections in which her party faces losses - will turn out to be a breakthrough or a landmine in the migrant crisis remains to be seen.

Reaction at home to Merkel's Turkish gamble has been mixed. Top-selling Bild newspaper welcomed the deal with the headline ""Ball in Turkey's court"", but some of her own conservative lawmakers object to giving Turks visa-free travel in exchange.

German officials say it was Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu who surprised everyone by arriving at a meeting with Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in Brussels on Sunday night with a bold plan offering to take back all migrants who cross into Europe in return for political and economic rewards.

Merkel immediately sensed that the deal could ""change the whole dynamic"", a German official said, adding that the gains would far outweigh concessions the EU would make in return.

Davutoglu's price was a doubling of European money to keep Syrian refugees in Turkey, faster visa liberalisation for Turks and accelerated EU membership talks for Ankara.

European Union diplomats and officials in Brussels were flabbergasted by the proposal sprung on them at a summit on Monday, with some irritated at having been kept in the dark during the preparations.

""Ask Mrs Merkel,"" one responded when asked how the idea of sending back all migrants, including Syrian refugees, to Turkey was compatible with international law.

LITTLE CLUE

European Council President Donald Tusk - who chaired Monday's summit - spent two days in Ankara and Istanbul last week meeting Davutoglu and President Tayyip Erdogan, working for a different deal, and was given little clue of what was coming.

Neither Tusk nor European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was invited to the Sunday night preparatory meeting.

Nor was France, Germany's closest European partner, which has minimised its commitment to take in refugees due to security fears since last November's Islamist attacks in Paris but also to the rise of far-right anti-immigration leader Marine Le Pen.

While Merkel took care to involve French President Francois Hollande in her diplomacy with Russia over Ukraine, she turned to Rutte this time as one of the few EU leaders willing to take in Syrian refugees directly from Turkey. Rutte also has a role in running the six-month Dutch presidency of EU meetings.

The proposal for a one-for-one swap in which Europe would admit one Syrian refugee from Turkey for each one the Turks took back from Greek islands - among the most contentious aspects of the draft deal - was first introduced by the Dutch. That left open how many might be brought to Europe - after Merkel found no takers for earlier German suggestions of accepting hundreds of thousands.

Diplomats said that when some leaders asked Tusk why he had not briefed them about the Turkish plan after his trip, he acknowledged that he had not known about the crucial offer to take back all migrants and refugees until Monday morning.

In fact, the former Polish prime minister was caught in a tug-of-war between Merkel and Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann, who infuriated her by holding a conference of central European and Balkan countries last month, without Germany or Greece, to coordinate the closure of their borders to migrants.

""There was a race between Merkel's Plan A and the central Europeans' Plan B, which she suspected Tusk of supporting,"" one EU envoy said. ""So Tusk was sidelined."" Tusk was indeed pushing hard for a closure of the Balkan migration route and had secured broad support for that from EU envoys on Sunday afternoon.

Plan A, which Merkel called a ""European solution"", entailed persuading Ankara to stop migrants leaving its shores, returning those who do not qualify for asylum to home countries or to Turkey, and sharing out legitimate refugees among EU countries.

Plan B, reflecting scepticism that Ankara would deliver and exhaustion with continued arrivals, involved shutting borders across the Balkans and bottling up new migrants in Greece. For Tusk, that was a way of showing the Turks that if they did not halt departures, Europe would act alone and withdraw its offers.

Davutoglu's Plan C was more ambitious than either, but there are big doubts about whether it can be implemented, whether it will work and whether it is legal.

IMPRESSION OF PROGRESS

Although Merkel denied domestic motives, the timing was helpful. The initiative offered a crucial sign of progress six days before votes in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt on which her political future may be riding.

Heavy defeats for her Christian Democrats could weaken her and might raise question marks over her ability to lead the party into next year's general election, although her popularity is still high and no alternative leader is in sight.

The legality, enforceability and feasibility of Davutoglu's offer will only be tested after the state polls.

Officially, the European Commission is clinging to the line that a formal agreement with Turkey to be concluded at the next summit on March 17-18 will ""at the end of it"" comply with both European and international law.

Juncker said European law allowed the return of irregular migrants to any ""safe"" third country, but added that Greece and Turkey would need to amend some domestic rules.

EU insiders say for the proposed arrangement to be legal, Turkey would have to change the way it applies the Geneva Convention on refugees to include non-European nationals, and Greece would have to create a special court to hear asylum seekers' appeals against being sent back to Turkey.

Under EU rules, migrants are entitled to appeal against being returned to a third country on grounds of a risk to their life or safety there, but the court would not consider their claim for protection from their own country.

Merkel's embrace of the Turkish plan may pose political problems for Hollande, British Prime Minister David Cameron - struggling to win a referendum in June on staying in the EU in which immigration is a big issue - and Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, whose country is the most outspoken in the EU about Turkey's human rights record.

However, most fellow leaders are reluctant to resist Merkel, the EU's longest-serving national leader at the head of its most powerful member state, in her hour of political need.

The protest took place at the Blanco Galindo bridge which joins the central city of Cochabamba with the rest of the country. The demonstrators are seeking a 500 boliviano ($72 U.S. dollar) monthly benefit, an increase from the current 83 boliviano ($12 U.S. dollar) monthly amount, and have been protesting for several weeks. A similar protest took place last month. Some demonstrators are going to extremes by allowing themselves to be enclosed for days inside a tiny brick enclosure. One woman, Prima Manuel, said she and the others were getting desperate as they have not received any response from the government. ""We ask the government and authorities to please engage in a dialogue with this sector (of people with disabilities). If they will not hold talks, it doesn't matter. I feel sorry for my colleagues who have to suffer hanging up there in the heat!"" Manuel said. Local media reported the government had allocated some 40 million bolivianos ($5.8 million U.S. dollars) for the disabled. But the pool has been divided into two groups - half has been paid out as a monthly stipend and the other half has been used for funding projects for the disabled. The Cochabamba protesters said the funds going to the projects do not help and they want everything to be paid out as a monthly stipend. Meanwhile, Cochabamba Governor Ivan Canelas told local media the matter had to be solved by the federal government. The demonstrators said they will continue protesting even if it means making a wheelchair-bound march to La Paz. Other cities, such as Potosi, Santa Cruz, Sucre and El Alto, have joined in with protests, which include hunger strikes.",[]
reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:27:52+00:00,Exclusive: Bank of America hiring bankers for new middle-market push - sources,"['Dan Freed', 'Olivia Oran']","Bank of America Corp is hiring a new team of investment bankers who cater to mid-size companies, four years after dismantling a similar business, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The precise number of middle-market bankers it plans to add could not be determined, but one person said it would be fewer than 10.

The hiring comes as Bank of America is reducing staff more broadly, while also trying to grow in areas where it believes it can gain market share. As the second-biggest U.S. lender with a large commercial banking business, executives believe Bank of America can make inroads in advising mid-sized companies on mergers and stock and bond offerings, the sources said. Middle-market deals are generally considered transactions worth less than $500 million.

The bank also hopes the push will lead to additional business such as managing money for executives at mid-sized companies. Sources asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media about matters that have not been made public.

Bank of America announced internally last year that Vice Chairman Mark Stephanz would create a group that provides investment banking services to mid-size companies. The hiring is part of that effort. His team will work together with counterparts in the commercial bank who provide traditional loans and cash management services, sources said.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender previously launched a middle-market business in 2007, with over 30 investment bankers who focused on mergers and acquisitions. It abandoned the effort in 2012 to focus on larger clients and bigger deals, sources said.

In 2015, Bank of America ranked fourth in global M&A league tables, according to Thomson Reuters data. It ranked 23rd globally for middle-market deals.

Bank of America generated around 17 percent of its M&A fees from middle market deals, the lowest percentage of any big Wall Street bank except Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Last year, M&A hit a record volume of nearly $5 trillion, due to mega deals like Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA's $106 billion acquisition of SABMiller Plc and oil firm Royal Dutch Shell Plc's $70 billion purchase of BG Group Plc.

But some Wall Street executives predict blockbuster deals will slow down this year. In January, JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said she expects to see fewer giant mergers and more mid-sized deals.

Bank of America has been hiring salespeople to drum up business, even as it has cut support staff and underperformers as part of a multi-year cost-cutting initiative. Last year alone, it cut more than 10,000 jobs.

The bank laid off a number of investment bankers on Tuesday because of weak markets, one of the sources said.

Por Eduardo Simoes

SAO PAULO O Ministerio Publico Estadual de Sao Paulo apresentou nesta quarta-feira denuncia contra o ex-presidente Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva no caso em que e investigado por suspeita de ser o proprietario oculto de um apartamento triplex no Guaruja, no litoral paulista, informou a assessoria de imprensa do orgao.

O ex-presidente nega ser proprietario do triplex, e sua defesa afirma que o promotor Cassio Conserino, responsavel pela investigacao contra Lula, nao e competente para realizar a investigacao por ter descumprido as regras do Ministerio Publico ao assumir o caso e por ter emitido, ainda na avaliacao da defesa, prejulgamento contra Lula.

O imovel no Guaruja tambem e alvo de investigacoes do Ministerio Publico Federal por alegacoes de que unidades do predio teriam sido usadas para lavagem de dinheiro do pagamento de propina pela construtora OAS, que fez a obra e e uma das investigadas pela operacao Lava Jato.

Em nota apos o anuncio da denuncia do MP, a defesa do Lula afirmou que Conserino ja havia antecipado a imprensa que denunciaria o ex-presidente e que a ""formalizacao do resultado"" apenas deixa claro ""que a apuracao nao foi isenta, decorrendo tao somente da parcialidade e da intencao deliberada de macular a imagem de Lula, imputando crime a pessoa que o promotor sabe ser inocente"".

""Conserino transformou duas visitas a um apartamento no Guaruja em ocultacao de patrimonio. A familia do ex-presidente Lula nunca escondeu que detinha uma cota-parte de um empreendimento da Bancoop (cooperativa imobiliaria dos bancarios), tendo solicitado o resgate desta cota no final de 2015"", afirma a nota, que lembra que o promotor e alvo de sindicancia por sua conduta no caso.

Tambem em nota, o Instituto Lula reiterou a avaliacao de que o promotor prejulgou o caso, que nao e o promotor natural do caso e voltou a dizer que o ex-presidente nao cometeu irregularidades.

""O ex-presidente Lula nao e proprietario nem de triplex no Guaruja nem de sitio em Atibaia, e nao cometeu nenhuma ilegalidade. Ele apresentou sua defesa e documentos que provam isso ao promotor Cassio Conserino"", disse o instituto.

""Essa denuncia so reforca necessidade do Supremo Tribunal Federal de avaliar acao dos advogados do ex-presidente sobre a competencia da investigacao feita em duplicidade pelo Ministerio Publico Federal e pelo Ministerio Publico de Sao Paulo.""

A avaliacao do Palacio do Planalto, segundo uma fonte, sobre a denuncia e que teve um forte componente politico, especialmente por ser anunciada as vesperas das manifestacoes contra o governo, marcadas para o proximo domingo, em todo o pais.

Essa fonte palaciana disse ainda, sob condicao de anonimato, que a denuncia do MP paulista reforca a ideia de que Lula assuma um ministerio, o que lhe daria foro privilegiado junto ao Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) e tiraria o ex-presidente do alcance do MP paulista.

Alem da denuncia pelo MP de Sao Paulo, Lula tambem foi o principal alvo da 24a fase da operacao Lava Jato, que investiga um bilionario esquema de corrupcao na Petrobras, sob suspeita de ter recebido vantagens indevidas de empreiteiras investigadas na Lava Jato.

Entre essas vantagens estariam o triplex no Guaruja e um sitio em Atibaia (SP).

Na ultima sexta-feira, data em que foi deflagrada a fase mais recente da Lava Jato, Lula foi obrigado a prestar depoimento a Policia Federal apos o juiz federal Sergio Moro, que cuida das acoes da Lava Jato na primeira instancia, emitir mandado de conducao coercitiva contra ele.

Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) said on Wednesday it would buy U.S. options exchange operator International Securities Exchange for $1.1 billion from Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1Gn.DE), the latest deal to emerge from a spate of exchange merger talks.

ISE operates three electronic options exchanges which together account for more than 15 percent of U.S. volume, while Nasdaq operates another three. Combined, Nasdaq would command more than 40 percent of the market, extending its lead as the No. 1 U.S. options exchange operator.

""The ability to further that lead gives us advantages as to how we could serve our customers because you have a different volume versus scale arrangement,"" Nasdaq Chief Executive Bob Greifeld said in an interview.

The deal would also free up capital for Deutsche Boerse, which has said it plans to merge with the London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE.L) to create a European trading powerhouse that could better compete against U.S. rivals.

Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) said it may make a rival bid for the LSE, raising the prospects of a takeover battle.

Nasdaq, which plans to move ISE's trading platforms onto Nasdaq technology, said it could strip out $40 million from the two businesses through the transaction.

The deal would also give Nasdaq an additional 20 percent stake in the Options Clearing Corporation, for a total of 40 percent ownership in the world's largest equity derivatives clearing corporation.

Greifeld said he had been looking to buy ISE for years, and talks with Deutsche Boerse CEO Carsten Kengeter picked up over the past three months.

The deal does not include ISE's stake in No. 2 U.S. stock exchange operator BATS Global Markets, or blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings, which will continue to be owned by Deutsche Boerse, the German company said.

Nasdaq said the transaction was expected to be finalized in the second half of the year, pending regulatory approval, and it would likely increase earnings within 12 months of closing.

Nasdaq has made several acquisitions in recent years that have helped boost its profits and share price. These include Chi-X Canada, that country's largest alternative trading system, in a deal that closed last month; and index provider Dorsey, Wright & Associates last year.

WASHINGTON The Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear Apple Inc's challenge to an appellate court decision that it conspired with five publishers to increase e-book prices, meaning it will have to pay $450 million as part of a settlement.

The court's decision not to hear the case leaves in place a June 2015 ruling by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that found Apple (AAPL.O) liable for engaging in a conspiracy that violated federal antitrust laws.

Apple, in asking the high court to hear the case, said the June appeals court decision that the company had conspired with the publishers contradicted Supreme Court precedent and would ""chill innovation and risk-taking.""

The 2nd Circuit's ruling followed a 2013 decision by U.S. District Judge Denise Cote that Apple played a ""central role"" in a conspiracy with publishers to raise e-book prices.

The Justice Department said the scheme caused some e-book prices to rise to $12.99 or $14.99 from the $9.99 price previously charged by market leader Amazon.com Inc.(AMZN.O)

""Apples liability for knowingly conspiring with book publishers to raise the prices of e-books is settled once and for all,"" said Bill Baer, head of the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division.

Publishers that the Justice Department said conspired with Apple include Lagardere SCA's (LAGA.PA) Hachette Book Group Inc, News Corp's (NWSA.O) HarperCollins Publishers LLC, Penguin Group Inc, CBS Corp's (CBS.N) Simon & Schuster Inc and Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH's Macmillan.

RECOMMENDED: A hacker's ransom for Apple customers

On Feb. 17, the appeals court in New York upheld the proposed settlement, which had been challenged by an e-books purchaser.

The publishers were concerned about the price of e-books being pushed down by Amazon while Apple was looking for a way to make its new iPad product a hit and was seeking to break up Amazon's low-cost dominance in the digital book market.

Apple and the publishers agreed on an arrangement in which Apple would get a 30 percent commission and publishers were allowed to set the prices for their books, a tactic known as ""agency pricing"" that prevents discounting.

The publishers also agreed they would charge all outlets the same amount, meaning Amazon was forced to raise its prices. E-books that had cost $9.99 suddenly cost $12.99 or $14.99.

Amazon said in a statement it was ""ready to distribute the court-mandated settlement funds to Kindle customers as soon as were instructed to move forward.""

Apple did not respond to requests for comment.

Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports

Mildronate (Meldonium) medication capsules are pictured on the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, in this November 23, 2010 file photo.

A manufacturing operator works at the Mildronate (Meldonium) medication packaging process in the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, November 23, 2010. Picture taken November 23, 2010.

LONDON, March 9 The medicine Maria Sharapova says she has taken for 10 years due to a family history of heart issues and diabetes is an old drug sold in just a few Eastern European countries that can also boost exercise tolerance.

The tennis star tested positive for the banned drug meldonium, or Mildronate, in a sample taken on January 26, the day of her Australian Open quarter finals defeat to Serena Williams.

RECOMMENDED: Trump's foreign labor practices in the spotlight

She said her family doctor had first given her the drug 10 years ago after she frequently became sick, had irregular electrocardiogram results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.

The 28-year old Russian, a five-time grand slam champion and the highest paid woman in sports, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said.

For the health conditions Sharapova says she has, however, doctors say the scientific evidence for Mildronate is limited compared with many medicines widely available in Europe and the United States, where Sharapova trains, which have full regulatory backing and years of robust safety and efficacy data.

LATVIAN DRUG

Meldonium is cheap and available over the counter without a prescription in some eastern European countries, where it is marketed as Mildronate by the Latvian pharmaceutical firm Grindeks (GRD1R.RI).

The drug, originally developed by scientists at the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, is not licensed by two of the world's biggest medicines regulators: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States where Sharapova trains, and the EU's European Medicines Agency.

RECOMMENDED: Iran tests more missiles, says capable of reaching Israel

A spokeswoman for Grindeks said the firm had not applied for a license for Mildronate from either the FDA or the EMA, but said the drug is registered in Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union.

She said it is designed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular diseases, including angina, chronic heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other cardiovascular disorders.

Grindeks' also promotes it for people with reduced working capacity from physical or psycho-emotional ""overload"", and during recovery from cerebrovascular disorders, head injury and encephalitis. It is not indicated for diabetes.

Tim Chico, a consultant cardiologist at Britain's Sheffield University, said it was unlikely that such a young and extremely fit woman would be suffering from a serious heart condition like angina, or would be able to play top level tennis if she were.

Asked how long the drug should be given to a patient, the Grindeks spokeswoman said in an emailed statement: ""Depending on the patient health condition, treatment course of meldonium preparations may vary from 4 to 6 weeks"". Such courses could be repeated two or three times in a year.

In an emailed reply to questions from Reuters about her medical reasons for using the drug, Sharapova's lawyer John Haggerty said: ""While I cannot go into detail out of respect for the ITF process, I can confirm that Ms Sharapova had abnormal EKG tests in 2006 and was also diagnosed with asthenia (a lack of energy or strength), decreased immunity and diabetes indicators.""

""She also had a family history of heart conditions,"" Haggerty said. ""The Mildronate and the other medicines recommended by her doctor treated these conditions.""

Munir Pirmohamed, a professor of molecular and clinical pharmacology at Britain's University of Liverpool, said the crucial issue with Mildronate for him is its lack of approval from EU and U.S. regulators.

""As a physician, this is not something I have, or would ever, prescribe,"" he said.

Others noted it was rare for a doctor treating illness to prescribe a drug that is unavailable in the country where the patient lives.

""Sharapova has been a U.S. resident since early in her career, which does bring in a question of how or why she is using a drug that is not licensed there,"" said Tom Bassindale, a lecturer in forensic science at Sheffield Hallam University.

Sharapova's agent Max Eisenbud was not available at his Miami office and did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

HELPS MUSCLES COPE

Whatever its medical benefits, research suggests Mildronate may have potential as a performance-enhancing drug for sports.

It reduces the level of a metabolite called carnetine in muscles, and by doing that helps muscles cope better with high levels of stress and low oxygen levels.

""Because it effects the cellular metabolism, it would increase energy production within cells and therefore make oxygen utilization more efficient,"" said Pirmohamed.

In a 2010 academic paper published in a review journal called Seminars in Cardiovascular Medicine and cited on the Grindeks company website, it has been shown to improve exercise tolerance in patients with heart problems.

The World Anti-Doping Agency, which banned the drug in January after previously having it on a ""watch list"", ranks it as a prohibited metabolic modulator and cites ""evidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance.""

Grindeks says the drug could protect athletes from cell damage, but says it would be unlikely to improve their competitive performance.

It would be ""reasonable to recommend (sports people) to use meldonium as a cell protector to avoid heart failure or muscle damage in case of unwanted overload,"" the spokeswoman said.

Athletes ""should not expect increase of physical capacity, but, for sure, they will be protected against ischemic damages of cells in case of overload.""

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks during Question Period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Canada, February 24, 2016.

A cyclist passes U.S. and Canadian flags placed side-by-side on the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House in Washington March 8, 2016.

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are set to discuss new ideas for curbing climate change and expanding trade during an Oval Office meeting this week, White House officials said during a preview on Tuesday.

Trudeau, who pledged to repair frayed ties with the United States when he took office in November, will meet with Obama on Thursday ahead of a star-studded state dinner.

The White House, which sees a natural partner in Trudeau, hopes the two countries can commit to cut methane emissions from the energy sector by 40 percent to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025, and endorse an initiative to stop routine flaring from oil and gas fields, said Todd Stern, the U.S. climate envoy.

The commitment of both leaders to addressing this global challenge is clear and I expect under their leadership North America will make significant progress this year, Stern told reporters.

Stern said the two countries also are looking at ways to make carbon emissions from the aviation sector ""neutral,"" starting in 2020 through the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization.

The United States also hopes to accelerate the timetable to phase out HFCs, industrial gases that have far more potential to trap the earth's heat than carbon dioxide, through an amendment to the Montreal Protocol, Stern said.

On trade, a hot-button issue for both Democrats and Republicans in the race to succeed Obama in the Nov. 8 presidential election, the leaders are likely to discuss two longstanding irritants, softwood lumber and meat labeling.

A deal governing Canadian softwood lumber exports expired last year, and the two nations are talking about a new arrangement, said Mark Feierstein, the White House National Security Council's senior director for the Western hemisphere.

""Were open to exploring all options with Canada at this point,"" Feierstein said, declining to put timelines on when a deal may be reached.

OTTAWA The United States sees no urgent need for a new energy pipeline between Canada and the United States, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday, in a broadcast interview ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

The U.S. government will evaluate new proposals individually, but is looking at new, cleaner technologies, Kerry said to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

""We have some 300 pipelines, it's not as if we're pipeline-less,"" Kerry said, according to a story on the broadcaster's website. ""Things change, technologies in particular help to change things, and we need to push the technology curve.""

Trudeau will attend a state dinner on Thursday, becoming the first Canadian leader to do so since 1997, as the two countries aim to fix a frayed relationship.

U.S. President Barack Obama last year blocked the cross-border Keystone XL crude oil pipeline proposed by TransCanada Corp in a victory for environmentalists.

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama is fully committed to pushing for Congress to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal despite anti-trade sentiment gaining steam on the presidential election campaign trail, National Security Adviser Susan Rice said on Wednesday.

Voter anxiety and anger over international trade and the 12-nation Pacific trade pact have helped propel the campaign of Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, as well as Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.

""The president remains fully committed to working to achieve ratification on the U.S. side and encouraging all of our TPP partners to move through their domestic processes to do the same,"" Rice told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.

For Obama, the TPP is a legacy issue, and standing firm on the pact reassures other nations with high expectations for the deal. At the same time, it highlights a division with Clinton, a close political ally, who has been grappling with Democratic anxiety about trade on the campaign trail.

Obama's commitment to the trade deal means that it will likely remain a hot campaign issue and exposes Clinton to trade-bashing rhetoric ahead of the Nov. 8 vote to elect Obama's successor.

Sanders has accused Clinton of backing ""disastrous"" trade policies that moved manufacturing jobs overseas, and questioned the sincerity of her opposition to the TPP since she became a presidential candidate.

Clinton had supported the trade pact when she was secretary of state during Obama's first term, but later said she was worried the deal would not do enough to crack down on currency manipulation or protect consumers from excessively high drug prices.

Sanders' unexpected victory in the Democratic primary in Michigan on Tuesday suggests that his criticism is resonating with some voters, and could spell trouble ahead for Clinton in states such as Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

Trump's anti-free trade rhetoric and promise to slap taxes on cars and parts shipped in from Mexico have also found support among Republican voters, helping him score a big victory in the party' primary in Michigan on Tuesday.

""There have been times - and this is one of them - where anti-trade sentiment has attained some salience in our domestic politics as well as in other countries,"" Rice said.

""There's been an evolution over the decades in the nature of trade agreements and in the caliber of trade agreements. And I'm not sure that that has fully been absorbed in the public mindset or the political discourse,"" she said.

Obama has repeatedly said that the TPP will expand markets for U.S. exporters and has high standards on labor and the environment that were not part of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.

Rice said policy makers face the challenge of being able to articulate the benefits of TPP and ""to not allow the sort of traditional 'old saws' of the critical narrative about trade to go unchallenged, when to a considerable extent they're based on agreements of the past.""

Rice made her comments ahead of a summit between Obama and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, a nation also wrestling with the merits of the TPP. The economy of Canada, the largest market for U.S. exports, is heavily reliant on open trade with the United States.

However, he said there was still discussion of whether U.S. taxpayer funds could be used to finance the purchase.

President Barack Obama's administration announced on Feb. 12 that it had approved the sale of the Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) aircraft as well as radars and other equipment to Pakistan.

It drew immediate criticism from India and concern from some members of Congress.

Republican Senator Rand Paul in late February invoked legislation known as the Arms Export Control Act in the hope of stopping the sale by passing a Resolution of Disapproval, calling Pakistan ""an uncertain ally.""

Cardin told reporters he opposed Paul's resolution and expected it would fail, with the chamber's Republican and Democratic leaders opposing it. The measure could be taken up by the Senate as soon as Thursday.

Cardin said lawmakers had concerns about Pakistan's nuclear program, commitment to fighting terrorist organizations and cooperation in the Afghanistan peace process but generally supported the sale.

""It was not controversial that Pakistan needs to modernize its air force and its counter insurgency and counter-terrorism activities, particularly in the mountainous territory of the border with Afghanistan,"" he said.

Congress is currently considering a request to ""reprogram"" some funds, in other words, use them for a different purpose than allocated in a budget bill, to help finance the deal.

Cardin said he was not yet prepared to make a judgment on whether U.S. taxpayer funds should be used to help Pakistan with the purchase.

First, they missed Senator Ted Cruzs surging popularity in the Louisiana primary. Then they were totally wrong in the Michigan Democratic race, consistently predicting a double-digit margin of victory for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, not U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who narrowly won Tuesday night.

This week, no doubt, anyone whos in the business of predicting races is busy double-checking their methods.

As the U.S. political polling editor for Reuters, I should say at this point that the Reuters/Ipsos poll doesnt predict state primaries, in part for the simple reason that theyre really hard to get right. Turnout is usually low at state nomination contests, and its tough to determine whos going to show up. In Michigans case, for example, its possible that polls of likely voters focused too heavily on politically active Democrats and not enough on new voters who were inspired by Sanders.

That said, were always looking for ways to improve. This year may turn out to be the year of the frustrated American  when people who were turned off by politics in the past finally showed up to vote. The challenge, then, is to make sure that were fairly accounting for all of these people into our poll.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll is different from many others in that we interview everyone before we decide whos a likely voter. We then consider their reported voting history, registration status, interest in election news and certainty about showing up on Election Day. That wont change, though its possible that well fine-tune this analysis before November after checking our results with primary returns in large states. Were also looking at several other ways to improve the way we predict turnout in the general election like cross-referencing voter files.

Come November, our poll will be put to the test. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was considered one of the most accurate in 2012, and we hope to keep that going this year.",[]

LONDON Athletics superpower Russia is running out of time to eradicate doping and may not be able to send a track and field team to this year's Rio Olympics, Dick Pound, chair of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) independent commission, said on Wednesday.

""There seems to be some evidence that they're just changing deck chairs on the Titanic,"" he told an anti-doping conference.

Russian athletes were banned from international competition after a report by Pound's commission revealing widespread doping and corruption with involvement from Russian and international athletics officials.

Sweeping reforms of Russian athletics authorities were ordered to enable the ban to be lifted.

""My guess is Russia may not make it back for Rio. The IAAF and WADA are not going to risk their reputations by rolling over and playing dead,"" Pound said, referring to the sport's world governing International Association of Athletics Federations.

Last week a German TV documentary contained fresh allegations of malpractice in Russia's anti-doping system.

Amongst the claims in Sunday's ARD program were that Russian coaches suspended in the worst corruption and doping scandal to hit the sport were still working in athletics, while others continued to provide banned substances to athletes.

""We said to them at the time if you stop complaining about the (WADA) report you have a chance. Whether their progress is sufficient enough? I don't think they are devoting all their time and energy into getting where they ought to be.

""We knew it would be a stretch for them but if they devoted themselves, heart and soul, to getting it done, it would be possible. Yet here we are four months later and I think somehow they must have convinced themselves that it would go away.

""Clearly it's not going to go away. Neither WADA nor the IAAF are going to buy a band-aid solution,"" he told Reuters.

The ARD reports in recent months on doping in Russian sport were based on information provided by whistleblowers Vitaly Stepanov, who formerly worked for Russia's anti-doping agency, and his wife Yuliya, an 800 metres runner banned for doping.

FINANCIAL SUPPORT

WADA chairman Craig Reedie, who also addressed delegates, said he had appealed to the IAAF and the International Olympic Committee to allow Yuliya to compete as an independent athlete in Rio.

Reedie said that contrary to media reports, WADA had also offered financial support and relocation to the Stepanovs who currently live in an undisclosed location outside Russia.

""For the record, I, WADA and the anti-doping community are very grateful,"" Reedie said.

Branded as traitors at home, Vitaly, Yuliya and their young son have been in hiding since the documentary aired in December 2014. They have changed residences nine times and are living under assumed names.

""Without them it would have been a case of 'Niet, not possible, it's lies'. They gave us hard evidence,"" Pound said.

Russia, a superpower of the sport alongside the United States, will be allowed to return to competition, including August's Rio Olympics, when it proves to WADA and the IAAF that it has met a series of conditions regarding its anti-doping operation.

Although Reedie said Russia was co-operating, the key was an agreement for the country to fund two independent experts to rebuild its tainted anti-doping unit (RUSADA).

The doping and corruption scandal is amongst the worst in athletics history and has put into question lucrative global sponsorship deals as well as results and medal awards in past international competitions.

Reedie said more investment was needed in clean sport, saying WADA was 'punching above its weight' on a budget of $30 million, about the same amount as a top tennis player can earn in endorsements each year.

""When you look at the damage being done to athletics, the damage to sport, I just wonder why very well resourced commercial companies might not think an investment in clean sport might pay dividends,"" Reedie said.

""Nike know where I am, as do Adidas.""

DETROIT The Virginia Automobile Dealers Association (VADA) on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and Virginia state officials to keep the electric car maker from opening a second dealership in the state.

The VADA claims in the suit filed in circuit court in Fairfax County, Virginia, that Tesla and the state's Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner, Richard D. Holcomb, are violating a 2013 agreement that Tesla could not consider owning and operating a second dealership in Virginia until at least August 2017.

Tesla has a dealership in Tysons Corner in the relatively affluent area of northern Virginia near Washington, D.C., which opened in February 2015.

Don Hall, president of the VADA, said in an interview with Reuters that Tesla and the Virginia DMV tried to keep the VADA in the dark about Tesla's efforts to open a second dealership.

The suit claims that Holcomb named a hearing officer for a DMV hearing of the Tesla request and that a hearing is set for March 31.

""They tried to get this done very quickly, in the dark of the night, in hopes that no one could know about it,"" Hall said.

A member of his organization learned of a real estate deal for property in Richmond for a Tesla store, alerting him to the request and, eventually, the lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Hall said.

Calls to Tesla and to the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles were not immediately returned on Wednesday afternoon.

Tesla has been fighting for the right to own and operate its own dealerships, and has sought to open its own stores in several states despite franchise laws that do not allow, in most cases, a manufacturer to own and operate an auto dealership.

WASHINGTON The White House has ruled out an encounter between President Barack Obama and revolutionary leader Fidel Castro in Cuba this month and is confident the Cuban government will not create obstacles to a meeting between Obama and dissidents in Havana, a top adviser said on Wednesday.

Despite the goal of improving ties between former Cold War foes, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Obama would not use his trip to meet Cuba's demands that he shutter Radio and TV Marti, U.S. broadcasters created to transmit anti-communist programing to the island nation.

Obama plans to hold talks with Cuban President Raul Castro during his historic March 20-22 visit but will not meet with Castro's brother, a legendary figure who took power in a 1959 revolution and led Cuba for 49 years.

""We've had no discussion about that meeting taking place, and we certainly wouldn't seek it,"" Rhodes, who was one of the negotiators in secret talks that led to a thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations, told Reuters in an interview.

Asked if a meeting was ruled out, Rhodes said: ""Yes.""

A meeting with the elder Castro could overshadow a trip that is meant to focus on the future of the U.S.-Cuba relationship rather than its troubled past. Castro, 89, stepped down from power after a series of health problems and rarely leaves his Havana home, though he occasionally meets visiting dignitaries.

The White House has said previously it did not expect a Fidel Castro meeting to occur but did not say it was ruled out.

The administration made clear when it set up Obama's trip that he would meet with anti-government dissidents in Havana despite the Cuban leadership's objections to what it sees as meddling in the country's internal affairs.

Rhodes said the list of participants had not been finalized and the meeting would take place in a U.S. facility, which suggests the U.S. embassy or ambassador's residence.

That meeting would take place after official events with Raul Castro.

Cuban dissidents in the past have reported being detained in their homes or picked up by police en route to major international events such as summits or papal visits, but Rhodes said he did not anticipate that happening for Obama's trip.

""We haven't worked out the logistics, but ... they have not suggested that they will throw up those types of obstacles,"" he said, adding the United States would be watching whether Cuba detained or harassed activists in connection with the visit.

Two of Cuba's most prominent dissidents, Berta Soler and Jose Daniel Ferrer, were detained on Tuesday, according to dissident groups.

Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, on Wednesday met with Cuban-American activists and U.S. human rights advocates and told them Obama would meet Cuban ""independent civil society"" representatives chosen by his aides, the White House said.

OUTSTANDING DIFFERENCES

Obama's Republican critics have accused him of playing down human rights concerns in order to pursue rapprochement with Cuba, which began in December 2014 and is now seen as a major piece of his foreign policy legacy.

The Cuban government has done little to reciprocate for a series of U.S. measures that eased restrictions on U.S.-Cuba travel and trade. It is unclear whether it will make any large gestures during Obama's visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president since 1928.

Rhodes countered that the outreach to Cuba was aimed at helping the local population while opening up commercial opportunities for Americans.

The administration plans to roll out further measures next week to chip away at decades-old restrictions to commerce.

Obama also wants to lift the embargo on Cuba, which is only possible through congressional action. Republican leaders in Congress oppose such a move.

Other differences remain. The Obama administration is not considering returning the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay to the Cuban government, and Rhodes said it would not make changes to the Radio and TV Marti broadcasters at this time.

Both issues are irritants that the Cubans consider obstacles to full normalization with Washington.

""The Cubans don't like Radio Marti and TV Marti for sure,"" Rhodes said. ""There's only so much you can get to.""

The U.S. government launched Radio Marti in 1983 and later added TV Marti to transmit anti-communist news and information into Cuba, where the government has a monopoly on the media.

A decision on whether to put an end to a U.S. program that encourages Cuban doctors and nurses on overseas assignments to defect was not tied to the trip either, Rhodes said.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 19:36:08+00:00,Amazon to start air delivery network with leasing deal,['Sai Sachin R Mari Saito'],"An ''Amazon Fresh'' delivery truck is seen parked in Brooklyn, New York, August 28, 2015.

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said on Wednesday it had signed a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA.N) 767 widebody freighter aircraft to handle more of its own deliveries in the United States.

The deal comes at a time when the world's biggest online retailer is offering ever-faster, and increasingly free, deliveries for millions of online orders.

Amazon, which relies on carriers like United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) to deliver most of its packages, spent $11.5 billion on shipping last year.

In a bid to assume more control over its supply chain and reduce costs, Amazon has rolled out thousands of trailers and launched a programme that uses contract drivers to deliver fast orders.

But analysts said the long-rumoured plan to build its own air fleet posed little threat to the leading delivery companies.

""This is an incremental negative for FDX and UPS as it will likely remove some higher yielding express freight and parcel volume from each of the respective networks,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst John Barnes wrote in a client note.

UPS, the world's No. 1 package delivery company, operates about 240 large planes while FedEx has a fleet of about 370, Barnes noted. FedEx and UPS shares were down about 1.5 percent.

FedEx said on Wednesday the announcement was not a surprise and called Amazon a valuable customer.

""We work closely with Amazon and have been aware for some time about their need for supplemental air capacity related to inventory management,"" said Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications at FedEx.

The leased planes will start to go into operation on April 1, Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email.

Amazon has been testing deliveries by drones but has not said when they would be in service.

The duration of the leases will be five to seven years, lessor Air Transport Services Group Inc (ATSG.O) said.

As part of the agreement, Amazon has the right to buy up to 19.9 percent of ATSG's stock over five years at $9.73 per share.

ATSG's stock soared almost 27 percent to a record high of $14.90, before paring gains to about 16 percent.

The Caisse also announced the appointment of Anita Marangoly George as managing director for South Asia. Based in New Delhi, George will head up the new CDPQ India unit to seek investment opportunities across all asset classes.

Canadian pension funds are expanding into new territories and investing directly in assets such as infrastructure and real estate as they seek alternatives to volatile global equity markets and low-yielding government bonds.

India is viewed as a prime investment opportunity, given its rapid economic growth and burgeoning middle class. The Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, Canada's biggest public pension fund, set up an office in Mumbai last year to scout for opportunities.

Caisse Chief Executive Officer Michael Sabia in a statement cited India's ""scope and quality of investment opportunities, the potential for strategic partnerships with leading Indian entrepreneurs, and the current government's intention to pursue essential economic reforms.""

A estimativa bilionaria foi feita pelo ministro de Minas e Energia, Eduardo Braga, em comunicado que anunciou a autorizacao para prorrogacao de concessoes de campos da Rodada Zero de 1998, a prorrogacao do Repetro e estudos para contratacao sob regime de partilha de areas unitizaveis.

""Estamos sentindo o governo tomando medidas e fazendo acoes no sentido de estimular e dar um sinal para a industria de que o Brasil esta buscando se tornar mais competitivo"", afirmou a Reuters o presidente do Instituto Brasileiro do Petroleo, Gas e Biocombustiveis (IBP), Jorge Camargo.

""A prorrogacao das concessoes esta nessa direcao, assim como Repetro, licitacao da unitizacao... a gente ve com entusiasmo e expectativa porque o Brasil comeca a tomar medidas para se tornar mais atraente"", comentou.

As iniciativas foram listadas em resolucao do Conselho Nacional de Politica Energetica (CNPE), que afirmou que ""o atual cenario mundial vem produzindo fortes impactos no mercado de petroleo e gas... com precos que dificultam a viabilizacao economica dos investimentos"".

Na resolucao, o CNPE autorizou a Agencia Nacional do Petroleo, Gas Natural e Biocombustiveis (ANP) a prorrogar os contratos de concessao da Rodada Zero, quando foram ratificados os direitos da Petrobras sobre os campos que se encontravam em producao antes da quebra do monopolio da estatal nas atividades de exploracao e producao de petroleo e gas natural no pais.

Entre os campos incluidos na Rodada Zero esta Marlim, da Petrobras, um dos maiores produtores do Brasil. A prorrogacao dos contratos permitira maior visibilidade e retorno sobre os investimentos das companhias.

A Rodada Zero tambem confirmou direitos sobre blocos em exploracao e desenvolvimento.

A prorrogacao sera feita apenas para campos cuja extensao do prazo de producao se mostre viavel para alem do periodo contratual original. Para a renovacao, o concessionario devera apresentar novo plano de desenvolvimento, com indicacao de investimentos a serem realizados.

""O prazo de prorrogacao devera ser compativel com as expectativas de producao decorrentes do novo plano de desenvolvimento e dos novos investimentos, limitado a 27 anos"", segundo o texto no Diario Oficial da Uniao.

O CNPE tambem determinou a ANP que em ate 30 dias notifique concessionarias de campos sem producao nos ultimos seis meses para que retomem a atividade nos proximos 12 meses ou transfiram os direitos sobre esses campos para outras empresas.

De acordo com a resolucao, a ANP devera iniciar processo de extincao das concessoes das empresas que nao cumprirem a determinacao.

""Existem campos com capacidade de produzir, mas encontram-se paralisados, comprometendo o aproveitamento racional de recursos energeticos, a geracao de empregos e a arrecadacao de royalties pela Uniao, Estados e municipios"", afirmou o CNPE.

Camargo, do IBP, apoiou a iniciativa do governo e disse que e uma medida comum no setor de petroleo.

""Isso e um movimento muito comum no mundo. As vezes sao campos nao muito atraentes, sao os menores ou em fase madura. A maioria em terra. E, com o preco baixo nao justificaria o investimento para retomar. Acho que o governo faz bem em colocar uma pressao sobre as empresas. Tem que ser feito dentro do arcabouco legal porque e uma concessao"", comentou.

O conselho tambem propos a prorrogacao da vigencia do regime aduaneiro especial de exportacao e importacao de bens destinados a atividades de pesquisa e producao de petroleo, o Repetro.

""Como o Repetro acabaria em 2019 e a industria trabalha com longo prazo, fazer um investimento aqui sem o Repetro inibiria investimentos. Foi uma boa ideia estender porque o governo esta consciente de que o setor de petroleo e gas sera muito importante para ajudar a tirar o Brasil da crise e da recessao"", disse Camargo.

Por fim, o CNPE determinou ao Ministerio de Minas e Energia que conclua estudos necessarios para propor ao conselho os parametros tecnicos e economicos a serem considerados na contratacao, sob o regime de partilha, de areas unitizaveis que extrapolem os blocos concedidos e estejam localizadas dentro do poligono do pre-sal.

Na terca-feira, o secretario de Petroleo e Gas do Ministerio de Minas e Energia, Marco Antonio Almeida, adiantou que o governo pretende realizar em 2017 uma licitacao de areas unitizaveis, ou seja, reservas interligaveis com areas ja licitadas, que sao passiveis de uma exploracao unificada.

""Ha areas no pre-sal que nao evoluem porque um pedaco grande da descoberta esta em area contigua"", explicou Almeida.

Bees impact 50-80 percent of the global food supply, so the issue extends beyond healthy sweeteners.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 14:42:04+00:00,Europe's deal with Turkey fails to deter migrant attempts for now,"['Dasha Afanasieva', 'Melih Aslan']","DIDIM, Turkey Turkey's coastguard intercepted dozens of mostly Syrian migrants in coves along the Aegean coast on Wednesday as they continued to attempt perilous sea crossings to Greece despite Ankara's efforts to stem the flow under a deal with the European Union.

A group of 42 people, more than a dozen of them children, sat inside a coastguard compound, some lying under blankets, in the seaside resort of Didim after being detained. Scores more waited among boulders by the beach, watched by armed police, as a bus came to take them away.

""We're afraid of staying here and afraid of staying in Syria ... We're fleeing to the country that will take us. We want safety, someone to care for us,"" said Sameeha Abdullah, one of the group near the beach, who fled Syria's civil war.

Just offshore, a coastguard boat approached what appeared to be a small vessel carrying more migrants. Some officials fear a scramble to cross to the nearby Greek islands, despite increased NATO-backed sea patrols in the Aegean, before the tentative agreement with the EU comes into full force.

Under the draft deal struck on Monday, Turkey agreed to take back all irregular migrants in exchange for more funding, an earlier introduction of visa-free travel to Europe for Turks, and a speeding up of Ankara's long-stalled EU membership talks.

The aim, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and EU leaders have said, is to discourage illegal migrants and break the business model of human smugglers who have fuelled Europe's largest migration crisis since World War Two. The message, they say, is simple: try to cross illegally and get sent straight back.

But in a shabby sea-front hotel in Didim, off whose coast 25 migrants drowned on Sunday when their boat capsized, few had heard of the deal. A group of migrants from the Iraqi city of Mosul, stuck because they could not afford to pay the smugglers, said they were still determined to leave.

""Even if they catch me, what am I going to do here? I may as well die trying,"" said Hussein, 45, who said his three sons were killed by Islamic State militants in Iraq.

The hotelier, who gave his name as Enes, said a group of 20 Syrians, whom he collectively charged 500 lira ($170) for the night, had left yesterday for Europe. But he was sure more would come.

""Even if Europe gave Turkey hundreds of billions for refugees, Syrians still wouldn't stay. Most of their family is there so they're joining them,"" he said.

LEGALITY QUESTIONED

Turkey has no intention of sending refugees back to conflict zones and sees no legal hurdles to implementing the deal, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Wednesday, after meetings with Belgian officials in Ankara.

EU and Turkish officials are scrambling to finalise the deal before their next summit on March 17-18, and Cavusoglu said the bloc had largely accepted Turkey's terms.

But the United Nations and human rights groups have warned that blanket returns without considering individual asylum cases could be illegal. And it remains far from clear that the message will get through to desperate families who see smuggling as their surest route into Europe as its borders close.

Even as groups of migrants were detained on the beaches, more arrived by taxi in Didim, a popular holiday resort with yachts bobbing in its marina. Some carried bags, children in tow, and headed for the town's small hotels, which like in other parts of the Aegean coast, have been profiting from migrant business in the tourism low season.

""The markets, the hotels, the restaurants - everyone was smiling. Because of the refugees we eat bread,"" said the manager of one hostel. The hostel is in Basmane, a run-down neighbourhood of Izmir, the main city on the Turkish Aegean coast and long a stopover for migrants trying to reach Europe during the Iraq wars and Arab Spring uprisings.

NEW GROUPS ARRIVING

More than a million people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and beyond have flooded into the EU since early 2015, most crossing the Aegean from Turkey to Greece in small boats, then heading north through the Balkans to Germany.

Border shutdowns further north have blocked the 'Balkans corridor', leaving tens of thousands of migrants trapped in Greece. Macedonia has closed its border to illegal migrants after Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia announced tight new restrictions on migrant entry.

Rights group Amnesty International called the proposed mass return of migrants under the EU deal with Turkey a ""death blow to the right to seek asylum"". Relief charity Doctors without Borders said it was cynical and inhumane.

But Davutoglu insisted the preliminary deal would not stop Syrian refugees legitimately seeking shelter in Europe. He and Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras signed an amendment to the countries' readmission agreement late on Tuesday to make returning third country nationals easier.

""The aim here is to discourage irregular migration and ... to recognise those Syrians in our camps who the EU will accept - though we will not force anyone to go against their will - on legal routes,"" he said after a meeting with Tsipras in Izmir.

Under the tentative deal with Ankara, the EU would admit one refugee directly from Turkey for each Syrian it took back from the Greek Aegean islands. Those who attempted the sea route illegally would be returned and go to the back of the queue.

With new groups of migrants from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere continuing to arrive along Turkey's coast in the hope of crossing to Greece, that message appears for now not to be getting through, to the frustration of some local residents.

""Whatever's necessary should be done. The refugees should be gathered in one spot in my opinion. Everything should be done to ensure everyone's comfort, peace and welfare,"" said Armagan Gulcicek, an Izmir resident in a street full of cafes and stores popular with migrants, some of them selling life jackets.

""Lets put an end to this nonsense.""

reuters.com,2016-03-09 18:05:57+00:00,'Fifth Beatle' George Martin dies aged 90,['Reuters Editorial'],"LOS ANGELES/LONDON George Martin, known as ""the fifth Beatle"" for his work in shaping the band that became one of the world's most influential music forces, has died at the age of 90.

He was considered the most successful music producer ever, cited in the Guinness Book of Records for having more than 50 No. 1 hit records over five decades in the United States and Britain alone.

He helped score, arrange, and produce many of the band's biggest hits, including ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand,"" ""A Day in the Life"", Yesterday, ""Eleanor Rigby"" and ""Love Me Do"".

""Im so sad to hear the news of the passing of dear George Martin,"" Beatle Paul McCartney said in a statement on Wednesday.

""If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle it was George.""

A statement from Martin's family confirmed he had died peacefully at his home on Tuesday evening.

Earlier, Ringo Starr, the Beatles' drummer, had announced his death on Twitter: ""God bless George Martin peace and love to Judy and his family... George will be missed.""

Starr followed the message by posting a black and white photo of the Fab Four with Martin, saying ""Thank you for all your love and kindness George.""

Martin served as producer, collaborator and mentor to Beatles John Lennon, George Harrison, McCartney and Starr.

Lennon was shot dead in New York in 1980. Harrison died of cancer in 2001.

Tributes from the music world poured in on Twitter. ""RIP to my musical brother George Martin. We were friends since 1964, & I am so thankful 4 that gift,"" said American music producer Quincy Jones.

Lenny Kravitz said: ""The legends are really going home!"" Boy George said: ""George Martin. Gentleman and legend"", while Mark Ronson said Martin was ""the greatest British record producer of all time.""

Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron said on Twitter: ""George Martin was a giant of music - working with the Fab Four to create the world's most enduring pop music.""

""YESTERDAY""

During his seven-decade career in the music industry, Martin produced almost all of the Beatles' recordings and also worked with Gerry & the Pacemakers, Shirley Bassey, Cilla Black, Jeff Beck, America, Cheap Trick and other acts.

Martin started work at Abbey Road Studios in 1950 producing records for EMI's Parlophone label.

He was noted for his comedy recordings with the likes of Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Beyond the Fringe and got his first Number 1 with The Temperance Seven in 1961. He signed The Beatles in 1962

The young band members were rough around the edges, but Martin saw their commercial promise and with them helped revolutionise the art of popular music recording.

His 1979 autobiography, ""All You Need Is Ears"", chronicles his discovery of the Beatles and their creative process.

Martin was knighted in 1996. In 2006, working with his son, Giles Martin, he helped develop the Beatles-inspired Cirque du Soleil show ""Love"" in Las Vegas, which went on to reap his two most recent Grammys.

NEW YORK Oil prices rose as much as 5 percent on Wednesday, with U.S. crude hitting three-month highs after a big gasoline inventory drawdown amid improving demand overshadowed growing record high crude stockpiles.

Speculation that top producers might agree soon to an output freeze also supported crude oil.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled up $1.42, or about 4 percent, at $41.07 a barrel.

U.S. crude futures CLc1 finished up $1.79, or 5 percent, at $38.29 a barrel after hitting a three-month high of $38.51.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude stockpiles USOILC=ECI rose 3.9 million barrels last week to reach nearly 522 million barrels, in its fourth week of building to record highs.[EIA/S]

But gasoline inventories USOILG=ECI fell 4.5 million barrels, nearly triple forecasts, in the largest weekly draw in almost two years.

U.S. gasoline demand over past four weeks was 7 percent higher than a year ago, the EIA said.

""Gasoline is the star of the show today,"" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at New York-headquartered energy data provider ClipperData. ""Ongoing strength in demand has yielded a large draw to gasoline inventories despite a rebound in refinery runs.""

U.S. gasoline futures RBc1 hit six-month highs, rallying 6 percent. The crack spread for gasoline 1RBc1-CLc1, a measure of profit margin refiners get for turning a barrel of crude into the motor fuel, scaled seven-month highs.

Oil has gained about 50 percent from 12-year lows hit less than two months ago, since OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Venezuela, along with non-OPEC exporter Russia, pledged to leave supply at January's levels if others cooperated.

Some analysts said the rally was excessive.

""We feel that values could consolidate well into next week or longer, prior to enough momentum shift to force an ultimate $9-10 crude price cut,"" said Jim Ritterbusch at Chicago-based oil advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates.

Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said it expected this year's average price of crude to be lower than last year's, reflecting the glut.

Oil rallied earlier in the day after an Iraqi oil official told a state newspaper that producers in and outside of OPEC plan to meet in Moscow on March 20 to discuss the output freeze. Russia's energy ministry, however, said no date or place had been set.

Credit ratings agency Moody's warned of more output declines if oil producers defaulted on debt because of low prices. Reuters exclusively reported that Saudi Arabia was seeking its first significant foreign borrowing in over a decade to help cover a record budget deficit from weak crude prices.

UNITED NATIONS The United States and Iraq on Wednesday hosted a meeting of senior diplomats and U.N. officials to discuss the possible collapse of the Mosul hydro-electric dam, which U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power said would create a catastrophe of ""epic proportions.""

Mosul dam has sustained structural flaws since its construction in the 1980s. If it collapsed, a wall of water would flood the heavily populated Tigris River valley.

Wednesday's meeting at the United Nations included Power and her Iraqi counterpart, Mohamed Ali Alhakim, experts from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, officials from the U.N. Development Program and Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and other senior diplomats.

""The briefings on the Mosul dam today were chilling,"" Power said in a statement issued by the U.S. mission to the United Nations. ""While important steps have been taken to address a potential breach, the dam could still fail.""

""In the event of a breach, there is the potential in some places for a flood wave up to 14 meters (15 yards) high that could sweep up everything in its path, including people, cars, unexploded ordnance, waste and other hazardous material, further endangering massive population centers,"" she said.

Power said all U.N. member states should be prepared to help prevent what would be ""a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions.""

Approximately 500,000 to 1.47 million Iraqis live in the flood path, the U.S. statement said.

Iraq has signed a contract with Italy's Trevi Group worth 273 million euros (US$296 million) to reinforce and maintain the Mosul dam for 18 months.

Italy has said it planned to send 450 troops to protect the site of the dam, which is 3.6 km (2.2 miles) long and close to territory held by Islamic State militants.

Islamic State militants seized the dam in August 2014, raising fears they might blow it up. It was taken two weeks later by Iraqi government forces backed by U.S.-led coalition air strikes.

The Iraqi government has said it is taking precautions against the dam's collapse, while seeking to play down the risk.

Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, World Health Organization (WHO) Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation attends a news conference on the Zika virus at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, March 9, 2016.

GENEVA Widespread spraying to eliminate mosquitoes has failed to significantly stop the spread of dengue fever and it may be the same case for the Zika virus linked to neurological disorders, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday.

The emphasis should be put on enlisting families and communities to protect themselves and eliminate from their homes the mosquitoes that carry the disease, which has spread rapidly in Brazil and Latin America, it said.

Releasing genetically modified mosquitoes or irradiating insects also needed to be studied, but evaluation of such novel methods should be done with ""extreme rigor"", the WHO warned.

A three-day meeting of experts set two other top priorities for research: speeding development of tools to diagnose Zika infections and of vaccines to prevent the disease. But they said vaccine trials may come too late for the current outbreak.

WHO Assistant Director General Marie-Paule Kieny said experts had told the meeting that there was no evidence that traditional mosquito control methods had had any significant impact on transmission of dengue, a virus close to Zika.

""This is important because we must be sure that we invest in interventions that work,"" Kieny told a news briefing.

""Certainly it is worth continuing to try to use this method for the lack of other interventions.""

She said the Aedes aegyptii species of mosquito that carries Zika is the ""cockroach of mosquitoes"" because it stays mainly indoors and is hard to eradicate. Efforts to control it needed to be much more targeted to communities and households.

""Then we will see whether it works or not,"" she said.

On Tuesday, the WHO advised pregnant women not to travel to areas with outbreaks of Zika virus due to the potential risk of birth defects, a condition known as microcephaly.

Zika has been linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, another neurological disorder, but neither link has been yet proven.

The most advanced candidate vaccines for Zika are still a few months away from entering early human clinical trials, Kieny said.

""It is therefore possible that vaccines may come late for the current Latin American outbreak, but the development of a vaccine remains an imperative, in particular vaccines suitable for pregnant women and women of child-bearing age,"" she said.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:11:20+00:00,Clinton's surprise Michigan loss exposes risks for her on trade,['Andy Sullivan'],"Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks to supporters about the primary voting results in Michigan and other states at her campaign rally in Cleveland, Ohio, March 8, 2016.

WASHINGTON Democrat Hillary Clinton's unexpected defeat in Michigan has laid bare growing voter anger over international trade, raising warning flags for her ahead of a possible presidential election showdown against Republican front-runner Donald Trump.

Trump has built his campaign on pledges to scrap international trade deals and do more to protect American workers from foreign competition, tapping the same groundswell of discontent that propelled Clinton's rival Bernie Sanders to victory in the Midwestern state on Tuesday.

Clinton remains heavily favored to win the Democratic nomination. But the setback in Michigan could signal further troubles in upcoming primaries in other Rust Belt states such as Ohio, forcing her further to the left on economic issues and possibly influencing her choice for an eventual running mate, strategists said.

The backlash against 20 years of trade liberalization has stalled the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), a sweeping Pacific trade deal backed by President Barack Obama and threatens to stymie the trade agenda for years to come.

""It's politically radioactive to support free trade right now,"" said Greg Valliere, a Washington analyst for Horizon Investments, a financial firm.

Clinton's troubles with her party's left wing -- and with white, working class voters more generally -- may steer her toward a trade skeptic such as Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio as a vice presidential running mate, said Democratic strategist Steve Jarding. Political pundits had expected Clinton to pick someone to increase her appeal to Hispanic or other minority voters, such as U.S. Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro.

Sanders, 74, is unlikely to end up as Clintons running mate, partly due to his age, Democrats said.

Both Sanders, a democratic socialist, and billionaire Trump have harnessed anti-trade sentiment in their insurgent White House bids, criticizing deals like NAFTA as job killers that have depressed the living standards of working Americans.

Exit polls from Michigan, a hub of the U.S. auto industry, show widespread voter skepticism on trade that may have helped Sanders and Trump win their respective party primaries.

""She made a fundamental mistake early on in this campaign to try to stay in the center,"" Democratic strategist Steve Jarding said of Clinton. ""This cycle, there is no center.""

NUANCED TRADE STANCE

Sanders campaigned heavily against foreign trade in a state that has been hammered by overseas competition since the 1980s. Some 58 percent of his supporters in Michigan exit polls said that trade takes away U.S. jobs, while a slight majority - 53 percent - of Clinton backers said trade creates U.S. jobs.

The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, estimates that Michigan would lose 5 percent of its jobs if TPP were to take effect, the highest proportion of any state.

Gary Hunley, a substitute teacher in Dearborn, Michigan, said he believed Clinton was partially to blame for stagnant wages because NAFTA was enacted under her husband Bill Clinton's presidency in the 1990s.

""She was not a passive first lady,"" Hunley said.

Clinton's stance on trade is more nuanced than Trump's and Sanders'. After NAFTA was enacted, she voted against a free-trade deal with Central America while serving as a U.S. senator in the following decade.

As Obama's secretary of state, Clinton helped negotiate the TPP with Japan, Vietnam and other Pacific Rim countries.

As a presidential candidate, Clinton has said after reading the final language of the deal she would vote against it because it does not adequately protect U.S. workers.

Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters Wednesday there were no plans to adjust her stance and that he would ""put Secretary Clinton up against any candidate in this race on trade,"" including Trump.

Despite backing by the Obama administration, Republican lawmakers and many business groups, Republican leaders in Congress have shown no sign that they will bring TPP up for a vote this year.

The Obama administration says the deal has high labor and environmental standards that were not part of NAFTA. ""Im not sure that has fully been absorbed in the public mindset,"" U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice told Reuters. [L1N16H1VJ]

The deal may fare no better under the next president. Sanders and Trump oppose TPP, and Senator Ted Cruz, who is in second place in the Republican contest, has said he would not vote for it this year.

""They've listened to the public and politicians have caught up with the public on this,"" Brown, the Ohio Democratic senator, told Reuters.

The evidence that the TPP would help the U.S. economy much is less than conclusive.

The Peter G. Peterson Institute, a pro-trade think tank, estimates that it would boost economic growth by just 0.5 percent after 15 years.

The deal would not boost employment overall, but would result in a ""churn"" of 53,700 jobs lost and created each year, and it would boost incomes by 0.5 percent, the institute found.

Another estimate by the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University found the trade deal would slow growth by 0.54 percent after 10 years and cost 448,000 jobs in the United States.

FRANKFURT A German court has ruled against an online shopping site's use of Facebook's ""like"" button on Wednesday, dealing a further legal blow to the world's biggest social network in Germany.

The Duesseldorf district court said that retailer Peek & Cloppenburg failed to obtain proper consent before transmitting its users' computer identities to Facebook, violating Germany's data protection law and giving the retailer a commercial advantage.

The court found in favor of the North Rhine-Westphalia Consumer Association, which had complained that Peek & Cloppenburg's Fashion ID website had grabbed user data and sent it to Facebook before shoppers had decided whether to click on the ""like"" button or not.

""A mere link to a data protection statement at the foot of the website does not constitute an indication that data are being or are about to be processed,"" the court said.

Peek & Cloppenburg faces a penalty of up to 250,000 euros ($275,400) or six months' detention for a manager.

The case comes on the heels of a January ruling by Germany's highest court against Facebook's ""friend finder"" feature and an announcement last week by Germany's competition regulator that it was investigating Facebook for suspected abuse of market power with regard to data protection laws.

Facebook's ability to target advertising, helped by features such as its ""like"" button, drove a 52 percent revenue jump in the final quarter of 2015.

Germany, Europe's biggest economy, is one of the world's strictest enforcers of data protection laws and its citizens have a high sensibility to privacy issues.

""The ruling has fundamental significance for the assessment of the legality of the 'like' function with respect to data protection,"" said lawyer Sebastian Meyer, who represented the consumer group in the case.

""Companies should put pressure on the social network to adapt the 'like' function to the prevailing law.""

The association has also warned hotel portal HRS, Nivea maker Beiersdorf, shopping loyalty program Payback, ticketing company Eventim and fashion retailer KiK about similar use of the ""like"" button.

It said that four of those had since changed their practices. A first hearing in a case it has brought against Payback is due in a Munich court in May.

Peek & Cloppenburg said that it had changed its deployment of the ""like"" button last year and now required users to activate social media before sharing data with Facebook. It said it would wait for the court's written reasons for its judgment before deciding whether to appeal.

A Facebook spokesman said: ""This case is specific to a particular website and the way they have sought consent from their users in the past.

""The Like button, like many other features that are used to enhance websites, is an accepted, legal and important part of the Internet, and this ruling does not change that.""

Can this rally last without that big 20% correction at some of MarketWatch user calling. The market coming back is directly related oil. This is all about how bad the decline in oil. Hurts the economy. And causing corporate bankruptcies and other potential risk so now that we've seen what we've closer back to forty it takes a lot of pressure off of not only that oil companies in the area but the banks in the people who lent money to these companies there's a lot less risk that we see in the market bounced back to I think a more reasonable level right now. Because it seems like a horrible scenarios were off the table right now but we still not out of the it all Ross you feel that's a good time to slowly and I think slowly. And capital what signs are you looking for indicate that it's time to release happened think big my positions. But you it's a little assessor. It's just about oil. This is the big strain on the global economy. From the oil producing nations and on parts of our economy. And so if we can get loyal to a price and I think it's about 45 bucks that it it's that perfect equilibrium where people can still make money not go out of business but prices don't affect the economy in negative way I think that's going to be that sign that things are going to be okay and and and once we get through the election. We'll have a lot more certainty. I think that the real thing that we watch every game right now the price of oil. Roth I you're buying text boxes that FaceBook in that lets look at all of the FaceBook and has trailing price of 82 times earnings. And the stock is just 10% shy of the all time peak are buying these levels. Yes you know unfortunately. Meaning good stocks to have really high valuations and that causes of risk. You don't have to taken lower valuations stocks so as much as we like FaceBook of course there's risk. Involve it buying these high multiples but this is the best in breed company. Doing phenomenally well and we expect in the half of very good year this year so it works you know obviously conservatively adding to positions in that area and the same holds true with Netflix. Wonderful company executing on all fronts but you're paying a full valuation report but with these investments worth thinking long term and we also understand the risks. Because of the higher and what do you see driving FaceBook for. Well especially Aspen in the political campaign will be incredibly beneficial for FaceBook over the next six months. We there's. No question that we're gonna see a billion dollars spent on ads and it's Smart candidates spend that money on social FaceBook and Google being the main winners here but also in mr. Graham is monetizing very well and populist is beginning to sell their. And I think Ross two going back Netflix aren't the barriers to entry low in the streaming. Not when it comes to original contact and what Netflix has done is they've. Basically doubled down on regional content this year they've got so many good shows already coming out now and coming up throughout the year and moving forward as well and so Netflix realized that they were gonna become a commodity I just buying you know shows from other producers and now it's become the biggest producer Hollywood so. Netflix is in. Good shape moving forward because the hunt at making it's such high quality really.

SAO PAULO Former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva could join Brazil's government if he wishes, the minister in charge of legislative affairs, Ricardo Berzoini, said on Wednesday, a move that would give him some protection from prosecution.

Lula was briefly detained for questioning by police on Friday, after investigators said they had evidence he was among the main political beneficiaries of a kickback scheme at state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro, commonly known as Petrobras.

Brazilian media reported on Wednesday that members of the ruling Workers Party (PT) were pressuring Rousseff to offer Lula a ministerial portfolio in President Dilma Rousseff's cabinet that would shield him from possible detention.

If Lula were appointed to a ministry, he could only be tried in the Supreme Court, placing him out of the reach of the judge in Curitiba pursuing the investigation into kickbacks at Petrobras.

""The ball is in his court,"" Berzoini told Reuters. ""The government is good with it. Which government would not want to have Pele on the field,"" he said, comparing Lula to the legendary Brazilian football player.

According to two sources close to the former president, he is reluctant to join the government but pressure from the Workers Party is having some effect.

""The best chance that he has is to accept a ministry and for the trial to go to the Supreme Court so he receives a fair hearing,"" said one source close to the former president.

Crude oil and U.S. equity prices have been linked for much of 2016 to a degree that has surprised many investors. Wednesday's market action extended that trend, with WTI crude CLc1 rising nearly 5 percent and the S&P 500 energy sector .SPNY up 1.5 percent. Chevron (CVX.N) jumped 4.6 percent to $92.82 and gave the biggest boost to the energy sector.

""It's not about oil being a barometer of the global economy,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. ""A lot of it has to do with psychology.""

U.S. crude and the S&P 500 have been directionally correlated on all but six trading days this year, according to Wunderlich data.

""Stability in that asset class (oil) for a period of time will allow for the correlation to break down,"" said Hogan.

Since Feb. 11, the S&P 500 has gained 8.8 percent, but it is still down 2.7 percent for the year.

The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 36.26 points, or 0.21 percent, to 17,000.36, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 10 points, or 0.51 percent, to 1,989.26 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 25.55 points, or 0.55 percent, to 4,674.38.

In a week with a thin economic data calendar, markets will turn to the European Central Bank, which is expected to further ease monetary policy on Thursday.

Biotechnology stocks came under pressure a day after the U.S. government proposed a test program that would lower incentives to use higher-priced drugs when alternative treatments are available.

The Nasdaq Biotechnology sector .NBI fell 1.2 percent with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN.O) down 5.1 percent to $374.75 as the largest decliner on the Nasdaq 100.

Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) lost 3.4 percent to $506.63. Already reeling from several food-borne illnesses, the company temporarily shut a Massachusetts restaurant after four employees fell sick.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE on a 2.3-to-1 ratio while on the Nasdaq a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 48 new highs and 41 new lows.

About 7.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the average 8.67 billion in the previous 20 sessions.

Rowling are in for a treat this week when her digital publisher website Pottermore releases a series of four pieces of writing about wizardry entitled ""History of Magic in North America"".

The writings, posted at 1400 GMT each day from Tuesday to Friday, are meant to set the scene for the highly anticipated ""Harry Potter"" spin-off movie called ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", which is due for release in November.

Tuesday's offering, entitled ""Fourteenth Century - Seventeenth Century"", takes readers ""back through the centuries to reveal the beginnings of the North American magical community and how witches and wizards used magic before they adopted wands,"" Pottermore said.

Wednesday's piece will look at ""the dangers faced by witches and wizards in the New World"" and Thursday's will reveal ""why the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) took steps to move the magical community deeper underground"".

Friday will take readers to the ""Roaring Twenties"", when the new movie ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" starring Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne is due to begin.

""These stories will give you some idea of how the wizarding world on this continent evolved over the years, and of the names and events that lay the foundation for the arrival of 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them',"" Pottermore told Rowling fans.

In the movie Redmayne plays ""magizoologist"" Newt Scamander, ""who stops in New York following his travels to find and document magical creatures"", according to Warner Bros.

A ""magizoologist"", in Rowling's make-believe universe, is somebody who studies magical creatures.

The story is set in 1926 - decades before Rowling's fictional boy wizard Harry Potter begins his adventures at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

The film, based on Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" accompanying volume ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", marks the best-selling author's screen writing debut.

""Estamos caminhando juntos e no caminho certo para descobrir e definir de forma cada vez mais especifica todas as orientacoes em torno da microcefalia e do virus Zika, afirmou o ministro da Saude, Marcelo Castro, em entrevista coletiva em Brasilia.

Apesar de a relacao entre a microcefalia e o virus nao ter sido ainda comprovada cientificamente, tracos do virus tem sido encontrados em testes dos fluidos corporais e tecidos de maes e bebes atingidos pelo problema.

As mudancas, a segunda revisao feita pelo Brasil nos seus parametros desde o inicio do surto no ano passado, sao um esforco para adaptar o padrao do pais as informacoes recentemente anunciadas pela OMS.

A OMS esta trabalhando com o Brasil e outros paises afetados para entender melhor a microcefalia e determinar as relacoes que ela tem com o virus.

Casos suspeitos de microcefalia registrados antes das mudancas e com medidas superiores aos novos limites continuarao a ser investigados ate terem uma confirmacao positiva ou negativa, disse o ministerio.

The U.S. government will evaluate new proposals individually, but is looking at new, cleaner technologies, Kerry said to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Trudeau will attend a state dinner on Thursday, becoming the first Canadian leader to do so since 1997, as the two countries aim to fix a frayed relationship.

U.S. President Barack Obama last year blocked the cross-border Keystone XL crude oil pipeline proposed by TransCanada Corp in a victory for environmentalists.

The first batch of IDs was issued to eight types of vehicles including heavy duty trucks, vehicles for carrying hazardous materials and school buses, China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp (CASC) said in a statement which was also posted on Wednesday on the website of the central government agency that oversees state-owned companies.

If successful, the project will be expanded to all private cars in the city, the statement said. The government has in the past trialled projects in Shenzhen before rolling them out across the country.

The project could pave the way for autonomous driving, which requires vehicles to communicate with each other and traffic infrastructure in real-time, but also raises concerns over invasive government measures amid efforts to register every Internet user's real name.

The electronic markers will use radio-frequency identification that can be used in conjunction with traffic monitoring equipment, the CASC statement said, adding that it would help cut down on fake license plates and other illegal activity, while also allowing accurate data gathering for ""smart traffic applications"".

Issuing set identities for every car could also help implement targeted transport policies, such as those proposed by Wang Fengying, the general manager of Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor and a representative in parliament this week.

On Monday, Wang filed a proposal that would make petrol more expensive for gas guzzlers by requiring a card to be issued and linked to every car based on the fuel economy of the model, with more efficient vehicles paying less.

Wang similarly proposed a law suggesting a system of taxes and fees for cars based on how much they drive among other data.

Transparency International, a corruption watchdog, has accused Abacha of stealing up to $5 billion of public money during the five years he ran the oil-rich country, from 1993 until his death in 1998.

Laolu Akande, a spokesman for Nigerian Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, said Nigeria's attorney general signed a letter of intent, under the terms of which Switzerland will award Nigeria $321 million ""acquired by the Abacha family,"" Akandesaid in an emailed statement.

Swiss authorities said the letter of intent was also signed by its head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, Didier Burkhalter, and ""marks an important step toward the return of assets monitored by the World Bank"".

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, who took office last year, has made combating corruption a priority. He has asked Britain and the United States for help recovering money stolen by some of the country's elite over several years.

An economic crisis in Africa's biggest economy and oil producer, brought on by a plunge in crude prices, has made the need to recoup money lost to corruption more acute.

In 2014, Nigeria and the Abacha family reached an agreement for the West African country to get back the funds, which had been frozen, in return for dropping a complaint against the former military ruler's son, Abba Abacha.

He was charged by a Swiss court with money-laundering, fraud and forgery in April 2005, after being extradited from Germany, and later spent 561 days in custody. In 2006, Luxembourg ordered that funds held by the younger Abacha be frozen.

The news, confirming a Reuters report on Tuesday, came a day after the U.S. Commerce Department slapped export restrictions on ZTE for alleged Iran sanctions violations, a move that is expected to disrupt its sprawling global supply chain.

The U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security of the Department of Commerce added ZTE, ZTE Kangxun Telecommunications Ltd, ZTE Parsian and Beijing 8-Star International Co to its list of companies impacted, ZTE said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange.

U.S. suppliers to these companies are required to apply for a licence for the supply of the components, effective immediately, it added. Suppliers based elsewhere were not affected.

""The company is conducting a thorough assessment on the potential impacts of the restriction measures on the business and operation of the group,"" Chairman Hou Weigui said in the statement.

""As at the date of this announcement, the company has been, and will continue to be, cooperative in the investigations by the U.S. relevant governmental department, and has been actively facilitating communications with the U.S. governmental department to search for a solution.""

ZTE said there was no certainty a solution could be reached through the communications. It gave no further details. Shares of the Hong Kong-listed company, which had a market value of $1.4 billion, have been suspended since Monday.

The export restrictions against ZTE drew fire from the Chinese government, which said it was ""resolutely opposed"" to the tough measures but stopped short of announcing retaliation.

ZTE is among the largest companies that the Commerce Department has hit with a near-total export ban, according to public records.

It is the No. 4 smartphone vendor in the United States, with a 7 percent market share, behind Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co and LG Electronics Inc, according to research firm IDC. It sells handset devices to three of the four largest U.S. mobile carriers: AT&T, T-Mobile US and Sprint Corp.

NEW YORK Prominent short seller Carson Block, founder of research firm Muddy Waters LLC, said on Wednesday he remains bearish on the U.S. stock market and that the recent rally feels like a ""dead cat bounce.""

""I would say that this does feel like it is a dead cat bounce because how much more ammunition really do policymakers have?"" Block told Reuters at its New York headquarters. ""I just don't know if there are that many more bullets that central banks could fire.""

A dead cat bounce is a small, short-lived recovery in the price of a declining security, such as a stock. As of Tuesday's close, the benchmark S&P 500 Index .SPX had gained in 11 out of 17 sessions since its Feb. 11 low, and on Friday closed above its 100-day moving average for first time in 2016.

The Bank of Japan's negative rates have backfired, Block said. ""You see negative interest rates introduced in Japan, and guess what? That didn't really provide the relief that they had hoped for,"" he said.

""I've been very skeptical about the fundamentals of the U.S. economy for a long time. I don't feel that there have been permanent solutions that have been introduced.""

Block said there has been a tremendous amount of misallocation of capital, as a result of loose monetary policies.

""We knew this years ago when we saw companies issuing debt to buy back stock and pay out dividends,"" he said. ""We knew that we would be at a point in a few years where when these companies were just really, maybe not mortally wounded, but seriously wounded.""

He added: ""So from a short (selling) perspective, this is a target-rich environment because of that. There are far more companies with fewer legs to stand on than they were a few years ago.""

Corporate America chiefs have become, in many cases, compensated to think like equity traders, he said. ""Especially with larger companies, they run these businesses that in this global environment, 'Where do you really get growth?' Even if you have a new CEO come in, is this CEO so much smarter and has much better insight than the last CEO and he can figure out a way to grow?""

As a result, Block said he has seen some companies attempt to increase returns for equity holders in ways that are unsustainable.

Block made his mark in the $3 trillion hedge fund industry after he challenged accounting practices of a number of Chinese companies that trade on North American stock exchanges, then bet against them using his own money to short their stocks.

Block reiterated that he was targeting European companies and credits rated just above ""junk"" status, or BBB-, for shorting opportunities.

In Europe, ""the government and the regulators are very suspicious of short sellers. But that's also the opportunity because there is just this cultural bias against short sellers there. There are a lot more problems in the shadows, as a result of that.""

The equivalent of 1.3 million euros a minute or 2,000 euros for every man, woman and child in the euro zone. Markets, though, are looking for more. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CMC MARKETS ANALYST, MICHAEL HEWSON, SAYING: ""Currently, what's priced in is a ten basis points cut to minus 0.4, potentially another 10 billion euros in asset purchases to 70 billion euros a month, but ultimately I think there is a concern that further deposit rate cuts are going to be counter-productive, simply because of the concerns about the financial stability of the banks."" The other concerns are low inflation - it's minus 0.2 per cent. And - amid global pressures - faltering growth. Germany posting a sharp rise in industrial output on Tuesday the only sparkle in a dull data landscape. For many analysts, ECB boss Mario Draghi and his policymakers came up short at their December meeting. But there's also a worrying sense that he could be running out of options.

reuters.com,2016-03-08 00:04:15+00:00,Fed officials set battle lines on rate hikes ahead of March meet,"['Lindsay Dunsmuir', 'Howard Schneider', 'Jason Lange']","WASHINGTON After a long wait for inflation to accelerate, U.S. Federal Reserve officials face a complex and possibly divisive debate over whether recent evidence of rising prices is strong enough to move ahead with planned rate hikes.

In separate statements on Monday, policymakers at the core of that debate staked out starkly different views, with Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer saying economic data now points to the ""first stirrings"" of inflation, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard countering that the Fed should not move until inflation proves its ""persistence.""

The differing views may not matter immediately, when the Fed meets next week. A rate hike at that meeting is not expected after weeks in which oil prices have remained depressed and global equity markets have been volatile.

But it could tax Fed Chair Janet Yellen's ability to maintain consensus over the year as the Fed decides whether it is riskier to let inflation rise more quickly now, and try to control it later, or raise rates more slowly in a weak world economic environment. That discussion, largely moot over an extended period in which the Fed persistently missed its 2 percent inflation target, may be joined in full after the central bank's preferred measure of inflation rose to 1.7 percent in January.

""We're not that far away"" from an inflation target that has been elusive in an era of cheap oil, weak global demand and a strong U.S. dollar that has held down the cost of imports, Fischer said.

Fed officials have argued since mid-2014 that those inflation ""headwinds"" would pass, and recent data on prices of goods and services, as well as a jump in commodity prices, may indicate that time has finally come.

""We may well at present be seeing the first stirrings of an increase in the inflation rate,"" Fischer said, adding that an increase from too-low levels is ""something that we would like to happen.""

Investors who had largely priced out a further Fed rate hike until late this year have pushed those expectations forward in recent days, as oil has rallied and prices of some other commodities crept higher.

It may take more than that to convince Fed members like Brainard. In recent weeks even policymakers who had been among the more concerned about inflation joined her in worrying that public expectations about inflation were falling, often a precursor to even weaker price increases and possible deflation.

Brainard, the leading voice for the Fed to stay cautious in a world where China remains a risk and growth overall is slow, said one strong month is no reason to rush.

While January's data was good, ""it's just that - a data point... For me... I want to see a pattern, some persistence. That would give me some comfort,"" she said.

""Given weak and decelerating foreign demand, it is critical to carefully protect and preserve the progress we have made here at home through prudent adjustments to the policy path,"" she told a group of bankers.

The Fed in December raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. At the time, it signaled it would likely raise rates four more times this year, reflecting a stronger U.S. labor market and the view that inflation will begin to rise toward the Fed's 2 percent goal.

But an oil price slump, a global economic slowdown and volatile financial markets since the beginning of this year have convinced investors that the Fed's optimism may be misplaced.

Wall Street economists now expect just two rates hikes this year, and traders of interest-rate futures are betting there will be just one.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:46:41+00:00,Signs of life for Apple's stock as Wall St. eyes new iPhone,['Noel Randewich'],"SAN FRANCISCO After months of declines in Apple's (AAPL.O) stock, sentiment appears to be mending as investors focus on steady earnings expectations and bet that the expected launch of a new iPhone will add badly-needed fuel to sputtering sales.

Battered by nearly a year of off-and-on declines from record highs because of fears of a slowdown in iPhone sales, Apple's stock now is valued closer to IBM, which has disappointed Wall Street for the past four years with declining revenue, than to Silicon Valley technology pioneers Alphabet and Tesla Motors.

Apple shares have increased 5 percent in the past two weeks as Wall Street bets the company this month will launch a less expensive iPhone to boost sales in developing countries like China. With U.S. consumers upgrading their smartphones less often, manufacturers have been relying on China for growth.

Shareholders this week pointed to Apple's reliable cash generation, beaten down valuation and its wild card potential for future game-changing products as key reasons for owning it.

""This company has a history of doing better than expectations and surprising people,"" said Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust Company, which holds over 1 million shares of Apple. ""Where else can I go and find a company trading at 10 or 11 times earnings that has had such a great history?""

At $100.97 a share on Wednesday, Apple is selling at 10.7 times its expected earnings per share over the next 12 months. Its average forward price-earnings-ratio has been 13 over the past two years.

By comparison, Internet behemoth Alphabet (GOOGL.O), whose Android mobile platform competes against Apple's iOS, trades at 20 times expected earnings and 13-year old Tesla Motors (TSLA.O) trades at 132 times earnings. International Business Machines (IBM.N), which is struggling to expand into a high-growth business like cloud computing, has a P/E of 10.2, according to Thomson Reuters data.

""Unless something big happens, (Apple) doesn't deserve to trade at 20 to 25 times earnings anymore. It's just too big,"" said David Meier, a portfolio manager at Motley Fool Funds. ""But as a high-quality company, could it trade at 15 times earnings? Certainly.""

A target of 15 times its next 12 months' expected earnings would put Apple at around $138.

In another hint of improving sentiment, Apple's stock has recently moved above its 50-day moving average for the first time since December.

The stock's selloff in recent months has boosted Apple's dividend yield to 2.2 percent from 1.5 percent a year ago.

Analysts' covering Apple have been little help to investors. Ahead of the stock's 20-percent drop that started in December, 41 analysts recommended buying Apple shares while just one recommended selling, according to Thomson Reuters data. Currently, no analysts recommend selling, while 38 recommend buying.

A new iPhone with a smaller 4-inch screen will likely boost volumes by about 5 percent this year, an increase not yet incorporated into Wall Street's expectations, Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski wrote in a report on Monday.

Apple chip supplier Dialog Semiconductor (DLGS.DE) on Tuesday forecast March-quarter revenue below analysts' expectations, but said it still expects single-digit growth for the year. That suggests the March quarter could mark the low-point in iPhone shipments, with demand for new models building later in the year, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a research note.

Jeffrey Carbone, Senior Partner at Cornerstone Financial Partners, said Apple remains a staple holding at his firm but that he has recently turned his attention to Apple suppliers including Skyworks Solutions (SWKS.O), which he believes is undervalued.

""We have a normal weighting on Apple, we like the company, but we think the supply chain could have greater potential,"" Carbone said.

Facebook Inc is acquiring Masquerade Technologies Inc, creator of the popular face-swapping app MSQRD, as part of efforts by the world's largest social network operator to build its video services.

Wednesday's deal comes nearly three years after the Wall Street Journal reported that photo and video messaging app Snapchat had rejected an offer from Facebook. (bit.ly/1Xdz1N5)

Masquerade, which announced the deal on its website, did not disclose financial details.

The deal is more a piece of Facebook's bigger effort to innovate into video, Monness, Crespi, Hardt, & Co Inc analyst James Cakmak said.

It is unlikely that Facebook would use Masquerade to significantly draw away Snapchat users, he said.

While Snapchat has features such as bulging eyes, Masquerade allows users to add special effects including animal masks and snow to their photos and video.

Masquerade, backed by Yuri Gurski and Gagarin Capital, said founders Eugene Nevgen, Sergey Gonchar and Eugene Zatepyakin will join Facebook.

The app will continue as a standalone product, Masquerade said. (bit.ly/1pxMh4x)

CAPE TOWN South Africa left-arm spinner Aaron Phangiso has been cleared to play at the World Twenty20 tournament in India after an independent reassessment of his bowling action found it to be legal, Cricket South Africa (CSA) said on Tuesday.

The 32-year-old failed tests carried out by the International Cricket Council (ICC) on March 1 having been reported by umpires in a domestic 50-over match last month.

Phangiso was suspended from bowling until his action could be re-tested and has now been cleared to resume his career having worked with South Africa spin-bowling consultant Claude Henderson over the past week.

""It's a huge relief to be cleared and to have my bowling action passed. Its been a tough and challenging few weeks for me, Phangiso said in a CSA statement.

I'd really like to use the next few days ahead of the (World Twenty20) tournament to gain playing confidence, especially with some of the technical adjustments we have made to my action.

Phangiso will be available for South Africas series-deciding third Twenty20 international against Australia in Cape Town on Wednesday.

South Africa open their World Twenty20 campaign against England on March 18. They will also play Sri Lanka and West Indies in their pool.

Pershing Square, run by activist investor Bill Ackman, bought a stake in Valeant last year when the drugmaker's shares were on the rise. They have fallen 68 percent since.

Valeant said later on Wednesday it had jointly ended litigation with R&O Pharmacy with both sides asking the court to dismiss case. R&O was not immediately available for comment on the settlement.

While Valeant did not disclose the terms of the settlement, it said the resolution included a payment by R&O to Valeant. [nPn3vWq4v]

R&O sued Valeant in federal court in California on Oct. 6, after receiving a demand letter from Valeant for more than $69 million, money that R&O said it did not owe. [nL1N12P0OC]

Valeant later countersued R&O, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Last fall, the company became the target of two U.S. state investigations into its drug pricing practices, and its relationship with Philidor RX Services, a pharmacy selling its dermatology products, came under scrutiny and was dissolved. [nL3N12U450]

During the last two weeks, the company delayed its annual financial filing with regulators, postponed a preliminary earnings announcement, and said it would restate financials. Chief Executive Officer Michael Pearson returned from a two-month medical leave and a top dermatology executive left. It also disclosed an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Stephen Fraidin, a veteran Wall Street lawyer who is vice chairman at Pershing Square, joined the board, Valeant said. He previously worked at the Kirkland & Ellis law firm before joining Pershing last year.

Fred Eshelman, a drug executive who founded Furiex Pharmaceuticals Inc, and Thomas Ross, an academic who is a fellow at Duke University and president emeritus of the University of North Carolina, also joined the board.

Anders Lonner, former CEO of Swedish specialty drug company Meda AB (MEDAa.ST), stepped down from the board, Valeant said. The board now has 14 members.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has an ""underperform"" rating on the stock, said in a research note that Pershing Square had proposed Eshelman for the board at Allergan during its and Valeant's failed hostile bid for the company.

Maris said investors will likely have reservations about Ross as well, given his ties to Duke University, to which CEO Pearson has donated $45 million.

Valeant plans to report preliminary fourth-quarter earnings and hold a conference call on March 15.

On Tuesday, Ackman said the company will reveal ""messy"" fourth- and first-quarter results, and said Valeant needed to stabilize soon. If not, new management will be brought in or the company will be sold, he said.

Valeant's board set up a committee last year to look into the relationship between Valeant and Philidor. As a result of that ongoing investigation, it is restating financials. The committee is advised by Mark Filip, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis.

On Wednesday, its shares rose 6.6 percent to $67.20.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 15:31:05+00:00,"UK industrial output returns to growth in January, manufacturing strong",['Reuters Editorial'],"LONDON, British industrial output grew in January following a sharp fall in December, helped by a stronger than expected upturn in manufacturing, official data showed on Wednesday.

Industrial output rose by a weaker-than-expected 0.3 percent month-on-month in January after a 1.1 percent drop in December, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected it to rise 0.5 percent.

Output in manufacturing rose 0.7 percent on the month following a 0.3 percent dip, the first increase for four months and easily topping expectations for a 0.2 percent uptick.

The monthly Markit/CIPS survey of British manufacturers also showed the sector enjoyed an unexpectedly strong January, but it then suggested factory activity barely grew last month.

Britain has been one of the fastest-growing major advanced economies in the world for the last couple of years. But it has relied heavily on domestically focussed services for growth, frustrating hopes for a better-balanced recovery.

Economic growth slowed in the second half of last year and economists say it could lose more momentum in early 2016.

Industrial output was still 10.2 percent below its peak in early 2008 during the three months to January 2016, while manufacturing output was 6.4 percent smaller.

The manufacturing sector failed to contribute to British economic growth last year.

Chancellor George Osborne has warned that the economy was facing a ""dangerous cocktail"" of risks from overseas in 2016, as growth slows in major emerging markets, stock markets tumble and oil prices slump amid fading global demand.

Economists say that the Britain's planned referendum on its European Union membership could also drag on growth.

North Sea oil and gas extraction fell 6.3 percent on the month, the biggest drop since June 2014, which the ONS said could be linked to bad weather.

Brent crude oil prices slid almost 7 percent in January following a 35 percent drop for 2015 as a whole.

Compared with a year ago, industrial output was 0.2 percent higher in January.

TRIPOLI Five years after the uprising that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi, Tripoli is on edge, somewhere between peace and war.

There is a semblance of normal life in the Libyan capital and glimpses of the unexpected - kite surfers zip across choppy waves and a group of amateur cyclists in matching kit pedal along a seafront highway.

Yet the armed groups that control the city are an unsettling presence. Gunmen in balaclavas staff checkpoints on key roads, and armed brigades have been flexing their muscles in late-night parades.

It is here that a unity government nominated abroad under a U.N.-backed plan is hoping to set up shop.

But two months after the deal was signed with limited Libyan support, Reuters interviews with residents and officials, and a string of recent incidents, show that resistance from hardliners in both Tripoli and the east is still getting traction, shrinking the space for the plan to succeed.

The hardliners in Tripoli present themselves as the true guardians of the uprising, protecting Libya against a counter-revolution and foreign meddling. Those in the east claim to be saving the country from Islamist extremism.

Both speak for some of the armed factions that hold real power in Libya, and are scared of losing influence, protection and access to the country's rapidly dwindling financial resources in a political transition.

In Tripoli's Martyrs' Square, where families stroll past dozens of men saying prayers at sunset, some support the unity government, saying they are fed up with violence, cash shortages and rising prices.

""We've had enough,"" said Fardous Boukhatwa, whose family was displaced by fighting in Benghazi and was visiting Tripoli with three of her children. ""There is only one solution - reconciliation and forgiveness.""

HARDLINERS

But others echo the criticism of the Tripoli hardliners. ""The United Nations did not play the role of mediator, it was biased towards the east,"" said Abdulkarim Sadiq, a retired teacher from the suburb of Janzour. ""They cannot bring peace to Libya  they just add fuel to the fire.""

A group of teenage boys mention photos they saw on Facebook of Prime Minister-designate Fayez Seraj meeting the commander of Libya's eastern military forces, Khalifa Haftar, a former Gaddafi ally deeply mistrusted in the west.

For nearly two years, Tripoli has been under the control of armed factions that formed an alliance known as Libya Dawn to seize control of the capital.

They reinstated the old parliament, the General National Congress (GNC), and the newly elected chamber moved east to Tobruk.

The Dawn alliance has now splintered. Key brigades have said they will provide security for the unity government, but the situation is volatile.

Under the U.N.-backed plan, the GNC is meant to form a consultative chamber, and a few dozen moderates have been holding meetings in preparation.

After their third session was disrupted by protesters last week, one of those attending, Bilqasem Eggzait, said they might have to consider meeting in a different city.

The same day, a group that regularly protests against the unity government in Martyrs' Square appeared on a popular TV station to proclaim the unity government ""illegal"" and warn of ""bloodshed and a fire of sedition"" in the capital.

Early on Friday, the man nominated to head the State Council said rocket-propelled grenades were fired at his Tripoli office. The U.N. envoy to Libya swiftly condemned the incident, though the property later appeared undamaged.

On Sunday, three members of the committee tasked with preparing security in Tripoli for the new government were briefly detained, drawing further U.N. condemnation.

The chances of major clashes if the unity government came to Tripoli were small because a majority of Libyans support it, said Eggzait.

But with a unified security force to build and oil revenues at a fraction of their former value, the government would need to cut salaries for brigades of former rebels who added tens of thousands of men to the state payroll after the revolution, and this would be difficult. ""Politics in Tripoli is not about ideology, it's about money,"" he said.

GUNFIGHTS

While recent violence in Tripoli has been limited to occasional gunfights and isolated clashes, Benghazi, Libya's second city, has been a battleground for Haftar's forces and a collection of armed groups including Islamic State.

After previous promises to ""liberate"" the city came to nothing, over the past two weeks the military has taken control of several key areas, allowing some residents to return to their homes and start repairing war-torn streets.

In the recently secured neighborhood of Laithi, 42-year-old father of four Khairy Mohamed al-Qatrani said he had been able to return to his house ""thanks to Khalifa Haftar, whose Karama (Dignity) operation has thwarted the plans of Islamic State to take control of Benghazi"".

Qatrani said he hoped the army would be a neutral force in the future, but the military deadlock was broken as Haftar's allies in the eastern parliament, the House of Representatives (HOR), continued to block approval of the unity government, which includes Mahdi al-Bargathi, a Haftar rival, as defense minister.

The recent military push ""very much has to do with Haftar's need to reassert himself as the savior of the east in the face of challenges within his own camp,"" said Issandr El Amrani, North Africa director for International Crisis Group.

A majority of HOR members signed a declaration of support for the new government, but complained that hardliners had resorted to threats and physical force to prevent a vote.

A ""crisis of trust"" in the Tobruk chamber meant that voting to approve the government there had become impossible, lawmaker Ayman al-Nasr told Reuters.

Western diplomats, who say they can only provide sustained support for the fight against Islamic State in Libya at the request of a unity government, have looked on with growing exasperation.

The extremist group is in control of Gaddafi's home town of Sirte and has expanded to several other cities. This year it has launched a series of attacks on facilities in Libya's coastal ""oil crescent"".

Diplomats may now have to accept a return to negotiations, which could be complicated by the military advances in Benghazi and Haftar's enduring popularity.

Critics of the unity government plan say it was pushed through prematurely, before Libya's powerful armed factions were brought on board.

Unless this happens, with help from the regional powers that have backed both sides  Egypt and the United Arab Emirates in the east, Turkey and Qatar in the west  Libya's conflict will not be resolved, said Amrani.

""The political guys who stand in as proxies cannot negotiate for them at the end of the day,"" he said.

Assange, 44, took refuge at the embassy in June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over allegations, which he denies, that he committed rape in 2010. He says the accusation is a ploy that would eventually lead to his extradition to the United States, where a criminal investigation into the activities of WikiLeaks is still open. ""We consider that there have arisen a number of new circumstances which mean there is reason to review the earlier decision,"" Thomas Olsson, one of Assange's lawyers, said on Monday. A second lawyer representing Assange said he remained willing to be questioned in the Ecuadorian embassy, according to Sweden's national news agency. Ecuador has granted Assange asylum and he says his rights have been infringed because he is unable to travel to the South American country. Both Britain and Sweden denied that Assange was being deprived of freedom and the Swedish prosecutor in charge of the case has said she will renew an application to interview Assange. Prosecutor Marianne Ny said the U.N. panels' non-binding ruling had no impact on the case. In 2010, WikiLeaks released more than 90,000 secret documents on the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan, followed by almost 400,000 U.S. military reports detailing operations in Iraq. Those disclosures were followed by release of millions of diplomatic cables dating back to 1973. A U.S. Grand Jury investigation into WikiLeaks is ongoing.",[]

Exibido numa mostra paralela no Festival de Veneza, em 2014, ao contrario do tipico cinema meditativo iraniano, aqui o que vemos e uma satira do poder e da sede cega provocada por este.

O filme comeca com um envelhecido ditador (interpretado pelo georgiano Mikheil Gomiashvili) de um pais sem nome mostrando ao seu pequeno neto (Dachi Orvelashvilli) o que e o poder. Ao seu gosto, manda ligar e desligar a energia eletrica da cidade, deixando toda a populacao no escuro simplesmente para mostrar que pode. A partir de um unico gesto, se diz muito. Ele pode tudo, quando bem quiser.

Porem, quando pede para a energia ser religada, isso nao acontece: a Revolucao chegou! Tratado por todos como Sua Majestade, ele entao obriga toda sua familia a fugir, mas o neto se recusa, pois os dois sao muito apegados. Simbolicamente, o menino funciona como a materializacao do infantilismo que governa os mandos e desmandos do ditador. Quando sao abandonados e comecam sua propria fuga, acabam num vilarejo, onde o protagonista troca de roupa com um barbeiro e foge em busca de uma prostituta (la Sukhitashvili) que conheceu na juventude.

Makhmalbaf  assinando o roteiro com sua mulher, a tambem cineasta Marziyeh Meshkiny  faz de O Presidente uma alegoria que tanto vale para as ditaduras instauradas nas pequenas republicas da ex-Uniao Sovietica como para o mundo arabe  estas, segundo o diretor, sua verdadeira inspiracao. E, ao mesmo tempo, um filme didatico, repleto de boas intencoes, mas exagerado em seus ensinamentos e sua pouca sutileza.

Sua mensagem sobre a corrupcao do poder e, especialmente, da tirania e necessaria, mas obvia. Assim como o modo como ele retrata a Revolucao: havera um inevitavel derramamento de sangue promovido por um povo oprimido e traumatizado.

Na sua fuga, o ditador e o neto acabam ao lado de um grupo de prisioneiros politicos que ilustram a variedade do espectro de posicionamentos. E mais um dos momentos exageradamente didaticos do longa que, por natureza, fala de um assunto bastante proximo ao nosso tempo, e, por isso mesmo, acaba enfraquecido diante da forca do mundo real.

Criancas sao uma presenca constante na obra do cineasta, mas o menino aqui acaba soando como um pretexto para fazer questionamentos simples que tentam ganhar ares mais profundos: O que e morte? O que e tortura? A presenca do garoto acaba reduzida a apenas isso, fazer perguntas, e, com o tempo, O Presidente vai se esvaziando de seu potencial critico.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 14:27:22+00:00,U.N. torture envoy concerned at water-boarding rhetoric in U.S. race,['Stephanie Nebehay'],"GENEVA The U.N. torture investigator voiced concern on Wednesday at calls by some Republican candidates in the U.S. presidential race to authorize water-boarding in interrogating detainees, noting that it was illegal under domestic and international law.

Republican candidate Donald Trump softened his stance on torture last Friday, saying he would not order the U.S. military to break international laws on how to treat terrorism suspects. The night before, he indicated he might order U.S. military to break the law on interrogation tactics, including waterboarding.

Trump's rival and number two in the Republican primaries, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, said last month he would only allow limited use of the practice. He said he didn't believe waterboarding met the international definition for torture.

""Candidates in the United States have again discussed whether waterboarding is torture or not and have actually promised to bring it back and to bring even harsher techniques,"" Juan Mendez, U.N. special rappporteur on torture, told a news briefing in Geneva.

The Bush administration allowed the use of waterboarding - the practice of pouring water over a cloth covering a detainee's face to mimic the sensation of drowning - around conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. President Barack Obama banned it days after taking office in 2009.

""The Bush administration itself had withdrawn the torture memos when it was discovered that these things were happening as a matter of policy,"" Mendez said. ""Even the Republican administration had already recognized that these things are illegal.""

""They are illegal as a matter of international law, they are illegal as a matter of constitutional law in the United States, they are illegal as a matter of military law...and they are immoral anyway,"" he said.

Speaking as a U.S. citizen, rather than in his U.N. role, he said: ""Yes, I think the damage in the standing of the United States as a law-abiding nation and as an example to other states to fight crime and terrorism within the strictures of the rule of law is very seriously damaged by this kind of rhetoric.""

The Senate Intelligence Committee released a report in 2014, despite the objection of Republicans, that detailed what it called torture tactics used by the Central Intelligence Agency, including extensive use of waterboarding.

SAO PAULO O dolar fechou em queda e voltou abaixo de 3,70 reais nesta quarta-feira, dando continuidade ao vies de baixa visto recentemente em meio a alta dos precos do petroleo, a atuacao do Banco Central e ao cenario politico brasileiro.

O dolar recuou 1,12 por cento, a 3,6970 reais na venda, voltando ao patamar de 20 de novembro. A moeda norte-americana atingiu 3,6842 reais na minima da sessao e 3,7515 reais na maxima.

O dolar futuro caia cerca de 1,60 por cento, apos o fechamento do mercado a vista.

""Essa trajetoria de queda do dolar nos ultimos dias nao esta dando sinais de perder forca"", disse o operador Glauber Romano, da corretora Intercam.

A alta dos precos do petroleo trouxe folego adicional ao bom humor que vem permeando os mercados domesticos nas ultimas sessoes. A commodity foi influenciada por expectativas de que os principais produtores do mundo podem acertar ainda neste mes o congelamento da producao.

A moeda norte-americana vem recuando firmemente desde a semana passada, conforme as investigacoes de corrupcao no Brasil se aproximaram do governo da presidente Dilma Rousseff.

Muitos operadores acreditam que uma mudanca no governo poderia ajudar a resgatar a credibilidade do pais com investidores, embora alguns ressaltem que as turbulencias politicas tendem a prejudicar as perspectivas economicas no curto prazo.

A atuacao do BC tambem ajudou a trazer alivio ao mercado de cambio. A autoridade monetaria realizou nesta tarde leilao de venda de ate 2 bilhoes de dolares com compromisso de recompra para reforcar que a autoridade monetaria esta pronta para corrigir exageros.

""O BC deixou claro que esta atento. So essa indicacao ja faz efeito no mercado"", disse o gerente de derivativos de uma gestora de recursos nacional.

Pela manha, o BC promoveu mais um leilao de rolagem dos swaps que vencem no proximo mes, vendendo a oferta total de 9,6 mil contratos. Ao todo, a autoridade monetaria ja rolou 3,195 bilhoes de dolares, ou cerca de 32 por cento do lote total, que equivale a 10,092 bilhoes de dolares.",[]

MEXICO CITY Mexican construction firm ICA has readied a bankruptcy protection filing in case it fails to restructure its hefty debt load outside of court, people familiar with the matter said, adding the board was meeting on Wednesday to discuss its plans.

ICA, which has defaulted on about $60 million in interest payments since December, is struggling under a multi-billion dollar debt load made heavier by a slumping peso and a cash crunch as government spending on infrastructure has slipped.

A spokesperson for ICA (ICA.MX) was not immediately available for comment.

It hired FTI Consulting and investment bank Rothschild to help it engineer business and restructuring plans by mid-February. But the company announced last month that the proposals would not be ready until March.

According to one source, ICA's board, which is presided over by Bernardo Quintana Isaac, was meeting to analyze FTI's business plan and Rothschild's restructuring recommendations.

If ICA cannot reach agreements with its creditors outside of court, it can file for bankruptcy protection, which would allow the company to continue negotiating with its creditors without risk of lawsuits.

The bankruptcy protection filing, which has been ready since January, envisions keeping certain units that hold company assets out of bankruptcy, two sources said. That would allow them to bid for projects.

ICA shares closed up 5.75 percent at 4.6 pesos per share.

TORONTO The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, marking a nearly four-month high as oil prices rallied and the Bank of Canada refrained from action to erode the currency's recent sharp gains.

The central bank held its policy interest rate steady at 0.50 percent, citing lower market volatility and stronger non-energy exports as it waits to assess the impact of government stimulus due to be unveiled in the March 22 budget.

""What the markets were anticipating was some push-back against Canadian dollar strength,"" said Bipan Rai, executive director, macro strategy at CIBC Capital Markets.

Lack of push-back indicates the Bank of Canada is comfortable with the currency at present levels, he added.

It has rebounded 11 percent since hitting a 12-year low on Jan. 20 at C$1.4689.

Too sharp a rally could hinder a pick-up in exports that appears to be underway.

The implied probability of a rate cut this year dropped to less than 29 percent from 43 percent before the decision, according to the overnight interest rate futures market BOCWATCH. It was 80 percent a little over two weeks ago.

U.S. crude CLc1 prices settled at $38.29 a barrel, up 4.90 percent after a huge draw in U.S. gasoline inventories last week convinced the market that energy demand was improving. [O/R]

The Canadian dollar CAD=D4 ended at C$1.3250 to the greenback, or 75.47 U.S. cents, much stronger than Tuesday's close of C$1.3416, or 74.54 U.S.

The currency's weakest level was C$1.3447, while it touched its strongest since Nov. 12 at C$1.3230.

The new Liberal government is expected to run a big deficit and invest in infrastructure projects. Adding private-sector investment to projects could spur even greater spending.

There should be a slight upgrade to the Bank of Canada's economic projection in April if it incorporates what is expected from fiscal stimulus, said Mark Chandler, head of Canadian fixed income and currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Canadian government bond prices were lower across a steeper maturity curve. The two-year CA2YT=RR price fell 7.5 Canadian cents to yield 0.532 percent and the benchmark 10-year CA10YT=RR was down 61 Canadian cents to yield 1.248 percent.

The Canada-U.S. two-year bond spread was 1.8 basis points higher at -36.6 basis points, while the 10-year spread was 2.4 basis points higher at -62.8 basis points as Canadian government bonds underperformed.

Por Lisandra Paraguassu

BRASILIA O governo da presidente Dilma Rousseff ve com bons olhos a eventual participacao de Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva no ministerio, embora o ex-presidente, alvo da mais recente fase da operacao Lava Jato, resista a ideia.

O ministro da Secretaria de Governo, Ricardo Berzoini, afirmou nesta quarta-feira que o ex-presidente pode assumir um ministerio, em meio a noticias sobre essa possibilidade. Segundo Berzoini, uma nomeacao depende apenas de ele (Lula) querer.

A bola sempre esteve com ele, disse Berzoini, ao ser questionado sobre o assunto. Para o governo e bom. Qual governo nao vai querer por o Pele em campo?, comparou.

Caso assuma um ministerio, o ex-presidente passara a ter foro privilegiado junto ao Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF). Lula foi o principal alvo da 24a da Lava Jato, deflagrada na sexta-feira, e foi obrigado a prestar depoimento a Policia Federal apos mandado de conducao coercitiva expedido pelo juiz federal Sergio Moro, que cuida das acoes da operacao na primeira instancia.

O ato de Moro acendeu a luz vermelha no PT e no governo, que passou a ver chances reais de o ex-presidente ser preso.

Ate agora, a alternativa mais provavel para Lula na Esplanada seria o Ministerio das Relacoes Exteriores, com o qual o ex-presidente tem uma grande afinidade e seria bem recebido pela maior parte dos diplomatas --dentro do Itamaraty, os tempos da pasta durante o governo Lula ainda sao lembrados com saudade.

Outra possibilidade seria a Secretaria de Governo, responsavel pela articulacao politica e a cargo hoje de Berzoini.

No entanto, de acordo com duas fontes proximas ao ex-presidente, Lula ainda resiste a voltar ao governo, mas a pressao do PT tem aumentado e estaria surtindo efeito.

De acordo com uma dessas fontes, um advogado amigo de Lula analisou as informacoes disponiveis no processo da Lava Jato e sinalizou ao ex-presidente que, da forma como a investigacao esta sendo feita, ha indicios de que a intencao e realmente prende-lo.

""A melhor chance seria ele (Lula) assumir um ministerio para o processo ir ao STF e ter um julgamento justo"", disse a fonte ligada ao ex-presidente. Ela reconheceu, no entanto, que Lula continua resistindo a ideia por achar que seria uma confissao de culpa e um ato de covardia.

Uma fonte palaciana disse a Reuters que Dilma deixou claro a Lula que o governo esta aberto para que ele ocupe o cargo que achar mais adequado e que nao e preciso convite, apenas a decisao do ex-presidente.

A ideia de levar Lula para o ministerio de Dilma ja havia surgido no ano passado, durante a reforma ministerial, justamente para dar foro privilegiado ao ex-presidente, mas nao prosperou porque Lula recusou essa possibilidade acreditando que nao seria necessario.

O governo sabe que enfrentara enormes criticas se nomear Lula para um ministerio com o claro intuito de protege-lo da Lava Jato, mas avalia que ainda assim e um movimento necessario.

""Seria bom para ele, mas bom para o governo tambem, que precisa de um apoio na area politica"", disse a fonte palaciana, que pediu anonimato. ""Seria um desgaste para o governo, mas depois passa"", acrescentou.",[]

WASHINGTON, Md.  Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump cancelled, last-minute, his scheduled appearance here at the American Conservative Unions annual conference, CPAC. Liz Mair, the spokeswoman for an anti-Trump effort who had planned to protest at his speech, is taking credit for keeping him at bay.

The New York businessman doesnt have as much support here among conservatives as he seems to have among the general population of Republicans. Mair, who says she had commitments from about 50 people to join her protest, explained just how strong her disapproval is: She said in an interview Saturday shed never vote for him  not even if he won the Republican nomination and faced off against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.

There are a lot of average Americans out there on the right who are terrified of this guy being president, she said, adding she believed those voters would turn to a third-party candidate, a write-in or would simply stay home on election day rather than vote for Trump.

The idea turns on its head a fear members of the Republican establishment began to express as soon as Trump announced his White House bid last summer. Worried hed launch a third-party run if he didnt get the Republican nomination, party leaders got Trump to sign a loyalty pledge saying he wouldnt run as an independent. They, in turn, pledged to support him as the nominee. The agreement seemed to head off the possibility that a third candidate would take votes away from the Republican ticket and hand the presidency to Clinton.

Trump is succeeding as a Republican, but the third-party threat from the right remains. Its just less likely that third candidate will be The Donald. Instead, it could be the Libertarian former governor of New Mexico Gary Johnson or a yet-undetermined write-in.

Mair pointed to the success of Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, who beat the Republican nominee for her Senate seat in 2010 as a write-in on the ballot.

Its a lot harder to spell Murkowski than it is to spell Ryan or Romney or Walker or Perry, she said, referring to her other ideas for Republican write-ins, House Speaker Paul Ryan, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and former Texas Governor Rick Perry. Romney, Walker and Perry have all run for president. Ryan was Romneys running mate on the 2012 Republican presidential ticket.

Not everyone at CPAC intends to vote for a third party if Trump is the nominee. Several people asked by a reporter about the idea chuckled and walked away at the suggestion, refusing to give their names.

But Josh Paladino, a 19-year-old student at Hillsdale College in Hillsdale, Michigan, brought up the idea without any prompting. He said he so strongly disapproved of Trump that he was hoping Republican leaders would use whatever obscure party rules they could find to keep the nomination away from him. But if they couldnt, he said, hed vote for someone else.

Hopefully a conservative can get on the ballot, he said.",[]

reuters.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,A campaign that makes the political turmoil of 1968 look good,"[""Any Opinions Expressed Here Are The Author's Own"", 'Maurice Isserman', 'Posted Laster', 'Maurice Isserman Teaches History At Hamilton College Is Co-author Of America Divided The Civil War Of The', 'Posted Solidar']","There is rare agreement, on the left and the right, that the 2016 presidential election season is looking to be a repeat of Democratic Partys 1968 race.

There was a bitterly fought primary campaign that year, with fierce public debates over the Vietnam War, race relations and law and order. The campaign led to a divisive and volatile Democratic National Convention in Chicago, with clashes between antiwar protesters and club-swinging cops in the streets outside the arena, and protests inside the hall over both the war and the mayhem outside.

The resulting split in Democratic ranks, plus the widespread public belief that the country was coming apart at the seams, led to Republican Richard M. Nixons win in November. The GOP went on to win the White House in all but one of the next half-dozen elections.

This time around, however, it is Republicans who seem most vulnerable to splintering after a fevered primary season. The Donald Trump insurgency is defying the best efforts of the GOP establishment to steer primary voters to other candidates. This seems a dire threat to Trumps adopted partys prospects  not only in the November election, but also potentially for decades to come.

Trumps supporters, like many liberal anti-war Democratic primary voters did in 1968, view the race in apocalyptic terms. They will not easily be persuaded to cast their votes strategically for another nominee should a brokered convention in July deny the current GOP front-runner the nomination.

I want to see Trump go up there and do damage to the Republican Party, one middle-aged white voter in Mississippi told a reporter after former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, urged the party faithful to support other candidates.

Resentfully nihilistic sentiments among the partys base voters do not contribute to building and maintaining durable majority coalitions, though many political pundits now suggest this could happen. Just ask the Democrats in 1968.

Yet, similar to the 1968 race and identical to it are different categories. History doesnt repeat itself, Mark Twain is supposed to have said, but it does rhyme. (The Twain attribution is a little dubious, but its the kind of thing he might have said.) Consider three ways in which 1968 and 2016 resemble each other while retaining significant dissimilarities.

First, the nominating process is significantly different. In 1968 the Democratic establishments candidate, and eventual nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, did not run in a single primary. Only 14 states and the District of Columbia held primaries that year, and the victories were largely divided between two insurgent, anti-war candidates, Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy, and New York Senator Robert Kennedy. (Though a few favorite son candidates did run as surrogates for Humphrey.)

The overwhelming majority of delegates who gathered at the convention in Chicago in August 1968 were thus chosen by party insiders, chiefly elected officials, rather than primary voters. So it should not have been surprising that they proved overwhelmingly pro-Humphrey  and awarded him the nomination on the first ballot.

Many liberal voters, accordingly, sat on their hands in the falls presidential campaign.

Thanks to reforms in both parties nominating process during the 1970s, most Republican and Democratic delegates today are chosen by primary and caucus voters, allowing presidential candidates to claim a popular mandate. Thus far in the Republican race, Trump has ridden a wave of populist resentments, and is well on his way to secure the simple majority he needs for nomination on the first ballot.

Should he remain the front-runner but fall short of the necessary 1,237 delegates, the consequences for Republicans could prove even more devastating than the boss-driven selection of the presidential candidate did for the Democrats in 1968.

In 1968, Humphreys selection, however controversial within party ranks, was still politics-as-usual. If Trump fails to win on the first ballot, and party insiders manage on a subsequent ballot (the dreaded brokered convention) to steer the nomination to an alternative candidate, it will be perceived as more akin to politics-by-coup-detat. Angry Trump voters are likely to abandon the Republican Party.

Second, the gap between party insiders and insurgent candidates in 1968, while wide in terms of specific issues, especially the Vietnam War, was far narrower in terms of the candidates experience and capabilities. The candidates, ordinarily team players, had a lot in common, among themselves  and with their partys elite. In 1968, McCarthy had served in Congress for 20 years, 10 in the House of Representatives and 10 in the Senate. Kennedy, in addition to being the brother of a martyred Democratic president, had been U.S. attorney general, and spent four years as a senator. McCarthys fellow Minnesotan, Humphrey had served a term as mayor of Minneapolis, before serving three terms as a senator (the last as Democratic majority whip), before taking his place as President Lyndon B. Johnsons vice president.

They were all dyed-in-the-wool Democrats. Solid party men. None of the candidates, faced with defeat, had any intention of bolting the party for a third party effort. In a less polarizing set of circumstances, say minus the Vietnam War, its easy to imagine either Kennedy or Humphrey, and perhaps even McCarthy, proving a candidate acceptable to all the partys factions, insiders and outsiders alike.

Today, however, there is a profound disjunction in the leading Republican candidates experiences, credentials and loyalties. Real estate developer and reality television star Trump has never held or seriously pursued elective office. Cruz and Rubio have backgrounds in Republican state politics, but neither have served long  or with any particular distinction  in national office. At the start of the primary season, none would have been the Republican establishments top choice. At least two, front-runner Trump and his chief rival, Cruz, are regarded by many party insiders as deranged or disloyal. Rubio, acceptable on other grounds, is seen as a hopelessly maladroit.

Further muddying the choices is the fact that the divisions among the candidates, rather than based on a serious debate over policy direction, have devolved into playground insults. Whatever else might be said about the Democrats in 1968, they took their separate stances over real and substantive issues, such as the Vietnam War. Penis size did not emerge as a subject for discussion.

Finally, in comparing 1968 to 2016, the violence factor needs to be considered. The backdrop for the 1968 presidential campaign included the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Kennedy, campus occupations and urban riots, as well as the protests in the streets of Chicago outside the convention. The anti-war protesters chanted The whole world is watching as they were beaten and arrested by Chicago police. In a sense they were right  though not about what the world would conclude from their example.

That fall, Republican television commercials featured clips of the Chicago disturbances, and demanded How can a party that cant keep order in its own backyard hope to keep order in our 50 states?

A fair question  that today can be asked of Republicans. When the front-running candidate for the nomination has some conservative commentators invoking the specter of fascism, the Republican vision of order isnt necessarily going to play well in November.

After one black man was beaten and ejected from a Trump rally in Atlanta, the candidate commented on Fox News, Maybe he should have been roughed up, because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing, (i.e. chanting Black Lives Matter!) Following a similar event a few weeks later, Trumps response was, I love the old days. You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? Theyd be carried out on a stretcher.

The rancor displayed by Trump rally-goers, encouraged by their candidate and directed against protesters and media alike, bears some resemblance to the old days of 1968  especially the hate-filled gatherings for third-party segregationist candidate Alabama Governor George Wallace  who once vowed to run over any protesters who sat-in in front of his limousine.

What happens if Trump is denied the Republican nomination in Cleveland in July? Will his supporters, with his overt or implied approval, fill the streets outside the convention hall in violent protest? Or will some of them seek Second Mmendment solutions to their political frustrations? (One of Trumps New Hampshire campaign officials was arrested earlier this month in connection with his role in the 2014 Bundy Ranch armed standoff with federal officers in Nevada.)

The 2016 election is not simply a repeat of 1968. If the current election evokes the historical rhyme scheme of that earlier contest, it is chiefly in the stakes involved and the uncertainty of the outcome.",[]
reuters.com,2016-03-09 13:09:13+00:00,Post lasst sich von Amazon nicht Bange machen,['Reuters Editorial'],"Trucks of German mail carrier Deutsche Post are parked during a demonstration Munich, Germany, June 18, 2015. Workers at Deutsche Post are on strike over labour union Verdi's demands in a dispute over pay and conditions.

Troisdorf Die Deutsche Post sieht sich fur einen Angriff des Online-Handlers Amazon in ihrem angestammten Paketgeschaft gerustet.

""Wir bieten eine hervorragende Qualitat in unseren Diensten"", sagte Konzernchef Frank Appel am Mittwoch in Troisdorf bei Bonn. Es sei schon, wenn sich Unternehmen fur den Markt der Post interessierten - ""dies zeigt, wie attraktiv er ist"". Der Konzern habe alle Szenarien durchgespielt und bekraftige seine Ziele bis 2020. Allein in diesem Jahr will Appel das operative Ergebnis um mindestens eine Milliarde Euro auf 3,4 bis 3,7 Milliarden Euro steigern. Dabei helfen sollen das boomende Expressgeschaft und die Sanierung der kriselnden Frachtsparte, die der Post im vergangenen Jahr noch einen Gewinneinbruch eingebrockt hatte.

Amazon, in Deutschland bislang Grokunde der Post, betreibt in Olching bei Munchen ein erstes Paketzentrum, in dem rund 130 Mitarbeiter Pakete fur die Zustellung noch am gleichen oder am kommenden Tag verteilen. ""Naturlich ist das etwas, was wir uns anschauen"", raumte Post-Vorstand Jurgen Gerdes ein. Ein Abzug von Paketmengen beschadige das Geschaft der Post, doch werde dies nicht nachhaltig sein. ""Wir haben eine groe Maschinerie mit vielen, vielen Kunden."" Zudem sei davon auszugehen, dass auch Amazon weiter zu den Kunden der Post zahlen werde. Gerdes machte auch klar: ""Jeder Kunde hat das Recht, seine Geschichte fortzuschreiben."" Auch die Post tue dies - und arbeite weiter ""an einer Erfolgsgeschichte"".

Zuversichtlich stimmt den Bonner Konzern die Entwicklung auf dem gesamten Paketmarkt in Deutschland. Hatte er 2010 der Post zufolge noch ein Volumen von 6,8 Milliarden Euro, waren es 2015 bereits 9,5 Milliarden Euro. Auf die Post enfiel ein Anteil von 44 Prozent. Nun will Amazon einen Teil des Kuchens abhaben. Der US-Konzern greift fur die Auslieferung an die Kunden auf lokale Logistikunternehmen zuruck - Amazon-Kleinlaster sind also nicht unterwegs. Jedoch pruft das Unternehmen die Eroffnung weiterer Verteilzentren. Zudem hatte Amazon Stellenanzeigen geschaltet, aus denen hervorgeht, dass in Deutschland eine Amazon-eigene vollautomatische Packstationen aufgebaut werden solle. In Grobritannien bietet Amazon diese bereits an. Die Post sieht sich dafur gewappnet, sie hat allein Deutschland mit uber 2700 Packstationen uberzogen.

GEWINNRUCKGANG IM VERGANGENEN JAHR - AKTIE IM MINUS

2015 litt die Post noch unter den anhaltenden Problemen in ihrer Frachtsparte: Der operative Konzernertrag (Ebit) brach auf 2,41 (Vorjahr: 2,97) Milliarden Euro ein. Auf der Bilanz lasteten nach Post-Angaben noch Abschreibungen in einer Hohe von gut einer halben Milliarde Euro. Trotzdem wollen die Bonner eine zum Vorjahr unveranderte Dividende von 0,85 Euro je Aktie ausschutten und fur bis zu eine Milliarde Euro eigene Aktien zuruckkaufen. Zum Ende des Jahres konnte die Post den Gewinnruckgang eingrenzen - dabei geholfen hat eine Paketflut zu Weihnachten. Ruckenwind erhofft sich das Unternehmen auch von der Porto-Erhohung in Deutschland. Die Post hatte die Preise so stark angehoben wie seit fast 30 Jahren nicht mehr. Beim Massenprodukt Standardbrief stieg das Porto etwa von 62 auf 70 Cent.

Borsianer konnte der Post-Chef mit seinem positiven Ausblick dennoch nicht uberzeugen: Post-Aktien gaben 1,4 Prozent auf 23,12 Euro nach und bildeten zeitweise das Schlusslicht im Dax. Die Titel hatten allerdings seit Monatsbeginn mehr als sechs Prozent zugelegt und damit drei Mal so viel wie der Leitindex. Analysten werteten es positiv, dass der Konzern seine Prognosen fur 2016 und 2020 bestatigte.",[]

Trump, who's had to fend off a number of accusations during his bid for president, is not named in the suit.

Traditional German industrial companies like Bosch are looking to transform themselves from manufactures of equipment to service providers using data generated by their machines.

Bosch is hoping its engineering expertise will give it an advantage in making the ""Internet of Things"" (IoT), where objects communicate with each other, a reality for its customers in smart homes, connected mobility or intelligent industry.

Its announcement on Wednesday that it plans build its own cloud puts it in competition with services from U.S. technology giants Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM and Salesforce.com.

Bosch's cloud will be run out of a computing center based in Germany, which it hopes will attract customers who may have doubts about data security of U.S-owned servers.

Bosch Chief Executive Volkmar Denner told a conference in Berlin that the company was building its own IoT and would combine this with its experience in making everyday objects.

""There are product companies like Bosch trying to add software and services and there are IT companies trying to get into the physical space. The race is completely open,"" he said.

Stuttgart-based Bosch plans to run around 50 of its own in-house applications on the cloud this year, before opening up to other companies from 2017. It plans to roll out other data centers across the globe but declined to give a timeline.

More than five million devices are currently connected via Bosch's IoT software suite. Applications include a system that enables users to remotely control the temperature of their home as well sensors that help drivers find parking spaces or firms track the quality of a product once it leaves a factory.

Bosch declined to disclose how much money it was spending on the cloud specifically but said it was investing around 500 million euros ($548 million) annually in new technologies.

The company plans to charge customers based on the services that they use, but did not give revenue forecasts. Market research firm Gartner estimates that global sales in the public cloud market will exceed $200 billion this year.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 00:24:56+00:00,Exclusive: Bank of America hiring bankers for new middle-market push - sources,"['Dan Freed', 'Olivia Oran']","Bank of America Corp is hiring a new team of investment bankers who cater to midsized companies, four years after dismantling a similar business, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The precise number of middle-market bankers it plans to add could not be determined, but one person said it would be fewer than 10.

The hiring comes as Bank of America is reducing staff more broadly, while also trying to grow in areas where it believes it can gain market share. As the second-biggest U.S. lender with a large commercial banking business, executives believe Bank of America can make inroads in advising midsized companies on mergers and stock and bond offerings, the sources said. Bank of America defines middle-market as companies with $50 million to $2 billion in revenue.

The bank also hopes the push will lead to additional business such as managing money for executives at midsized companies.

Sources asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media about matters that have not been made public.

Bank of America announced internally last year that Vice Chairman Mark Stephanz would create a group that provides investment banking services to midsized companies. The hiring is part of that effort. His team will work together with counterparts in the commercial bank who provide traditional loans and cash management services, sources said.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender previously launched a middle-market business in 2007, with more than 30 investment bankers who focused on mergers and acquisitions. It abandoned the effort in 2012 to focus on larger clients and bigger deals, sources said. In 2015, Bank of America ranked fourth in global M&A league tables, according to Thomson Reuters data. It ranked 23rd globally in deals worth $500 million or less. Bank of America generated around 17 percent of its M&A fees from middle market deals, the lowest percentage of any big Wall Street bank except Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Last year, M&A hit a record volume of nearly $5 trillion, due to mega deals like Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA's $106 billion acquisition of SABMiller Plc and oil company Royal Dutch Shell Plc's $70 billion purchase of BG Group Plc. But some Wall Street executives predict blockbuster deals will slow down this year. In January, JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said she expects to see fewer massive mergers and more mid-sized deals.

Bank of America has been hiring salespeople to drum up business, even as it has cut support staff and underperformers as part of a multiyear cost-cutting initiative. Last year alone, it cut more than 10,000 jobs.

The bank laid off a number of investment bankers on Tuesday because of weak markets, one of the sources said.

O Projeto de Decreto Legislativo (PDC), que se aprovado pode gerar um impacto de 300 bilhoes de reais no estoque da divida, estava pautado para esta quarta-feira. O governo havia lancado mao de uma obstrucao para evitar uma derrota caso a proposta fosse votada.

A oposicao, por outro lado, trabalhava para evitar que a CMO aprovasse as contas do governo federal de 2014, o que configuraria uma noticia positiva para o Planalto, dias antes das manifestacoes convocadas contra presidente Dilma Rousseff, no domingo.

Apos o acordo, ficou acertado que o jogo ficaria no zero a zero: o governo abriu mao de ter a noticia positiva nesta quarta, mas tambem evita uma derrota bilionaria no plenario da Camara.

E um bom acordo, e uma vitoria da Casa, disse o lider do governo na Camara, deputado Jose Guimaraes (PT-CE).

A votacao do PDC, que para entrar em vigor precisa ser aprovado pela Camara e depois pelo Senado, esta marcada para a proxima terca-feira, dia seguinte a nova reuniao prevista entre governadores e Executivo Federal.

Pouco antes de selar o trato com a oposicao, Guimaraes e outros aliados fizeram apelos para que o projeto que susta o calculo da divida nao fosse votado.

Faco um apelo para que nos pelo menos esperassemos a conclusao da negociacao com o governo, pediu o lider do governo, seguido do vice-lider Silvio Costa (PtdoB-PE), para quem a aprovacao da materia sera uma pessima sinalizacao ao mercado.

Outros lideres aliados se manifestaram na mesma linha e ate mesmo o deputado Aguinaldo Ribeiro (PP-PB), lider do partido do autor do projeto, Esperidiao Amin (PP-SC), fez coro a Guimaraes, e pediu que a votacao fosse adiada para a proxima terca-feira.

A proposta ja havia sido pautada na semana passada, mas a analise foi adiada para que governadores pudessem negociar o tema com a presidente Dilma Rousseff, na ultima sexta-feira.

O projeto propoe a anulacao da metodologia de calculo estabelecida no Decreto no 8.616, de dezembro do ano passado, que regulamenta a mudanca de indexadores da divida dos Estados e municipios com a Uniao.

Amin criticou as tentativas de acordo promovidas pelo governo com os chefes dos Executivos estaduais, que incluiu a oferta de um alongamento da divida.

Um acordo para alongar uma divida extorsiva, fundanda em indexadores fixados em decreto e nao na lei. Se o decreto fosse aprovado aqui e no Senado, signifca negociar para valer com os Estados e municipios empoderados, e nao mendigos, tendo que ocultar a sua posicao como estao hoje, disse Amin.

Considerando que o Projeto de Decreto Legislativo (PDC) suspende as regras para o calculo do montante da divida, a Uniao ficara sem condicoes de cobrar Estados e municipios, segundo assessoria tecnica da lideranca de governo.

Por se tratar de um PDC, a proposta e sujeita a votacoes na Camara e no Senado, mas nao passa por sancao, ou seja, nao pode ser vetada pela presidente, justamente em um momento em que o governo se esforca para equilibrar as contas publicas.

The opinions expressed are her own.

Theres a glimmer of hope for the humans whose jobs in financial services are under threat from computers that can do their jobs faster and more cheaply. Buyside firms are spending more on paying traders than on technology, a new study shows. But only a select few bankers will beat the rise of the machines.

Asset managers spent an estimated $15.6 billion on trader compensation and technology in 2015, up 4 percent from the previous year, according to Greenwich Associates. The share allocated to paying humans rose by 5 percentage points to 69 percent, with the bulk of the trading staff budget earmarked for actual traders rather than support staff.

The willingness to fork out more money for traders may seem odd when layoffs on bank trading floors are creating a glut of supply. Sales, trading and research headcount in fixed income, currencies, commodities and equities has fallen by 23 percent globally in the past five years, according to analytics firm Coalition. And theres no end in sight to the trend with the likes of Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse announcing more layoffs this year.

Still, not everyone has the skills to land a job in asset management. Buyside firms want traders with a good cross-asset grounding rather than tunnel vision in a world where, for example, what happens to equities or bonds can hinge on swings in oil. The ability to read and deal with increasingly whimsical financial markets is also crucial at a time when 10 percent asset price drops can be quickly followed by gains of the same magnitude. Computers arent necessarily able to anticipate such irrational moves.

Ideal candidates need to twin such skills with the ability to find and access liquidity even in difficult times. Balance sheet constraints have taken a toll on market-making and banks have fewer staff to handle buyside relationships. Also useful will be the ability to process large amounts of data, some ability to programme and a fearless approach to quantitative analysis. The lucky few humans who tick all these boxes can look forward to machines becoming their colleagues, not their usurpers.",[]

SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO During a tour of Zika preparations in Puerto Rico, Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called Zika a ""tremendous challenge and crisis"" and said protecting pregnant women from the virus is a top priority.

In Brazil, Zika has been linked to a spike in cases of microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size and underdeveloped brains.

""Until a few months ago, no one had any idea that Zika could cause birth defects,"" Frieden told reporters Tuesday at a briefing in Puerto Rico's health department.

Frieden has been working with CDC staff and the Puerto Rican government on strategies to protect pregnant from becoming infected with the mosquito-borne virus, which Frieden called a top priority.

In Puerto Rico, the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries Zika is widespread, and Frieden said controlling it will require a multi-pronged approach involving government, municipalities, neighbors, families and society at large.

Cases of Zika are doubling weekly in Puerto Rico, and the CDC expects hundreds of thousands of individuals will become infected, including thousands of pregnant women.

To protect pregnant women, Frieden recommended using insect repellent daily and reliably.

He also suggested adding window screens and air conditioning, where possible. And he called for reducing standing water in and around homes to eliminate mosquito breeding habitats.

Frieden's comments, delivered mostly in Spanish, followed two days of briefings with staff at the CDC's Emergency Operations Center in San Juan. CDC researchers are monitoring the outbreak and studying the best ways to prevent Zika infections through education campaigns, and the distribution of Zika prevention kits for pregnant women.

Much remains unknown about Zika, including whether the virus actually causes microcephaly in babies. Brazil said it has confirmed more than 640 cases of microcephaly, and considers most of them to be related to Zika infections in the mothers. Brazil is investigating more than 4,200 additional suspected cases of microcephaly.

At the CDC's Dengue Branch in Puerto Rico, scientists are conducting research on the most effective mosquito control measures, and processing diagnostic tests from blood samples delivered daily to the laboratory.

Dr. Jorge Munoz, branch director, said in an interview they are capable of processing 400 to 500 blood samples a week. Scientists at the laboratory developed a triple test that can detect Zika, dengue and chikungunya - three different viruses carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito that is endemic in Puerto Rico.

The test will be crucial in helping to quickly sort out whether Zika was the cause of an infection or whether it was dengue and chikungunya, which also cause infection and illness.

""Puerto Rico is in a very different situation from the rest of the United States,"" Frieden told the briefing.

Besides the high density of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, Puerto Rico has a lot of housing without window screens or air conditioning.

""The combination of those two things, when you add Zika in, means the likelihood of a very large number of cases,"" Frieden said.

""In rest of the United States, we may see clusters,"" he said. But if Zika behaves the way chikungunya and dengue have, ""we will not see widespread transmission.""

For the 1930s, the Spanish Civil War, the three-year fight between Fascists (helped by Nazi German) and Republicans (armed by the Soviet Union) pointed to the far larger global disaster to come. For the 1980s, the Soviet battle to control Afghanistan, a bloody mess of occupation and insurgency, helped bring forward the collapse of the Soviet Union and set the stage for 9/11 and modern Islamist militancy.

For the 1990s, you can take your pick of the Balkans, Somalia, Rwanda or Democratic Republic of Congo. For the 2000s, it was Iraq  the ultimate demonstration of the unipolar moment and the limits, dangers and sheer short-livedness of Americas status as unchallenged global superpower.

We are, of course, little more than half way through the current decade. Already, however, it looks as though it has to be Syrias civil war.

In pure human terms, the war dwarfs any other recent conflict. Estimates of the number of Syrian dead range from 270,000 to 470,000 people. The United Nations estimates up to 7.6 million Syrians are displaced within their own country, with up to 4 million fleeing their homeland. From its relatively small beginnings as a largely unarmed revolt, the Syrian conflict has now dragged in more than a half-dozen countries.

Its broader implications continue to grow by the month. While not the sole cause of Europes migrant crisis, Syrians make up a significant proportion  perhaps even the majority  of new arrivals on the continent. The sheer numbers are producing political strains that have already torn up the ideal of a borderless Europe and may yet wreck the entire European Union project.

Syria has exemplified what Financial Times columnist Gideon Rachmann calls a zero-sum world. From the beginning, rival regional powers  particularly Shiite Iran and Sunni states led by Saudi Arabia  approached the conflict with the assumption that neither side could afford to back down or compromise without letting the other win.

From that perspective, Syria is part of a larger regional confrontation that encompasses the war in Yemen, the long-term sectarian battle for control of Iraq and, of course, attempts to rein in Iran, in general, and its nuclear program, in particular.

Increasingly, though, the war in Syria has become part of the wider, potentially more dangerous confrontation between Western powers and Russia. That confrontation also goes back years  through Kosovo and the Balkans to the Cold War.

It also goes well beyond geopolitics to a fundamental disagreement over the limits of state power, the acceptable tools to restore order and the sustainability of authoritarian government. As I wrote in September, Russian President Vladimir Putins entire domestic justification of his power comes down to the importance of maintaining a stable central government as a bulwark against instability and chaos, whatever brutality that might take.

In Syria, Russias military intervention has been a game changer. As in Ukraine in 2014, Moscow has proved itself willing to use a level of military force that the West never anticipated and, as yet, has no real strategy to counter. Nor, for now, has it shown the will or intent to do so.

If the invasion of Iraq showed a United States that saw few real restrictions to its power, Syria has demonstrated the opposite. Washington has continuously prevaricated over what to do about Syria and even now, with Russian action literally redrawing the battlefield, has little in the way of a coherent strategy.

Painting this simply as a tale of Western or U.S. presidential weakness misses the point, however. If Syria shows us anything, it is how complicated the 21st century has become and how few good choices it can leave Washington.

Of course, if the West had signaled more clearly in the Syrian uprisings early days that it would do nothing and let Syrian President Bashar al-Assad slaughter his way back to stability, it might have fatally undermined the rebellion before it started. But this would also have left many in the West feeling distinctly uncomfortable.

Launching massive military strikes against Damascus following its 2013 use of chemical weapons might have helped the credibility of any future Western red lines. But they would also have further undermined what was left of the central government, an outcome now widely seen to have been an error when tried in Iraq and Libya.

The situation on the ground, meanwhile, is ever messier. As in several other recent wars  Iraq, Ukraine, Libya and Yemen  the national armed forces of Syria have become ever less important. Most of the recent fighting is down to relatively disparate militias with increasingly complex loyalties. Already, we have seen U.S.-backed Kurdish forces fighting other U.S.-backed groups, as well as in the growing conflict with Turkey, a U.S. ally.

The one area where the United States and its European allies have been willing to take action has been the fight against Islamic State. That seems reasonable: Of all the elements in the Syrian civil war, Islamic State is by far the most direct threat to Western interests, states and populations. Taking it on is a battle possibly and even likely to be won. Islamic State has already lost significant territory and finances.

That doesnt, however, come close to providing clarity over what to do about the rest of Syria.

As international mediation and ceasefire talks stutter forward, global and regional powers have a choice.

For most of those involved, the truth is that there may still be much to be gained by fighting. Russia could keep up the pressure and win back more territory for Assad and possibly benefit closer to home if the war helped destabilize the European Union. The United States, for that matter, could finally step up and support opposition fighters, which could block any recovery for Assad and drag the Russian mission into a quagmire. Also, regional powers could throw more resources into the battle, something Saudi Arabia seemingly signaled with its talk of sending ground troops to fight Islamic State.

The alternative, though, is that all sides pull back and demonstrate a willingness to compromise. There are plenty of messy issues. The most obvious is the immediate future of Assad and those around him. What exactly the compromise turns out to be might probably be less important than whether or not there is one.

Based on the past few weeks, the signals are mixed, at best. Some local ceasefires have been brokered, though with limited but very real humanitarian benefits for those on the ground.

If ordinary Syrians come to believe the war might genuinely be over one day, they are more likely to stay in the region, which might spark a whole different collection of conflicts.

A deal over Syria would perhaps be the most positive sign that the world could overcome its myriad growing challenges and confrontations. Failing to do so, however, might point to even worse things to come.",[]

South Korea's Lee Sedol, the world's top Go player, speaks during a news conference ahead of matches against Google's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo, in Seoul, South Korea, March 8, 2016.

SEOUL Google's AlphaGo computer program on Wednesday won the first of five matches against one of the world's top players of a complex board game, Go, marking a dramatic advance for the field of artificial intelligence (AI).

South Korean professional player Lee Sedol, the holder of 18 international titles, conceded defeat in a match broadcast live, with one YouTube stream drawing tens of thousands of spectators worldwide, while domestic television gave frequent updates.

""We landed on the moon,"" Demis Hassabis, chief executive and co-founder of Google subsidiary DeepMind, which built AlphaGo, said in a tweet after the victory. ""So proud of the team!""

AlphaGo had made history in October, by becoming the first computer program ever to beat a human professional player at the ancient Asian game, which many experts consider to be the most fiendishly complicated of its kind.

But 33-year-old Lee, a much more challenging opponent, was considered a bigger hurdle for a machine to vanquish.

Lee expressed surprise at his loss.

""I didn't think AlphaGo would play the game in such a perfect manner,"" he told reporters after the match. ""I would like to express my respect to the programmers for making such an amazing program.""

Go, most popular in countries such as China, South Korea and Japan, involves two contestants moving black and white stones on a square grid, with the aim of seizing the most territory.

Experts did not expect an artificial intelligence program to beat a human professional for at least a decade, until AlphaGo's victory last year over player Fan Hui.

""Today's win is symbolic, but nevertheless a very important step,"" said Jang Woo-seok, a research fellow at the Hyundai Research Institute. ""What AlphaGo is doing is essentially cutting down the number of potential moves to consider.""

Google executives say Go offers too many possible moves for a machine to win simply through brute-force calculations, unlike chess, in which IBM's Deep Blue famously beat former world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.

Instead, they said, AlphaGo has sought to approximate human intuition, by studying old matches and using simulated games to hone itself independently.

In recent years, scientists have made strides in getting computers to think and learn in ways approaching those of people, so that artificial intelligence can one day assist in advanced fields, such as healthcare and scientific research.

""The ultimate aim is to use these general-purpose technologies and apply them to all sorts of important real world problems,"" Hassabis said ahead of the match.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 12:29:37+00:00,Russia says repeatedly warned athletes about Sharapova drug,['Reuters Editorial'],"A manufacturing operator works at the Mildronate (Meldonium) medication packaging process in the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, November 23, 2010. Picture taken November 23, 2010.

MOSCOW Russia's athletics federation, facing exclusion from the Rio Olympics over previous doping scandals, said on Wednesday it had repeatedly warned athletes and coaches not to take meldonium, the banned substance used by tennis player Maria Sharapova.

Since former world number one Sharapova admitted using meldonium, Russian sports officials have said a number of other competitors have taken the substance, which is used to treat diabetes and low magnesium, and more names could emerge.

So far none of the Russian sports people named have been involved in track and field, but if any are found to have used the drug it would set back what is already an uphill struggle by Russian athletics to prove it is tackling doping in time for the Rio Games in August this year.

In an announcement entitled: ""To the attention of sports people and coaches,"" the Russian athletics federation, or ARAF, said it was reminding people in the sport yet again that meldonium is on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned list.

""The ARAF has on multiple occasions warned sports people, coaches, and support staff that, since Jan. 1 this year meldonium is included in the list of the banned substances.""

The announcement said on several occasions last year items were posted on the federation's website stating meldonium was banned, the message was also passed on at a conference of coaches last October and at three training camps.

The governing body of world athletics, the IAAF, last year suspended Russian athletics from international competition after a report commissioned by WADA alleged there was a culture of doping in Russian athletics and that sports administrators helped cover up positive tests.

Russian sports officials say they are doing everything asked of them to comply with the IAAF's demands so they can return to competition. But they have only a few months left to get reinstated before the Rio Games.

Dick Pound, author of the report on Russia commissioned by WADA, said on Wednesday that Russia may not make it back in time for Rio.

She's asking for $225,000 (USD) in back pay. The lawsuit alleges that the agency, Trump Model Management, employed Palmer using an H1-B visa, which allows U.S. employers to hire so-called ""specialized"" foreign labor. The agency listed Palmer's salary as ""at least $75,000 per year"" for three years on the application. But the model says she received less than $4000 during that time. Trump, who's had to fend off a number of accusations during his bid for president, is not named in the suit. But his attorney argues that the $75,000 a year figure was simply a guess, not a guarantee. And that the contract required Palmer ""to promptly reimburse"" the agency ""for any and all costs and expenses"". Palmer says those reimbursements amounted to 80 percent of her earnings, which were deducted by the agency. A decision is expected by the end of March.",[]

Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, World Health Organization (WHO) Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation attends a news conference on the Zika virus at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, March 9, 2016.

GENEVA Widespread spraying to eliminate mosquitoes has failed to significantly stop the spread of dengue fever and it may be the same case for the Zika virus linked to neurological disorders, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday.

The emphasis should be put on enlisting families and communities to protect themselves and eliminate from their homes the mosquitoes that carry the disease, which has spread rapidly in Brazil and Latin America, it said.

Releasing genetically modified mosquitoes or irradiating insects also needed to be studied, but evaluation of such novel methods should be done with ""extreme rigor"", the WHO warned.

A three-day meeting of experts set two other top priorities for research: speeding development of tools to diagnose Zika infections and of vaccines to prevent the disease. But they said vaccine trials may come too late for the current outbreak.

WHO Assistant Director General Marie-Paule Kieny said experts had told the meeting that there was no evidence that traditional mosquito control methods had had any significant impact on transmission of dengue, a virus close to Zika.

""This is important because we must be sure that we invest in interventions that work,"" Kieny told a news briefing.

""Certainly it is worth continuing to try to use this method for the lack of other interventions.""

She said the Aedes aegyptii species of mosquito that carries Zika is the ""cockroach of mosquitoes"" because it stays mainly indoors and is hard to eradicate. Efforts to control it needed to be much more targeted to communities and households.

""Then we will see whether it works or not,"" she said.

On Tuesday, the WHO advised pregnant women not to travel to areas with outbreaks of Zika virus due to the potential risk of birth defects, a condition known as microcephaly.

Zika has been linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, another neurological disorder, but neither link has been yet proven.

The most advanced candidate vaccines for Zika are still a few months away from entering early human clinical trials, Kieny said.

""It is therefore possible that vaccines may come late for the current Latin American outbreak, but the development of a vaccine remains an imperative, in particular vaccines suitable for pregnant women and women of child-bearing age,"" she said.

On a catwalk of mirrored spiky columns, designer Nicolas Ghesquiere opened the autumn/winter 2016/2017 show with a black leather coat adorned with golden buttons and cinched at the waist over shiny red leather trousers and combat boots. Similar leather trousers, flared and cropped at the ankle, peppered the show in various colors and were worn with block colored knits or sleek black leather jackets that were zipped at the front. Ghesquiere, who has led a renaissance of the brand known for its monogrammed leather bags, also presented T-shirt-like dresses in block colors -- blue, red, white and black. Silk scarf prints, namely belts and chains, decorated short sleeve tops and skirts combinations. They were worn with black leather sleeves that crept up above the elbow. Looks were layered -- models, who had dark makeup, wore short or quilted jackets over long waist-cinched tops and trousers or colorful knit dresses over floral printed skirts. There were also leather bra-like tops over dresses. The outfits were accessorized with lace-up boots, mostly flat, while handbags came in a variety of shapes, colors and sizes. Some models also wore large black furry hats.

His brother, Charlie (Rod Steiger), lieutenant to a powerful mobster, has ruined Terrys promising boxing career  instructing him to throw a crucial bout so the mob could bet on his opponent. It proved to be the end of Terrys hopes. Near tears, Terry confronts his brother: I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am.

Its a speech Donald Trump will not have to utter. Those who are nominally his mob  that apparently powerless entity called the Republican establishment  tried to get him to throw the bout. He hasnt. And it now seems too late to get him out of the ring. Super Tuesdays results, in which Trump won seven of 11 states, mean he is a contender. Certainly no bum. Class, though, is more debatable.

Trump achieved this through bile, prejudice, insults and money. That was Act I. Act II has followed hard on its heels: No interval. It opened with his news conference in Palm Beach, Florida, as the Super Tuesday results rolled in. Like Benedick in Shakespeares Much Ado about Nothing, who has railed to all who would listen against the entanglements of desire for women, hes suddenly ready for love of Beatrice.

Trump is ready now for love of all. Hes a reacher-out, a generous foe, a unifier. Hes not a bum at all: How could we have thought so?

If a substantial number of Americans view this with trepidation, it cannot match the horror of Europeans. I can think of no major news organization that expresses anything but fear of a Trump presidency. If Democrat Hillary Clinton falters, or the blitz against her that Trump has promised works (shes the one great heretic in his unification church), Europeans and others, who still depend on the United States for stability, protection and a basic shared morality in world affairs, will likely be even more fearful than they are already.

The view has been much rehearsed in the primary season that Trumps mastery of reality TV, his showmanship, his Youre fired! ease of dealing with any and all problems have endeared him to millions determined to see politicians as a lost, even a malign cause. The entertainment-ization of politics has proved overwhelming and pulled the most serious of politicians onto the vaudeville stage.

Look, for an illustration, at a roast of Trump, broadcast by Comedy Central in 2011. It was a dinner devoted to comic insults  harsh, libelous and hilarious  of Trump. The comedian and actor Seth McFarlane issued a stream of putdowns of Trumps monstrous ego  the funniest claimed that, even when having sex with a beautiful woman, Trump was fantasizing about himself. Trump had volunteered for the roasting and, sitting a few feet from MacFarlane, maintained a look of amusement.

In his 1987 autobiography The Art of the Deal  now a necessary read  Trump wrote, Good publicity is preferable to bad, but from a bottom-line perspective, bad publicity is sometimes better than no publicity at all. Controversy, in short, sells.

One reason Trump accepted to be roasted was that he was considering running for president in 2012. He didnt. But that was just a postponement.

In March 2014, President Barack Obama, perhaps following the same thinking, appeared on the popular web program Between Two Ferns. Host Zach Galifianakis conducted a mocking interview. He asked Obama, for example, how he would feel when he left the presidency and people wouldnt let him win at basketball any more. Galifianakis made an elaborate display of boredom when the president spoke about the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. (Is this what they mean by drones?) Both Fox News on the right and Stephen Colbert on the left accused Obama of demeaning the presidency. Meanwhile, the program has gotten (to date) 13.5 million views on YouTube. This is what matters to the White House communications people.

Trump knew  and the White House learned  that ritual, high-profile disrespect can work to the advantage of the disrespected. It shows they can take a joke, and so are rounded people. In a way, its a tribute to their status. It makes them look cool, especially to the young.

Norman Mailer, in his 1963 book The Presidential Papers, wrote, Politics is arithmetic, but politics is also rhetoric, passion and an occasional idea to fire the imagination of millions. He expressed despair that then-President John F. Kennedy (not the least charismatic of the occupiers of the Oval Office, one would think), was too wedded to arithmetic. Mailer was probably not thinking about someone like Trump. (He would be thinking, as ever, more about himself.) But Trump is the one who fits his bill.

Trump has expressed passion  or at least convincingly acted passionately  about a number of ideas: deporting what he calls criminal, rape-inclined Mexicans; temporarily barring Muslims from entering the United States; repealing Obamacare and bringing in something much better.

In The Art of the Deal, he writes, I play to peoples fantasies ... a very effective form of promotion.

This is why he appeals to people. He is where he is because people vote for him  sometimes tongue in cheek, but often because it seems that his aggression, desire to be the best and wealth will be at their service. Trump isnt a politician, has no experience in elected office and enjoys the support of President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Yay! Hes not one of them.

As one Trump supporter, Ken Magno of Everett, Massachusetts, said: This isnt about whether hes going to do a better job or not. More or less, its the statement: Listen, were sick and tired of what you people do. And were going to put somebody in there  now that its our choice, were going to put somebody in there that basically you dont like.

A sizable part of America, many millions strong, is putting the finger up to the political class  right and left. They are responding to what Mailer thought he was calling for  passion, rhetoric, new ideas, firing the imagination of millions.

Having done all that, the nomination is Trumps to lose. Its more and more likely that hell be in a face-off with a woman who can do the arithmetic but finds showmanship far harder.",[]

The move follows complaints from local seeds companies that Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India)(MMB), a Monsanto joint venture with India's Mahyco, was charging high royalties. This prompted India's farm ministry to form a panel to look into the matter, whose recommendation the government has now accepted.

MMB has filed a case in a Delhi court, challenging the authority of the panel to determine the trade fee agreed upon by MMB and a number of Indian seed companies.

As well as cutting the royalties, the government also capped GM cotton seed prices at 800 rupees for a packet of 400 grams after appeals by some state governments and farmers to lower the rate of the Bt variety that commands 90 percent of the market.

Bt cotton seeds are being sold at between 830 and 1,100 rupees per packet in different parts of the country.

The government's move came after Monsanto threatened on Friday to pull out of the country and hold off new technology if the government forced a big cut in its payments from Indian seed companies.

India's Mahyco and U.S.-based Monsanto launched a GM cotton variety in India in 2002, helping transform the country into the world's top producer and second-largest exporter of the fiber.

Separately, the Competition Commission of India, the antitrust regulator, last month said there were indications that MMB had abused its dominant position in the country and asked its director general to complete an investigation within two months.

The cause of the blast was not immediately known. Fire investigators were working to determine the cause, and gas workers were checking to see if gas was involved, officials said. Eight firefighters and one battalion chief were taken to a local hospital with minor injuries, according to Seattle Fire Department spokeswoman Corey Orvold. The explosion occurred at 1:43 a.m. local time, leveling a restaurant and convenience store and heavily damaging a coffee shop, Orvold said. Businesses across the street also were hit. At about 6 a.m. local time Seattle Fire Chief Harold Scoggins told reporters there was still an active gas leak and fire at the site but the public was not in danger.

SEOUL North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast city of Wonsan early on Thursday, flying approximately 500 km (300 miles), South Korea's military said.

North Korea has a large stockpile of short-range missiles and is developing long-range and intercontinental missiles.

Reports of the missiles being fired coincide with already heightened tension on the Korean peninsula after the North conducted its fourth nuclear test in January and launched a long-range rocket last month, leading to new U.N. Security Council and bilateral U.S. sanctions.

The North fired six rockets into the sea last week using a multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) from Wonsan, supervised by leader Kim Jong Un who ordered his military to be prepared to launch pre-emptive attacks against enemies.

Kim said on Wednesday his country has miniaturized nuclear warheads to mount on ballistic missiles and ordered improvements in the power and precision of its arsenal in his first direct comment about nuclear warhead miniaturization.

State Department spokesman John Kirby declined to comment on Kim's claim to have miniaturized nuclear warheads and accused him of ""provocative rhetoric.""

""I'd say the young man needs to pay more attention to the North Korean people and taking care of them than in pursuing these sorts of reckless capabilities,"" Kirby said.

The Pentagon said this week it had not seen North Korea demonstrate a capability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead. But Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the department was working on U.S. ballistic missile defenses to be prepared.

North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 but its claim to have set off a miniaturized hydrogen bomb has been disputed by the U.S. and South Korean governments and many experts.

U.S. and South Korean troops began large-scale military drills this week, which the North called ""nuclear war moves"" and threatened to respond with an all-out offensive.

reuters.com,2016-03-07 13:42:38+00:00,U.S. Commerce Department to place restrictions on China's ZTE,['Steve Stecklow'],"Visitors check out products at the ZTE stand at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, February 24, 2014.

LONDON The U.S. Commerce Department is set to place export restrictions on Chinese telecoms equipment maker ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) for alleged violations of U.S. export controls on Iran, according to documents seen by Reuters.

The restrictions will make it difficult for the company to acquire U.S. products by requiring ZTE's suppliers to apply for an export license before shipping any American-made equipment or parts to ZTE. According to a Commerce Department notice that will be published next week in the U.S. Federal Register, the license applications generally will be denied.

The restrictions will take effect Tuesday, Reuters has learned, and apply to any company worldwide that wants to ship American-made products to ZTE Corp in China. Those companies are not the target of the export curbs on ZTE.

""This is a significant new burden on trade with ZTE,"" a senior official at the Commerce Department told Reuters. The official declined to comment on whether the U.S. government might take further action against ZTE.

The company can appeal against the action.

ZTE, based in the southern Chinese boomtown of Shenzhen, said in a statement on Sunday that it was aware of media reports on U.S. export restrictions.

""ZTE is highly concerned about recent media reports relating to a U.S. Department of Commerce investigation,"" the company said. ""ZTE has been working with associated U.S. government departments on investigations since 2012 and maintains constant communication with associated departments and is committed to fully address and resolve any concerns.""

Trade in shares in ZTE, which also sells consumer electronic devices such as smartphones in the United States, was suspended on Monday in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The company did not offer an explanation.

""We believe the restrictions, if implemented, will cause significant supply problems to ZTE,"" Jefferies analyst Cynthia Meng wrote in a note, adding that ZTE has major trading relationships with several U.S. companies including Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and IBM (IBM.N).

Telecoms equipment and terminal businesses combined account for 80 percent of ZTE's total revenue of 2015, Meng said. The company's revenue for last year was expected to rise 23.8 percent to a record high of 100.8 billion yuan ($15.47 billion), preliminary results showed.

ALLEGED VIOLATIONS

The Commerce Department investigated ZTE for alleged export-control violations following reports by Reuters in 2012 that the company had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars worth of hardware and software from some of America's best-known technology companies to Iran's largest telecoms carrier, Telecommunication Co of Iran (TCI), and a unit of the consortium that controls it.

The U.S. companies, which included Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), IBM (IBM.N), Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and Dell Inc [DI.UL], have all said they were not aware of the Iranian contracts. It is not clear if any of the companies still do business with ZTE.

Washington has long banned the sale of United States-made technology products to Iran. The Commerce Department's investigation focused on whether ZTE had acquired American products through front companies and then shipped them to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.

Commerce Department investigators obtained internal ZTE documents - some of which had been marked by the company as ""Top Secret"" - outlining an alleged sanctions-busting scheme. Reuters reviewed some of the documents.

The senior Commerce Department official declined to comment on whether ZTE had implemented that scheme.

The ZTE statement did not provide comment relating to the documents.

The day after the first Reuters article was published in March 2012, a ZTE spokesman said the company would ""curtail"" its business in Iran. The company later issued a statement saying: ""ZTE no longer seeks new customers in Iran and limits business activities with existing customers.""

BUSINESS IMPACT

What effect the new export restrictions will have on ZTE's global business is not clear.

One undated internal ZTE document obtained by Commerce Department investigators and reviewed by Reuters states: ""Our company has many technologies and components that came from suppliers in the U.S ... Lots of chips or software used in the products of our company are from U.S. suppliers.""

One of ZTE's websites also states that several leading U.S. technology companies, including Microsoft, Intel Corp (INTC.O), IBM and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), are ""key strategic partners of ZTE"". The terms of the partnerships are not described.

A spokeswoman for Microsoft said the company had a licensing agreement with ZTE but could not confirm if the Chinese company purchases other products, such as software. The other U.S. companies did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

The undated internal ZTE document also describes a proposal overseen by the company's legal department that describes ways to export American products subject to U.S. sanctions by using shell companies to avoid getting caught.

""The biggest advantage"" of one method is that it will make it ""harder for the U.S. government to trace it or investigate the real flow of the controlled commodities"", the document states.

In its planned action against ZTE, the Commerce Department cites the proposal, stating that the company ""planned and organized a scheme to establish, control and use a series of 'detached' companies to illicitly re-export controlled items to Iran in violation of U.S. export control laws"". It is not clear if the alleged scheme was implemented.

'TOP SECRET'

Another internal ZTE document from August 2011 that discusses ""U.S. export control risks"" facing the company allegedly was signed by several top ZTE officials, including Shi Lirong, its president.

The document, marked by the company ""Top Secret"" and ""No spreading abroad without permission of ZTE"", begins ""Dear company leaders"".

It states that ZTE ""has ongoing projects in all five major embargoed countries - Iran, Sudan, North Korea, Syria and Cuba"", adding that ""all of these projects depend on U.S.-procured items to some extent, so export control obstacles have arisen"".

The document goes on to cite ""other risks"" to ZTE, including its operations in the United States.

""R&D employees at the U.S. Research Centers often travel between China and the U.S., carrying R&D data,"" it states, in an apparent reference to research and development. ""This already severely violates the law.""

The document does not specify what law may have been violated.

The company ""needs to take preventative measures immediately, otherwise will face the risk of being investigated anytime"", the document states.

The document also states that ZTE's Iran project ""can potentially put us at risk of being put on the Blacklist by the U.S.,"" and that such an eventuality could leave the company facing ""the risk of losing the supply chain of U.S. products"".

ZTE Corp is one of the world's largest telecoms equipment makers with operations in 160 countries, according to its website. It also is a major manufacturer of mobile handsets. Founded in 1985, its shares trade on both the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock markets.

Besides ZTE, the export curbs will apply to two of its Chinese affiliates, ZTE Kangxun Telecommunications Ltd and Beijing 8-Star, and an Iranian company, ZTE Parsian.

Until the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, the use of performance enhancing drugs helped East Germany win hundreds of medals at the summer and winter Olympic Games amid fierce Cold War competition with West Germany.

An estimated 8,000-9,000 athletes were on the doping program from 1972-1989, the overwhelming majority without their knowledge.

The government on Wednesday said it had approved the drafting of a law for a one-off payment of 10,500 euros ($11,500) per eligible doping victim and expected several times more cases than the 194 beneficiaries of the first scheme in 2002.

""Today we take a step closer to our target of a renewal of the fund for GDR (East German) doping victims,"" German Interior Minister Thomas De Maiziere said in a statement.

""Given the difficult fate and bad health of many of the GDR doping victims speed is of essence,"" he said, adding he hoped to start paying out by the second half of the year.

In 2002 the German government paid out a similar amount to 194 athletes but not all those eligible came forward at the time, with many seeing the effects of doping on their health only much later.

The former East Germany's embrace of doping triggered a rapid improvement in results, with the country of 17 million almost doubling its gold medal tally from one Olympics to the next.

In the Olympic Games from 1972 to 1988, despite a boycott of the 1984 Los Angeles Games, East Germany won 384 medals. It was second in the medals table in three of the four Games in which it took part.

Today up to 2,000 former athletes are seriously ill, suffering from tumors, heart defects, infertility, depression, bulimia, and circulation and spinal problems. Some have died, others are waiting to see what health problems their children have inherited.

The launch of the fund to compensate the victims of past doping comes as athletics finds itself in the midst of one of the worst doping and corruption scandals in the sport's history.

The chairman of Parliament's Business, Innovation and Skills Committee, Iain Wright, said in a letter made public on Wednesday that Ashley had not responded to a request to attend parliament to answer questions, nor agreed in principle to attend.

""Should you fail in your reply to agree to attend on one of the dates offered to you, or a mutually convenient alternative before 1 June, the Committee reserves the right to take the matter further, including seeking the support of the House of Commons in respect of any complaint of contempt,"" Wright said in the letter to Ashley dated March 3.

Sports Direct has come under fire for its employment practices and a newspaper investigation last year said that lengthy security checks of workers at its main warehouse in Shirebrook, central England, meant that some were effectively paid less than the legal minimum wage.

The company, which denied the allegations, launched a review of working conditions at the site, where many staff are supplied by agencies.

Ashley, who owns English Premier League football club Newcastle United as well as 55 percent of Sports Direct's equity, would oversee the review, the company said in December.

A spokesman for Sports Direct said that Ashley had previously invited members of the Committee to attend Shirebrook to see for themselves the company's working practices.

""That invitation remains open,"" the spokesman said. ""Mike will respond to the committee's recent letter in due course.""

Wright acknowledged Ashley's offer to meet the committee at the Shirebrook site but said the request had been turned down because it did not comply with the MPs' commitment to transparency.

Parliament can in theory order a person's imprisonment for contempt, although its powers on contempt actions are untested in recent times, according to a government paper published in 2012.

Iranian state television showed footage of two Qadr missiles being launched from northern Iran, which the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said hit targets 1,400 km (870 miles) away.

Iranian agencies said the missiles were stamped with the Hebrew words, ""Israel should be wiped from the pages of history,"" though the inscription could not be seen on any photographs.

Clinton, a former secretary of state under President Barack Obama, said she was ""deeply concerned"" by the tests, the second round of Iranian missile launches in two days.

""Iran should face sanctions for these activities and the

international community must demonstrate that Iran's threats

toward Israel will not be tolerated,"" said Clinton, who is ahead in the race to be Democratic nominee at the Nov. 8 presidential elections.

Her call for sanctions reflected a tougher line against Iran's recent missile activity than that taken so far by the White House, which said it is aware of and reviewing reports of the Iranian tests, and would determine an appropriate response.

""We know that Iran is in a season of carrying out a number of military activities, and so it certainly would not be a surprise if there are additional launches over the next several days,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

The Iranian move on Wednesday came despite warning from the U.S. State Department after Tuesday's missile tests that Washington continues to ""aggressively apply our unilateral tools

to counter threats from Iran's missile programme,"" a possible reference to additional U.S. sanctions.

Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Wednesday with Iran's foreign minister about the test-firing of two ballistic missiles, a State Department spokesman said.

The missile tests underline a rift in Iran between hard-line factions opposed to normalizing relations with the West, and

President Hassan Rouhani's relatively moderate government, which is trying to attract foreign investors to Iran.

ISRAEL IN MIND

Iran's IRGC said the missiles tested on Wednesday were designed with Israel in mind.

""The reason we designed our missiles with a range of 2,000 km is to be able to hit our enemy the Zionist regime from a safe distance,"" Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by the ISNA agency. The nearest point in Iran is around 1,000 km (600 miles) from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon told Israel Radio the tests showed Iran's hostility had not changed since implementing a nuclear deal with world powers in January, despite Rouhani's overtures to the West.

""To my regret there are some in the West who are misled by the honeyed words of part of the Iranian leadership while the other part continues to procure equipment and weaponry, to arm terrorist groups,"" Yaalon said.

Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee, said: Iran is making a mockery of President Obamas vow to confront Irans dangerous and illicit acts.

He urged Obama to ""aggressively enforce all sanctions against Irans missile programs, support for terrorism and human rights abuses. No more looking the other way.

Washington imposed sanctions against businesses and individuals in January over another missile test in October 2015. But the IRGC said it would not bow to pressure.

""The more sanctions and pressure our enemies apply ... the more we will develop our missile programme,"" Hajizadeh said on state television.

The IRGC maintains dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles, the largest stock in the Middle East. It says they are solely for defensive use with conventional, non-nuclear warheads.

Tehran has denied U.S. accusations of acting ""provocatively,"" citing the long history of U.S. interventions in the Middle East and its own right to self-defence.

The swift response on the heels of Sharapova's announcement on Monday signaled a change in attitude among high-profile corporate backers following a series of doping and corruption scandals in world sports.

""We're now entering a zero tolerance era for sponsors,"" said Rupert Pratt, co-founder of sports sponsorship agency Generate. ""It is now seen as not acceptable to 'stand by your man' because of the amount of scrutiny corporates are now under.""

Sharapova's failed drug test at January's Australian Open, one of four annual Grand Slam events, will likely lead to a ban for the 28-year-old Russian. The International Tennis Federation's anti-doping program calls for a four-year suspension for a positive test. That ban can be reduced in various circumstances, such as if the player shows no significant fault or negligence.

Loss of sponsor income would be costly for Sharapova, a five-time Grand Slam winner who earned $29.7 million last year, according to Forbes magazine, most of it from endorsements, appearances and royalties rather than victories on court.

Sharapova, who lit up women's tennis when she won Wimbledon in 2004 as a 17-year-old, is still ranked among the top players. She was the world's highest-paid female athlete last year for the 11th consecutive year, and Forbes put her off-court career earnings at more than $200 million.

Fellow athletes had mixed reactions to Sharapova's announcement that she had tested positive for meldonium, a drug she said she had been taking for a decade to treat diabetes and low magnesium.

The substance, recently banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), boosts blood flow and can enhance athletic performance. Sharapova, who lives in the United States, is at least the seventh athlete in a month to test positive for meldonium. It is widely available in Eastern Europe but not approved for use in the United States.

""She's ready to take full responsibility and I think that showed a lot of courage and a lot of heart,"" Serena Williams, the top-ranked player in women's tennis, told reporters at a briefing ahead of a game in New York on Tuesday.

Others were not so sympathetic.

""I'm extremely angry and disappointed. I had to lose my career and never opted to cheat no matter what,"" tweeted former world No. 1 Jennifer Capriati, in a long series of posts attacking Sharapova.

Aries Merritt, a U.S. hurdler, said there was no excuse for Sharapova to be unaware that WADA added meldonium to its latest list of banned drugs effective Jan. 1, which it circulated to competitors.

""As an athlete it is your responsibility to always know what's being placed on the banned list. Period,"" said Merritt at the U.S. Olympic Committee summit in Los Angeles.

Former U.S. Olympic swimmer Aaron Peirsol told Reuters there was some confusion over meldonium. ""It wasn't even anything that was illegal until the beginning of this year,"" he said. ""You have a bunch of people taking stuff that the athletes probably don't even know (is illegal)... it becomes gray.""

Sharapova said she had not read an email informing her that meldonium was banned for use in sport.

She will be provisionally suspended from playing tennis from March 12 and could be prevented from competing for Russia at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics this year.

SOME SPONSORS ON THE FENCE

Sharapova's deal with Tag Heuer, owned by French luxury goods group LVMH (LVMH.PA), expired at the end of 2015, and the company said on Tuesday it had dropped renewal talks in view of her announcement.

Nike Inc (NKE.N), the world's biggest sportswear brand, and German luxury car maker Porsche, a unit of Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), have said they are suspending their relationship with Sharapova as they gather more information and wait for a decision on a ban.

A person close to Sharapova told Reuters her team was encouraged that none of the sponsors so far have said they were terminating contracts with the player, although they had the right to do so.

""Suspension means to put on hold,"" the source said, requesting anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the situation. ""Under the circumstances we're very pleased that everybody is willing to stand by and see what facts come out instead of terminating.""

Danone SA (DANO.PA), the maker of Evian water, a longtime Sharapova sponsor, said on Tuesday it would monitor developments. Avon Products Inc (AVP.N), another sponsor, declined to comment on its endorsements.

Brian Socolow, an expert in sports law and a partner at Loeb & Loeb LLP, said Nike's quick suspension was no surprise after its long support for now-disgraced U.S. cyclist Lance Armstrong.

But he said Sharapova may yet win back sponsors. ""She has the chance, like other athletes, to redeem herself and regain her leadership position as an endorser,"" said Socolow. ""She will have to demonstrate that it was an honest mistake and there are no other improper reasons she took the drug.""

There was some scepticism about the sponsors' motives from tennis fans on social media.

Ben Stanley (@BDStanley) tweeted on Tuesday, ""Nike is in the business of making money, not offering moral guidance. If it paid to keep Sharapova on, they'd do it.""

reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:54:04+00:00,Peru bars Fujimori's biggest rival from presidential race,['Mitra Taj'],"Peru's presidential candidate Julio Guzman attends a news conference after the Special Jury of Elections, which approves presidential tickets, accepted a citizen's petition to declare Guzman's candidacy 'inadmissible' for the upcoming April elections, in Lima March 4, 2016....

LIMA Peru's electoral board kicked the main rival to presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori out of the race on a technicality on Wednesday, removing the front-runner's biggest obstacle to winning the office once held by her jailed father.

Fujimori, a center-right career politician and daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori, looks all but certain to win the April 10 first round after the board's 3-2 decision against centrist technocrat Julio Guzman but she cannot be sure of securing the 50 percent needed to win outright.

The National Jury of Elections ruled Guzman cannot take part in the elections because his party failed to comply with electoral procedures when registering its presidential ticket.

Guzman had been the only candidate seen coming close to tying with Fujimori in a run-off vote, but voters could still punish her in the second round if they feel Guzman and another candidate, Cesar Acuna, were pushed unfairly from the race.

The election winner would replace President Ollanta Humala, whose five year term ends this year.

Guzman, little known just months ago, vowed to keep campaigning while exhausting all legal avenues to get reinstated. He also heaped pressure on the electoral board to bar four other candidates, including Fujimori, from the contest, citing similar questions over compliance with election rules.

""If their cases are not treated with the same criteria, the current election and potential elected authorities will be illegitimate,"" Guzman said in a statement.

Fujimori's opponents accuse her and her running mate of illegally dishing out gifts and prizes to voters while campaigning - accusations she called ""absurd.""

The electoral board also rejected wealthy former governor and center-left populist Acuna's appeal to stay in the race after he gave cash to poor voters while campaigning, in violation of a new law.

Acuna, who had sunk to fourth place amid allegations of plagiarism, said he accepted the decision even though he thought it was undemocratic. Unlike Guzman, Acuna's party can still take part in elections and win congressional seats.

Recent opinion polls indicated the quarter of votes that Guzman and Acuna expected to draw in the first round would be split among several candidates, with Fujimori and former prime minister Pedro Pablo Kuczynski benefiting most.

'HORRIBLE PRECEDENT'

Guzman said he would launch an ""extraordinary"" appeal before the electoral board, a move constitutional lawyers said was unlikely to succeed. Guzman said a delegation from the Organization of American States was traveling to Peru on Monday.

He said he would also seek the intervention of the local courts as well as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, processes that could take months.

Guzman's candidacy bounced between electoral boards for more than a month, exasperating many Peruvians and stoking suspicions of foul play. The electoral board chief, who voted in favor of admitting Guzman, said last month he had received death threats.

Peru's electoral board has not sparked so much controversy since 2000, when it let Alberto Fujimori run for a third term despite a constitutional ban. Fujimori is now serving a 25-year jail sentence for ordering death squads to conduct massacres in the fight to quash a leftist insurgency and for corruption.

""No modern democracy excludes major presidential candidates...for breaking minor rules,"" said Harvard University political scientist Steve Levitsky. ""It's a horrible precedent.""

On the streets of Lima, many voters said Guzman and Acuna deserved to be excluded for breaking rules, but their supporters said that they felt cheated and would spoil their ballots. Voting is mandatory in Peru.

""It's not fair. Supposedly this is a democracy and everyone can take part,"" said Carlos Ortega, a 39-year-old engineer who had intended to vote for Acuna. ""If this continues, the only one left will be Keiko.""

Soon after in the occupied West Bank, Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian who tried to stab them, the military said.

The attacks came a day after an American tourist was killed in Tel Aviv by a Palestinian who went on a stabbing spree on the beachfront while Biden met former Israeli President Shimon Peres blocks away.

On Twitter, Biden called it a ""tragic attack ... taking the life of an American"" and said ""there is no justification for such acts of terror"". There was no immediate comment from Palestinian authorities.

Since October, Palestinian stabbings, shootings and car rammings have killed 28 Israelis and two U.S. citizens. Israeli forces have killed at least 179 Palestinians, 121 of whom Israel says were assailants. Most others were shot dead during violent protests.

After several days in which the violence largely subsided, a series of attacks erupted after Biden arrived in Israel on Tuesday.

Israel's national police chief said he saw no direct connection between Biden's trip and the surge in attacks.

TALKS

Biden held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Wednesday and was due to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank later in the day.

U.S. officials said Biden would discuss with Netanyahu a new 10-year military aid package to Israel currently under negotiation, as well as the situation in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East. They warned against any expectations of a breakthrough on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, stalled since 2014, in Biden's meetings with Netanyahu and Abbas.

The incident in Jerusalem on Wednesday began when gunfire ran out near a commuter bus, though no one was hurt and the vehicle was not hit, a police spokesman said.

Several minutes later, two Palestinians in a car, believed by police to have tried to attack the bus, opened fire near the Damascus Gate entrance to Jerusalem's Old City, the scene of multiple attacks over the past five months.

One man, who was not immediately identified, was critically wounded by the Palestinian gunfire and police shot and killed the two assailants, the spokesman said.

The U.S. State Department identified the American killed on Tuesday as Taylor Force, a 28-year-old graduate student at Vanderbilt University's Owen School of Management who was on a trip to Israel organised by the school.

The past five months of bloodshed have been fuelled by various factors, including a dispute over Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque compound and the failure of several rounds of peace talks to secure the Palestinians an independent state in Israeli-occupied territory.

LOS ANGELES ""The Matrix"" filmmaker Lilly Wachowski, formerly known as Andy, came out as a transgender woman on Tuesday, four years after her sister Lana Wachowski revealed she was a transgender woman.

Lilly Wachowski, 48, said in a statement in Chicago's Windy City Times that she decided to make her gender reassignment public after a journalist from Britain's DailyMail asked her for an interview to tell her story. Wachowski said other reporters have approached her agents in the past to ask about her transition.

""I knew at some point I would have to come out publicly. You know, when you're living as an out transgender person it's ... kind of difficult to hide. I just wanted  needed some time to get my head right, to feel comfortable. But apparently I don't get to decide this,"" Wachowski wrote.

In an emailed statement on Wednesday, a spokesperson for the DailyMail.com said it did not try to pressure Wachowski into revealing her gender transition.

""As Ms Wachowski herself says, we were not the first media organization to approach her and we made absolutely clear at several points in the conversation that we were only interested in reporting the story if and when she was happy for us to do so and with her cooperation,"" the spokesperson said.

Lily Wachowski's sister Lana, 50, formerly known as Larry, came out publicly as a transgender woman in 2012.

In her statement, Lilly Wachowski touched on the struggles faced by the transgender community, and said that while progress has been made, ""we continue to be demonized and vilified in the media where attack ads portray us as potential predators to keep us from even using the goddamn bathroom.""

""So yeah, I'm transgender. And yeah, I've transitioned,"" she said, adding that she is out to her wife, family and friends.

The Wachowskis, who are private about their lives and rarely give interviews, have carved a reputation with ""The Matrix"" franchise, ""V for Vendetta"" and, most recently, Netflix's sci-fi series ""Sense8.""

Workers erect scaffolding to build a stage at the venue of World Culture Festival on the banks of the river Yamuna in New Delhi, March 8, 2016.

NEW DELHI Environmentalists are aghast that a huge cultural festival is to be held on the floodplain of Delhi's main river from Friday, warning that the event, and the 3.5 million visitors expected, will devastate the area's biodiversity.

The ""World Culture Festival"", organised by one of India's best-known spiritual gurus, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, spreads across 1,000 acres (400 hectares) on the banks of the Yamuna. It features a 7-acre stage for 35,000 musicians and dancers, newly built dirt tracks and 650 portable toilets.

Green groups accuse organisers of ripping up vegetation and ruining the river's fragile ecosystem by damaging its bed and disrupting water flows. They want authorities to cancel the event and avert further harm.

""This land is not meant for any of those things. The biodiversity of the land has been completely destroyed,"" said Anand Arya, one of several environmentalists who petitioned India's top green court.

""Where will the sewage and the excrement go? All across the floodplains!"" he said, adding that the waste left by visitors would endanger a nearby bird sanctuary.

The National Green Tribunal on Wednesday ruled that the event could go ahead but fined Ravi Shankar's Art of Living Foundation 50 million rupees ($744,000) to help restore the area, media reported.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a yoga devotee like Ravi Shankar, was due to attend Friday's opening, but it is not clear whether he will do so after the event sparked such uproar - and not just among environmentalists.

Delhi police have warned of ""utter chaos"" at the event unless safety lapses are tackled, the Indian Express said, citing a March 1 letter to the federal government saying the stage lacked a structural stability certificate.

Farmers who plough the banks of the river amid Delhi's urban sprawl also accused organisers of forcing them off the land.

Ravi Shankar, who enjoys a cult following, has rejected the criticism, saying he should be rewarded for hosting the event beside one of India's most polluted rivers.

Saraswati Akshama Nath, the lawyer for his organisation, said approvals, including safety certificates, had been given in December before construction began, and the structures would be removed after the three-day festival ends.

""Consent was given to us by all the authorities,"" she told Reuters. ""We have only used eco-friendly material.""

At the site, builders were scrambling to complete what they say is the world's biggest ever performing stage. It can accommodate a symphony orchestra of 8,500 and 20,000 performers, said Prasana Prabhu, a trustee of Ravi Shankar's foundation.

The 5,200-square-metre facility in Taizhou, China, is to be completed by mid-2016 and will produce complete seating systems for a small crossover utility vehicle, said Magna, which held an investor day in Toronto on Wednesday.

Ontario-based Magna, which earns about half its revenue outside North America, has a customer list that includes General Motors Co (GM.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Ford Motor Co (F.N).

Despite strong growth opportunities outside Canada, Magna Chief Executive Don Walker said he still sees great scope for the company to expand around its Ontario home base.

That is especially true if the provincial and federal governments make an effort to keep auto assembly plants in the province, while also providing incentives to attract new ones, he said.

""In my opinion, the governments should be focused on keeping the assembly plants here,"" said Walker, in an interview after the investor day in Toronto. ""A lot of jobs are tied to a geographic region around the assembly plants, so if the assembly plants are kept here, then hopefully the employment in the auto sector will stay.""

Walker said Magna has roughly 140,000 employees including about 20,000 in Ontario. It cut back like everybody else during the 2008-09 downturn, but has since restored employment to pre-crisis levels, he said.

If the government contributes $100 million to a $400 million investment in an assembly plant, it can pay out in a big way over the long run, said Walker.

""If you look at all the tax that goes to the government in payroll taxes and everything else, if they spend $100 million ... they can recoup all of that money in two or three years and they continue to keep that revenue for the long-term,"" he said.

""They are crazy not to do that, even if it may not be popular,"" he added.

Washington/Hamburg Volkswagen droht in den USA noch mehr Arger: Das US-Justizministerium weite seine Ermittlungen aus und gehe nun auch dem Verdacht des Bankbetrugs nach, sagte eine mit den Vorgangen vertraute Person der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters.

Das ""Wall Street Journal"" berichtete zudem unter Berufung auf Insider, in diesem Zusammenhang gehe es auch um mogliche Verstoe gegen Steuergesetze. Analysten rechnen nun mit zusatzlichen Strafzahlungen fur VW. Volkswagen auerte sich am Mittwoch dazu nicht. Ein Sprecher bekraftigte, man werde bei den Ermittlungen weiter mit allen zustandigen US-Behorden kooperieren.

Das 1989 fur Ermittlungen gegen groe Geldhauser konzipierte US-Gesetz gegen Bankbetrug erlaubt es, unter bestimmten Bedingungen einem Verdacht im Zeitraum der vergangenen zehn Jahre nachzugehen. Es wurde unter anderem in Fallen rund um Autokredit-Anbieter angewandt. Laut ""Wall Street Journal"" ermittelt das US-Justizministerium, ob Kreditgeber bei der Finanzierung von Fahrzeugen mit manipulierten Abgaswerten geschadigt wurden.

VW ist in den USA wegen Verstoen gegen Umweltgesetze bereits mit hohen Strafandrohungen konfrontiert. Es steht eine Strafe von bis zu 46 Milliarden Dollar im Raum. Die Summe durfte nach Einschatzung von Juristen allerdings deutlich niedriger ausfallen, wie fruhere Falle vermuten lassen. Experten schatzen, dass der Abgasskandal einschlielich Schadensersatzzahlungen VW am Ende mehr als 30 Milliarden Euro kosten konnte.

BISLANG 80.000 KLAGER IN EUROPA

In den USA sind bereits mehr als 500 Sammelklagen eingegangen. Auch immer mehr Autobesitzer in Europa schlieen sich offenbar einem geplanten Sammelverfahren gegen den Konzern an. Die Zahl sei seit Januar von rund 60.000 auf etwa 80.000 gestiegen, sagte Rechtsanwalt Julius Reiter, dessen Kanzlei die Klage gegen Volkswagen in Deutschland organisiert, die uber eine niederlandische Stiftung gefuhrt wird. Die meisten Klager seien osterreichische Fahrzeugbesitzer. Reiter betonte: ""Wir streben eine auergerichtliche Einigung mit VW an.""

Nach der Allianz zieht nun auch die Dekabank gegen Volkswagen vor Gericht. Finanzkreisen zufolge beteiligt sich das Wertpapierhaus der Sparkassen an der selben Sammelklage wie die Allianz-Tochter Allianz Global Investors (AGI). Die Deka ist nach Reuters-Daten elftgroter VW-Aktionar und halt einen Anteil von 0,6 Prozent. Damit bringen sich immer mehr Profi-Investoren in Deutschland gegen den Autobauer in Stellung. Sie werfen VW vor, uber die weit verbreitete Manipulation zu spat informiert zu haben. Beim Landgericht Braunschweig liegen bereits mehrere Klagen von Privatanlegern, die wegen des drastischen Kursverfalls der VW-Aktie Schadensersatz fur erlittene Kursverluste verlangen.

Die VW-Aktie verlor zeitweise mehr als vier Prozent, grenzte ihre Verluste spater aber ein. Am Nachmittag drehte das Papier ins Plus. Die negativen Nachrichten zum ""Dieselgate"" hatten in den vergangenen Tagen zugenommen, erklarte DZ Bank Analyst Michael Punzet. ""Mogliche weitere finanziellen Belastungen konnten zu einer starkeren Dividendenkurzung als vom Markt angenommen fuhren."" Er bekraftigte seine Verkaufsempfehlung fur die VW-Aktie. Seit Jahresbeginn hat das Papier rund 16 Prozent an Wert verloren, der Leitindex Dax kommt im gleichen Zeitraum auf ein Minus von knapp zehn Prozent. Frank Schwope von der NordLB monierte: ""Es wird sicher nicht billiger fur VW.""

Der Skandal um manipulierte Abgaswerte war in den USA durch die Umweltbehorde EPA offentlich gemacht worden. VW hatte daraufhin den Einsatz einer illegalen Software zugegeben, durch die Stickoxid-Werte von Dieselautos nur auf dem Prufstand eingehalten werden. Weltweit sind von dem Betrug rund elf Millionen Fahrzeuge betroffen.

Some 14,000 people are stranded there after new border restrictions were imposed along the Balkan migration route. Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia said on Tuesday (March 8) they would place new restrictions on the entry of migrants and Macedonia responded on Wednesday by closing its border completely to illegal migrants, a police official said. Ai walked around the makeshift camp speaking with the migrants - seeing for himself the difficult conditions they have to brave as they wait to cross over to Macedonia and continue their trek northwards to wealthier European states. Ai, known for his criticism of China's human rights record, said he was witnessing a ""huge, big violation of human rights"" in the middle of Europe. ""What we have seen here is almost unbelievable, you know. If you say this is in the middle of Europe, all the people stuck here, and there's no hope for them even to be transferred to anywhere else, you know. It's just in the rain, in the cold, and women, children, all the people waiting for some bread, or some dry clothes, and this is a very sad situation and people have no hope because the door is closed, totally shut off. I think this is a huge, big violation of human rights, right in front of us. I don't know what is going to come out from this, but in Lesbos people still come in thousands every day, and here nobody tells them what to do, and they stay here, still having hope to go to Germany or some other location, but I think, as the sky is getting darker and I don't think there's much hope for them,"" he said. People fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and beyond have flooded into the EU since early 2015, most making the perilous sea crossing from Turkey to Greece, then heading north through the Balkans to Germany. But a cascade of border shutdowns in the Balkans has caused the blocking of the so-called 'Balkans corridor' used by more than a million people since the migratory wave started a year ago. More than 34,0000 people are now trapped on Greece's islands and mainland. At an emergency EU-Turkey summit on Monday (March 7), aimed to stem the migrant influx to Europe, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told leaders of the bloc Ankara was willing to take back all migrants who enter Europe from Turkey in future in return for financial aid, faster EU entry talks and quicker visa-free travel for its citizens. EU leaders aim to work out key details with Turkey by the next scheduled summit on March 17-18.

While Americas financial technology industry has exploded in recent years, regulators have not kept pace. This is partly because of the countrys outdated patchwork of state rules. The UK and others are further ahead in addressing this emerging sector in a fresh way. Creating a modern, federal regime to oversee these firms is a priority for U.S. policymakers.

Many of the new so-called fintech firms fall under the categories of money transmitters or consumer lenders, businesses that require licenses from nearly 50 states, each of which has different standards, not to mention regulatory examiners with varying degrees of sophistication.

That means 165-year-old Western Union is regulated the same way that a bitcoin-based transfer startup with fewer than 50 employees might be. For freshly minted companies in the space, state compliance can be prohibitive, costing more than $1 million annually.

Marketplace lenders that directly provide loans are also under state jurisdiction. Take SoFi, a San Francisco startup, which makes loans. The company led by former Wells Fargo banker Mike Cagney, and which raised $1 billion, has 18 state licenses for consumer lending and nearly 20 more for mortgages.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was established after the 2008 financial crisis, is the federal watchdog now looking out for fintech customers, a critical role in a landscape where algorithms have replaced credit scores to determine borrowing.

But the agencys mandate is limited and doesnt address risks to the broader financial system. The sector is not large enough to spark those concerns, but it could in the future. Yet its not yet clear who at the federal level has jurisdiction. Regulators need to figure this out fast, and account for the different business models many of these firms have from traditional banks.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is looking at ways to evaluate some of the new products. The Federal Reserve could be ideal as it can see the interconnectivity between fintech and the banking sector to assess risks. Banks are partnering with some of these startups and purchasing their loans.

Other countries have already moved forward. This year Britain established a startup unit to help firms thinking of becoming banks, and later will accept proposals for their regulatory sandbox program in which companies can test products.

Eventually, an international framework will be needed since many of these enterprises encompass global, borderless businesses. The industry is quickly evolving and regulators need to innovate, too.",[]

Two hedge funds said on Tuesday they are gunning to install six new directors at the $20 billion United Continental, a week before the newish chief executive is due to return from several months sick leave. Despite heated rhetoric, a revamped boardroom could be a winning compromise for the third-biggest U.S. airline and its investors.

PAR Capital Management and Altimeter Capital Management, which together own just over 7 percent of United shares, say they want to shake up what they claim is an underqualified, ineffective and entrenched board. The language is sharp, but they have a point.

As of last week few of Uniteds directors, other than two union representatives and a former Boeing executive, looked equipped to challenge managers on the nuts and bolts of running a major airline. As an example, non-executive chairman Henry Meyer, who stepped in after Uniteds previous chairman and CEO Jeff Smisek departed in September amid a federal probe, used to run a regional bank.

While United has made progress tackling late arrivals and other operational problems, the board hasnt covered itself in glory lately. It paid Smisek lavishly despite mediocre performance, and failed to communicate clearly with shareholders when his replacement, Munoz, fell ill with heart trouble in October.

United added three new directors on Monday in what looks like an attempt to spike the activists guns. Even if thats part of the motivation, though, the new faces  including the former boss of Air Canadas parent and a onetime operating chief at Delta Air Lines  bring relevant expertise.

The hedge-fund nominees look solid, too. The slate is led by Gordon Bethune, who led a turnaround of Continental Airlines in the 1990s. The company grumbles that PAR and Altimeter refused to engage constructively, but it ought to be possible to settle on compromise candidates as well as agreeing whose services are no longer needed.

A deal would be preferable to a drawn-out proxy fight. After all, that would distract Munoz from improving United Continentals business and the tricky balancing act of making the company more shareholder-friendly while not paying out so much cash that its vulnerable to the next downturn.",[]

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said on Wednesday it had signed a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA.N) 767 widebody freighter aircraft to handle more of its own deliveries in the United States.

The deal comes at a time when the world's biggest online retailer is offering ever-faster, and increasingly free, deliveries for millions of online orders.

Amazon, which relies on carriers like United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) to deliver most of its packages, spent $11.5 billion on shipping last year.

In a bid to assume more control over its supply chain and reduce costs, Amazon has rolled out thousands of trailers and launched a program that uses contract drivers to deliver fast orders.

But analysts said the long-rumored plan to build its own air fleet posed little threat to the leading delivery companies.

""This is an incremental negative for FDX and UPS as it will likely remove some higher yielding express freight and parcel volume from each of the respective networks,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst John Barnes wrote in a client note.

UPS, the world's No. 1 package delivery company, operates about 240 large planes while FedEx has a fleet of about 370, Barnes noted. FedEx and UPS shares were down about 1.5 percent.

FedEx said on Wednesday the announcement was not a surprise and called Amazon a valuable customer.

""We work closely with Amazon and have been aware for some time about their need for supplemental air capacity related to inventory management,"" said Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications at FedEx.

The leased planes will start to go into operation on April 1, Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email.

Amazon has been testing deliveries by drones but has not said when they would be in service.

The duration of the leases will be five to seven years, lessor Air Transport Services Group Inc (ATSG.O) said.

As part of the agreement, Amazon has the right to buy up to 19.9 percent of ATSG's stock over five years at $9.73 per share.

ATSG's stock soared almost 27 percent to a record high of $14.90, before paring gains to about 16 percent.

The opinions expressed are his own.

The European Unions bold deal with Turkey to stop the disorderly flow of migrants to Europe offers a lot  if it sticks.

Not only would it help keep Britain in the EU and Greece in the euro. It would shore up German Chancellor Angela Merkels position, and so help stabilise the EU. It would also avoid the collapse of the Schengen Area, which allows border-free travel throughout most of the bloc.

The provisional deal, which emerged on March 8, is more extensive than originally envisaged. Turkey will take back any irregular migrants crossing to Greece, including Syrian refugees. In return, the EU will accept an equal number of Syrians to those who come to Greece but are then sent back to Turkey.

Critically, these will not be the same people who attempt the boat trip across the Aegean. Instead, refugees will be taken directly from Turkey in a more orderly process. This should cut the incentive for people to make the dangerous crossing, putting their lives in the hands of people-smugglers.

Turkey also will get a series of other goodies: visa-free travel for its citizens to come to the Schengen Area from the end of June; extra cash on top of the 3 billion euros so far promised so it can better look after the millions of refugees who will stay in Turkey; and the energisation of talks to admit the country to the EU.

A lot of detail needs to be filled in. In particular, it is unclear how Syrians who are brought to the EU in an orderly fashion will be divvied up between the different members of the bloc. Given that several countries wont want to take any  or at least not many  bitter wrangling could yet cause the deal to fall apart.

Meanwhile, right-wing nationalists wont be happy with either visa-free travel for 79 million Turks, many of whom are Muslim, or the possibility that the country will eventually join the EU  even though that still seems a remote prospect that may never materialise. Nevertheless, movements such as Frances Front National and Germanys Alternative fur Deutschland will have new sticks with which to beat their nationalist drums.

That said, if the deal is finalised, perhaps as soon as another summit on March 17, there will be important economic and financial benefits.

First, the perception that the EU is finally getting a grip on the migrant crisis will undermine one of the strongest arguments used by those campaigning for Britain to quit the EU in a referendum set for June 23. Insofar as the Brexit risk is cut, that will reduce one of the main current concerns in financial markets. The UK is a big winner from the mooted deal because it has opted out of most of the EUs migration policies and so wont be required to take a quota of refugees. And since it is not in the Schengen Area, the offer of visa-free travel to Turks wont impact it.

Another big winner would be Greece. It has been at risk of being turned into a giant refugee camp as other countries north of it have tightened border controls. The political fallout could in turn have exacerbated its economic crisis. Even with this deal, Greece will face multiple difficulties, but theres less risk of them spinning out of control and tipping the country out of the euro.

Merkel also would be a winner. She has taken a lot of heat at home in the past few months for her previous open-door approach to Syrian refugees. If she can now show things are coming under control, she may be able to restore her authority. That would be good for the stability of the EU in general, given that she is its most important leader.

The EU and its member states would, of course, face a financial cost. In addition to the money sent to Turkey, Greece would get cash to help manage the refugees on its territory. An even bigger cost would be looking after refugees settled in the EU as part of the orderly process.

Set against that, borders would no longer need to be erected in the Schengen Area. Such a scenario would gum up trade and tourism. The cost of that could be 100 billion euros a year by 2025, according to analysis by the French government. And, eventually, Syrian refugees could play a valuable role in the economies of the countries where they settle  although it remains to be seen how well those who come will integrate in their new homes.

There are of course many ifs and buts in this scenario. Some people also will rightly worry that the EU is turning a blind eye to Turkeys abuse of press freedom and rule of law in its desperation to cut a deal on migrants. Nevertheless, from an economic perspective, the provisional deal reached in the early hours of March 8 has much to offer.

For the 1930s, the Spanish Civil War, the three-year fight between Fascists (helped by Nazi German) and Republicans (armed by the Soviet Union) pointed to the far larger global disaster to come. For the 1980s, the Soviet battle to control Afghanistan, a bloody mess of occupation and insurgency, helped bring forward the collapse of the Soviet Union and set the stage for 9/11 and modern Islamist militancy.

For the 1990s, you can take your pick of the Balkans, Somalia, Rwanda or Democratic Republic of Congo. For the 2000s, it was Iraq  the ultimate demonstration of the unipolar moment and the limits, dangers and sheer short-livedness of Americas status as unchallenged global superpower.

We are, of course, little more than half way through the current decade. Already, however, it looks as though it has to be Syrias civil war.

In pure human terms, the war dwarfs any other recent conflict. Estimates of the number of Syrian dead range from 270,000 to 470,000 people. The United Nations estimates up to 7.6 million Syrians are displaced within their own country, with up to 4 million fleeing their homeland. From its relatively small beginnings as a largely unarmed revolt, the Syrian conflict has now dragged in more than a half-dozen countries.

Its broader implications continue to grow by the month. While not the sole cause of Europes migrant crisis, Syrians make up a significant proportion  perhaps even the majority  of new arrivals on the continent. The sheer numbers are producing political strains that have already torn up the ideal of a borderless Europe and may yet wreck the entire European Union project.

Syria has exemplified what Financial Times columnist Gideon Rachmann calls a zero-sum world. From the beginning, rival regional powers  particularly Shiite Iran and Sunni states led by Saudi Arabia  approached the conflict with the assumption that neither side could afford to back down or compromise without letting the other win.

From that perspective, Syria is part of a larger regional confrontation that encompasses the war in Yemen, the long-term sectarian battle for control of Iraq and, of course, attempts to rein in Iran, in general, and its nuclear program, in particular.

Increasingly, though, the war in Syria has become part of the wider, potentially more dangerous confrontation between Western powers and Russia. That confrontation also goes back years  through Kosovo and the Balkans to the Cold War.

It also goes well beyond geopolitics to a fundamental disagreement over the limits of state power, the acceptable tools to restore order and the sustainability of authoritarian government. As I wrote in September, Russian President Vladimir Putins entire domestic justification of his power comes down to the importance of maintaining a stable central government as a bulwark against instability and chaos, whatever brutality that might take.

In Syria, Russias military intervention has been a game changer. As in Ukraine in 2014, Moscow has proved itself willing to use a level of military force that the West never anticipated and, as yet, has no real strategy to counter. Nor, for now, has it shown the will or intent to do so.

If the invasion of Iraq showed a United States that saw few real restrictions to its power, Syria has demonstrated the opposite. Washington has continuously prevaricated over what to do about Syria and even now, with Russian action literally redrawing the battlefield, has little in the way of a coherent strategy.

Painting this simply as a tale of Western or U.S. presidential weakness misses the point, however. If Syria shows us anything, it is how complicated the 21st century has become and how few good choices it can leave Washington.

Of course, if the West had signaled more clearly in the Syrian uprisings early days that it would do nothing and let Syrian President Bashar al-Assad slaughter his way back to stability, it might have fatally undermined the rebellion before it started. But this would also have left many in the West feeling distinctly uncomfortable.

Launching massive military strikes against Damascus following its 2013 use of chemical weapons might have helped the credibility of any future Western red lines. But they would also have further undermined what was left of the central government, an outcome now widely seen to have been an error when tried in Iraq and Libya.

The situation on the ground, meanwhile, is ever messier. As in several other recent wars  Iraq, Ukraine, Libya and Yemen  the national armed forces of Syria have become ever less important. Most of the recent fighting is down to relatively disparate militias with increasingly complex loyalties. Already, we have seen U.S.-backed Kurdish forces fighting other U.S.-backed groups, as well as in the growing conflict with Turkey, a U.S. ally.

The one area where the United States and its European allies have been willing to take action has been the fight against Islamic State. That seems reasonable: Of all the elements in the Syrian civil war, Islamic State is by far the most direct threat to Western interests, states and populations. Taking it on is a battle possibly and even likely to be won. Islamic State has already lost significant territory and finances.

That doesnt, however, come close to providing clarity over what to do about the rest of Syria.

As international mediation and ceasefire talks stutter forward, global and regional powers have a choice.

For most of those involved, the truth is that there may still be much to be gained by fighting. Russia could keep up the pressure and win back more territory for Assad and possibly benefit closer to home if the war helped destabilize the European Union. The United States, for that matter, could finally step up and support opposition fighters, which could block any recovery for Assad and drag the Russian mission into a quagmire. Also, regional powers could throw more resources into the battle, something Saudi Arabia seemingly signaled with its talk of sending ground troops to fight Islamic State.

The alternative, though, is that all sides pull back and demonstrate a willingness to compromise. There are plenty of messy issues. The most obvious is the immediate future of Assad and those around him. What exactly the compromise turns out to be might probably be less important than whether or not there is one.

Based on the past few weeks, the signals are mixed, at best. Some local ceasefires have been brokered, though with limited but very real humanitarian benefits for those on the ground.

If ordinary Syrians come to believe the war might genuinely be over one day, they are more likely to stay in the region, which might spark a whole different collection of conflicts.

A deal over Syria would perhaps be the most positive sign that the world could overcome its myriad growing challenges and confrontations. Failing to do so, however, might point to even worse things to come.",[]

WASHINGTON The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation hinted on Wednesday that authorities in Iran had recently been trying to help locate Robert Levinson, a retired FBI agent who disappeared exactly nine years ago after traveling to an Iranian resort island to meet a fugitive from U.S. justice.

""We are encouraged by recent cooperation between the government of Iran and the United States, and believe that our ability to locate Bob and reunite him with his family requires a shared commitment by the Iranian government,"" the FBI's Washington Field Office said in a prepared statement.

The statement quoted FBI Director James Comey saying that his agency was ""doing everything in our power to investigate all leads.""

The FBI statement did not elaborate further.

The White House also said that finding Levinson ""remains a top priority for the United States,"" but added that the U.S. would ""continue to call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to provide assistance in his case, as agreed to as part of the prisoner exchange finalized earlier this year.""

Five Americans were released by Iran in January to coincide with the lifting of economic sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran's nuclear program. The White House offered clemency to seven Iranians who were convicted or facing trial in the United States.

Levinson's family continued to urge the U.S. government to press Iran for his release. In a statement, Levinson's wife, Christine, said: ""We need the United States government and the country of Iran to work together to resolve what happened to Bob and return him safely to his family.""

Levinson disappeared after flying from Dubai to Kish Island in the Gulf in March 2007. There he met with Daoud Salahuddin, an American Islamic militant who fled to Iran while facing charges in the murder of an Iranian embassy official based in Washington.

Levinson, working then as a private investigator, was seeking information on alleged corruption involving former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and his family, said sources familiar with his work.

Months after he disappeared, U.S. government sources acknowledged that Levinson also maintained an unorthodox contractual relationship with the analytical branch of the Central Intelligence Agency. A handful of CIA officials were forced out of the agency and several more were disciplined after an internal agency investigation.

The Iranian government has never publicly acknowledged any role in Levinson's abduction, though at the time of his disappearance a government-affiliated media outlet broadcast a story saying he was ""in the hands of Iranian security forces.""

Some FBI investigators strongly believe Levinson is still alive, while officials at other U.S. agencies believe he died some time ago.

Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports

Mildronate (Meldonium) medication capsules are pictured on the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, in this November 23, 2010 file photo.

A manufacturing operator works at the Mildronate (Meldonium) medication packaging process in the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, November 23, 2010. Picture taken November 23, 2010.

LONDON The medicine Maria Sharapova says she has taken for 10 years due to a family history of heart issues and diabetes is an old drug sold in just a few Eastern European countries that can also boost exercise tolerance.

The tennis star tested positive for the banned drug meldonium, or Mildronate, in a sample taken on January 26, the day of her Australian Open quarter finals defeat to Serena Williams.

She said her family doctor had first given her the drug 10 years ago after she frequently became sick, had irregular electrocardiogram results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.

The 28-year old Russian, a five-time grand slam champion and the highest paid woman in sports, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said.

For the health conditions Sharapova says she has, however, doctors say the scientific evidence for Mildronate is limited compared with many medicines widely available in Europe and the United States, where Sharapova trains, which have full regulatory backing and years of robust safety and efficacy data.

LATVIAN DRUG

Meldonium is cheap and available over the counter without a prescription in some eastern European countries, where it is marketed as Mildronate by the Latvian pharmaceutical firm Grindeks.

The drug, originally developed by scientists at the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, is not licensed by two of the world's biggest medicines regulators: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States where Sharapova trains, and the EU's European Medicines Agency.

A spokeswoman for Grindeks said the firm had not applied for a license for Mildronate from either the FDA or the EMA, but said the drug is registered in Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union.

She said it is designed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular diseases, including angina, chronic heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other cardiovascular disorders.

Grindeks' also promotes it for people with reduced working capacity from physical or psycho-emotional ""overload,"" and during recovery from cerebrovascular disorders, head injury and encephalitis. It is not indicated for diabetes.

Tim Chico, a consultant cardiologist at Britain's Sheffield University, said it was unlikely that such a young and extremely fit woman would be suffering from a serious heart condition like angina, or would be able to play top level tennis if she were.

Asked how long the drug should be given to a patient, the Grindeks spokeswoman said in an emailed statement: ""Depending on the patient health condition, treatment course of meldonium preparations may vary from 4 to 6 weeks."" Such courses could be repeated two or three times in a year.

In an emailed reply to questions from Reuters about her medical reasons for using the drug, Sharapova's lawyer John Haggerty said: ""While I cannot go into detail out of respect for the ITF process, I can confirm that Ms Sharapova had abnormal EKG tests in 2006 and was also diagnosed with asthenia (a lack of energy or strength), decreased immunity and diabetes indicators.""

""She also had a family history of heart conditions,"" Haggerty said. ""The Mildronate and the other medicines recommended by her doctor treated these conditions.""

Munir Pirmohamed, a professor of molecular and clinical pharmacology at Britain's University of Liverpool, said the crucial issue with Mildronate for him is its lack of approval from EU and U.S. regulators.

""As a physician, this is not something I have, or would ever, prescribe,"" he said.

Others noted it was rare for a doctor treating illness to prescribe a drug that is unavailable in the country where the patient lives.

""Sharapova has been a U.S. resident since early in her career, which does bring in a question of how or why she is using a drug that is not licensed there,"" said Tom Bassindale, a lecturer in forensic science at Sheffield Hallam University.

Sharapova's agent Max Eisenbud was not available at his Miami office and did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

HELPS MUSCLES COPE

Whatever its medical benefits, research suggests Mildronate may have potential as a performance-enhancing drug for sports.

It reduces the level of a metabolite called carnetine in muscles, and by doing that helps muscles cope better with high levels of stress and low oxygen levels.

""Because it affects the cellular metabolism, it would increase energy production within cells and therefore make oxygen utilisation more efficient,"" said Pirmohamed.

In a 2010 academic paper published in a review journal called Seminars in Cardiovascular Medicine and cited on the Grindeks company website, it has been shown to improve exercise tolerance in patients with heart problems.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:58:56+00:00,Myanmar on edge as long wait for new president ends,['Timothy Mclaughlin'],"Myanmar's National League for Democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi arrives for the opening of the new parliament in Naypyitaw February 1, 2016.

NAYPYITAW Four months after Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won a crushing electoral victory over a government made up of former generals, Myanmar's citizens should finally find out who their new president will be on Thursday.

It won't be Suu Kyi. The NLD leader and Nobel peace prize laureate is barred from holding the office under a junta-drafted 2008 constitution because her children are not Myanmar citizens.

The wildly popular Suu Kyi has said that she will run the country regardless through a proxy she would name as president. But she and the NLD leadership have kept the identity of their nominee a closely guarded secret even from rank-and-file MPs.

They have done so partly out of fear a rushed and overly enthusiastic reaction to the election victory could put the sensitive transition at risk. In 1990, the military tossed out results of an election that the NLD won and remained in power.

Suu Kyi has repeatedly said she hoped to reach a compromise with the armed forces that would allow her to assume the presidency.

But talks since the election to bridge the differences failed, sources in her camp said, leading to a deepening rift between Suu Kyi and the military.

The secrecy has fueled a presidential guessing game in a country keen to see the NLD, many of whose members were jailed during years of military rule, complete its transition from democracy movement to ruling party.

Lawmakers from the NLD-dominated parliament that sat for the first time on Feb. 1, said on Wednesday they were eager for the nomination process to get under way.

""It is a very big change, like the Magna Carta,"" said Myint Lwin, a lower house lawmaker from the NLD. ""I'm proud to be involved in this history.""

Speculation on the NLD presidential nominee has ranged from Suu Kyi's personal physician to her chief-of-staff. In recent days, it has focused on her close friend Htin Kyaw. He runs the Daw Khin Kyi Foundation, a charity to assist people in Myanmar's poorest areas founded by Suu Kyi and named after her mother.

RECONCILIATION GESTURE

Three presidential candidates will be nominated on Thursday - one by the lower house, one by the upper house, and one by the military bloc in parliament. The constitution gives the armed forces a quarter of seats in both houses.

""We will propose the vice presidential candidates tomorrow in both Pyithu and Amyotha Hluttaw,"" said NLD spokesman Dr Zaw Myint Maung referring to Myanmar parliament's lower and upper house chambers.

Because the NLD has a comfortable majority in both chambers it will effectively control two of the nominations, with the party's second pick widely expected to be a representative of one of Myanmar's ethnic minorities.

The two losing nominees become vice presidents, meaning that a nominee from an ethnic party would be proposed with that role in mind in line with Suu Kyi's goal of forming a government for national reconciliation.

Local media have named Thet Swe, a former navy chief who stepped down last year to run in the election representing the far flung Coco Islands, as one of the possible nominees for the military.

The three nominees do not need to be lawmakers, but they will be vetted by a parliamentary commission.

After that, both houses of parliament will come together for a joint session to vote on the presidency.

The NLD's huge majority means that whichever candidate it backs as president will win.

The president picks the cabinet that will take over from President Thein Sein's outgoing government on April 1, with the exception of the heads of the home, defense and border security ministries who will be appointed by the armed forces chief.

There was confusion among members of parliament on Wednesday over how soon the presidential vote would take place.

A director from the parliament told Reuters that the vote would not be held until at least Monday.

New NLD members of parliament said they remained in the dark over who would be nominated.

""We only have the news from Facebook,"" said Sein Mya Aye, a lower house NLD lawmaker.

BRASILIA O ministro da Fazenda, Nelson Barbosa, mantem o cronograma preparado por ele para envio das propostas de reformas Fiscal e da Previdencia ao Congresso, apesar de reconhecer uma deterioracao do cenario politico da semana passada para ca.

Segundo ele, as duas reformas serao encaminhadas para o Legislativo entre este mes e o fim de abril.

Barbosa espera que medidas relacionadas a area economica que ja estao no Congresso possam ter a tramitacao retomada o mais rapido possivel.

Em entrevista a Reuters nesta quarta-feira, o ministro rebateu a avaliacao de agentes do mercado financeiro de que eventual impeachment da presidente Dilma Rousseff faria a economia do pais melhorar.

Na semana passada, noticias de delacao premiada do senador Delcidio do Amaral (PT-MS), ex-lider do governo no Senado, e fase da operacao da Lava Jato que teve como alvo o ex-presidente Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva fizeram o dolar cair ante o real e a Bovespa registrar alta.

""A melhor solucao para o momento atual e fazer uma combinacao de medidas que de espaco para o governo estabilizar a economia no curto prazo"", afirmou Barbosa, citando maior espaco fiscal, ""normalizacao da oferta de credito"" e reformas estruturais.

""O governo atual e o mais qualificado, o mais apto a promover essas reformas"", disse o ministro.

Ele reconheceu, no entanto, que a piora do ambiente politico atrasa o andamento de medidas importantes que ja foram enviadas ao Legislativo, como a recriacao da CPMF.

Barbosa afirmou ainda que a meta de superavit primario deste ano dos governos regionais, de 6,6 bilhoes de reais, pode ser reduzida dependendo do acordo que esta sendo costurado com a Fazenda para alongar a divida dos Estados.

Assim, a meta de economia para pagamento de juros do setor publico consolidado --governo central, Estados, municipios e estatais-- pode ser ainda menor em 2016.

O governo esta negociando o alongamento da divida dos Estados junto a Uniao em 20 anos e, na terca-feira, abriu espaco para que o pagamento das parcelas nos dois primeiros anos tenha um desconto em troca de mais austeridade fiscal dos entes.

RECUPERACAO

Na visao de Barbosa, a economia brasileira devera ser estabilizada no terceiro trimestre, voltando a crescer a partir dos ultimos tres meses deste ano.

""Estamos trabalhando para recuperar o nivel de atividade o mais rapido possivel, estabilizando renda e emprego e reducao da inflacao. Isso vai contribuir para reduzir nao so a incerteza macroeconomica, mas tambem para a reducao da incerteza politica"", afirmou.

Em 2015, o Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) sofreu a maior queda em 25 anos, de 3,8 por cento, afetado pela contracao recorde nos investimentos e na industria.

Pesquisa Focus do Banco Central, que ouve semanalmente uma centena de economias, mostra projecoes de queda de 3,5 por cento do PIB neste ano, com crescimento de apenas 0,5 por cento em 2017.

Questionado sobre as perspectivas para o ingresso de receitas extraordinarias no caixa da Uniao este ano, Barbosa citou as aberturas de capital da Caixa Seguridade e da IRB-Brasil Resseguros, que devem ocorrer no segundo semestre, quando as condicoes de mercado estiverem mais favoraveis.

Em fevereiro, a IRB-Brasil desistiu da oferta publica inicial de acoes (IPO, na sigla em ingles), citando condicoes adversas de mercado. A Caixa Seguridade suspendeu em outubro passado seu pedido para uma oferta de acoes.

CREDITO

Barbosa afirmou que o governo trabalha para reaquecer o mercado de credito num momento em que as empresas sofrem com falta de liquidez. Ele argumentou que isso ocorre dentro do espaco fiscal existente, e indicou que o esforco nao sera estendido para o credito voltado ao consumo.

O ministro mostrou-se ainda contrario a taxacao, voltada para a Previdencia, sobre exportadores agricolas, mesmo no cenario de baixa arrecadacao.

Tambem disse que o governo nao tem planos para injetar capital na Petrobras, tampouco usar as reservas internacionais.

""Nos achamos importante manter reservas internacionais no nivel atual, principalmente neste nivel de turbulencia"", afirmou.

ASMARA In an often forgotten corner of the Horn of Africa, Eritrea's capital boasts one of the worlds finest collections of early 20th century architecture and the authorities want it declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

When Italy's colonial experiment in Eritrea ended in 1941, it left behind an array of Rationalist, Futurist, Art Deco and other Modernist styles in Asmara, a city whose historic heart has changed little since the Italians lived and worked there.

In following decades, conflict ravaged Eritrea, leaving the nation isolated and stifling development. But the violence by-passed the city, and the capital has never been swamped by the kind of construction that raced ahead elsewhere in Africa.

A Reuters photo essay at reut.rs/1UQi38U shows elegant avenues still flanked by the Art Deco Cinema Impero, the imposing lines of the Education Ministry that once housed the Fascist party headquarters and the Futurist Fiat Tagliero garage with gravity-defying concrete cantilevered wings, extending 15 meters either side without the support of pillars.

Italian architects used what had been an amalgamation of highland villages centuries earlier as ""an ideal blank canvas"", according to UNESCO's description, to practice what were, at the time, some of the world's most avant garde designs.

Italians nicknamed it ""La Piccola Roma"" or ""Little Rome"".

""The city is very intact and maintains its original character,"" said Medhanie Teklemariam, coordinator for the Asmara Heritage Project, which has drawn up an inventory of about 4,300 buildings in Asmara's historic perimeter.

The nomination dossier for World Heritage Site status was submitted to UNESCO this year, with a decision expected in 2017.

If approved, Asmara would benefit from technical assistance, helping renovate and preserve the historic buildings, which include offices, government buildings and homes.

World Heritage Site status could also draw visitors to a barely trodden tourist trail. Eritrea has soaring mountains and a long Red Sea coast, but no international hotel chains.

The authorities have also carefully protected the architectural assets, adhering to 1938 building regulations. New planning regulations are being drawn up but some rules, such as limiting buildings to 60 meters high, are likely to remain.

""If we are going to exceed above this height, I think we are going to destroy the skyline of Asmara,"" said Medhanie.

The Italians left their mark in other ways. Pizza and pasta are almost national dishes - and expertly cooked.

Italians also brought cycle racing to Eritrea and it has become a national passion - images of Eritrean cyclist Daniel Teklehaimanot who wore the King of the Mountains jersey in the 2015 Tour de France are plastered in hotels and shops.

Street-side cafes are filled with the grumble and hiss of polished coffee machines serving up espressos and macchiatos.

Seeking to mirror the bigger and older empires of Britain and France, Eritrea was Italy's route ""to enter the big business of imperialism,"" said Federico Niglia, a history professor at Luiss University in Rome.

Coinciding with a period when there was an ""explosion of art"" in Italy, Asmara's architecture was one way to show off Italy's approach to colonial management, he added.

But Italy's ambitions lay beyond Eritrea, which was seen as simply the starting point of a far grander empire in East Africa. It had long had its eyes on Ethiopia next door, a nation it briefly occupied from 1936 until it was ejected in 1941.

Unlike Asmara, a city Italians shaped during several decades there, Addis Ababa's soaring skyline and rapid expansion have overshadowed the few reminders of Ethiopia's brush with Italian rule.

WASHINGTON A U.S. general nominated to lead U.S. forces in the Middle East told lawmakers on Wednesday that he was concerned about the lack of a reliable partner in Syria in the fight against Islamic State and would look carefully at Washington's strategy if confirmed to the post.

Army General Joseph Votel told the Senate Armed Services Committee he would seek to ensure a coherent and well-resourced strategy to go after Islamic State strongholds.

""In Iraq we do have a partner, we do have a government, (but) in Syria we don't and so I am concerned about how we approach this moving forward in Syria without a political element to support that,"" Votel told the committee, which is considering his nomination to head the U.S. Central Command that oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East.

""I do have concerns about our broader strategy against ISIL,"" Votel said, using an acronym for Islamic State, ""about how we are applying resources, about how we are focusing our authorities.""

Votel said operations to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul and the Syrian city of Raqqa would take additional resources.

The committee also is considering the nomination of Army Lieutenant General Raymond Thomas to lead U.S. Special Operations Command. Thomas told the members that U.S.-backed rebels in northeastern Syria had suffered more than 75 casualties fighting Islamic State in the past month.

""They're losing a lot of people to carry the fight against ISIL, so I'm impressed with their tenacity,"" Thomas said.

In response to a comment from Republican Senator John McCain, Thomas said he would support the presence of U.S. special forces in Libya to combat a growing threat from Islamic State there.

The United States launched an air strike on an Islamic State training camp last month and France has conducted surveillance flights and sent military advisers. U.S., French and British special forces also are present in the country, officials and media have said.

""That particular part of ungoverned space requires potentially unique special operations solutions and we're attempting to provide those options to the chain of command,"" Thomas said. ""We've already identified some formative organizations that we hope to be able to work with in the future.""

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said on Wednesday it had signed a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA.N) 767 widebody freighter aircraft to handle more of its own deliveries in the United States.

The deal comes at a time when the world's biggest online retailer is offering ever-faster, and increasingly free, deliveries for millions of online orders.

Amazon, which relies on carriers like United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) to deliver most of its packages, spent $11.5 billion on shipping last year.

In a bid to assume more control over its supply chain and reduce costs, Amazon has rolled out thousands of trailers and launched a program that uses contract drivers to deliver fast orders.

But analysts said the long-rumored plan to build its own air fleet posed little threat to the leading delivery companies.

""This is an incremental negative for FDX and UPS as it will likely remove some higher yielding express freight and parcel volume from each of the respective networks,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst John Barnes wrote in a client note.

UPS, the world's No. 1 package delivery company, operates about 240 large planes while FedEx has a fleet of about 370, Barnes noted. FedEx and UPS shares were down about 1.5 percent.

FedEx said on Wednesday the announcement was not a surprise and called Amazon a valuable customer.

""We work closely with Amazon and have been aware for some time about their need for supplemental air capacity related to inventory management,"" said Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications at FedEx.

The leased planes will start to go into operation on April 1, Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email.

Amazon has been testing deliveries by drones but has not said when they would be in service.

The duration of the leases will be five to seven years, lessor Air Transport Services Group Inc (ATSG.O) said.

As part of the agreement, Amazon has the right to buy up to 19.9 percent of ATSG's stock over five years at $9.73 per share.

ATSG's stock soared almost 27 percent to a record high of $14.90, before paring gains to about 16 percent.

Trade between the United States and Canada and joint efforts to curb climate change will loom large on the agenda for the meeting between President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Washington on Thursday.

It will be followed by a star-studded state dinner meant to recognize the importance of the bilateral relationship, the first state dinner to honor Canada in 19 years.

Trudeau's Liberals came to power in November by ousting right-wing Conservative leader Stephen Harper, whose ties with Washington deteriorated as he hectored Obama over the Keystone XL pipeline.

President Barack Obama blocked the project last year, a victory for environmentalists who had campaigned against the pipeline.

The spat is in the past, Rice said.

""In any bilateral relationship, there are going to be issues of difference and occasional friction,"" she told Reuters in an interview.

""The complexity and the breadth and the depth of the U.S-Canada relationship is such that no single issue can overshadow the totality of the relationship,"" she said.

Obama and Trudeau will discuss the next steps for the ""Beyond the Border"" initiative, a plan to speed travel and trade, Rice said.

""With the longest peaceful border and $2 billion a day in trade in both directions, we have an enormous shared stake in a border that is open for business and open for travel - and safe,"" Rice said.

Trudeau campaigned to strengthen ties with the United States, but also promised he would pull out six fighter jets from the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

Rice said the White House is satisfied with steps that Trudeau took to beef up training, surveillance and other support to the coalition.

""Taken as a whole, we view the Canadian stepped-up contribution to the counter-ISIL campaign as being very, very valuable and welcome,"" Rice said, using an acronym for Islamic State.

The White House has also watched closely as Trudeau welcomed 25,000 Syrian refugees to Canada in four months.

""We've seen thus far that Canada is taking very seriously its responsibility to its own citizens and to our common security to be vigilant as it welcomes these new refugees,"" Rice said.

Michael Horn, speaks at their media reception during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, January 10, 2016.

Michael Horn, President and CEO of Volkswagen America, reacts to being mobbed by the media after he apologized for the Volkswagen diesel scandal at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, United States in a November 18, 2015 file photo.

Michael Horn, President and CEO of Volkswagen America, introduces the new Beetle Dune at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, United States in a November 18, 2015 file photo.

WASHINGTON Volkswagen AG's top U.S. executive is stepping down nearly six months after the German automaker admitted to installing software to allow 580,000 diesel U.S. vehicles to emit excess emissions, the company said on Wednesday.

Michael Horn, who has been president and chief executive officer of Volkswagen of America since 2014, is leaving by mutual agreement ""to pursue other opportunities effective immediately,"" VW said.

Horn could not immediately be reached. A lawyer for Horn did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

The German automaker said on an interim basis, Hinrich J. Woebcken, who was recently named the new head of the North American Region and chairman of Volkswagen Group of America, will assume Horn's role.

Horn's departure comes as VW continues to negotiate with California, the Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency on possible fixes or buybacks for the diesel vehicles. It faces a March 24 deadline to tell a federal judge whether it has an acceptable fix.

A top California official told state lawmakers Tuesday that VW may only be able to mount a partial fix and may have to pay to mitigate the harm caused by allowing vehicles to remain on the road.

During the initial response to the crisis, Horn was VW's public face in the United States, apologizing days after the scandal became public and testifying before Congress.

""Lets be clear about this: our company was dishonest  with the EPA and the California Air Resources Board  and with all of you. And in my German words: We totally screwed up. We must fix those cars,"" Horn said in New York on Sept. 21.

In October, Horn told a U.S. House of Representatives panel that VWs supervisory board and top leadership did not intentionally order the cheating, but said it was the work of a few individuals. Asked by Rep. Joe Barton, a Republican from Texas, if it made sense that a company like VW could allow a fraud to go on for seven years without top leaders knowing, Horn was blunt.

""I agree it is very hard to believe, he said. ""Some people made the wrong decisions.""

Horn told Congress he had no knowledge of the cheating.

He became CEO based at VW's U.S. headquarters in Herndon, Virginia following the resignation of his predecessor, Jonathan Browning who abruptly resigned after VW brand sales fell in 2013. Sales fell despite an aggressive plan announced in 2008 by VW to triple sales in 10 years.

Airport officials became suspicious after they found fresh operation scars below the woman's breasts during a search on Feb. 24 and she complained of severe pain.

The woman admitted to carrying drugs, which had been inserted into her body during a hastily arranged operation.

She was sent to a local hospital where doctors removed two 500-gram lumps of cocaine wrapped in plastic from each of her breasts.

The drugs have a market value of 200,000 euros ($220,000) and were destined for Spain, a customs spokesman said.

""This is the first case in Germany in which drugs have been smuggled in this fashion,"" said spokesman Hans-Juergen Schmidt.

Customs agents were shocked by what they said was the amateurish surgery. Schmidt said it showed how drugs smugglers ""are completely indifferent to human life and the life-threatening conditions of their drug carriers.""

The woman, who said she has three children in Colombia where she worked in agriculture, will be charged with drug trafficking and faces jail time. ($1 = 0.9123 euros)

Model Alexia Palmer, who is suing Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump's Trump Model Management LLC of lying to the federal government, is shown is this undated handout photo released on March 8, 2016.

NEW YORK A judge will decide by the end of this month whether to proceed with a proposed class action lawsuit filed by a Jamaican fashion model against Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump's modeling agency, the judge's office said.

Alexia Palmer accuses Trump Model Management LLC of lying to the federal government in its work-visa application that said she would be paid a $75,000-a-year salary while living in the United States, according to court documents.

READ MORE: North Korea says it has missile-ready nukes

Instead, according to court papers, Palmer received a total of $3,880.75 during the three years she was under contract with the agency. The complaint alleges fraudulent misrepresentation and violations of U.S. immigration and labor laws. It asks for $225,000 in back pay.

The suit was originally filed in October 2014. A decision on a pending motion by Trump Model Management to dismiss is expected by the end of March, the clerk for Judge Analisa Torres, who is presiding over the case in the U.S District Court, Southern District, told Reuters.

If Torres rules the case can proceed, it could revive attention on Trumps foreign labor practices at a time when the celebrity billionaire's rise in American politics has riveted the worlds attention.

Trumps lawyers have called the case ""frivolous"" and ""without merit."" In court documents, they said Palmer wasnt an employee and was more than adequately compensated for a very brief stint as a fashion model, which they say amounted to less than 10 days of work over three years.

Reuters could not independently confirm that assertion.

RECOMMENDED: Iran tests more missiles, says capable of reaching Israel

At the end of the day, this model just didnt have a successful career, and we fully expect to win, said Lawrence Rosen, a lawyer for Trump Model Management.

Although Trump owns the modeling agency, the suit does not name him. Trump's campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said in a statement that Trump Model Management's treatment of Palmer was in line with ""standard practice in the modeling industry.""

Palmer's lawyer, Naresh Gehi, says his client was cheated of earnings and seduced by a life of glamour that never materialized. ""The visa application the company filed with the government requires that people are paid the full amount,"" Gehi said. ""Its a requirement.

Palmer, who was 17 when she came to New York in 2011, was not available to comment.

TOP JAMAICAN MODEL

Sylvia Ayass, a lawyer who has worked with models on visas like Palmer's, said agencies typically pay what they state on visa applications.

Trump has won Republican frontrunner status in the 2016 election in large part by positioning himself as a champion of the American worker who will deport illegal immigrants, build a wall with Mexico and do away with the off shoring of U.S. jobs.

This is not the first time Trump's labor practices have drawn criticism. A Reuters story published in August revealed that Trump's companies sought to import at least 1,100 workers on temporary visas since 2000. Of those, 250 were filed for foreign fashion models, according to the Reuters analysis of federal Department of Labor data.

Using a federal visa program called H-1B that allows U.S. employers to hire ""specialized"" foreign labor, Trump's modeling agency offered Palmer ""at least $75,000 per year"" for three years. It listed that salary on her H-1B visa application in 2011, according to the court documents reviewed by Reuters.

Rosen, the lawyer for Trump Model Management, said the $75,000 a year figure was simply a guess, not a guarantee.

Under that contract, Palmer agreed ""to promptly reimburse"" Trump Model Management ""for any and all costs and expenses"" that the agency incurred relating to her modeling.

According to the suit, the agreement stipulated that Trump Model Management would take a 20 percent cut of Palmers earnings but instead took 80 percent by deducting charges for everything from postage to walking lessons to mobile phone costs and limousine rides, as well as $4,000 in ""administrative fees,"" according to court documents.

The suit said it was seeking class-action status to represent other models who believe they were misled and underpaid after coming to the United States with sponsorship from Trumps modeling agency.

Frankfurt Die Aussicht auf neue Geldgeschenke von EZB-Chef Mario Draghi hat Anleger am Mittwoch in Kauflaune versetzt.

Gegen Handelsschluss machten einige von ihnen allerdings Kasse, um nicht auf dem falschen Fu erwischt zu werden. Der Dax schloss 0,3 Prozent fester bei 9723,09 Punkten und der EuroStoxx50 gewann 0,6 Prozent auf 3019,10 Zahler. An der Wall Street ging es ebenfalls leicht bergauf. Dow Jones, Nasdaq und S&P 500 gewannen bis zu 0,5 Prozent.

Am Markt werde fest damit gerechnet, dass die Europaische Zentralbank (EZB) am Donnerstag die Ausweitung ihrer Wertpapierkaufe auf 75 Milliarden Euro monatlich ankundigt, schrieben die Analysten der Essener National-Bank in einem Kommentar. Auerdem sei eine Verlangerung der Laufzeit des Programms moglich. Bislang pumpen die Wahrungshuter ""mindestens bis Marz 2017"" monatlich 60 Milliarden Euro in die Finanzmarkte, um die Konjunktur anzukurbeln und die drohende Deflation, eine Spirale fallender Preise und rucklaufiger Investitionen, abzuwenden.

""Da die Erwartungen an die EZB aber so hoch gesteckt sind, besteht das Risiko, dass sie dahinter zuruckbleibt"", warnte Devisenstratege Niels Christensen von der Nordea Bank. In diesem Fall musse mit einer kraftigen Aufwertung des Euro gerechnet werden. Einige Borsianer sehen die Wahrung in diesem Fall wieder bei 1,11 Dollar. Am Mittwoch kostete sie 1,1024 Dollar.

HOFFNUNG AUF ABEBBENDE OLSCHWEMME TREIBT PREISE

Am Rohstoffmarkt sorgte die Aussicht auf ein geringeres Uberangebot fur gute Stimmung. Die groen Exportstaaten wollen ab dem 20. Marz uber eine Deckelung der Fordermengen beraten. Sollte es zu einer Einigung kommen, ware dies ein Schritt auf dem Weg, Angebot und Nachfrage wieder ins Gleichgewicht zu bekommen, sagte Analyst Olivier Jakob vom Research-Haus Petromatrix. Aktuell werden taglich ein bis zwei Millionen Barrel Rohol mehr gefordert als benotigt.

Mit Erleichterung reagierten Investoren zudem auf den im Rahmen der Erwartungen ausgefallenen Anstieg der US-Lagerbestande. Die richtungsweisende Rohol-Sorte Brent aus der Nordsee verteuerte sich um bis zu 3,7 Prozent auf 41,11 Dollar je Barrel (159 Liter).

Gleichzeitig trennten sich Anleger von Gold. Das als sicher geltende Edelmetall verbilligte sich um 0,5 Prozent auf 1254,16 Dollar je Feinunze (31,1 Gramm). Der Bund-Future, der auf der zehnjahrigen Bundesanleihe basiert, gab 100 Ticks auf 162,17 Punkte nach.

BMW TROTZ REKORDERGEBNIS UNTER DRUCK - E.ON AUCH TIEFER

Bei den deutschen Aktienwerten ruckte am Mittag BMW ins Rampenlicht. Der Autobauer konnte mit einem Rekordergebnis und der Anhebung seiner Dividende auf 3,20 Euro je Stammaktie Investoren nicht uberzeugen. Borsianer hatten mit 3,38 Euro gerechnet. Die Papiere schlossen 1,8 Prozent tiefer bei 78,54 Euro.

Nach unten ging es auch fur E.ON, die sich nach Vorlage der Bilanz um 3,1 Prozent verbilligten. ""Der Ausblick macht die Musik"", sagte ein Handler. ""Und da dieser nicht besonders optimistisch ausgefallen ist, furchten Anleger, dass es auch bei der Dividende kunftig Abstriche geben konnte."" Auerdem gab Vorstandschef Johannes Teyssen fur 2015 einen Rekordverlust von sieben Milliarden Euro bekannt.

An der Wall Street sorgte Air Transport mit einem Kurssprung von zeitweise knapp 27 Prozent fur Aufsehen. Der Flugzeugvermieter liefert 20 Boeing-Frachtmaschinen an Amazon, der die Auslieferung von Paketen zunehmend in Eigenregie ubernehmen will. Der Online-Handler sicherte sich gleichzeitig das Recht, bis zu 19,9 Prozent an Air Transport zu ubernehmen. Dies hievte deren Aktien auf ein Rekordhoch von 14,90 Dollar.

Speaking at a news conference with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Kerry said ""I want to be clear that the United States considers the refugee crisis to be global. The impact first was felt, obviously, by Jordan and Lebanon and Turkey, and they've borne an unbelievable burden in the course of these four and a half, four-plus years of war."" On Monday a senior official from the Saudi-backed opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC) said the cessation of hostilities faced ""complete nullification"" because Syrian government attacks were violating the agreement. The cessation of hostilities agreement, the first of its kind since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, is a less formal arrangement than a ceasefire. It is meant to allow peace talks to resume and aid to reach besieged communities.

WASHINGTON Technology companies could face civil penalties for refusing to comply with court orders to help investigators access encrypted data under draft legislation nearing completion in the U.S. Senate, sources familiar with continuing discussions told Reuters on Wednesday.

The long-awaited legislation from Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, may be introduced as soon as next week, one of the sources said.

It would expose companies like Apple Inc, which is fighting a magistrate judge's order to unlock an iPhone connected to the mass-shooting in San Bernardino, California, to contempt of court proceedings and related penalties, the source said.

Senators are expected to circulate the draft bill among interested parties next week and hope to introduce it soon after, though a timetable is not final, the source said.

The Senators' proposal would not seek criminal penalties, as some media reports have stated, the sources said.

The controversial proposal faces an uphill climb in a gridlocked Congress during an election year and would likely be opposed by Silicon Valley.

Tech companies have largely supported Apple in its legal fight against the Justice Department, which is seeking access to a phone used by Rizwan Farook, one of two shooters in the San Bernardino attack last December in which 14 were killed and 22 wounded.

It is particularly unlikely the proposal will gain traction in the U.S. House of Representatives, which staked out positions strongly supporting digital privacy in the wake of revelations about government-sanctioned surveillance of communications by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.

Last year, amid stiff private sector opposition, the White House backed away from pushing for legislation to require U.S. technology firms to provide investigators with mechanisms to overcome encryption protections.

But the issue found renewed life after the shootings in San Bernardino and Paris. An August email from Robert Litt, the top U.S. intelligence community lawyer, obtained by the Washington Post, noted that momentum on the issue ""could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement.""

Separately, Democratic Senator Mark Warner and Republican Representative Michael McCaul last week introduced legislation to create a national commission to further explore solutions to the so-called going dark problem, where strong encryption has made it more difficult for law enforcement to access communications belonging to criminal suspects.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:03:18+00:00,Brazil prosecutors methods questioned after Lula detained,['Anthony Boadle'],"Brazil's former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva leaves a meeting with senators of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) in Brasilia, Brazil March 9, 2016.

BRASILIA An investigation into a massive corruption scheme centered on Brazilian state oil company Petrobras enjoys overwhelming public support but concern is growing that prosecutors may be over-reaching as they pursue politicians and executives.

The high-profile detention for questioning last week of former president Luis Inacio Lula da Silva drew criticism from the government and federal judges, reigniting debate over the methods used in ""Operation Car Wash"".

Critics say prosecutors trying to unravel the vast network of bribery and political kickbacks and Judge Sergio Moro, who presides over the case, are unfairly leaking evidence to the media and have left defendants in prison for months without charges as part of a strategy to win plea bargain deals.

Those allegations have intensified in the last few days.

""The detention of Lula has put a lot of stress on the whole investigation,"" said Rafael Mafei, a law professor at the University of Sao Paulo. ""It was a very public incident broadcast live on television and involved an ex-president.""

Mafei said Moro's methods test the limits of the law but are warranted by the scale of the graft scheme, a situation he compared to Colombia's war on drug cartels in the 1990s.

""Many Brazilians believe that our existing legal system is poorly equipped to handle such massive illegality that is larger than the justice system itself,"" he said.

Crucially, Moro's tactics have won the backing of higher courts in dealing with Brazil's biggest ever corruption scandal, in which a cartel of builders overcharged Petrobras for contracts, paying bribes to company directors and kickbacks to politicians.

Prosecutors have struck more than a dozen plea bargain deals and none of them have been denied by the Supreme Court, which has to approve testimony before it can be accepted as evidence.

While some Supreme Court justices questioned the way police arrived unannounced to pick up Lula, they publicly backed the investigation.

Moro has used questioning in custody and lengthy pre-trial detentions to garner information leading to dozens of arrests and the recovery of billions of dollars in bribes and political kickbacks.

Backed by an elite police unit in commando gear, officers arrived at Lula's Sao Paulo apartment last Friday at dawn and took the 70-year-old into custody for over three hours of questioning on suspicion he took bribes paid by engineering firms with graft money.

Lula's lawyer said the measure was based on scant evidence and illegal because the former union leader should have been served a subpoena asking him to make a statement before a warrant was issued to bring him in.

""They arrived by surprise with a disproportionate show of force, intent on making a public spectacle of his detention,"" his lawyer, Cristiano Martins, told Reuters. ""You cannot resort to illegal methods under the pretext of fighting corruption, just by saying the ends justify the means.""

COURTS BACK UP PROSECUTORS

Lula, popular leftist leader who was president from 2003 to 2010, went straight to the headquarters of the ruling Workers' Party after his questioning and rallied his followers to take to the streets to defend him.

His protege President Dilma Rousseff, fighting to survive the scandal amid a severe recession, said Lula's detention was ""unnecessary"" because he would have answered questions voluntarily.

The Workers' Party said the move was aimed at destroying Lula's legacy as defender of the poor so he cannot run again for president in 2018.

Federal prosecutors insist that they will push ahead with the probe regardless of the consequences.

""The storm will pass. Our only concern is that our investigations not be used politically by one side or the other,"" said a senior official in the federal prosecutor's office, known as the PGR.

Prosecutors are confident the Supreme Court will accept a plea bargain testimony of Workers' Party senator Delcidio do Amaral, reports of which sent shockwaves through Brazil's political establishment last week.

According to the IstoE news magazine, which had access to the document, Amaral accused Rousseff of trying to interfere in the Petrobras investigation, an impeachable offense, and said her 2014 re-election campaign was funded by graft money.

ODEBRECHT PUT AWAY

Lawyers for Marcelo Odebrecht, former CEO of Latin America's largest engineering group, criticized judicial overreach in arguing for his release after six months of pre-trial detention, but Brazil's second-highest court voted against the appeal.

Odebrecht was sentenced on Tuesday to 19 years in prison for bribery, money laundering and organized crime.

Prosecutors hope the stiff sentence will lead one of Brazil's richest men to seek a plea bargain.

Last month, the Supreme Court ruled convicted criminals should start their prison sentence as soon as it is confirmed by the circuit court and not after a lengthy appeals process.

The decision will reinforce Moro's strategy, Mafei said.

The Supreme Court ruling prompted Workers' Party lawmaker Wadih Damous to proposed a bill banning plea bargains by anyone in jail.

""Anyone behind bars will do anything to get out, even lie,"" the congressman said.

Damous echoed Rousseff's criticism of frequent leaks of plea bargain testimony to Brazilian media before courts rule on whether the evidence is valid.

""Every time a defendant's plea bargain is leaked, it becomes truth the very next day,"" he said.

BRUXELLES L'Italia, unitamente a Belgio, Croazia, Finlandia e Romania, ha ricevuto un 'early warning' dalla Commissione europea sui conti pubblici.

Bruxelles e preoccupata per il rispetto delle regole europee di bilancio e chiede per questo misure di aggiustamento entro meta aprile.

E quanto emerge da un comunicato della Commissione e dalla lettera che la stessa Commissione ha inviato al governo italiano.

In base alle stime macroeconomiche invernali la Commissione evidenzia nella lettera inviata all'Italia il rischio di significativa deviazione rispetto agli obiettivi 2016. Questo giudizio vale anche nel caso non venissero considerate le spese eccezionali sostenute dall'Italia per i migranti.

Prima del giudizio finale di maggio, che potrebbe contenere nuove raccomandazioni, la Commissione valutera per l'Italia e per gli altri quattro paesi i nuovi documenti economici per il 2016 e i loro programmi di convergenza, incluse le nuove misure dopo il giudizio di oggi.

Piu grave la situazione della Spagna alla quale la Commissione riserva una raccomandazione specifica (ACR) sulla ncesssita di procedere a misure correttive per riportare in tempo utile il deficit entro i limiti previsti da Bruxelles.

""Abbiamo identificato sei paesi le cui strategie di bilancio possono comportare rischi circa il rispetto dei loro impegni per il Patto di Stabilita e crescita. C'e ancora tempo per prendere le misure necessarie e per questo oggi stiamo mandando un primo early warning"" ha detto il vice-presidente della Commissione Valdis Dombrovskis in una nota.

I moniti arrivano un mese prima del 15 aprile, scadenza per presentare a Bruxelles i loro piani di bilancio pluriennali.

Lunedi 7 marzo l'Eurogruppo, nella sua nota finale, aveva sottolineato che l'Italia rischia di non rispettare i vincoli di bilancio anche nel caso di ottenimento dell'intera flessibilita aggiuntiva richiesta. Si tratta dello 0,6% del Pil, poco meno di 10 miliardi di euro. La stessa nota sottolineava le preoccupazioni sul livello del debito/pil nonostante la stabilizzazione del rapporto nel 2015 e la stima governativa di un calo nel 2016.

""Abbiamo fatto tutto il possibile per allertare le autorita nazionali sui rischi di rispetto dei vincoli. Adesso e in capo ai paesi fare tesoro di questo quando presenteranno i loro programmi di medio-termine ad aprile"" ha detto il commissario agli Affari eocnomici e monatari Pierre Moscovici.

Nei giorni scorsi il ministro dell'Economia Pier Carlo Padoan si e detto non preoccupato del richiamo della Commissione in arrivo.

reuters.com,2016-03-10 00:24:56+00:00,Exclusive: Bank of America hiring bankers for new middle-market push - sources,"['Dan Freed', 'Olivia Oran']","Bank of America Corp is hiring a new team of investment bankers who cater to midsized companies, four years after dismantling a similar business, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The precise number of middle-market bankers it plans to add could not be determined, but one person said it would be fewer than 10.

The hiring comes as Bank of America is reducing staff more broadly, while also trying to grow in areas where it believes it can gain market share. As the second-biggest U.S. lender with a large commercial banking business, executives believe Bank of America can make inroads in advising midsized companies on mergers and stock and bond offerings, the sources said. Bank of America defines middle-market as companies with $50 million to $2 billion in revenue.

The bank also hopes the push will lead to additional business such as managing money for executives at midsized companies.

Sources asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media about matters that have not been made public.

Bank of America announced internally last year that Vice Chairman Mark Stephanz would create a group that provides investment banking services to midsized companies. The hiring is part of that effort. His team will work together with counterparts in the commercial bank who provide traditional loans and cash management services, sources said.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender previously launched a middle-market business in 2007, with more than 30 investment bankers who focused on mergers and acquisitions. It abandoned the effort in 2012 to focus on larger clients and bigger deals, sources said. In 2015, Bank of America ranked fourth in global M&A league tables, according to Thomson Reuters data. It ranked 23rd globally in deals worth $500 million or less. Bank of America generated around 17 percent of its M&A fees from middle market deals, the lowest percentage of any big Wall Street bank except Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Last year, M&A hit a record volume of nearly $5 trillion, due to mega deals like Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA's $106 billion acquisition of SABMiller Plc and oil company Royal Dutch Shell Plc's $70 billion purchase of BG Group Plc. But some Wall Street executives predict blockbuster deals will slow down this year. In January, JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said she expects to see fewer massive mergers and more mid-sized deals.

Bank of America has been hiring salespeople to drum up business, even as it has cut support staff and underperformers as part of a multiyear cost-cutting initiative. Last year alone, it cut more than 10,000 jobs.

The bank laid off a number of investment bankers on Tuesday because of weak markets, one of the sources said.

Traders expect the ECB on Thursday to cut its deposit rate by at least 10 basis points and expand its asset-buying program. More ECB stimulus would put downward pressure on the euro but analysts have said ECB policymakers may not deliver the levels of easing traders expect.

The single currency was little changed at $1.1008, erasing an earlier 0.6 percent fall against the dollar EUR=. The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against the euro, yen and four other currencies, dipped 0.1 percent.

In the bond market, yields of U.S. safe-haven government bonds rose as some investors bet the recent decline in yields due to global growth concerns was overdone.

Yields extended their climb as weak demand for $20 billion worth of 10-year government debt stoked a wave of selling.

The benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RR was last down 17/32 in price to yield 1.891 percent, up from 1.834 percent late on Tuesday.

Copper, zinc and other base metals rose as speculators piled back into the market on hopes more production cuts would lead to shortages. Three-month copper in London CMCU3 closed up 1.4 percent at $4,935 a tonne.

Industrial output rose by a weaker-than-expected 0.3 percent month-on-month in January after a 1.1 percent drop in December, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected it to rise 0.5 percent.

Output in manufacturing rose 0.7 percent on the month following a 0.3 percent dip, the first increase for four months and easily topping expectations for a 0.2 percent uptick.

The monthly Markit/CIPS survey of British manufacturers also showed the sector enjoyed an unexpectedly strong January, but it then suggested factory activity barely grew last month.

Britain has been one of the fastest-growing major advanced economies in the world for the last couple of years. But it has relied heavily on domestically focused services for growth, frustrating hopes for a better-balanced recovery.

Economic growth slowed in the second half of last year and economists say it could lose more momentum in early 2016.

Industrial output was still 10.2 percent below its peak in early 2008 during the three months to January 2016, while manufacturing output was 6.4 percent smaller.

The manufacturing sector failed to contribute to British economic growth last year.

Finance minister George Osborne has warned that the economy was facing a ""dangerous cocktail"" of risks from overseas in 2016, as growth slows in major emerging markets, stock markets tumble and oil prices slump amid fading global demand.

Economists say that the Britain's planned referendum on its European Union membership could also drag on growth.

North Sea oil and gas extraction fell 6.3 percent on the month, the biggest drop since June 2014, which the ONS said could be linked to bad weather.

Brent crude oil prices slid almost 7 percent in January following a 35 percent drop for 2015 as a whole.

Compared with a year ago, industrial output was 0.2 percent higher in January.

reuters.com,,The Worlds Most Influential Scientific Minds,"['Using Citation Analysis To Identify Authors Whose Scientific Scholarly Papers Wield Outsized Influence', 'Julia Laurin', 'Vp Head Of Product Management Government Academia']","Every year upwards of 9 million scientists and scholars publish their findings in academic journals producing papers that, according to some estimates, likely number in excess of 2 million.

With such prodigious output, the task of qualifying the value of each piece of work is challenging. Nevertheless, the research community, publishers, academic administrators and others seek such designation, beyond who has the highest salaries, biggest laboratories or office shelves with the most awards.

One strategy is to concentrate on the research papers themselvesspecifically, the extent to which they have assisted, inspired or challenged other researchers. Papers meeting this standard earn a clear distinction when other authors explicitly footnote, or cite, the reports in their subsequent work. A paper that other authors have frequently cited has quantifiably proved itself to be significant.

Extending this logic provides a clear avenue: to seek out authors who have consistently produced papers which have, in turn, won peer approval in the form of high citation counts.

This approach is embodied in the latest Thomson Reuters report on The Worlds Most Influential Scientific Minds, covering the main areas of science and the social sciences, presenting the researchers who, in their respective fields, have contributed markedly high numbers of top-cited papers over a recent ten-year period. The report also includes a section on the worlds hottest scientists, whose work within the last two years has been cited at a notably rapid clip.

The Top 1%

Compiled annually, the Most Influential Scientific Minds report reflects data from the Thomson Reuters Highly Cited Researchers website, with publication and citation figures drawn from Essential Science Indicators (ESI), a component of the Web of Science. Among its assorted features and metrics, ESI tracks papers published in the last decade that rank in the top 1% most cited for their respective years of publication in each of 22 main subject fields. These reports, officially designated as Highly Cited Papers, numbered more than 120,000 in a recent analysis covering the years 2003 to 2013.

Thomson Reuters analysts identified author names listed on multiple reports within each ESI field. (Each paper is assigned to only one field, depending on the journal in which it appeared. Any paper published in a multidisciplinary journal, such as Science or Nature, is assigned based on algorithmic analysis of the literature predominantly cited by the paper, as well as of the journals which subsequently cited the report. For example, a Science paper that mostly cites immunology reports, and is in turn cited by papers published in immunology journals, would be assigned to the field of Immunology.)

Once the papers have been accurately attributed, the authors are listed within each ESI field according to the number of Highly Cited Papers to their credit. In all, the current listing of Highly Cited Researchers features more than 3,100 names.

Size Matters

The specialty areas covered by ESI differ drastically in size. That is, some fields are characterized by greater numbers of journals, in which larger populations of authors publish more papers, and therefore greater quantities of Highly Cited Papers. For example, the field of Clinical Medicine is the largest in ESI, accounting for about 12% of the databases total content. Economics & Business, meanwhile, contributes just over 2%.

The relative size of each ESI field, in terms of the overall number of Highly Cited Papers, was factored into the thresholds that determined how many authors to feature in each field. Varying thresholds are also included in determining how many Highly Cited Papers were required to qualify a given author.

Figure 1 reflects the variance in the size and the corresponding yield of Highly Cited Researchers for the top 10 of the 21 ESI fields, showing the number of authors within each area. Clinical Medicine, as noted earlier, is unmistakably predominant.",[]
reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:46:41+00:00,Signs of life for Apple's stock as Wall St. eyes new iPhone,['Noel Randewich'],"SAN FRANCISCO After months of declines in Apple's (AAPL.O) stock, sentiment appears to be mending as investors focus on steady earnings expectations and bet that the expected launch of a new iPhone will add badly-needed fuel to sputtering sales.

Battered by nearly a year of off-and-on declines from record highs because of fears of a slowdown in iPhone sales, Apple's stock now is valued closer to IBM, which has disappointed Wall Street for the past four years with declining revenue, than to Silicon Valley technology pioneers Alphabet and Tesla Motors.

Apple shares have increased 5 percent in the past two weeks as Wall Street bets the company this month will launch a less expensive iPhone to boost sales in developing countries like China. With U.S. consumers upgrading their smartphones less often, manufacturers have been relying on China for growth.

Shareholders this week pointed to Apple's reliable cash generation, beaten down valuation and its wild card potential for future game-changing products as key reasons for owning it.

""This company has a history of doing better than expectations and surprising people,"" said Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust Company, which holds over 1 million shares of Apple. ""Where else can I go and find a company trading at 10 or 11 times earnings that has had such a great history?""

At $100.97 a share on Wednesday, Apple is selling at 10.7 times its expected earnings per share over the next 12 months. Its average forward price-earnings-ratio has been 13 over the past two years.

By comparison, Internet behemoth Alphabet (GOOGL.O), whose Android mobile platform competes against Apple's iOS, trades at 20 times expected earnings and 13-year old Tesla Motors (TSLA.O) trades at 132 times earnings. International Business Machines (IBM.N), which is struggling to expand into a high-growth business like cloud computing, has a P/E of 10.2, according to Thomson Reuters data.

""Unless something big happens, (Apple) doesn't deserve to trade at 20 to 25 times earnings anymore. It's just too big,"" said David Meier, a portfolio manager at Motley Fool Funds. ""But as a high-quality company, could it trade at 15 times earnings? Certainly.""

A target of 15 times its next 12 months' expected earnings would put Apple at around $138.

In another hint of improving sentiment, Apple's stock has recently moved above its 50-day moving average for the first time since December.

The stock's selloff in recent months has boosted Apple's dividend yield to 2.2 percent from 1.5 percent a year ago.

Analysts' covering Apple have been little help to investors. Ahead of the stock's 20-percent drop that started in December, 41 analysts recommended buying Apple shares while just one recommended selling, according to Thomson Reuters data. Currently, no analysts recommend selling, while 38 recommend buying.

A new iPhone with a smaller 4-inch screen will likely boost volumes by about 5 percent this year, an increase not yet incorporated into Wall Street's expectations, Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski wrote in a report on Monday.

Apple chip supplier Dialog Semiconductor (DLGS.DE) on Tuesday forecast March-quarter revenue below analysts' expectations, but said it still expects single-digit growth for the year. That suggests the March quarter could mark the low-point in iPhone shipments, with demand for new models building later in the year, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a research note.

Jeffrey Carbone, Senior Partner at Cornerstone Financial Partners, said Apple remains a staple holding at his firm but that he has recently turned his attention to Apple suppliers including Skyworks Solutions (SWKS.O), which he believes is undervalued.

""We have a normal weighting on Apple, we like the company, but we think the supply chain could have greater potential,"" Carbone said.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Why America could (probably) survive a President Trump,"['Peter Apps Is Reuters Global Affairs Columnist Writing On International Affairs Globalization Conflict Other Issues He Is Also Founder Executive Director Of The Project For Study Of The Century A Non-national Non-partisan Non-ideological Think Tank Operating In London New York Washington Prior To That He Spent Years As A Reporter For Reuters Covering Defense Political Risk Emerging Markets', 'Peter Apps', 'Posted Cheeze', 'Posted Moriganti', ""Any Opinions Expressed Here Are The Author's Own"", 'Posted Mottjr', 'Posted Uaus']","One of the more fascinating things this election has been watching it dawn far too late on many pundits and the political establishment that Donald Trump might actually win the Republican nomination. Now, of course, the question is rather starker  could he win the presidency, and what happens if he does?

The conclusion, in my experience talking to many Washington policy types of both political persuasions, frequently includes a swear word. Foreign diplomats, officials and policy experts often take a similar view.

For sure, Trump is like no politician in recent American history. For now, I dont necessarily expect him to win  his supporters might be enthusiastic, but he could be even more effective at getting his opponents out to vote against him.

Still, there are routes by which he could win, particularly if Democrats fail to come out for Hillary Clinton as expected.

Even if that doesnt happen, the Trump phenomenon is part of a much wider  perhaps even global  political trend. That could have implications well beyond the United States.

Indeed, America is one of the few countries in the world that could actually withstand a Trump-type presidency.

For all his rhetoric, a President Trump would, like all other occupants of the Oval Office, find himself constrained by the Constitution, judiciary and Congress. Even if the Republicans do retain control of the House and Senate, many members of Congress are already voicing their opposition. And if a Trump presidency proves as contentious as many expect, it could easily deliver the Democrats control of Congress in 2018.

Earlier this month, I took a shot at imagining in more detail what future historians might make of a Trump presidency. My conclusion was that he might last one term, achieve much less than he initially expected and quite possibly exert considerable energy on minor changes to real estate laws.

That doesnt mean he wouldnt have an effect, particularly on perceptions of the United States in the rest of the world. The optics of his rhetoric on Islam is already playing badly in the Middle East. As president, that  particularly if tied to more indiscriminate military action  could prove disastrous.

Still, overall he would be restrained. And, just like the current incumbent of the White House, would probably leave largely frustrated by what he had failed to do.

While Trump is a unique political creature, the forces he is riding go much deeper and wider  and have been growing for a while. Ultimately, what he is really taking on is much deeper societal frustration  particularly with political elites on both sides. His strength is that he looks authentic, and he has successfully used both social and traditional media to persuade huge swathes of supporters that he is the candidate most like them and most in tune with their  not always politically correct  instincts.

On the left in the United States, we have simultaneously seen Bernie Sanders harnessing some of the same frustrations to mount a credible challenge to Hillary Clinton. In Europe, weve seen the rise of both non-traditional left and right parties.

Weve also seen unexpectedly left-wing leaders in particular  for example, Britains opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn  seize control of what had been much more moderate mainstream political parties.

In most cases, those elected so far have remained relatively committed to operating within established political systems. Some of the more radical groups  such as Marine Le Pens far right in France  have performed worse than many expected. (France is, after all, a country that endured Nazi occupation in relatively recent history.)

That may not always be the case, though  none of these frustrations are going away and in Europe, the migrant crisis may yet fuel a further move either to the extremes or to more generic authoritarianism. The chaos of the 1990s in Russia, after all, helped set the scene for the rise of Vladimir Putin.

Already, some Europe experts talk of a rise in authoritarianism, particularly in the communist states of the former Eastern Bloc. Hungary has seen the rise of Viktor Orban and his far-right Jobbik party. Poland has seen something similar, while this months elections in Slovakia saw a much-better-than-expected performance by the very far right.

Like Trump, these leaders are invariably nationalist, more isolationist, anti-globalization in general and anti-migrant in particular.

Thats when political systems become really important. In the United Kingdom, the parliamentary system usually keeps the fringe parties  such as the anti-EU UK Independence Party  almost entirely sidelined from elected office. (Although the rise of the Scottish National Party, which now controls most parliamentary seats in Scotland, is probably another sign of this trend.)

In Germany, however, a much more proportional representation-based system means that a radical Trump-type figure could make himself a kingmaker in German politics with a small share of votes, say 25 percent. In the 1930s, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis were able to use that kind of platform to take control of the entire country.

The United States isnt Weimar Germany, and Donald Trump isnt Hitler (despite the words of comedian Louis C.K.) But it says a lot about the United States founders and system of government that it could likely survive a politician worse than The Donald.",[]

reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:12:59+00:00,Virginia auto dealer group sues Tesla to stop second store in state,['Reuters Editorial'],"A Tesla logo is pictured on the hub of a car during the second media day of the 86th International Motor Show in Geneva, Switzerland, March 2, 2016.

DETROIT The Virginia Automobile Dealers Association (VADA) on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and Virginia state officials to keep the electric car maker from opening a second dealership in the state.

The VADA claims in the suit filed in circuit court in Fairfax County, Virginia, that Tesla and the state's Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner, Richard D. Holcomb, are violating a 2013 agreement that Tesla could not consider owning and operating a second dealership in Virginia until at least August 2017.

Tesla has a dealership in Tysons Corner in the relatively affluent area of northern Virginia near Washington, D.C., which opened in February 2015.

Don Hall, president of the VADA, said in an interview with Reuters that Tesla and the Virginia DMV tried to keep the VADA in the dark about Tesla's efforts to open a second dealership.

The suit claims that Holcomb named a hearing officer for a DMV hearing of the Tesla request and that a hearing is set for March 31.

""They tried to get this done very quickly, in the dark of the night, in hopes that no one could know about it,"" Hall said.

A member of his organization learned of a real estate deal for property in Richmond for a Tesla store, alerting him to the request and, eventually, the lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Hall said.

Calls to Tesla and to the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles were not immediately returned on Wednesday afternoon.

Tesla has been fighting for the right to own and operate its own dealerships, and has sought to open its own stores in several states despite franchise laws that do not allow, in most cases, a manufacturer to own and operate an auto dealership.

ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: And welcome to The Whiting Auditorium on the campus of the Flint Cultural Center in Flint, Michigan for a special CNN democratic presidential debate.

COOPER: Im Anderson Cooper. I want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. Tonights debate will be seen on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Espanol, by American soldiers, sailors, and airmen on the American Forces Network, and nationwide on the Westwood One Radio Network.

And now we want to welcome the Democratic candidates for president of the United States, please welcome Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Please welcome former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Ladies and gentlemen, the Democratic candidates for president of the United States!

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Before we begin tonight, we want to take a moment to remember former first lady Nancy Reagan. As probably know she passed away this morning at the age of 94. Her grace and elegance in the White House, her deep love for President Reagan, and her strength and advocacy in the fight against Alzheimers and drug abuse will always be remembered. We would like to pause of a moment of silence in honor of Mrs. Reagan.

And now will you please rise for our national anthem performed by the Flint City Wide Choir, conducted by Darnell Ishmel. (MUSIC PLAYING, THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER)

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Our thanks to the Flint City Wide Choir.

Candidates take your positions behind the podium. Before we begin as the candidates take their positions, I just want to set out some ground rules as moderators, Ill ask questions, Ill ask follow- ups and guide the discussion. The candidates will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions. Theyll have 30 seconds for follow- ups. CNNs Don Lemon will join me in the questioning, as will members of our audience here tonight. The members of our audience are Democrats and independents from Flint and elsewhere in Michigan. Weve reviewed their questions just so they dont overlap.

Now weve come to Flint because this is a city in crisis, a city where, as you probably know, the tap water is toxic. Public servants, public institutions not only failed to prevent the crisis, their decisions created this crisis. The state of Michigan, in an effort to save money, switched Flints water source to a cheaper, but riskier alternative, the Flint River. Safeguards were ignored. That river water corroded residential pipes, and for nearly two years, lead leaked into the water used in peoples homes. Now, for much of that time, the state downplayed the danger, even in the face of growing complaints and physical evidence.

For 100 days, the federal government knew about it, and yet in all that time nobody told the people of Flint. They bathed in the water, they drank it, and so did their kids. Even today, lead is still present in some of the water.

Tonight the Democratic candidates are here to answer questions about what they would do for Flint, as well as about other issues facing their country right now.

Each candidate has one minute for an opening statement, Senator Sanders is first. We begin with him. Senator Sanders?

SEN. BERNARD SANDERS, I-VT.: Anderson, thank you very much.

Over the last several weeks I had the opportunity to meet with a number of residents of Flint at a town meeting in Flint, and I have to tell you what I heard, and what I saw literally shattered me. And, it was beyond belief that children in Flint, Michigan in the United States of America in the year 2016 are being poisoned.

That is clearly not what this country should be about.

As Anderson indicated, theres a lot of blame to go around, and one of the points that I have made is that I believe the Governor of this state should understand that his dereliction of duty was irresponsible. He should resign.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: But more importantly, what is happening in Flint to a lesser degree is happening throughout this country. In recent years we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires, and increase in income and wealth inequality, and all over this country middle class families are struggling. Cities and towns are struggling, in order to provide basic services. Among many other things, we need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our water systems, our waste water plants, our roads and our bridges. The wealthiest country in the history of the world has got to get its priorities right, take care of the people, no more tax breaks for billionaires.

COOPER: Thank you, Senator.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, Ill start by saying amen to that.

(APPLAUSE)

We are here in Flint, Im very grateful that my request that we hold this debate be held here so we can continue to shine a very bright spotlight on what has happened in this city.

I agree, the Governor should resign, or be recalled...

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: ... support the efforts of citizens attempting to achieve that. But, that is not enough. We have to focus on what must be done to help the people of Flint.

I support a hundred percent the efforts by your senators and members of congress to get the money from the federal government in order to begin the work that must occur to fix the infrastructure. The state should also be sending money immediately to help this city.

(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)

CLINTON: I know the state of Michigan has a rainy day fund for emergencies, what is more important than the health and wellbeing of the people, particularly children? It is raining lead in Flint, and the state is derelict in not coming forward with the money that is required.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: And, well get to what we need to do to help the children and the people when I have a little more time because thats just as important as fixing the pipes.

COOPER: Were going to have a lot of time for that. We want to begin tonight with the people of Flint themselves. This is Mikki Wade, shes a public housing program manager, and the mother of two kids. She says shes currently undecided, and has a question that both of you will be able to weigh in on. Ms. Wade?

QUESTION: The water has impacted our lives in such a way that living comfortably in our home isnt the same anymore. The constant drives to pick up water just so my children can wash their hair, to wash our fruits and vegetables, and to brush our teeth is incredibly difficult. Once the pipes are replaced, Im not so sure I would be comfortable ever drinking the water.

QUESTION: If elected president, what course will you take to regain my trust in the government?

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, well begin with you.

CLINTON: Well Nikki, its a very fair question.

Your government at all levels have let you and your children and the people of Flint down. So I think that there are there several things. All the repair work that is being done  and Mayor Weaver program that we support to begin to help train people in Flint to be able to do this work to distribute the water. Everything that is done has to be triple checked to regain your trust and to hold those who are responsible for fixing the pipes and delivering the clean water which has you said, you bathe in it and drink it and wash food in it. You do everything with it.

Every one of us should have to run through in our minds how we use water every single day to understand the pressures and the real pain that families are going through. So I will make sure as President that I double and triple check. I will work with elected officials who I trust like your mayor and like your senators and member of Congress so that we can assure you that when its fixed, you can trust it. You deserve nothing less.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me follow-up with that, he people here still wasnt drink the water in their homes as you well know. They cant bathe their kids in the water and they are desperate for accountability and specifics. As president can you give a specific about what you can do if you were president that would make Ms. Wades life better and life better for people here?

CLINTON: Well, I support what President Obama is doing. He called for and got accountability from the officials at the EPA to make sure the state is doing its job. He expanded Medicaid for helping kids particularly to get the health care they need. He is also ordered that there be a Head Start program. I support that.

When it comes to the water itself, we are supporting a program that Mayor Waver announced through Flint Waterworks to pay people in Flint, not outsiders, but people here to deliver the water while we are fixing the pipes. I would do even more of that. As president, what we were able to put together was a beginning. As president, I would concentrate resources on the city for economic development for more jobs as we fix the water and provide the health and education, interventions that children need. COOPER: Senator Sanders for Ms. Wade specifically?

SANDERS: What is going is a disgrace beyond belief. As the president of the United States, this is what I would do is if local government does not have the resources  if state government for whatever reason America shouldnt be poisoned, federal government comes in, federal government acts.

(APPLAUSE)

What is absolute incredible to me is that water rates have soared in Flint. You are paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vermont for clean water.

First thing is you say, people are not paying a water bill for poison and that is retroactive.

(APPLAUSE)

Second of all, to ease anxiety, CDC has to come in and examine every child and adult in this community in terms of the amount of lead they may have. Thirdly, the wealthiest country has to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure, our water systems. I have a bill for a trillion dollars, it creates 13 million jobs rebuilding flint, Michigan and communities all over the country.

COOPER: Thank you, senator.

(APPLAUSE)

We will have more on the infrastructure shortly but I want to follow up with you.

This crisis in flint as you know, as everybody in the room knows was created by the government. Your policies are about expanding government. Why should people from flint trust that more government is the answer?

SANDERS: Thats a good point, Anderson.

Listen, I suppose they can trust the corporations who have destroyed Flint by a disastrous trade policy which have allowed them to shut down plants in flint and move to China or Mexico. We could trust them Im sure.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Or maybe  you know, maybe, Anderson, tell you what  we should  maybe we should let Wall Street come in and run the city of Flint...

(APPLAUSE)

... because we know their honesty and integrity has done so much for the American people. Look, we live in a democracy, and Im not in (ph) the last person to deny that government is failing in many respects.

But at the end of the day, I will trust the people to create a government that works for them, rather than Wall Street or corporate America.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton  Secretary Clinton, you  youve now both called for the governor to resign. I believe thats  thats new for you. Previously, you had not called for that, but youre calling for that tonight.

Its easy to blame the Republican governor, Rick Snyder. But the federal government also dropped the ball here. According to Section 1414 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA has to step in and take action when a state is informed at (ph)  about water problems and doesnt do anything for 30 days, as the state here didnt do.

The EPA knew for months and months, never warned the people of Flint not to drink the water. As president, would you fire the head of the EPA?

CLINTON: Well, I think that the people here in the region, who knew about this and failed to follow what you just said, rightly, the law required, have been eliminated from the EPA.

COOPER: So far, one person has resigned.

CLINTON: I dont  well, I dont know how high it goes. I would certainly be launching an investigation. I think there is one. I was told that  you know, some of the higher-ups were pushing to get changes that were not happening.

So I would have a full investigation, determine who knew what, when. And yes, people should be fired. How far up it went, I dont know. But as far as it goes, they should be relieved, because they failed this city.

But let me just add this, Anderson. This is not the only place where this kind of action is needed. We have a lot of communities right now in our country where the level of toxins in the water, including lead, are way above what anybody should tolerate.

(APPLAUSE)

We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint. So Im not satisfied with just doing everything we must do for Flint. I want to tackle this problem across the board. And if people know about it and theyre not acting, and theyre in the government at any level, they should be forced to resign.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, would a President Sanders fire the head of the EPA?

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: President Sanders would fire anybody who knew about what was happening and did not act appropriately.

(APPLAUSE)

And President Sanders would make the point that, how does it happen, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world? What are our priorities when, among others, Republicans today are fighting for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest people?

How did we have so much money available to go to war in Iraq and spend trillions of dollars...

(APPLAUSE)

... but somehow not have enough money  not just for Flint, the secretary is right. There are communities all over this country  its not just infrastructure, it is education. Detroits public school system is collapsing.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Thank you  thank you, Senator.

SANDERS: Anderson, the bottom line is, and what my campaign is, is changing our national priorities. We need a government that works for all of us...

COOPER: Thank you, Senator.

SANDERS: ... not just wealthy campaign contributors.

COOPER: I want to go to Lee-Anne Walters. This is Lee-Anne Walters. She was one of the first people to report problems with the water in Flint. One of her twin boys stopped growing. Her daughter lost her hair.

She says shes undecided, and has a question for both of you to answer, but well start with Senator Sanders. Ms. Walters?

QUESTION: After my family, the city of Flint and the children in D.C. were poisoned by lead, will you make a personal promise to me right now that, as president, in your first 100 days in office, you will make it a requirement that all public water systems must remove all lead service lines throughout the entire United States, and notification made to the  the citizens that have said service lines.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: I will make a personal promise to you that the EPA and the EPA director that I appoint will make sure that every water system in the United States of America is tested, and that the people of those communities know the quality of the water that they are drinking, and that we are gonna have a plan to rebuild water systems in this country that are unsafe for drinking.

COOPER: Let me just point out for accuracys sake, there is 10 million lead service pipes delivering water to people all across this country tonight. Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: Well, I agree completely. I want to go further though. I want us to have an absolute commitment to getting rid of lead wherever it is because its not only in water systems, its also in soil, and its in lead paint that is found mostly in older homes. Thats why 500,000 children today have lead  lead in their bodies.

So, I want to do exactly what you said. We will commit to a priority to change the water systems, and we will commit within five years to remove lead from everywhere.

We were making progress on this in the 1990s. I worked with then Senator Obama to get more money, more support to do more to remove lead.

COOPER: Thank you.

CLINTON: That has, unfortunately, been in many ways, moved to a lower priority. I will elevate it, and I will do everything I can. Water, soil, and paint...

COOPER: ... Thank you...

CLINTON: ... Were going to get rid of it.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Thank you, Secretary. I want to go to my colleague, Don Lemon.

LEMON: Anderson, thank you very much. Secretary Clinton, tonight you call for the resignation, or for Governor Snyder to be recalled. There are residents of this city who want to see criminal charges brought against those who are responsible. Do you think people should go to jail?

CLINTON: Well, thats going to be up to the legal system, Don. I mean, I cant standing here  I dont have all the facts, but people should be held accountable wherever that leads. If it leads to resignation, or recall if youre in political office.

If it leads to civil penalties, if it leads to criminal responsibility. There has to be an absolute accountability, and I will support whatever the outcome of those investigations are.

LEMON: Senator Sanders, do you think people should go to jail?

SANDERS: Well, I agree, you know? We cant sit up here  I cant sit up here and make judgment over whether or not somebody committed a criminal act. But, I will tell you this that after an investigation, if people, in fact, were found to have committed a criminal act  I talked to a mother.

Imagine this for a second, imagine a mother who had a bright seven-year-old gregarious girl doing well in school. Two years later, that child is now in special education, intellectual capabilities significantly deteriorated. That is a crime against that child, and the people of Flint. And, clearly, people are going to have to be held accountable.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Secretary.

I want to turn now to Bryn Mickle, the editor of the Flint Journal, hes our local partner in this debate. He has our next question.

Bryn?

QUESTION: Secretary Clinton, it took this water crisis for politicians like yourself to notice we are a city in trouble. Youve only both recently started talking about Flint, holding campaign events here in just the past few weeks. Secretary Clinton, youve even made the crisis a centerpiece of a new campaign ad. Why should the people of Flint believe that you arent just using this crisis to secure political points?

CLINTON: Well, I think because throughout my public career I have been evening the odds for people in every way that I could. I started out with the Childrens Defense Fund, I worked throughout my time as a young lawyer as a person, an activist. Certainly, in Arkansas, then in the White House, to try to fix problems wherever I saw them.

And, this problem is one that is particularly outrageous and painful at the same time.

So, when I heard about it I immediately sent people here to find out what was going on. It was almost unbelievable. We have this problem in other places, but we dont say that it was actually caused by decisions made by public officials in positions of authority, as this one was.

Then, when I talked to the mayor I basically said, What can I do to help?

Then, when I came here, and I met with some of the mothers, and met their children, and heard their stories  Im just determined to do whatever I can. So, I have put together resources from the private and philanthropic communities to help provide a bridge because youve got to get the federal money, youve got to get the state money, but Im going to do everything I can. And, I will be with Flint all the way through this crisis in whatever capacity I am.

And, if Im president, it will always be a priority for action from me.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Bryn has a follow up.

QUESTION: Senator Sanders, how about you? Your first visit to Flint as a presidential candidate was just over a week ago. Thats almost five months after the people here were told to stop drinking the water. What took you so long?

SANDERS: Well, first of all, thats not quite accurate. I was here long before that. I will you what I did. What I did was meet very quietly in Detroit with parents and others who were impacted by this disaster.

And the second thing I did is hold a town meeting, which was as nonpolitical as I could make it for hundreds of people to tell me and the world through the media exactly what was happening here in Flint. I think the fear and the legitimate fear of the people of Flint is that a certain point the TV cameras and CNN will disappear.

(APPLAUSE)

And people are going to be left struggling in order to live in a safe and healthy community. All I can say is if you check my record going back a long time, I have stood with those who are hurting. I have stood with those who have no money, and I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in the United States of America. Thats my record and Im proud of it.

COOPER: Thank you, Senator.

This city is also facing a jobs crisis, 75 percent of Flints manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last 25 years and about the same amount of time, Michigan lost 230,000 manufacturing jobs.

I want to go to Tanisha Motron, she grew up in flint and now works in Detroit at the Shinola watch factory which as you know, is often held up as the blueprint for how to save American industry jobs. She says shes leaning towards secretary Clinton and has a question for her.

QUESTION: A lot of members work in the auto industry here in Flint. Thats ultimately what I wanted to do when I got out of school unfortunately, I was unable to get any one of the big three and thats why I now reside at Shinola. If you are elected president, what are you going to do to in the United States instead of sending them overseas to other countries?

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: Im going to do what I think will work which is both carrots and sticks. Let me talk about the carrots. Were going to have a very clear set of proposals and incentives for manufacturing so that we change the way that companies think about making investments again in America. I have a comprehensive manufacturing plan that I will be implementing.

Were also going to invest more on infrastructure as we both have said, its woefully under resourced. That will put a lot of people to work. I want to do more to help small businesses, they are the source of two thirds of our jobs and we have to help them start and grow, particularly minority and women-owned small businesses.

We need to do more to help create clean energy as a source of good jobs but I am also going to go after companies. You know, when a company decides to leave like Nabisco is leaving and they have gotten tax benefits from Chicago and Illinois to stay there, I will claw back the benefits. They will have to pay them back if they are leaving a place that actually invested in them.

I am also going to go after companies like Johnson Controls in Wisconsin. They came and got part of the bailout because they were an auto parts supplier and now they want to move headquarters to Europe. They are going to have to pay an exit fee. We are going to stop this kind of job exporting and we are going to start importing and growing jobs again in our country.

COOPER: Senator sanders, I will let you...

SANDERS: I am very glad, Anderson, that secretary Clinton discovered religion on this issue but its a little bit too late.

Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America.

(APPLAUSE)

NAFTA, supported by the Secretary cost, us 800,000 jobs nationwide, tens of thousands of jobs in the Midwest. Permanent normal trade relations with China cost us millions of jobs. Look, I was on a picket line in early 1990s against NFATA because you didnt need a PhD in economics to understand that American workers should not be forced to compete against people in Mexico making 25 cents an hour........

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: And the reason that I was one of the first, not one of the last to be in opposition to the TPP is that American workers...

(APPLAUSE)

... should not be forced to compete against people in Vietnam today making a minimum wage of $0.65 an hour. Look, what we have got to do is tell corporate America that they cannot continue to shut down. Weve lost 60,000 factories since 2001. Theyre going to start having to, if Im president, invest in this country  not in China, not in Mexico.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Well  well, Ill tell you something else that Senator Sanders was against. He was against the auto bailout. In January of 2009, President-Elect Obama asked everybody in the Congress to vote for the bailout.

The money was there, and had to be released in order to save the American auto industry and four million jobs, and to begin the restructuring. We had the best year that the auto industry has had in a long time. I voted to save the auto industry.

(APPLAUSE)

He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry. I think that is a pretty big difference.

SANDERS: Well, I  If you are talking about the Wall Street bailout, where some of your friends destroyed this economy...

CLINTON: You know...

SANDERS: ... through  excuse me, Im talking.

COOPER: Let him (ph) (inaudible).

(APPLAUSE)

(CROSSTALK)

CLINTON: If youre gonna talk, tell the whole story, Senator Sanders.

SANDERS: Let me tell my story. You tell yours.

CLINTON: I will.

SANDERS: Your story is for  voting for every disastrous trade agreement, and voting for corporate America. Did I vote against the Wall Street bailout?

When billionaires on Wall Street destroyed this economy, they went to Congress and they said, please, well be good boys, bail us out. You know what I said? I said, let the billionaires themselves bail out Wall Street. It shouldnt be the middle class of this country.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: OK, so...

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

SANDERS: Wait a minute. Wait. Could I finish? Youll have your turn, all right?

But ultimately, if you look at our records, I stood up to corporate America time and time again. I went to Mexico. I saw the lives of people who were working in American factories and making $0.25 an hour.

I understood that these trade agreements were going to destroy the middle class of this country. I led the fight against us (sic). That is one of the major differences that we have.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton.

CLINTON: Well, if I  if I could...

(APPLAUSE)

... to set the record straight, I voted against the only multinational trade agreement that came before me when I was in the Senate. It was called CAFTA. I came out against the TPP after it was finished. I thought it was reasonable to actually know what was in it before I opposed it. I oppose it.

(APPLAUSE)

Now let me get back to what happened in January of 2009. The Bush administration negotiated the deal. Were there things in it that I didnt like? Would I have done it differently? Absolutely.

But was the auto bailout money in it  the $350 billion that was needed to begin the restructuring of the auto industry? Yes, it was. So when I talk about Senator Sanders being a one-issue candidate, I mean very clearly  you have to make hard choices when youre in positions of responsibility. The two senators from Michigan stood on the floor and said, we have to get this money released. I went with them, and I went with Barack Obama. You did not. If everybody had voted the way he did, I believe the auto industry would have collapsed, taking four million jobs with it.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Senator Sanders?

SANDERS: I believe that the recklessness, the greed, and the illegal behavior of Wall Street drove this country into the worst economic downturn in the history of the United  modern history of the United States of America. And I will be damned if it was the working people of this country who had to bail out the crooks on Wall Street.

(APPLAUSE)

And what I proposed  and I had an amendment that was defeated  it was defeated by a voice vote on the floor of the Senate  that said to those people on the top who benefited from Wall Street greed  I said, you pay for the bailout. Dont go to my constituents, who are struggling to make ends meet.

In terms of the auto bailout, of course that made sense. In terms of the stimulus package, of course that made sense, and I strongly supported President Obamas position on that.

SANDERS: But let us be clear, one of the major issues Secretary Clinton says Im a one-issue person, well, I guess so. My one issue is trying to rebuild a disappearing middle class. Thats my one issue.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Senator Sanders...

CLINTON: Well, all I can say is that given the terrible pressures that the auto industry was under and that the middle class of this state and Ohio and Indiana and Illinois and Wisconsin and Missouri and other places in the Midwest were facing, I think it was the right decision to heed what President-elect Obama asked us to do.

He sent a letter, an authorized letter, asking us to support that to save the auto industry. Yes, were there things in it that you and I would not have necessarily wanted? Thats true. But when it came down to it, you were either for saving the auto industry or you were against it. I voted to save the auto industry. And I am very glad that I did.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Let me just say this, while we are on Wall Street, one of us has a super PAC. One of us has raised $15 million from Wall Street for that super PAC. One of us has given speeches on Wall Street for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now, I kind of think if you get paid a couple hundred thousand dollars for a speech, it must be a great speech. I think we should release it and let the American people see what that transcript was.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: And I have said and I will say again, I will be happy to release anything I have as long as everybody else does too, because what really is behind that question, Republicans and Democrats, is where I can stand up to Wall Street.

Well, lets have some facts instead of some rhetoric for a change. I went to Wall Street when I was a United States senator. I told them they were wrecking the economy. I asked for a moratorium on foreclosures. I asked that we do more to try to prevent what I worried was going to happen. I also called for closing loopholes including the carried interest loophole. I also called for changes in CEO pay. I have a record. And you know what, if you were going to be in some way distrusted or dismissed about whether you can take on Wall Street if you ever took money, President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had.

And when it came time to stand up to Wall Street, he passed and signed the toughest regulation since the Great Depression with the Dodd-Frank regulations.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, just yesterday, in fact, you said just  I believe it was yesterday you said not only her speech must have been a fantastic speech, it must have been a Shakespearean speech for that amount of money. Is her answer enough for you that she will release it when all the Republicans and Democrats do? SANDERS: All right, look, Secretary Clinton wants everybody else to release it, well, Im your Democratic opponent, I release it, here it is. There aint nothing. I dont give speeches to Wall Street for hundreds of thousands of dollars, you got it.

Second of all, when we talk about being tough on Wall Street, and this galls me and the American people. Recently Goldman Sachs, among many other major financial institutions on Wall Street, as you know, reached a settlement with the federal government for $5 billion because they were selling worthless packages of subprime mortgages, $5 billion settlement.

You know how many people, executives on Wall Street have gone to jail? If you are a kid caught with marijuana in Michigan, you get a police record. If you are an executive on Wall Street that destroys the American economy, you pay a $5 billion fine, no police record.

If I am elected president, we are going to bring justice back to a broken criminal justice system.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: Well, I think we are in vigorous agreement on this. I have said repeatedly no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail. And I have said that I would use the tools in the Dodd-Frank regulations, that if any bank posed a systemic risk to the economy, they would be broken up.

Because we now have tools, laws that we didnt have before. And I am very happy we did. Because there does need to be accountability, including criminal accountability if it is called for.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, I just want to show the audience, you sent a tweet, I want to return to trade.

You sent a tweet on Thursday, this is the tweet, Im showing it to viewers. It says the people of Detroit know the real costs of Hillary Clintons free trade policies. It shows pictures of crumbling buildings. It seems like youre blaming her for the situation in Detroit.

SANDERS: Well, Im blaming the trade policies. You know what? This is an amazing thing which I didnt know until recently, and I wonder how many people did know this.

COOPER: But, youre calling them Hillary Clintons failed trade policies.

SANDERS: Well, Hillary Clinton, and everybody else who supported these disastrous trade policies. She wasnt alone. We have many, many Republicans and far too many Democrats who supported these disastrous trade policies.

Do you know...

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: ... Do you know that in 1960 Detroit Michigan was one of the wealthiest cities in America? Flint, Michigan was a prosperous city, but then what happened is corporate America said why do I want to pay somebody in Michigan a living wage when I can pay slave wages in Mexico or China? Were going to shut down, were going to move abroad, were going to bring those products back into this country.

Those trade policies, as much as any other set of policies, has resulted in the shrinking of the American middle class. And, Ill tell you what else it did. Its not only job loss by the millions, it is the race to the bottom so that new jobs in manufacturing, in some cases today, pay 50 percent less than they did 20 years ago. How stupid is that trade policy?

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: You know, if were going to argue about the 1990s instead of talking about the future, which Id much prefer because I think every election is about the future, and you all deserve to know what we will do to help you have a brighter future  but, if we are going to talk about the 1990s I think its only fair to say that at the end of the 1990s, after two terms of my husbands presidency, the unemployment rate in Michigan was 4.4 percent.

There had been a net increase of 54,000 manufacturing jobs. There had been a net increase of 653,000 jobs overall.

And, one of the ways jobs were brought to, and grown here in Michigan was through something called the Export-Import Bank which helped a lot of businesses, particularly small businesses, be able to export around the world.

Senator Sanders opposes that. I think were in a race for exports. I think China, Germany, everybody else supports their businesses. Here in Michigan theres been $11 billion dollars in recent years used to support exports, primarily from small businesses.

I favor that, hes opposed it. I want to do everything I can for us to compete and win in the global economy...

COOPER: ... Senator Sanders...

CLINTON: ... and thats what I will do as president...

COOPER: ... I just want to explain to viewers what the Export- Import Bank is, in case everybody is not quite as wonkish as everybody on this stage here.

The Export-Import Bank, its a federal agency, it gives loans to companies that export American products. Senator Sanders, you do oppose it. The vast majority of the banks customers are small businesses, 176 right here in Michigan. What do you say to small business owners....

SANDERS: ... Ill tell you what I say...

COOPER: ... Who rely on the banks to make their company profitable...

SANDERS: ... Ill tell you what I say. Do you know what the other name of the Export-Import Bank is? What its called in Washington? Its called the bank of Boeing because Boeing itself gets 40 percent of the money discharged by the Export-Import Bank.

Seventy-Five percent of the funds going from the federal government, the Export-Import Bank, goes to large, profitable corporations. Many of these corporations have shut down in America, and have gone abroad to exploit poor people.

You know what? I dont think its a great idea for the American taxpayer to have to subsidize through corporate welfare profitable corporations who downsize in the United States of America.

COOPER: Senator...

SANDERS: ... Seventy-Five percent of that money goes to large profitable corporations.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, you are the only member of the Democratic caucus to vote against it. Youre agreeing with Senator Ted Cruz on this, why is he right and the Democrats wrong?

SANDERS: Well, let me tell you, I dont want to break the bad news.

(LAUGHTER)

SANDERS: Democrats are not always right. Democrats have often supported corporate welfare...

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Democrats have supported disastrous trade agreements, but on this issue I do not believe in corporate welfare, and in fact, secretary Clinton may know or not know, but as a member of the Financial Services Committee, I worked hard and successfully to make sure that at least 20 percent of the money went to small businesses which is where it should go and not to profitable corporations and downsizing in our country.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: When I traveled around the world on you behalf as Secretary of State and went to 112 countries, one thing I saw everywhere was how European and Asian countries were supporting their companies back in their countries, to be able to make sales and contracts in a lot of the rest of the world. In fact, without the export-import bank, supporting businesses of all sizes  I believe more jobs would be lost here at home and more jobs literally would be exported. Instead of exporting products, we would be exporting jobs.

I just believe that Senator Sanders took that lonely position because most of us who saw the results  I saw it as a senator from New York. Your Senators saw it here in Michigan. They can give you the names of 240 companies in Michigan that have been helped.

There is a company in Levonia being helped, there are companies all over this state. I know, if we are going to compete and win in the global economy, we cant let every other country support their companies and we take a hands off approach. I will not agree with that.

COOPER: Im going to let you respond but I just want to push back on this. Senator Sanders is correct, the majority of the money does go Boeing, does go to companies like Caterpillar. Do they need this money?

CLINTON: I will tell you what, Anderson, after I investigated it, I concluded they did and heres why. There two big plane manufacturers in the world, theres Airbus and Boeing. Airbus does everything it can to get contracts to sell planes everywhere in the world. We dont have as quite an aggressive outreach from our government.

I did go in many places around the world to sell American products because the alternatives were usually European, Asian, primarily Chinese products. That to me was an unacceptable concession. So yes, Boeing and other big companies get support just like their competitors do from the companies that they are from in the countries that provide the support.

COOPER: Thank you.

Senator sanders?

SANDERS: Isnt it tragic that the large multinational corporations making billions of dollars a year, shutting down in America, going to China, going to Mexico? Absolutely they need a handout from the American middle class  I dont think so.

Second of all.

(APPLAUSE)

Second of all, secretary Clinton traveled the world, she has been to Europe. And lets talk about Europe versus the United States. Im sure that when you were in Europe, and France, and Germany and the U.K., and all of the other countries; you noticed something and that is every one of those countries guarantees health care to all of their people as a right.

(APPLAUSE)

And I am sure you know as you know you do that in countries like the U.K. compared to America, we are spending almost three times as much as they spend in the U.K. for health care for our people. We are spending 50 percent more than the French. When we talk about Europe and their pluses and minuses, one thing they have done well that we should emulate and that is guaranteed health care for all people for a better care for all.

COOPER: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton, 30 seconds and we have to take a break. So 30 seconds if you can.

CLINTON: We are on the path to doing that thanks to President Obama and the Affordable Care Act, we have 90 percent coverage. We are lacking 10 percent. We are going to stay on that and get to 100 percent universal coverage.

COOPER: We have to take a break. We will continue this discussion. We have a lot more to talk about. We will take a short break.

We have more of the Presidential Democratic Debate from Flint, Michigan when we come back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

COOPER: And welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate, live here in Flint, Michigan. We want to continue the discussion now  were gonna turn to the subject of crime.

As most of you know, two weeks ago, an Uber driver in Kalamazoo, which is two hours from where we are tonight, went on a shooting rampage, killing six people, injuring two people.

One of the injured was a 14-year-old girl. Her name is Abigail Kopf. She was shot in the head, her heart stopped, she was on life support  looked like she might  might not make it. But amazingly, Abigail pulled through. Her father...

(APPLAUSE)

... her father Gene Kopf is here tonight. And I know, Gene, you have a question. But before you ask your question, I just want to ask, how is Abigail doing tonight?

QUESTION: She is now laughing and giggling, but she has a long road of physical recovery.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: I should point out you are leaning toward Senator Sanders, but I know you have a question that applies to both candidates. Well first toss it to Secretary Clinton. Whats your question?

QUESTION: The United States has had a rash of mass shootings over the years  42 shootings in the United States this year alone. The man who shot everyone, including my daughter, in Kalamazoo, had no mental health issues recorded, and had a clear background.

What do you plan to do to address this serious epidemic? I dont want to hear anything about tougher laws for mental health or criminal backgrounds, because that doesnt work....(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: Well, first of all I am looking at your daughter and Im very grateful that she is laughing and she is on a road to recovery. But it never should have happened. You know, on average, 90 people a day are killed by gun violence in our country.

I think we have to try everything that works to try to limit the numbers of people and the kinds of people who are given access to firearms. The Brady Bill, which has been in effect now for about 23 years, has kept more than two million purchases from going forward. So we do have to continue to try to work on that because not every killer will have the same profile.

But the comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online loophole, closing whats called the Charleston loophole, where you get a gun at the end of three days, even if the background check is not completed which is what the killer in Charleston did. And then they found out later, he shouldnt have gotten the gun when he killed nine people at Mother Emmanuel Church.

I also believe, so strongly Gene (ph), that giving immunity to gunmakers and sellers was a terrible mistake.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Because it removed any accountability from the makers and the sellers. And it also disrupted what was a very promising legal theory, to try to get makers to do more to make guns safer for example. To try to give sellers more accountability for selling guns when they shouldnt have. So that is an issue that Senator Sanders and I differ on, I voted against giving them immunity, but I think we should very seriously move to repeal that and go back to making sure gun makers and sellers are like any other business. They can be held accountable.

And then I do think we have got to have a public...

QUESTION: Thank you.

CLINTON: Well, weve got to have a public discussion, because we have created a culture in which people grab for guns all the time.

COOPER: Thank you. CLINTON: And there has got to be a way to have more warning signals and more efforts to try to stop that from happening like with the man who shot your daughter.

COOPER: I want to go to Senator Sanders.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Senator Sanders?

SANDERS: I remember President Obama being on television maybe three months ago. Showed the secretary members as well. She knows the president, I know the president. And he is generally speaking in public and hes not a very emotional guy. And he  after the mass killing in Oregon if my memory is correct, he said look. There  to be honest with you, lets be honest. Nobody has a magic solution to this problem.

Any lunatic tomorrow, any person can walk into a theater and do something horrific. And you know what? For us to tell you that that absolutely will not happen would be untrue. But what the president said, he said look, this is a tough issue. But we have got to do everything we possibly can to minimize the possibility of these mass killings.

You are looking at a guy who comes from a rural state with no gun control. I have a D minus voting record from the NRA. You are looking at a guy who in 1988 lost a statewide election for Congress because I was the only candidate who said you know what, I dont think its a great idea in this country to be selling military-style assault weapons which are designed to kill people.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: I lost that election by three votes. I agree with what the secretary said. We need to expand and improve the instant background checks. Bottom line is people who should not have guns in America should not be able to buy guns in America.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton mentioned the so- called Charleston loophole. What she is calling the Charleston loophole. Is that something, if you were president, you would you work to extend that three day?

SANDERS: Absolutely, I agree. Look, that bill had some sensible provisions in it. It had the banning of bullets that pierce policemens armor. Is that a good thing? I think we would want to get rid of that. particular legislation had safety locks on guns so the kids do not pick them up and shoot them. That bill had bad things in it. What I have said...

COOPER: So you would want a longer than three days waiting period?

SANDERS: Absolutely. That was a very arbitrary decision. What that real debate was about, as you may or may not know, was about how long it would take for the instant background check to go into effect. I wanted that instant background check to go into effect as soon as possible. That was the most important part of that bill.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton  actually, Senator Sanders, let me continue to follow-up, because Secretary Clinton mentioned the liability.

Right now, families of Sandy Hook victims announced that they are going to sue Remington, who made the AR-15 which was used in the Newtown massacre.

(APPLAUSE)

Now, they believe  those families believe that  that Remington, the distributors, the sellers  should be held legally responsible for how that gun  how their product is used.

Now, the lawsuit may not go anywhere because of the bill you voted for  legislation that prevents gun makers from being sued. Tonight, what do you say to those families?

SANDERS: Well, this is what I say, if I understand it  and correct me if Im wrong. If you go to a gun store and you legally purchase a gun, and then, three days later, if you go out and start killing people, is the point of this lawsuit to hold the gun shop owner or the manufacturer of that gun liable?

If that is the point, I have to tell you I disagree. I disagree because you hold people  in terms of this liability thing, where you hold manufacturers liability is if they understand that theyre selling guns into an area that  its getting into the hands of criminals, of course they should be held liable.

But if they are selling a product to a person who buys it legally, what youre really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in America. I dont agree with that.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Well, that  that is not  that is not what happened, and I think its important for people to understand.

Because of the proliferation of guns, because of the epidemic of gun violence in our country, there were a group of cities, states, and other concerned people who, in the late 90s and in the early 2000s, were working on legal theories that they thought would force gun makers to do more to make guns safer and force sellers to be much more responsible.

The NRA saw this happening, and they said, weve got to stop it. Last thing in the world we want is to have guns that you can only shoot with your fingerprint, or to have guns with such strong safety locks on them that they may not be sellable.

So the NRA went to the Congress, and the head of the NRA has said this was the most important NRA legislation in more than 20 years...

COOPER: Secretary...

CLINTON: ... and they basically went to the Congress  I was there.

COOPER: ... Secretary...

CLINTON: I was in the Senate. And they said, give us absolute immunity. No other industry in America has absolute immunity...

(CROSSTALK)

CLINTON: ...and they sell products all the time that cause harm...

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: So lets say this. Lets say this.

CLINTON: ... and theyre held responsible.

COOPER: Senator Sanders.

SANDERS: If I understand  and  you know, as I understand it, what youre really talking about is not what Secretary Clinton is responding to.

As I understand it  and maybe Im wrong on this, but what you were essentially saying, and what people are saying, is that, if somebody who is crazy or a criminal or a horrible person goes around shooting people, the manufacturer of that gun should be held liable.

And if that is your position, then what you are saying, essentially  if that is the case, as I understand it  its not what Secretary Clinton is talking about. I agree with what she said.

But if that is the case, then essentially, your position is there should not be any guns in America, period.

(CROSSTALK)

CLINTON: That is like the NRA position. No.

SANDERS: Can I  can I finish, please? All right?

And you can  there are people who hold that view. And thats fine, if you hold it. I think what you do is you hold those people who have used the gun accountable. You try to make...

COOPER: Were gonna move on.

SANDERS: ... guns as safe as possible, but I would disagree on that.

COOPER: Were gonna move on. Dawn (ph)...

CLINTON: Anderson, I just want to finish, because this  I know some of the parents from Sandy Hook. I want people in this audience to think about what it must feel like to send off your first grader, little backpack, maybe, on his or her back, and then the next thing you hear is that somebody has come to that school using an automatic weapon, an AR-15, and murdered those children.

Now, they are trying to prevent that from happening to any other family.

SANDERS: Hold...

CLINTON: And the best way to do that is to go right at the people...

COOPER: Senator Sanders...

CLINTON: ... you talk about corporate greed?

SANDERS: Hold it.

CLINTON: The gun manufacturers sell guns to make as much money as they can make.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Senator Sanders.

SANDERS: You know, I think it is a little bit  it is a little bit  look, what happened at Sandy Hook, what happened in Michigan, what has happened far too often all over this country is a terrible, terrible tragedy, and we have got to do everything we can, as I mentioned a moment ago, to end these mass killings.

But, as I understand what your question is  and, youre not the only person whose heart was broken. I know, I was there in the Senate when we learned about this killing. It is almost unspeakable to talk about some lunatic walking into a  I mean; it is hard to even talk about it.

We all feel that way. But it, as I understand it, Anderson, and maybe Im wrong, what youre really talking about is people saying lets end gun manufacturing in America. Thats the implications of that, and I dont agree with that.

COOPER: Were going to move on. Don Lemon?

LEMON: Alright, thank you very much, Anderson.

As a black man in America, if I were born today Id have a one in three chance of ending up in prison in my life. Secretary Clinton, on the campaign trail, you are calling for an end to the era of mass incarceration, but a lot of folks in the black community blame the 1994 Crime Bill, a bill you supported for locking up a generation of black men.

Given whats happened since 1994, why should black people trust you to get it right this time?

CLINTON: Well, Dont, let me say this, Senator Sanders voted for that bill, we both supported it. And, I think its fair to say we did because back then there was an outcry over the rising crime rate, and people from all communities were asking that action be taken.

Now, my husband said at the NAACP last summer that it solved some problems, but it created other problems, and I agree. And, one of those problems was, unfortunately, a move to expand the reasons why people would be incarcerated, not just at the federal level which is what this bill about, but in states and localities as well. And, thats why the very first speech that I gave in this campaign was about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration because I believe absolutely that too many families were broken up, too many communities were adversely affected. So, weve got to do a bunch of things.

On the criminal justice side, look, weve got to have better policing. That means body cameras, that means ending profiling, that means doing everything we can to make sure theres respect between the community and the police.

And, when it comes to incarceration...

LEMON: But, Secretary...

CLINTON: ... That means we have to limit mandatory minimums, we have to end disparities and treatment at last through (ph) incarceration...

LEMON: The question is why should black people trust you this time to get it right? Thats the question.

CLINTON: Well, Senator Sanders voted for it as well. Are you going to ask him the same question?

SANDERS: Probably will.

LEMON: Do you think your support  your husband has said that this bill was a mistake. Do you think it was a mistake?

CLINTON: I just said that. He said at the NAACP that there were some aspects that worked well. The violence against women provisions have worked well, for example. But, other aspects of it were a mistake and I agree. Thats why Im focused, and have a very comprehensive approach toward fixing the criminal justice system, going after systemic racism that stalks the criminal justice system, ending private prisons, ending the incarceration of low-level offenders, and I am committed to doing that.

(APPLAUSE)

LEMON: And, Senator Sanders, before you respond, I want to ask you this. Back in 1994, heres what you warned, we are dooming tens of millions of young people to a future of bitterness, mystery, hopelessness, drugs, crime, and violence, but you voted for the bill anyway. Was your vote a mistake?

SANDERS: You know, as I think Secretary Clinton knows, as we all know, there are bills in congress that have bad stuff, there are bills in congress that have good stuff. Good stuff and bad stuff in the same bill.

Now, if I have voted against that bill, Secretary Clinton would be here tonight and shed say, Bernie Sanders voted against the ban on assault weapons. Bernie Sanders voted against the violence against women act. Those were provisions in the bill, as the Secretary just indicated. So, in that bill there was some good provisions, I have been a fierce fighter against domestic violence ever since I was mayor in Burlington.

Violence against women act has protected millions of women in this country, it was in that bill. The ban on assault weapons, thats what I have fought for my whole life. It was in that bill.

Now, what you are reading though is I went to the floor, as I recall, and thats what I said. I tried to get the death penalty aspects in that bill out. Secretary Clinton have a disagreement. I was then, and I am now opposed to the death penalty.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: So, to answer your question, what you read was a congressman who was torn, who said there are good things in that bill, there are bad things overall. I voted for it.

But where we are right now is having more than 2.2 million people in jail  more than any other country on earth. This is a campaign promise, at the end of my first term, we will not have more people in jail than any other country.

COOPER: Thank you very much. I want to go to David Mcghee. David Mcghee runs a youth development program director and he is undecided, but his question is for Senator Sanders. David?

QUESTION: We live in a diverse nation. Opportunities to lead however to be frank, are often at the feet at older Caucasian men and women.

SANDERS: You are not talking about me, are you?

(LAUGHTER)

QUESTION: Men more so than women. However, what experiences do you have that have helped you deeply understand the mind sets and values of other cultures?

SANDERS: Well, I think the best answer  I dont know that I can give you a definitive answer here, but I will give you this answer. When I was a young man at the University of Chicago, I worked with fellow black and white students trying to desegregate the University of Chicago owned housing. Most candidates for president, dont put this on their resume, but I was arrested by the Chicago police for trying to desegregate the Chicago school system.

(APPLAUSE)

In 1963, and an important day for me, I went to the march on Washington led by Dr. King for jobs and freedom. Dr. King has been an important inspiration for me. In this campaign, if you go to berniesanders.com and read our position on criminal justice, it is I believe the strongest position of any candidate. What it says among other things, 51 percent of African-American kids today are unemployed  you know were going to do? Were going to provide education and jobs for those kids, not jails or incarceration. COOPER: In a speech about policing, the FBI director borrowed a phrase from Avenue Q saying, everybody is a little racist. So on a personal front, what racial blind spots do you have?

CLINTON: Let me go answer Mr. Mcghees question because I think its a profound one.

I think the most important that happened to me was a combination of my church and youth minister when I was a teenager, insisting that we go in to inner-city Chicago because I lived in a suburb and have exchanges with kids in black and hispanic churches. It was also important for me to be a baby-sitter for the children of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives, and to hear Dr. King speak in Chicago when I was about 14 years old. That got me thinking about what I needed to do to try to fulfill my faith.

When I was in law school, I had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman, named Mary Right Adelman, who worked with Dr. King who was the first African-American woman who passed the Mississippi bar. I asked her for a job and she said she didnt have any money. I was working my way through law school and she said if I could get a job and get myself paid, she would give me a job. So I got law students a Civil Rights Research Council Grant.

The first thing she did was send me to look at South Carolina, to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails. The second thing she did was to send me to Alabama to investigate segregated academies. So from that moment until today, I am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the Childrens Defense Fund which have given me some insight and have lit a fire inside me to do everything I can to address systemic racism.

LEMON: I want to ask both of you this question. I appreciate you responding to that question, but I want to ask both of you again. In a speech about policing, the FBI director James Comey borrowed a phrase saying, everyone is a little bit racist. What racial blind spot do you have? Secretary, you first.

CLINTON: Well, Don, if I could, I think being a white person in the United States of America, I know that I have never had the experience that so many people, the people in this audience have had. And I think its incumbent upon me and what I have been trying to talk about during this campaign is to urge white people to think about what it is like to have the talk with your kids, scared that your sons or daughters, even, could get in trouble for no good reason whatsoever like Sandra Bland and end up dead in a jail in Texas.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: And I have spent a lot of time with the mothers of African-American children who have lost them, Trayvon Martins mother. And Ive gotten to know them. Ive listened to them. And it has been incredibly humbling because I cant pretend to have the experience that you have had and others have had. But I will do everything that I possibly can to not only do the best to understand and to empathize, but to tear down the barriers of systemic racism that are in the criminal justice system, in the employment system, in the education and health care system.

That is what I will try to do to deal with what I know is the racism that still stalks our country.

(APPLAUSE)

LEMON: Thank you, Secretary.

Senator Sanders, on a personal front, what racial blind spots do you have?

SANDERS: Well, let me just very briefly tell you a story. When I was in one of my first years in Congress, I went to a meeting downtown in Washington, D.C. And I went there with another congressman, an African-American congressman. And then we kind of separated during the meeting. And then I saw him out later on. And he was sitting there waiting and I said, well, lets go out and get a cab. How come you didnt go out and get a cab?

He said, no, I dont get cabs in Washington, D.C. This was 20 years ago. Because he was humiliated by the fact that cabdrivers would go past him because he was black. I couldnt believe, you know, you just sit there and you say, this man did not take a cab 20 years ago in Washington, D.C. Tell you another story, I was with young people active in the Black Lives Matter movement. A young lady comes up to me and she says, you dont understand what police do in certain black communities. You dont understand the degree to which we are terrorized, and Im not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and weve got to hold police officers accountable, Im just talking about every day activities where police officers are bullying people.

So to answer your question, I would say, and I think its similar to what the secretary said, when youre white, you dont know what its like to be living in a ghetto. You dont know what its like to be poor. You dont know what its like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car.

And I believe that as a nation in the year 2016, we must be firm in making it clear. We will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal justice system.

(APPLAUSE)

LEMON: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Senator Sanders, a CNN poll found that 64 percent of Americans felt like race relations got worse over the last decade. You have said they would absolutely be better under a Sanders presidency.

So how would you be more effective in tackling racial issues than President Barack Obama?

SANDERS: Its not a question of being better than President Obama, it is a question of building on the work that President Obama has done, the very important work.

(APPLAUSE)

LEMON: You said absolutely, though, in an answer.

SANDERS: No, well, he has given us a good, good basis and foundation. We have got to do better than that. And of course we should.

But heres what I would do. I would end  I would make sure that the Department of Justice investigated every killing of a citizen of this country when they are under apprehension from a police officer or when they are killed in police custody.

I would end the militarization of local police departments.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: I would develop model programs to make police departments look like the communities that they serve. I would end minimal sentencing and give judges more discretion. I would recognize that substance abuse and drug addiction is a health issue, not a criminal issue.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: And I would make sure that those people who left jail had the education and job training so they dont go back into the same environment which got them in jail in the first place.

(APPLAUSE)

LEMON: Senator, thank you very much.

Secretary Clinton, in 1996, you used the term super predators to describe some young kids. Some feel like it was racial code. Was it and were you wrong to use that term?

CLINTON: Well, I was speaking about drug cartels and criminal activity that was very concerning to folks across the country. I think it was a poor choice of words, I never used it before, I havent used it since, I would not use it again.

Because my whole life, to go back to what I was saying to Mr. Mcgee (ph), is, you know, really, ever since I went to work for the Childrens Defense Fund, is to try to figure out ways to even the odds for people that are left out and left behind.

And I know very well that we have too many kids in our country right now who are living in poverty, who are going to schools like the ones in Detroit that have mold and rodents in them. I saw that in South Carolina. Its unfortunately across America. So what we have got to do is provide more opportunities earlier in the lives of every child.

Thats why I believe in supporting families, early childhood education, universal pre-kindergarten, help kids be successful. And here is Flint, weve got to do more to mitigate against the effects of lead, because too many kids are having the experiences Ive been told about, where theyre falling back in school, where they are having headaches because of the lead exposure.

LEMON: Thank you.

CLINTON: So were going to have to do even more here than we would do in most other counties.

LEMON: Were going to talk about education in just a moment.

SANDERS: But can I respond to that briefly?

COOPER: Were...

SANDERS: Just in this. I am not sure which legislation that was. But I think it may have been the Welfare Reform, so-called...

CLINTON: No, it was the crime bill.

SANDERS: Oh, it was the crime bill.

CLINTON: Crime bill.

SANDERS: But during that same period, 96. There was a bill called  so-called, it had a long title to it, Welfare Reform Bill. And this bill really was a bill that scapegoated the poorest people in this country. I strongly opposed that legislation. Secretary Clinton had a different position then.

And what that legislation ended up doing is increasing extreme poverty, the poorest people in this country have become much poorer as a result of that  really a bill that was written by Republicans. Bad bill.

LEMON: Thank you. Secretary Clinton, you were in, so 30 seconds.

CLINTON: Well, once again, if were going to argue about the 90s, lets try to get the facts straight. That bill had a lot of provisions that unfortunately were stripped out by George W. Bush, by Republican governors. And I disagreed with the way it was applied. And I have a very clear set of ideas about what should be done to try to provide more support, including trying to cut poverty in half in the next years.

But if we are going to talk about the 90s, lets talk about 23 million new jobs, incomes went up for everybody. The median African- American income went up 33 percent at the end of the 90s and we lifted more people out of poverty than at any other time in recent history.

So we were on the right path. More jobs, rising incomes.

LEMON: Senator Sanders.

CLINTON: Along came George W. Bush and trickle down economics and brought us the Great Recession, which thank goodness President Obama has been digging us out of ever since.

LEMON: Senator Sanders.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Secretary Clinton is right. In the 1990s, we created a whole lot of jobs. Good. And I supported many of your husbands initiatives. But in the 1990s, you know what we also did? We deregulated Wall Street, which allowed Wall Street to end up destroying our economy.

(APPLAUSE)

We passed NAFTA and other disastrous trade agreements which had a horrendous impact on African-Americans in particular, in Flint, in Detroit and all across this country. So when we talk about the 90s, youre right. A lot of good things happened, but a lot of bad things happened.

LEMON: Thank you Senator.

SANDERS: I voted against those trade agreements.

LEMON: Thank you Senator.

SANDERS: And I voted against Wall Street deregulation.

COOPER: Thank you Senator. We have to take a short break. The Democratic presidential discussion and debate continues here from Flint in just a moment.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

COOPER: And welcome back. Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate, here live in Flint, Michigan. Lets  lets move on to the subject of education.

In nearby Detroit, the public schools have become a national symbol of neglect and failure. That school system is $3.5 billion in debt. Officials say they could run out of money by April.

I want to bring in Shoniqua Kemp. Shes right here  Ms. Kemp. Her 14-year-old daughter Imani is a student in Detroit. Shoniqua is one of ten parents suing Detroit public schools  not for money, she says, but to improve conditions.

She says shes currently leaning towards Senator Sanders. Her question will go to both of you, but well start with Senator Sanders. Ms. Kemp?

QUESTION: Thank you. Speaking of opportunities for success, in Detroit, schools open and close with no accountability to  or transparency to the communities that it  they service.

Not only that  in our schools, as youve stated, we have issues with rats, mold, no working water fountains, not to mention non- certified teachers, lack of accountability around transportation and special education, and so much more.

QUESTION:

With that said, our students can no longer suffer due to lack of these things, or having these dilapidated issues take place. So, my question is whos going to step up? Whos going to ensure that the policies procedures are put in place that will ensure, and bring forth a successful future for our students because my daughter cannot wait eight more years for success to take place at your hands. At the leaders hands.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, lets start with you.

SANDERS: Well, thank you very much for not being resigned to that horrendous situation, but being prepared to stand up and fight back...

QUESTION: ... Thank you...

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: ... Thats what we need all over this country.

And, let me be very honest with you, hard thing to say, but it is true. A great nation is judged not by how many millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how it treats the most vulnerable amongst us, and that is the children, and that is the elderly. And, do you know what?

We should be ashamed of how we treat our kids and our senior citizens.

QUESTION: Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: We have a Republican leadership in congress now fighting for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the top two-tenths of one percent, but somehow we cant come up with the money to fix Detroits crumbling public school system. Somehow we cannot make sure that Detroit has qualified, and good teachers.

Somehow we cant make sure that there are summer programs for your children, and after school programs for your children. Somehow we cannot do what other countries around the world, is provide quality childcare and pre-K. We have got to change our national priorities, no more tax breaks for billionaires, and large corporations.

We are going to invest in our children, and have the best public school system in the world.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, before we go to Secretary Clinton  Senator Sanders, let me just follow up with you. As president, you have to decide where to spend your political capital. Theres a lot of things you want to do, where does fixing Mrs. Kims daughters school and other schools, where does that lay in your list of things to do...

SANDERS: ... Anderson, not only do we have a crumbling school system in Detroit, and in many other areas, we have  and everybody in this room should be embarrassed by this, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth. That is a disgrace.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: So, when you ask me about my priorities, my priorities are that no, were not going to give tax breaks to the wealthy. Were going to ask them to start paying their fair share of taxes so we can raise the money to make sure that every child in this country, in Detroit, in Vermont, gets the quality education that he or she deserves.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: Mrs. Kim (ph), here is what I would do as president. Number one, I would reinstate a program we did have during the 1990s where the federal government provided funding to repair and modernize public schools because a lot of communities cant afford to do that on their own.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Secondly, I would use every legal means at my disposal to try to force the Governor and the state to return the schools to the people of Detroit  to end the emergency management...

(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)

CLINTON: ... which, I believe, if you look at the data, the situation has only gotten worse with these emergency managers that have put the system further in debt.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Number three, I want to set-up inside the Department of Education, for want of a better term, kind of an education SWAT team, if you will. Where weve got qualified people, teachers, principals, maybe folks who are retired, maybe folks who are active, but all of whom are willing to come and help. When Detroit gets back their schools, they should have all the help they can get to be able to get teachers in the classroom, to be able to find spaces while schools are being repaired. And, I also would look at how we could through the federal government support more teachers because were going to have a teacher shortage in some of the hardest to teach districts...

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: ... (inaudible)

CLINTON: ... including Detroit.

COOPER: Let me just follow up with the Secretary and then Ill come back to you.

Secretary Clinton, youve been endorsed by two of the biggest teachers unions. Theres an awful lot of great teachers in this country. Its an incredibly difficult job, one of the most difficult jobs there is but union rules often make it impossible fire bad teachers and that means disadvantaged kids are sometimes taught by the least qualified. Do you think unions protect bad teachers?

CLINTON: You know, I am proud to have been endorsed by the AFT and the NEA, and Ive had very good relationship with both unions, with their leadership. And weve really candid conversations because we are going to have to take a look at  what do we need in the 21st century to really involve families, to help kids who have more problems than just academic problems?

A lot of what has happened and honestly it really pains me, a lot of people have blaming and scape-goating teachers because they dont want to put the money into the schools system that deserve the support that comes from the government doing its job.

COOPER: So just to follow up, you dont believe unions protect bad teachers?

CLINTON: You know what  I have told my friends at the top of both unions, weve got take a look at this because it is one of the most common criticisms. We need to eliminate the criticism.

You know, teachers do so much good, they are often working under most difficult circumstances. So anything that could be changed, I want them to look at it. I will be a good partner to make sure that whatever I can do as president, I will do to support the teachers of our country.

COOPER: Senator Sanders?

SANDERS: What our campaign is about, is asking people to think big not small. And when we think big and we talk about education, weve got to ask ourselves a simple question, how is it  starting at college that hundreds of thousands of bright young people are today, unable to go to college because they cant afford it? How is it that maybe your kid  and when I was growing up, we didnt have any money  were not even dreaming about going to college because they knew it was another world.

So starting with the top, now I know some people think its a radical idea, I dont. I believe that every public college and university in this country should be tuition free.

(APPLAUSE)

So that your child regardless of the income of your family knows that if shes studies hard, she is going to be able to go to college. And you know what else we do? We invest in child care. Right now, youve got child-care workers making McDonalds wages, that is crazy.

COOPER: Thank you Senator.

SANDERS: I want well trained, well paid, child care workers to give our youngest kids advance opportunities.

COOPER: I want to go over to my colleague, Don Lemon.

LEMON: Anderson, thank you very much.

Secretary, I want to turn now from the state of our nations school to the state of our nations crumbling infrastructure, which you talked a little bit about in the beginning of this debate. But beyond the Detroit schools and Flint water crisis; pipes, roads, and bridges are in need of repair. It would take trillions of dollars to fix it all. Senator Sanders has proposed a one trillion dollar plan but yours is only a quarter of that, is your plan big enough to fix the crumbling infrastructure in this country?

CLINTON: Well, theres no doubt, we have an enormous backlog of infrastructure repairs. Heres what Id do  the congress finally got around to pass the Highway Transportation Bill, which should never have been partisan  it turned into be one partisan argument. I want to go further.

I want to put 250 billion dollars additional, on top of what Congress has done. That gets us to a half a billion. I want to start a National Infrastructure Bank. I want to capitalize it with 25 billion that I believe will leverage 10 times that, thats another 250 billion.

So Im trying to do this in a way that will gain support and be affordable but theres no doubt, we have to do more on our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports. And as weve talked in the beginning here, under our ground, our water systems, our sewer systems. We have pipelines that are leaking and that are dangerous. We have so much work to be done and if we can put millions of peoples to work, I think my plan is a very good way to begin doing that work and get people out there doing it.

LEMON: Thank you, Secretary. Senator Sanders, critics of the proposal say its yet another example of a costly plan that will never get through Congress and cant be paid for. The best deal is what the Secretary just mentioned, the deal President Obama could negotiate with Republicans, is a $305 billion dollar highway bill. If he couldnt do more, how can you?

SANDERS: Well, lets begin by discussing the problem. As youve indicated, the American Society of Civil Engineers say we need trillions of dollars  trillions of dollars  just to bring up our infrastructure to deal with  water systems like Flint, just to bring them up to decent levels.

We have suggested a trillion-dollar investment. Now, you know how were gonna pay for that? Ill tell you how were gonna pay for that. Right now, this country is losing $100 billion every single year because profitable corporations are stashing their profits in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and in other tax havens...

(APPLAUSE)

... and in some cases, not paying five cents in federal income tax. I will eliminate that outrageous loophole, and we will raise $1 trillion. And by the way, not only do we rebuild our crumbling infrastructure  $1 trillion over five years creates 13 million decent-paying jobs.

COOPER: Thank you  thank you, Senator Sanders.

(APPLAUSE)

The issue of climate change has been a major talking point for both of you. I wanted to bring in Sarah Bellaire, shes a student at the University of Michigan at Dearborn who says shes currently undecided.

Ms. Bellaire has a question on fracking, which, for viewers, is a process of oil and gas drilling thats led to a significant increase in American energy production and jobs, but also raises serious environmental concerns.

Sarah, your question is for Secretary Clinton, but youll both be able to weigh in. Sarah?

QUESTION: Fracking can lead to environmental pollution including, but not limited to, the contamination of water supply. Do you support fracking?

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: You know, I dont support it when any locality or any state is against it, number one. I dont support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I dont support it  number three  unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using.

So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place. And I think thats the best approach, because right now, there places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated.

So first, weve got to regulate everything that is currently underway, and we have to have a system in place that prevents further fracking unless conditions like the ones that I just mentioned are met.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, you...

SANDERS: My answer  my answer is a lot shorter. No, I do not support fracking.

(APPLAUSE)

And by the way  by the way, Anderson, Im glad you raised the issue of climate change, because the media doesnt talk enough about what the scientists are telling us, and that is, if we dont get our act together...

(APPLAUSE)

... the planet that were gonna leave our children may not be healthy and habitable. I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the Senate, which, among other things, calls for a tax on carbon, massive investments...

(APPLAUSE)

... in energy efficiency, wind, solar and other sustainable energy.

COOPER: Senator...

SANDERS: This is a crisis we have got to deal with now.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, though...

(APPLAUSE)

... to Secretary Clintons point, there are a number of Democratic governors in many states who say that fracking can be done safely, and that its helping their economies. Are they wrong?

SANDERS: Yes.

(APPLAUSE)

You know  you know, one of the differences  look, Secretary Clinton  and Ive said this before, and I admit it  she has the support of all the governors  Democratic  all the Senators, all the Congressmen. I dont. I am not part of that establishment. I plead guilty.

(APPLAUSE)

I happen to be a member of the Environmental Committee. I have talked to scientists all over the world. And what they are telling me  if we dont get our act together, this planet could be 5 to 10 degrees warmer by the end of this century  cataclysmic problems for this planet.

This is a national crisis. And I talk to scientists who tell me that fracking is doing terrible things to water systems all over this country. We have gotta be bold now. We gotta transform our energy system to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. Weve gotta do it yesterday.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, before we come to you...

CLINTON: Yeah. Yeah.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clintons gonna be able to respond. But, Senator Sanders, youve been very tough lately. Last week, you said this about Secretary Clinton.

Quote, just as I believe you cant take on Wall Street while taking their money, I dont believe you can take on climate change effectively while taking money from those who would profit off the destruction of the planet.

Are you suggesting that shes in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry?

SANDERS: No, what I am suggesting is that we have a corrupt campaign finance system. And instead of standing up to that finance system...

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: And instead of standing up to that finance system, Secretary Clinton has super PAC, which is raising huge amounts  well, I hate to say the word huge, every time I say huge it...

(LAUGHTER)

SANDERS: A lot of money from Wall Street and from the fossil fuel industry. I am doing it a different way. I have 5 million individual contributors who have gone to BernieSanders.com to make a $27 contribution. I dont take money from the fossil fuel industry.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Thank you, Senator.

Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I think I have the most comprehensive plan to combat climate change. It sets some very big goals, a half billion more solar panels deployed by the end of my first term, if Im so fortunate to be president. And enough clean energy to power every home by the end of my second term.

What I am looking at is how we make the transition from where we are today to where are today to where we must be. I worked with President Obama during the four years I was secretary of state to begin to put pressure on China and India and other countries to join with us to have a global agreement which we finally got in Paris.

So I am committed to and focused on how we make that transition. Ive already said we are taking away the subsidies for oil and gas, but it is important that people understand that a president cant go ordering folks around. Our system doesnt permit that. I am going to set the goals. I will push everybody as hard as I can to achieve those goals. We will make progress on clean renewable energy and create millions of jobs through that.

(APPLAUSE) COOPER: Senator Sanders, on the  on the campaign trail, Senator Sanders often refers to a fundraiser in January that was hosted by executives from a firm that has invested significantly in domestic fracking. Do you have any comment on that?

CLINTON: I dont have any comment. I dont know that. I dont believe that there is any reason to be concerned about it. I admire what Senator Sanders has accomplished in his campaign. I have more than 850,000 donors, most of them give less than $100. I am very proud of that.

And I just want to make one point. You know, we have our differences. And we get into vigorous debate about issues, but compare the substance of this debate with what you saw on the Republican stage last week.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Senator Sanders.

SANDERS: Well, let me make a couple of responses. Let me pick up on the last point the secretary made. You know, we are, if elected president, going to invest a lot of money into mental health. And when you watch these Republican debates, you know why we need to invest in that.

(LAUGHTER)

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: But heres the difference. Here is the difference. Its not a personal difference. We just do things differently. All right. I honestly  look, we have a corrupt campaign finance system. And what Secretary Clinton is saying and what every candidate who receives from the fossil fuel industry or the drug companies or Wall Street say, not going to impact me.

The question the American people have to ask is, why are these people putting millions of dollars into candidates if its not going to make a difference?

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Thank you, Senator.

SANDERS: And that is why, by the way, that is why one of my top priorities, if elected president will be to overturn this outrageous Citizens United Supreme Court (INAUDIBLE).

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Thank you very much, Senator.

CLINTON: And...

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, no, we have to go.

CLINTON: And that is one of the many reasons we must all support President Obamas right to nominate a successor to Justice Scalia and demand that the Senate hold hearings and a vote on that successor because there are so many issues at stake. On the first day of my campaign, I said, we are going to reverse Citizens United. And if we cant get it done through the court, I will lead a constitutional amendment effort to reverse it that way.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: More questions coming up. Much more of the Democratic presidential debate here in Flint right after this.

(APPLAUSE)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

COOPER: Welcome back to the CNN Democratic Presidential Debate. Thanks very much for joining us.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, I want to ask you about something you talked about this morning. You said this morning, about your emails, that you expect the investigation to be wrapped up soon. The Republican front-runner, Donald Trump says, hes going to talk about your emails every single day if he is the nominee and out on the campaign trail.

Democrats want to know, your supporters want to know, if youre the nominee, how are you going to take him on?

CLINTON: Well, let me start by saying that the last time I checked as of last night, Donald Trump had received 3.6 million votes, which is a good number. And there is only one candidate in either party who has more votes than him and thats me.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: And, I am building a broad, diverse coalition across our country. Im very excited by the support were receiving. I have said, and Ill repeat here, I think that Donald Trumps bigotry, his bullying, his bluster, are not going to wear (oh) well on the American people.

(APPLAUSE)

So, I will look forward to engaging him because, you know, I dont think we need to make America great again. America didnt stop being great, we have to make it whole again. We have to knock down the barriers, we have to end the divisiveness, we have to unify the country.

And, if Im fortunate enough to be the nominee thats exactly what I will do.

COOPER: Senator Sanders, I want to ask you basically the same question. Hes called you a communist, how are you going to...

SANDERS: ... That was one of the nice things that he said about me.

(LAUGHTER)

SANDERS: Ill tell you something, this is my right arm. Im prepared to give  no, I shouldnt say that. I would love to run against Donald Trump, and Ill tell you why.

For a start, but almost  not all, but almost every poll has shown that Sanders versus Trump does a lot better than Clinton versus Trump.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Right here in Michigan there was a poll done, I think yesterday, or today, had me beating Trump in Michigan by 22 points.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Secretary Clinton beat him as well, but not by so much. And, thats true nationally, and in many other states. And, the other reason I think we can beat Trump is that our campaign is generating an enormous amount of excitement. Just in the last two days we have won the caucuses in Maine, we won that tonight with a very large turnout.

(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)

SANDERS: We won Nebraska, we won Kansas, and Kansas was the biggest turnout in their caucus history.

I think we are exciting working class people, young people who are prepared to stand up and demand that we have a government that represents all of us.

COOPER: Thank you.

SANDERS: And not just the few.

COOPER: Thank you. I want to  we have a question from Denise Ghattas, she grew up here in Flint, Michigan. She says shes undecided on a candidate, shes got a question for  actually shes got two questions. The first one if for Senator Sanders, then shell ask another question to Secretary Clinton. Denise?

QUESTION: Thank you. Senator Sanders, do you believe that God is relevant, why or why not?

SANDERS: Well, I think  well, the answer is yes, and I think when we talk about God whether it is Christianity, or Judaism, or Islam, or Buddhism, what we are talking about is what all religions hold dear. And, that is to do unto others as you would like them to do unto you.

(APPLAUSE)

I am here tonight, and Im running for president. Im a United States Senator from my great state of Vermont because I believe that, because I believe morally and ethically we do not have a right to turn our backs on children in Flint, Michigan who are being poisoned, or veterans who are sleeping out on the street.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: What I believe as the father of seven beautiful grandchildren, I want you to worry about my grandchildren, and I promise you I will worry about your family. We are in this together.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Senator Sanders, let me just follow up. Just this weekend there was an article I read in the Detroit News saying that you keep your Judaism in the background, and thats disappointing some Jewish leaders. Is that intentional?

SANDERS: No. I am very proud to be Jewish, and being Jewish is so much of what I am.

Look, my fathers family was wiped out by Hitler in the Holocaust. I know about what crazy and radical, and extremist politics mean. I learned that lesson as a tiny, tiny child when my mother would take me shopping, and we would see people working in stores who had numbers on their arms because they were in Hitlers concentration camp.

I am very proud of being Jewish, and that is an essential part of who I am as a human being.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Denise has a question for Secretary Clinton. Denise

QUESTION: Yes. Secretary Clinton, during our church services, we pray for the president of the United States, we pray for the armed forces, we pray for all civil authorities, three times during our liturgy. And we give thanks to them. We pray for our loved ones. We pray for our enemies. To whom and for whom do you pray?

CLINTON: Well, I have been several times in your services and have joined in those prayers and have also been privileged to lead them in some settings. I pray very specifically for people whom I know by name. People who either have gone through or are experiencing difficult times, illness, divorce, death, disappointment, all of the life experiences that confront most of us.

I pray for the will of God to be known that we can know it and to the best of our limited ability, try to follow it and fulfill it. I have said many times that, you know, I am a praying person, and if I havent been during the time I was in the White House, I would have become one. Because its very hard to imagine living under that kind of pressure without being able to fall back on prayer and on my faith.

So I do pray for people in authority. I try to think about what they are going through, even when I disagree with them. Trying to find some common ground, some common understanding that perhaps can make me more empathetic. I dont always succeed. I will tell you that.

So I pray on a pretty regular basis during the day, because I need that strength and I need that support. And especially when you are in the position that Im in and that Senator Sanders is in, where you are asking people to vote for you, to give you the most important job, not only in our country, but I would argue in the world.

I think humility is one of the most important attributes that you bring to both that seeking and then if youre fortunate enough, to that holding of office and thats what I will try to do.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Thank you, secretary. Its time for closing statements. Youll each have one minute for a closing statement. Senator Sanders, we begin with you. SANDERS: My father came to this country at the age of 17 without any money. Never made any money. We lived in a three and half room rent-controlled apartment. So I learned about economics, not just in college, but in living in a family that didnt have money that had to scrape by. We are here tonight in Flint, Michigan, because a horrendous tragedy is taking place.

But its not just in Flint, Michigan. We are have 29 million people who have no health insurance. Were the only major country on earth that doesnt provide paid family and medical leave. We have school systems around America that are collapsing. And yet we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. But most people dont know that because almost all of the new incoming wealth is going to the top one percent.

I believe, and with all due respect to my good friend, Secretary Clinton, that it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. It is too late for a corrupt campaign finance system and super-PACs that raise enormous amounts of money from special interests.

We need in this country a political revolution where ordinary people stand up and reclaim the government that men and women fought and died for. Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Thank you, Senator.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: Well, Im running for president to do my very best to knock down every barrier that stands in the way of America realizing its potential and every American having a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. We have a lot of work to do. We have economic barriers. Thats why Ive laid out plans for more good jobs with rising incomes. We have barriers that stand in the way of quality health care. Thats why I will build on the Affordable Care Act.

We have barriers to education. Thats why I want to start early and provide debt-free tuition, and deal with student debt so it is no longer the burden that weighs down so many young Americans. And I do want to take on the barriers of systemic racism. I may not have experienced them, but I see the results every single day.

So Im asking for your support in the primary here in Michigan on Tuesday. Im asking for it, and I will do whatever I can as the Democratic nominee to run a campaign youll be proud of.

I dont intend to get into the gutter with whoever they nominate, but instead to lift our sights, to set big goals, to make it clear that Americas best days can be and are ahead of us.

(APPLAUSE)

COOPER: I want to thank both the candidates. While weve been debating tonight, CNN has learned that a labor union fund has committed $25 million in low-interest loans to help replace lead- contaminated pipes.

I want to thank the candidates, the Democratic National Committee...

(APPLAUSE)

Jason Soll of Silicon Valley based Cape Productions says the future of capturing the perfect digital memory is with flying robots. (SOUNDBITE) (English) JASON SOLL, CEO OF CAPE PRODUCTIONS, SAYING: ""So the first time I saw a video shot with drones I knew this was the future of being able to capture incredible experiences."" That incredible experience comes with a big problem, figuring out how to make it safe for semi-autonomous drones to fly in close proximity to humans on the side of a mountain. (SOUNDBITE) (English) JASON SOLL, CEO OF CAPE PRODUCTIONS, SAYING: ""We build out these safe cinematic flight paths that we call rails that are like virtual wires that travel down the run and that ensures that the drone maintains a proper distance from the ground, proper distance from obstacles like trees, chair lifts, power lines, but also ensures that we get the perfect shot every time."" Currently the company, which offers its drone video service at three ski resorts in North America with several more in the pipeline, has a perfect safety record and according to Soll, it's the only one certified to fly around humans by the Federal Aviation Administration. Currently a pilot ensures the drone stays on its flight path and captures the best video angles. But in the not too distant future with more accurate GPS technology just around the corner, these drones may be operating completely on their own in the not too distant future, tracking wearable technology attached to the wrist of their designated human. (SOUNDBITE) (English) JASON SOLL, CEO OF CAPE PRODUCTIONS, SAYING: ""So we are working on the next generation of the wearable and will only introduce it once it met the quality level that our pilots currently maintain out in the field.""

reuters.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,Do you suffer from Russophobia? The Kremlin thinks you might.,"['Posted Smarynakurskaya', 'Posted Paulharper', 'Lucian Kim Is A Berlin-based Journalist Who Has Covered The Ukraine Conflict For Slate Newsweek Buzzfeed He Previously Worked As A Correspondent For Bloomberg News In Moscow The Christian Science Monitor In Berlin', 'Posted No_apartheid', 'Posted Radfo', 'Posted Laster', 'Lucian Kim', ""Any Opinions Expressed Here Are The Author's Own"", 'Posted Danram', 'Posted Jundi']","If Russian officials are to be believed, the reason people worry about what Russia might do next is because they suffer from Russophobia, an irrational fear of all things Russian.

In February, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov assailed the fashion of Russophobia in certain capitals during a visit to Germany. Then Russias defense ministry accused General Philip Breedlove of Russophobia. The commander of U.S. forces in Europe had testified that the United States and its allies were deterring Russia now and preparing to fight and win if necessary following the Kremlins military adventures in Ukraine and Syria.

Russophobe has become a convenient label for anyone who disagrees with Russian President Vladimir Putins aggressive behavior at home and abroad. You are not criticizing an authoritarian leader and his erratic policies; you are instead attacking the Russian nation.

Russias state media churns out reports on how enemies are tirelessly seeking to isolate the country  when in fact it is Putins own actions that are closing off Russia.

When I first visited Moscow as a college student 25 years ago, the Soviet Union was in its last year of existence. Kremlin reformer Mikhail Gorbachev was opening up the country after more than seven decades of communism, and Russians were hungry to rejoin the world. Goodwill, curiosity and hope were the overriding feelings among Russians and Americans alike. My host parents in Moscow even displayed a picture of then-President George H.W. Bush in their living room.

The Cold War was finally over. I was fascinated by the parallel world that had existed behind the Iron Curtain and shocked by the deprivations that people endured. Later, as a journalist based in Moscow, I would encounter dozens of Russians who welcomed me into their homes and hearts. It helped, of course, that I tried my damnedest to speak Russian. But it never hurt to be American. Often it was an advantage.

My initial interest in Russia led me to explore other countries that had belonged to the Soviet empire: Ukraine, Poland, the Baltic states, the Central Asian republics. Although anti-Russian rhetoric has cheapened the political discourse in those places, the Russian language is still widely understood, if not actively used. Given their difficult history with Russia, eastern European countries viewed membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a prudent defensive measure. Putins surprise attack on Ukraine proved them right.

To me, the folly of Russophobia became most obvious in Ukraine. Most of my Ukrainian friends speak Russian as their first language, and many have parents or grandparents from Russia. They arent afraid of Russia but of its revanchist, autocratic government.

The crux of the problem between Russia and its former satellites is that nationalism was the driving force behind the independence movements that split apart the Soviet Union. Estonians, Lithuanians and Georgians knew who they were and what they wanted: their own countries.

But from Russians perspective, it looked like their neighbors were abandoning them. Russians never had to liberate themselves from the Soviet Union: They just woke up one day in its ideological ruins. Not surprisingly, Russian nationalism today ties together a jumble of monarchist, Orthodox Christian and communist strands.

The appeal of Russophobia isnt just based on resentment about the breakup of an empire. Its also rooted in the frustration that the Western model of governance proved a more attractive way of running a country.

Putin, now in his 17th year of ruling Russia, is preoccupied with regime survival. Thats one reason the Kremlin is working so hard to discredit liberal democracy as a system of government. Telling Russians to fear the West because the West hates Russia is a way of distracting the population from the deficiencies of one-man rule.

Ever since my first visit to Russia in 1991, Russians have asked me why I decided to learn their language and travel to their country. People were incredulous that an American without any Russian roots could be so interested in their country.

My answer was simple: the mellifluous Russian language, the richness of Russian literature, the vastness of the countrys geography and the diversity of its peoples. It was all about what Russians themselves call the Russian soul  a generosity of spirit and a knack for improvisation amid adversity.

In their bluster about a brave new Russky Mir (Russian world) to redeem the perceived humiliations of the past, Russias current rulers are putting their own insecurities on full display. In the process, they have squandered the countrys greatest resource, which isnt oil and gas but Russias enormous soft power.

Ironically, the biggest Russophobes inhabit Russias highest political offices. They are the people who believe the essentialist argument that the Russian people are too immature for real democracy and can only be ruled by a strong leader.

Russophobia isnt an international problem. Its a domestic one.",[]

reuters.com,2015-09-15 21:58:56+00:00,Schools that sue: Why more universities file patent lawsuits,['Reuters Editorial'],"During Apple's most recent annual tech-fest, the company unveiled new iPhone features in front of a packed arena in San Francisco. Some of its lawyers, meanwhile, are preparing for a different stage: A courtroom in Madison, Wisconsin.

There Apple will defend itself before a federal jury against allegations that it used technology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the iPhone's microprocessors without permission.

It is the latest court action to date over patents involving universities, now-familiar players in suing over intellectual property.

The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF), the university's licensing arm, sued Apple in federal court last year alleging that Apple infringed its 1998 patent for greatly improving chip efficiency with the A7 processor, found in devices such as the iPhone 5S and iPad Air.

Apple declined to comment. In court papers it denied infringing the patent and claimed it is invalid.

Apple's sheer size, deep pockets and willingness to adopt and buy technologies from other companies make it a prime target for infringement litigation by patent owners, including universities, and the iPhone is one of the most commonly accused products.

But other tech giants have also faced such allegations from universities. For example, WARF sued Intel Corp over the same patent in 2008. The case settled on the eve of trial. Boston University sued about 40 tech companies in 2013 alleging infringement of a professor's patented technology for producing blue light-emitting diodes. Most of the defendants in that case, including Apple and Sony Corp, have settled.

In one of the most high profile cases pitting a university against a tech company, Carnegie Mellon University successfully sued semiconductor maker Marvell Technology Group in federal court in Pittsburgh for infringing two hard disk drive patents. An appeals court in August said Marvell must pay at least $278 million in damages.

According to unpublished numbers compiled by University of Alberta professor Tania Bubela using data from patent analytics firm Lex Machina, educational institutions file between 45 and 50 patent-related suits each year in the U.S.

""Almost every major university has a lawsuit or two in process,"" said Calvin Chu, former licensing officer of Columbia University's tech transfer office, Columbia Technology Ventures.

The litigation has led to debate over the role of universities, which receive government money for research that often leads to patents.

Critics say some universities have become too aggressive in suing or demanding license royalties for their patents, behaviors that they say are more akin to so-called patent trolls - companies that make money solely by enforcing patents, rather than making products.

""The question is, will the universities maintain their positions as good stewards (of taxpayer money), or are they going to be drawn towards behaving more like trolls? I think we're at a turning point,"" said Robin Feldman, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of Law.

Universities, like any patent owner, say they must protect their intellectual property rights. And legal experts note they are sometimes contractually obligated, in a joint venture, for instance, to litigate over patents.

They are also not solely after the money like trolls are, said Jason Schwent, an attorney at Thompson Coburn in St. Louis, Missouri.

""They do want to keep the white hat in the process,"" he said. ""They can't be ruthless.""

Universities are increasingly licensing their technologies or partnering with companies to bring ideas to market, according to a recent survey by the Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM), the umbrella group for intellectual property officials for more than 300 universities and other research institutions.

Just like a lawsuit, however, licensing can be used to enforce a patent. This comes in the form of demands that another company pay for a license to a patent, based on a product it has on the market. These demands are often made under the threat of litigation.

Researchers are casting doubt as to whether this leads to innovation.

A new study by UC prof Feldman and Stanford Law School's Mark Lemley surveying 181 in-house company lawyers found that when a patent owner, whether a troll or a university, demanded the company take a license to its patents, it rarely led to new products or other kinds of innovation, such as joint ventures.

The study, to be published later this year in the Iowa Law Review, acknowledged that universities generate a large number of new inventions, and strike deals with companies better able to bring ideas to market. But in most cases, it is the technology that is being sold, often before a patent is granted or an application for one is even filed.

""The more recent university practice of suing or demanding licenses from existing companies appears much less likely to be driving innovation,"" the authors said.

Michael Horn, speaks at their media reception during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, January 10, 2016.

Michael Horn, President and CEO of Volkswagen America, reacts to being mobbed by the media after he apologized for the Volkswagen diesel scandal at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, United States in a November 18, 2015 file photo.

Michael Horn, President and CEO of Volkswagen America, introduces the new Beetle Dune at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, United States in a November 18, 2015 file photo.

WASHINGTON Volkswagen AG's top U.S. executive is stepping down nearly six months after the German automaker admitted to installing software to allow 580,000 diesel U.S. vehicles to emit excess emissions, the company said on Wednesday.

Michael Horn, who has been president and chief executive officer of Volkswagen Group of America since 2014, is leaving by mutual agreement ""to pursue other opportunities effective immediately,"" VW said.

Horn, 54, could not immediately be reached. A lawyer for Horn did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

The German automaker said on an interim basis, Hinrich J. Woebcken, a former BMW executive who ran global purchasing among other jobs, is filling Horn's job. In January, VW named Woebcken as head of VW's North American region, effective April 1.

Horn sent an email to employees thanking them for supporting him and for pulling together during the crisis.

Horn's departure comes as VW continues to negotiate with California, the Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency on possible fixes or buybacks for the diesel vehicles that emit up to 40 times legally allowable pollution. It faces a March 24 deadline to tell a federal judge whether it has an acceptable fix.

A top California official told state lawmakers Tuesday that VW may only be able to mount a partial fix and may have to pay to mitigate the harm caused by allowing vehicles to remain on the road.

Volkswagen faces an ongoing Justice Department criminal investigation. The Justice Department sued VW in January seeking up to $46 billion for violating environmental regulations and sent VW a civil subpoena under a bank fraud law.

Alan Brown, general manager of Hendrick Volkswagen in Frisco, Texas who is president of the National Volkswagen Dealer Advisory Council, praised Horn's tenure at VW and said he had talked to Horn over the last three days about his departure. Brown told Reuters Horn had been offered other jobs at Volkswagen outside the United States, but declined to take them.

Brown said it was critical VW maintain the strategy of growing U.S. volume and noted dealers have strongly supported the automaker through the crisis.

""We are not working out of gas stations any more,"" Brown said, noting VW's about U.S. 650 dealers have invested $1 billion over the last decade in facilities.

Brown is flying to Germany on Sunday and staying through Wednesday for meetings with VW executives in the aftermath of Horn's departure.

VW brand U.S. sales are down 14 percent this year after falling 5 percent last year. VW still faces a stop sale on all new diesel vehicles.

Brown said it was important VW stick with the business plan it approved to expand U.S. sales by quickly refreshing and redesigning vehicles.

U.S. VW dealers ""don't want a handout. They want a chance to win,"" Brown said. He said VW should scrap the idea of positioning itself as a ""near premium brand"" and return to its roots in the 1960s of selling mass market vehicles like the iconic Beetle.

Dennis Gaudet, a New Hampshire VW dealer, said Brown was ""probably the most popular (head) we've had as long as I've been a dealer"" and added he knew the American market ""better than most.""

During the initial response to the crisis, Horn was VW's public face in the United States, apologizing days after the scandal became public and testifying before Congress.

""Lets be clear about this: our company was dishonest  with the EPA and the California Air Resources Board  and with all of you. And in my German words: We totally screwed up. We must fix those cars,"" Horn said on Sept. 21.

In October, Horn told a U.S. House of Representatives panel that VWs supervisory board and top leadership did not intentionally order the cheating, but said it was the work of a few individuals.

Horn told Congress he had no knowledge of the cheating.

Horn joined VW in 1990 and held a series of jobs, including VW sales for Europe, before he became CEO based at VW's U.S. headquarters in Herndon, Virginia following the resignation of his predecessor, Jonathan Browning who abruptly resigned after VW brand sales fell in 2013. Sales fell despite an aggressive plan announced in 2008 by VW to triple sales in 10 years.

Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) said on Wednesday it would buy U.S. options exchange operator International Securities Exchange for $1.1 billion from Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1Gn.DE), the latest announcement in a spate of merger talks in the exchange space.

ISE operates three electronic options exchanges which together account for more than 15 percent of U.S. volume, while Nasdaq operates another three. Combined, Nasdaq would have market share of more than 40 percent, extending its lead as the No. 1 U.S. options exchange operator.

""The ability to further that lead gives us advantages as to how we could serve our customers because you have a different volume versus scale arrangement,"" Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq's chief executive officer, said in an interview.

The deal would also free up capital for Deutsche Boerse, which has said it plans to merge with the London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE.L) to create a European trading powerhouse that could better compete against U.S. rivals.

Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) said it may make a rival bid for the LSE, raising the prospects of a takeover battle.

Nasdaq, which plans to move ISE's trading platforms onto Nasdaq technology, said it could strip out $40 million from the two businesses through the transaction.

The deal will also give Nasdaq an additional 20 percent stake in the Options Clearing Corporation, for a total of 40 percent ownership in the world's largest equity derivatives clearing corporation.

Greifeld said he had been looking at buying ISE for years, but that talks with Deutsche Boerse CEO Carsten Kengeter picked up over the past three months.

The deal does not include ISE's stake in No. 2 U.S. stock exchange operator BATS Global Markets, or blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings, which will continue to be owned by Deutsche Boerse, the German company said.

Nasdaq said the transaction was expected to be finalized in the second half of the year, pending regulatory approval, and it would likely add to Nasdaq's earnings within 12 months of closing.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 22:11:20+00:00,Clinton's surprise Michigan loss exposes risks for her on trade,['Andy Sullivan'],"Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks to supporters about the primary voting results in Michigan and other states at her campaign rally in Cleveland, Ohio, March 8, 2016.

WASHINGTON Democrat Hillary Clinton's unexpected defeat in Michigan has laid bare growing voter anger over international trade, raising warning flags for her ahead of a possible presidential election showdown against Republican front-runner Donald Trump.

Trump has built his campaign on pledges to scrap international trade deals and do more to protect American workers from foreign competition, tapping the same groundswell of discontent that propelled Clinton's rival Bernie Sanders to victory in the Midwestern state on Tuesday.

Clinton remains heavily favored to win the Democratic nomination. But the setback in Michigan could signal further troubles in upcoming primaries in other Rust Belt states such as Ohio, forcing her further to the left on economic issues and possibly influencing her choice for an eventual running mate, strategists said.

The backlash against 20 years of trade liberalization has stalled the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), a sweeping Pacific trade deal backed by President Barack Obama and threatens to stymie the trade agenda for years to come.

""It's politically radioactive to support free trade right now,"" said Greg Valliere, a Washington analyst for Horizon Investments, a financial firm.

Clinton's troubles with her party's left wing -- and with white, working class voters more generally -- may steer her toward a trade skeptic such as Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio as a vice presidential running mate, said Democratic strategist Steve Jarding. Political pundits had expected Clinton to pick someone to increase her appeal to Hispanic or other minority voters, such as U.S. Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro.

Sanders, 74, is unlikely to end up as Clintons running mate, partly due to his age, Democrats said.

Both Sanders, a democratic socialist, and billionaire Trump have harnessed anti-trade sentiment in their insurgent White House bids, criticizing deals like NAFTA as job killers that have depressed the living standards of working Americans.

Exit polls from Michigan, a hub of the U.S. auto industry, show widespread voter skepticism on trade that may have helped Sanders and Trump win their respective party primaries.

""She made a fundamental mistake early on in this campaign to try to stay in the center,"" Democratic strategist Steve Jarding said of Clinton. ""This cycle, there is no center.""

NUANCED TRADE STANCE

Sanders campaigned heavily against foreign trade in a state that has been hammered by overseas competition since the 1980s. Some 58 percent of his supporters in Michigan exit polls said that trade takes away U.S. jobs, while a slight majority - 53 percent - of Clinton backers said trade creates U.S. jobs.

The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, estimates that Michigan would lose 5 percent of its jobs if TPP were to take effect, the highest proportion of any state.

Gary Hunley, a substitute teacher in Dearborn, Michigan, said he believed Clinton was partially to blame for stagnant wages because NAFTA was enacted under her husband Bill Clinton's presidency in the 1990s.

""She was not a passive first lady,"" Hunley said.

Clinton's stance on trade is more nuanced than Trump's and Sanders'. After NAFTA was enacted, she voted against a free-trade deal with Central America while serving as a U.S. senator in the following decade.

As Obama's secretary of state, Clinton helped negotiate the TPP with Japan, Vietnam and other Pacific Rim countries.

As a presidential candidate, Clinton has said after reading the final language of the deal she would vote against it because it does not adequately protect U.S. workers.

Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters Wednesday there were no plans to adjust her stance and that he would ""put Secretary Clinton up against any candidate in this race on trade,"" including Trump.

Despite backing by the Obama administration, Republican lawmakers and many business groups, Republican leaders in Congress have shown no sign that they will bring TPP up for a vote this year.

The Obama administration says the deal has high labor and environmental standards that were not part of NAFTA. ""Im not sure that has fully been absorbed in the public mindset,"" U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice told Reuters. [L1N16H1VJ]

The deal may fare no better under the next president. Sanders and Trump oppose TPP, and Senator Ted Cruz, who is in second place in the Republican contest, has said he would not vote for it this year.

""They've listened to the public and politicians have caught up with the public on this,"" Brown, the Ohio Democratic senator, told Reuters.

The evidence that the TPP would help the U.S. economy much is less than conclusive.

The Peter G. Peterson Institute, a pro-trade think tank, estimates that it would boost economic growth by just 0.5 percent after 15 years.

The deal would not boost employment overall, but would result in a ""churn"" of 53,700 jobs lost and created each year, and it would boost incomes by 0.5 percent, the institute found.

Another estimate by the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University found the trade deal would slow growth by 0.54 percent after 10 years and cost 448,000 jobs in the United States.

ANKARA/ISTANBUL Turkey's prime minister applied to parliament on Wednesday to lift the immunity of senior pro-Kurdish opposition deputies to prosecute them on charges of belonging to an armed terrorist group.

Such a step could further inflame tensions in the mainly Kurdish southeast which has been hit by the worst violence in two decades since a two-year Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) ceasefire collapsed in July.

President Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly called for Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) deputies to face prosecution, accusing them of being an extension of the PKK. Lawmakers in Turkey are normally protected from prosecution.

Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu's office filed a submission requesting immunity from prosecution be lifted from HDP co-leaders Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdag and deputies Selma Irmak, Sirri Sureyya Onder and Ertugrul Kurkcu, parliament officials told Reuters.

They deny the accusation of belonging to an armed terrorist organisation and provoking hatred.

""The attitudes of those who exploit 'podium immunity' and offend the shared conscience cannot be assessed within (the framework of) immunity,"" Davutoglu told reporters.

The Kurdish conflict in NATO Turkey has been further complicated by the activity of armed Kurdish groups across the border in Syria. Syrian Kurds have been a close ally of the United States in fighting Islamic State but Ankara regards them as a partner of the PKK and a terrorist grouping

Demirtas alone is the subject some 60 dossiers in parliament calling for the lifting of his immunity, including some related to calls for protest marches. As yet, there have been no moves in the assembly to open the way for his prosecution.

""FEELINGS OF REVENGE""?

""Erdogan is personally angry with us, especially me and a few other friends. He is...driven by feelings of revenge,"" Demirtas told reporters this week, attributing this to HDP election successes last year that chipped at the power of the AK Party Erdogan founded.

The HDP exceeded the threshold of 10 percent of votes to become the first party with Kurdish roots to enter parliament on its own in a general election in June.

Demirtas says he opposes violence and wants a negotiated end to a three-decade conflict with the PKK, deemed a terrorist organisation by the United States and the EU as well as Turkey, that has cost some 40,000 lives.

The latest requests were prepared in response to calls for Kurdish self-rule by the lawamkers at a congress last December. If the parliamentary commission backs lifting immunity, the request will be debated and a vote held, requiring a simple majority.

In 1994, at the height of the conflict, lawmakers had their immunity revoked after speaking Kurdish in parliament. Four MPs spent a decade in prison, sparking condemnation from Turkey's Western partners.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 20:58:33+00:00,Clinton calls for sanctions on Iran after more missile tests,"['Bozorgmehr Sharafedin', 'Sam Wilkin']","DUBAI U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton on Wednesday called for sanctions against Iran after the Islamic Republic brushed off U.S. concerns and test-fired two ballistic missiles that it said were designed to be able to hit Israel.

Iranian state television showed footage of two Qadr missiles being launched from northern Iran, which the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said hit targets 1,400 km (870 miles) away.

Iranian agencies said the missiles were stamped with the Hebrew words, ""Israel should be wiped from the pages of history,"" though the inscription could not be seen on any photographs.

Clinton, a former secretary of state under President Barack Obama, said she was ""deeply concerned"" by the tests, the second round of Iranian missile launches in two days.

""Iran should face sanctions for these activities and the

international community must demonstrate that Iran's threats

toward Israel will not be tolerated,"" said Clinton, who is ahead in the race to be Democratic nominee at the Nov. 8 presidential elections.

Her call for sanctions reflected a tougher line against Iran's recent missile activity than that taken so far by the White House, which said it is aware of and reviewing reports of the Iranian tests, and would determine an appropriate response.

""We know that Iran is in a season of carrying out a number of military activities, and so it certainly would not be a surprise if there are additional launches over the next several days,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

The Iranian move on Wednesday came despite warning from the U.S. State Department after Tuesday's missile tests that Washington continues to ""aggressively apply our unilateral tools

to counter threats from Iran's missile program,"" a possible reference to additional U.S. sanctions.

Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Wednesday with Iran's foreign minister about the test-firing of two ballistic missiles, a State Department spokesman said.

The missile tests underline a rift in Iran between hard-line factions opposed to normalizing relations with the West, and

President Hassan Rouhani's relatively moderate government, which is trying to attract foreign investors to Iran.

ISRAEL IN MIND

Iran's IRGC said the missiles tested on Wednesday were designed with Israel in mind.

""The reason we designed our missiles with a range of 2,000 km is to be able to hit our enemy the Zionist regime from a safe distance,"" Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by the ISNA agency. The nearest point in Iran is around 1,000 km (600 miles) from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon told Israel Radio the tests showed Iran's hostility had not changed since implementing a nuclear deal with world powers in January, despite Rouhani's overtures to the West.

""To my regret there are some in the West who are misled by the honeyed words of part of the Iranian leadership while the other part continues to procure equipment and weaponry, to arm terrorist groups,"" Yaalon said.

Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee, said: Iran is making a mockery of President Obamas vow to confront Irans dangerous and illicit acts.

He urged Obama to ""aggressively enforce all sanctions against Irans missile programs, support for terrorism and human rights abuses. No more looking the other way.

Washington imposed sanctions against businesses and individuals in January over another missile test in October 2015. But the IRGC said it would not bow to pressure.

""The more sanctions and pressure our enemies apply ... the more we will develop our missile program,"" Hajizadeh said on state television.

The IRGC maintains dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles, the largest stock in the Middle East. It says they are solely for defensive use with conventional, non-nuclear warheads.

Tehran has denied U.S. accusations of acting ""provocatively,"" citing the long history of U.S. interventions in the Middle East and its own right to self-defense.

NASA plans to repair a Mars spacecraft that was grounded in December because of a leak in its primary science instrument, putting the mission back on track for another launch attempt in 2018, the U.S. space agency said on Wednesday.

The spacecraft, a satellite known as InSight, was designed to study the deep interior of Mars, information that will help scientists figure out how the planet, and other rocky planets such as Earth, formed and evolved.

The space agency said it was reviewing how much the repair would cost, but the projects lead scientist last week estimated the price tag would be about $150 million above the $675 million already budgeted.

InSight missed its launch opportunity in March after scientists in December discovered that a pesky leak in its main science instrument had re-appeared.

That setback raised questions about whether NASA would cancel the mission. But agency managers said on Wednesday that the science goals were compelling and the plans for repairing the leak were sound.

The next time Earth and Mars will be properly aligned for InSight to launch is in May 2018. The spacecraft would arrive at Mars in November 2018 to begin a two-year mission.

The primary instrument is a seismometer with sensors that need to be suspended in near vacuum conditions so that they can make measurements as small as the diameter of a hydrogen atom.

The nine-inch (22-cm) spherical chamber holding the sensors has a tiny leak, so small that if a car tire leaked at that rate it could go three centuries without needing additional air, project scientist Bruce Banerdt of NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said during a March 2 presentation to the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group.

But even that leak rate is too high for the seismometer to work properly, so NASA grounded the mission for review.

Spacecraft builder Lockheed Martin said InSight would be stored in a facility near Denver while the seismometer instrument was repaired.

WASHINGTON Technology companies could face civil penalties for refusing to comply with court orders to help investigators access encrypted data under draft legislation nearing completion in the U.S. Senate, sources familiar with continuing discussions told Reuters on Wednesday.

The long-awaited legislation from Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, may be introduced as soon as next week, one of the sources said.

It would expose companies like Apple Inc, which is fighting a magistrate judge's order to unlock an iPhone connected to the mass-shooting in San Bernardino, California, to contempt of court proceedings and related penalties, the source said.

Senators are expected to circulate the draft bill among interested parties next week and hope to introduce it soon after, though a timetable is not final, the source said.

The Senators' proposal would not seek criminal penalties, as some media reports have stated, the sources said.

The controversial proposal faces an uphill climb in a gridlocked Congress during an election year and would likely be opposed by Silicon Valley.

Tech companies have largely supported Apple in its legal fight against the Justice Department, which is seeking access to a phone used by Rizwan Farook, one of two shooters in the San Bernardino attack last December in which 14 were killed and 22 wounded.

It is particularly unlikely the proposal will gain traction in the U.S. House of Representatives, which staked out positions strongly supporting digital privacy in the wake of revelations about government-sanctioned surveillance of communications by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.

Last year, amid stiff private sector opposition, the White House backed away from pushing for legislation to require U.S. technology firms to provide investigators with mechanisms to overcome encryption protections.

But the issue found renewed life after the shootings in San Bernardino and Paris. An August email from Robert Litt, the top U.S. intelligence community lawyer, obtained by the Washington Post, noted that momentum on the issue ""could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement.""

Separately, Democratic Senator Mark Warner and Republican Representative Michael McCaul last week introduced legislation to create a national commission to further explore solutions to the so-called going dark problem, where strong encryption has made it more difficult for law enforcement to access communications belonging to criminal suspects.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 23:38:08+00:00,Fate of lawsuit brought by Trump model to be decided this month,['Michelle Conlin'],"NEW YORK A judge will decide by the end of this month whether to proceed with a proposed class action lawsuit filed by a Jamaican fashion model against Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump's modeling agency, the judge's office said.

Alexia Palmer accuses Trump Model Management LLC of lying to the federal government in its work-visa application that said she would be paid a $75,000-a-year salary while living in the United States, according to court documents.

READ MORE: North Korea says it has missile-ready nukes

Instead, according to court papers, Palmer received a total of $3,880.75 during the three years she was under contract with the agency. The complaint alleges fraudulent misrepresentation and violations of U.S. immigration and labor laws. It asks for $225,000 in back pay.

The suit was originally filed in October 2014. A decision on a pending motion by Trump Model Management to dismiss is expected by the end of March, the clerk for Judge Analisa Torres, who is presiding over the case in the U.S District Court, Southern District, told Reuters.

If Torres rules the case can proceed, it could revive attention on Trumps foreign labor practices at a time when the celebrity billionaire's rise in American politics has riveted the worlds attention.

Trumps lawyers have called the case ""frivolous"" and ""without merit."" In court documents, they said Palmer wasnt an employee and was more than adequately compensated for a very brief stint as a fashion model, which they say amounted to less than 10 days of work over three years.

Reuters could not independently confirm that assertion.

RECOMMENDED: Iran tests more missiles, says capable of reaching Israel

At the end of the day, this model just didnt have a successful career, and we fully expect to win, said Lawrence Rosen, a lawyer for Trump Model Management.

Although Trump owns the modeling agency, the suit does not name him. Trump's campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said in a statement that Trump Model Management's treatment of Palmer was in line with ""standard practice in the modeling industry.""

Palmer's lawyer, Naresh Gehi, says his client was cheated of earnings and seduced by a life of glamour that never materialized. ""The visa application the company filed with the government requires that people are paid the full amount,"" Gehi said. ""Its a requirement.

Palmer, who was 17 when she came to New York in 2011, was not available to comment.

TOP JAMAICAN MODEL

Sylvia Ayass, a lawyer who has worked with models on visas like Palmer's, said agencies typically pay what they state on visa applications.

Trump has won Republican frontrunner status in the 2016 election in large part by positioning himself as a champion of the American worker who will deport illegal immigrants, build a wall with Mexico and do away with the off shoring of U.S. jobs.

This is not the first time Trump's labor practices have drawn criticism. A Reuters story published in August revealed that Trump's companies sought to import at least 1,100 workers on temporary visas since 2000. Of those, 250 were filed for foreign fashion models, according to the Reuters analysis of federal Department of Labor data.

Using a federal visa program called H-1B that allows U.S. employers to hire ""specialized"" foreign labor, Trump's modeling agency offered Palmer ""at least $75,000 per year"" for three years. It listed that salary on her H-1B visa application in 2011, according to the court documents reviewed by Reuters.

Rosen, the lawyer for Trump Model Management, said the $75,000 a year figure was simply a guess, not a guarantee.

Under that contract, Palmer agreed ""to promptly reimburse"" Trump Model Management ""for any and all costs and expenses"" that the agency incurred relating to her modeling.

According to the suit, the agreement stipulated that Trump Model Management would take a 20 percent cut of Palmers earnings but instead took 80 percent by deducting charges for everything from postage to walking lessons to mobile phone costs and limousine rides, as well as $4,000 in ""administrative fees,"" according to court documents.

The suit said it was seeking class-action status to represent other models who believe they were misled and underpaid after coming to the United States with sponsorship from Trumps modeling agency.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has not changed its key interest rate since cutting by a surprise 50 basis points in September. Governor Raghuram Rajan has emphasised the need for fiscal reform and stable inflation before he takes any further action.

India unveiled a fire-fighting budget last week that seeks to win back support among rural voters for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government and sustain growth against a grim global backdrop, putting the onus for support back on Rajan.

Junior Finance Minister Jayant Sinha said the tight fiscal policy could allow for further monetary easing. Also giving Rajan room to act, the poll of 23 economists predicted retail prices INCPIY=ECI rose 5.60 percent in February, a touch slower than January's 5.69 percent.

""Food inflation eased in February...most likely due to the fact that temperatures have finally returned to normal, after unusually high temperatures earlier in winter led to delays in the sowing of rabi (summer) crops such as wheat and barley,"" said Shilan Shah, India economist at Capital Economics.

""The chances of there being perhaps one more rate cut in the near term have risen, but this is because the FY16/17 budget adopted a tighter fiscal stance than expected rather than any change in the outlook for inflation,"" he added.

Although inflation has been climbing since July, it has remained below the RBI's January 2016 target of 6 percent for nearly a year-and-a-half.

The RBI is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points at its April 5 meeting and follow up with a second cut in the last three months of 2016, a separate Reuters poll conducted last week found, as it tries to boost flagging growth.

Indian industrial production INIP=ECI was expected to contract for a third straight month in January, the latest poll also found.

Economists predicted Friday's data will show a fall of 0.5 percent in factory output, following a 1.3 percent and 3.4 percent decline in December and November respectively.

""Although auto sales are doing well and the manufacturing PMI recovered very recently, other indicators such as rail freight and production in 'core' industries remain weak,"" said Devika Mehndiratta, ANZ Research's chief Asia economist.

The slight rebound is likely due to a similar bounce back in infrastructure output, which rose 2.9 percent in January, up from December's 0.9 percent. Infrastructure output accounts for over one-third of the wider industrial measure.

A rocket is launched from a M270A1 multiple launch rocket system during a live-fire training exercise of the 6-37th Field Artillery Regiment at a training area near the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, in Cheorwon, South Korea, March 9, 2016.

CHEORWON, South Korea There's more to do in South Korea's heavily forested Rocket Valley, just a few miles from the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, than fire rockets. In quieter times, people tend vegetable patches along ice-cold streams.

But on Wednesday, a U.S. artillery brigade based in the South heated things up, launching a barrage of rockets close to the border town of Cheorwon.

The live-fire drills came hours after a report by reclusive North Korea that it had miniaturised nuclear warheads to be mounted on ballistic missiles and leader Kim Jong Un had ordered further improvements to its arsenal.

Tension in the region was already high as South Korean and U.S. troops began large-scale military exercises on Monday in a test of their defences against North Korea, which called the drills ""nuclear war moves"" and threatened to respond with an all-out offensive.

The U.N. Security Council imposed harsh new sanctions on North Korea last week for its Jan. 6 nuclear test. The North launched a long-range rocket a month later, drawing international criticism and sanctions from South Korea.

The drills in Rocket Valley were separate to the annual joint U.S.-South Korean manoeuvres which involve about 17,000 U.S. troops and more than 300,000 South Koreans.

They were a test of the U.S. Army M270A1 system, a multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) built by Lockheed Martin that can fire 12 rounds and re-load and move at 64 km (40 miles) per hour.

One unit was dug in at the foot of Rocket Valley, under the swaying firs. A sonic boom followed the rockets as they screamed over the tree line followed by trails of flame towards targets eight km (five miles) away, invisible over the ridge lines.

""If North Korea decides to use their long-range artillery, which they have so many pieces of, Seoul would be in direct range,"" Captain Harry Lu of the U.S. Army's 37th Field Artillery Regiment said.

""So our mission here is to make sure we destroy that artillery before they can cause any more damage to the greater Seoul metropolitan area.""

SHRILL THREATS OF WAR

In bellicose rhetoric, North Korea routinely threatens to turn Seoul into a ""sea of flames"" and the city was reduced to rubble in the 1950-53 Korean conflict, which ended in a truce, not a treaty, meaning the two sides are technically still at war.

Kim Jong Un's announcement of advances in North Korea's nuclear programme followed his order last week for the country to be prepared to mount pre-emptive attacks against the United States and South Korea and stand ready to use nuclear weapons.

He issued the command as the North showcased its own MLRS which is carried by a Chinese-made truck and may be able to operate outside the range of similar U.S. and South Korean weapons, according to an expert.

South Korea's defence ministry said the North's rockets flew up to 150 km (90 miles) off the east coast and into the sea, a display of power seen as a response to the U.N. sanctions.

The U.S. 210th Field Artillery Brigade, based in Dongducheon, north of Seoul, is one of the only U.S. battalions that will not move to a newly expanded military base south of the capital under an agreement between South Korean and U.S. defence chiefs.

That is because it is considered part of South Korea's ""counter-fire plan"" and contains MLRS, capable of firing a barrage of rockets at a target beyond the range of conventional artillery.

It is one of South Korea's first lines of defence in the event of war.

""Unless using guided munitions, (multiple-launch rockets) are less accurate than tube artillery but can put a lot of steel downrange with devastating effect,"" said Bruce Klinger, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation and former Korea specialist at the CIA.

On Wednesday, the devastating effect was being unleashed over an idyllic landscape which belies its name. In just a few weeks, holiday makers will return to the private cottages, camp sites and vegetable plots that dot the hills to get away from the summer heat of the city.

Last week in Mexico, the pontiff, who is usually calm and accommodating with his admirers, clearly lost his temper with a person who pulled on him so hard that he fell onto a child on a wheel chair. Video footage showed that while the pope was walking at the edge of a crowd in an stadium, he stopped to greet children who were sitting.

The pope said, however, he did not want to advise American Catholics on whether or not to vote for Trump.

reuters.com,2016-03-09 21:56:33+00:00,Florida lawmakers: Couples can move in without saying 'I do',['Bill Cotterell'],"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. Florida lawmakers on Wednesday gave the thumbs-up to living together without being married, sending to the governor a bill repealing the state's Reconstruction-era ban on cohabitation by unmarried couples.

The old law made it illegal to ""lewdly and lasciviously"" live together without being married to each other - language that presumably differentiated between romantic couples sharing a bed and non-romantic roommates splitting the rent.

In either case, sponsors said, it is a law that is impossible to enforce but dangerous to have on the books.

""You shouldn't have statutes that are not being enforced,"" said state Representative Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda, a Tallahassee Democrat and bill sponsor. ""You'd have to arrest a half-million people, if we enforced this.""

The repeal statute leaves in place a section of the 1868 law making it a misdemeanor to engage ""in open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior,"" regardless of marital status.

It is difficult to determine if anyone gets arrested for cohabitation, since the offense is combined in the state with public lewdness, said Rehwinkel Vasilinda, a law school instructor.

But the law ""could be used in a discriminatory manner"" if a jealous ex-spouse or prosecutor wanted to harass a person or unmarried couple, she said.

The cohabitation ban is the latest in a string of antiquated and rarely-if-ever-enforced sex laws being repealed across the country - either by new laws, referendum, or court action, the most notable being bans on same-sex intercourse struck down by the courts in recent years.

If Florida's repeal passes the governor's muster, only Mississippi and Michigan will be the holdouts on laws requiring couples to marry before sharing roof and bed, according to a staff analysis of the Florida bill.

The bill was also sponsored by state Senator Eleanor Sobel, a Hollywood Democrat.

The repeal earned the overwhelming support of the Florida lawmakers, with a unanimous vote in the state Senate and five dissenters in the House.

Among them was Representative Jennifer Sullivan, a Republican from Mount Dora, who said she ""ran on a pro-family platform"" and could not vote to legalize cohabitation.

""Based on my own faith and what I believe, I voted accordingly,"" she said. ""My faith affects everything I do and who I am, so I'm just being consistent with who I said I was as a candidate.""

reuters.com,2016-03-07 13:42:38+00:00,U.S. Commerce Department to place restrictions on China's ZTE,['Steve Stecklow'],"Visitors check out products at the ZTE stand at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, February 24, 2014.

LONDON The U.S. Commerce Department is set to place export restrictions on Chinese telecoms equipment maker ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) for alleged violations of U.S. export controls on Iran, according to documents seen by Reuters.

The restrictions will make it difficult for the company to acquire U.S. products by requiring ZTE's suppliers to apply for an export license before shipping any American-made equipment or parts to ZTE. According to a Commerce Department notice that will be published next week in the U.S. Federal Register, the license applications generally will be denied.

The restrictions will take effect Tuesday, Reuters has learned, and apply to any company worldwide that wants to ship American-made products to ZTE Corp in China. Those companies are not the target of the export curbs on ZTE.

""This is a significant new burden on trade with ZTE,"" a senior official at the Commerce Department told Reuters. The official declined to comment on whether the U.S. government might take further action against ZTE.

The company can appeal against the action.

ZTE, based in the southern Chinese boomtown of Shenzhen, said in a statement on Sunday that it was aware of media reports on U.S. export restrictions.

""ZTE is highly concerned about recent media reports relating to a U.S. Department of Commerce investigation,"" the company said. ""ZTE has been working with associated U.S. government departments on investigations since 2012 and maintains constant communication with associated departments and is committed to fully address and resolve any concerns.""

Trade in shares in ZTE, which also sells consumer electronic devices such as smartphones in the United States, was suspended on Monday in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The company did not offer an explanation.

""We believe the restrictions, if implemented, will cause significant supply problems to ZTE,"" Jefferies analyst Cynthia Meng wrote in a note, adding that ZTE has major trading relationships with several U.S. companies including Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and IBM (IBM.N).

Telecoms equipment and terminal businesses combined account for 80 percent of ZTE's total revenue of 2015, Meng said. The company's revenue for last year was expected to rise 23.8 percent to a record high of 100.8 billion yuan ($15.47 billion), preliminary results showed.

ALLEGED VIOLATIONS

The Commerce Department investigated ZTE for alleged export-control violations following reports by Reuters in 2012 that the company had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars worth of hardware and software from some of America's best-known technology companies to Iran's largest telecoms carrier, Telecommunication Co of Iran (TCI), and a unit of the consortium that controls it.

The U.S. companies, which included Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), IBM (IBM.N), Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and Dell Inc [DI.UL], have all said they were not aware of the Iranian contracts. It is not clear if any of the companies still do business with ZTE.

Washington has long banned the sale of United States-made technology products to Iran. The Commerce Department's investigation focused on whether ZTE had acquired American products through front companies and then shipped them to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.

Commerce Department investigators obtained internal ZTE documents - some of which had been marked by the company as ""Top Secret"" - outlining an alleged sanctions-busting scheme. Reuters reviewed some of the documents.

The senior Commerce Department official declined to comment on whether ZTE had implemented that scheme.

The ZTE statement did not provide comment relating to the documents.

The day after the first Reuters article was published in March 2012, a ZTE spokesman said the company would ""curtail"" its business in Iran. The company later issued a statement saying: ""ZTE no longer seeks new customers in Iran and limits business activities with existing customers.""

BUSINESS IMPACT

What effect the new export restrictions will have on ZTE's global business is not clear.

One undated internal ZTE document obtained by Commerce Department investigators and reviewed by Reuters states: ""Our company has many technologies and components that came from suppliers in the U.S ... Lots of chips or software used in the products of our company are from U.S. suppliers.""

One of ZTE's websites also states that several leading U.S. technology companies, including Microsoft, Intel Corp (INTC.O), IBM and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), are ""key strategic partners of ZTE"". The terms of the partnerships are not described.

A spokeswoman for Microsoft said the company had a licensing agreement with ZTE but could not confirm if the Chinese company purchases other products, such as software. The other U.S. companies did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

The undated internal ZTE document also describes a proposal overseen by the company's legal department that describes ways to export American products subject to U.S. sanctions by using shell companies to avoid getting caught.

""The biggest advantage"" of one method is that it will make it ""harder for the U.S. government to trace it or investigate the real flow of the controlled commodities"", the document states.

In its planned action against ZTE, the Commerce Department cites the proposal, stating that the company ""planned and organized a scheme to establish, control and use a series of 'detached' companies to illicitly re-export controlled items to Iran in violation of U.S. export control laws"". It is not clear if the alleged scheme was implemented.

'TOP SECRET'

Another internal ZTE document from August 2011 that discusses ""U.S. export control risks"" facing the company allegedly was signed by several top ZTE officials, including Shi Lirong, its president.

The document, marked by the company ""Top Secret"" and ""No spreading abroad without permission of ZTE"", begins ""Dear company leaders"".

It states that ZTE ""has ongoing projects in all five major embargoed countries - Iran, Sudan, North Korea, Syria and Cuba"", adding that ""all of these projects depend on U.S.-procured items to some extent, so export control obstacles have arisen"".

The document goes on to cite ""other risks"" to ZTE, including its operations in the United States.

""R&D employees at the U.S. Research Centers often travel between China and the U.S., carrying R&D data,"" it states, in an apparent reference to research and development. ""This already severely violates the law.""

The document does not specify what law may have been violated.

The company ""needs to take preventative measures immediately, otherwise will face the risk of being investigated anytime"", the document states.

The document also states that ZTE's Iran project ""can potentially put us at risk of being put on the Blacklist by the U.S.,"" and that such an eventuality could leave the company facing ""the risk of losing the supply chain of U.S. products"".

ZTE Corp is one of the world's largest telecoms equipment makers with operations in 160 countries, according to its website. It also is a major manufacturer of mobile handsets. Founded in 1985, its shares trade on both the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock markets.

Besides ZTE, the export curbs will apply to two of its Chinese affiliates, ZTE Kangxun Telecommunications Ltd and Beijing 8-Star, and an Iranian company, ZTE Parsian.

WASHINGTON Having twice failed to achieve Israeli-Palestinian peace, the Obama administration is discussing ways to help preserve the prospect of an increasingly threatened two-state solution, U.S. officials said.

One possibility under discussion is to issue an outline of a deal to end the nearly 70-year-old conflict on such matters as borders, security, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees.

Such an outline could range from a brief description of core tradeoffs the two sides might need to make to a detailed set of ""parameters"" like those that former U.S. President Bill Clinton laid out for the parties in late 2000.

Under one scenario, the outline could be enshrined in a U.N. Security Council resolution to give it greater international standing for a future U.S. president or the parties whenever they might resume peace talks that collapsed in April 2014.

""It's one of the ideas that they are talking about,"" said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Resorting to a U.N. resolution would require a major shift in long-standing U.S. policy, which has mostly opposed use of the United Nations as a forum for pressuring Israel. The United States has repeatedly insisted it is up to the two sides to directly negotiate over their differences.

Another possibility would be for U.S. President Barack Obama to make a speech laying out his principles for a settlement.

U.S. officials have no expectation peace talks will resume before the end of Obama's term in January 2017 and they played down the odds of any quick decision on how the White House might help preserve a two-state solution.

""People in the government are asking the question what can we do to keep the two-state solution alive, and theyre generating ideas,"" said a senior U.S. official.

The ideas had not yet risen to senior White House staff and Obama is focused on other issues including Islamic State, Iran and Cuba, the officials said.

Two separate peace efforts, by George Mitchell and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, have failed during Obama's seven years in office.

TWO-STATE SOLUTION DYING ON OBAMA'S WATCH?

A two-state solution long seen as the most internationally acceptable outcome envisages a Palestinian state on most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, lands Israel captured in a 1967 war, and an Israeli state that absorbs some of the settlements Israel built on occupied land in return for mutually agreed land swaps.

Such a solution appears remote because of ongoing Jewish settlement building; a split between the Palestinian Fatah and Hamas factions; preoccupation within the Palestinian Authority about who may succeed 81-year-old President Mahmoud Abbas; and a wave of Palestinian stabbings, shootings and car rammings of Israelis.

The Palestinian attacks have killed 28 Israelis and two U.S. citizens since October, while Israeli forces have killed at least 179 Palestinians, 121 of whom Israel says were assailants.

Current and former U.S. officials have warned that a failure to break the impasse could lead to greater conflict and that continued occupation of Palestinian land puts at risk Israels character as a Jewish and democratic state.

Former officials also cite a deepening cynicism on both sides regarding peace, making it ever harder to achieve.

""In the absence of negotiations, actions on the ground are making it more and more difficult to see how a two-state solution could be achieved,"" said Martin Indyk, Obama's former special envoy for the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.

""I think there is a real concern on the part of the president and the secretary of state,"" said Indyk, who is now executive vice president of the Brookings Institution think tank, ""that instead of achieving a breakthrough to a two-state solution, the two-state solution will die on their watch.""

Mildronate (Meldonium) medication capsules are pictured on the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, in this November 23, 2010 file photo.

A manufacturing operator works at the Mildronate (Meldonium) medication packaging process in the production plant of the Grindeks pharmaceutical company in Riga, Latvia, November 23, 2010. Picture taken November 23, 2010.

LONDON, March 9 The medicine Maria Sharapova says she has taken for 10 years due to a family history of heart issues and diabetes is an old drug sold in just a few Eastern European countries that can also boost exercise tolerance.

The tennis star tested positive for the banned drug meldonium, or Mildronate, in a sample taken on January 26, the day of her Australian Open quarter finals defeat to Serena Williams.

RECOMMENDED: Trump's foreign labor practices in the spotlight

She said her family doctor had first given her the drug 10 years ago after she frequently became sick, had irregular electrocardiogram results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.

The 28-year old Russian, a five-time grand slam champion and the highest paid woman in sports, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said.

For the health conditions Sharapova says she has, however, doctors say the scientific evidence for Mildronate is limited compared with many medicines widely available in Europe and the United States, where Sharapova trains, which have full regulatory backing and years of robust safety and efficacy data.

LATVIAN DRUG

Meldonium is cheap and available over the counter without a prescription in some eastern European countries, where it is marketed as Mildronate by the Latvian pharmaceutical firm Grindeks (GRD1R.RI).

The drug, originally developed by scientists at the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, is not licensed by two of the world's biggest medicines regulators: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States where Sharapova trains, and the EU's European Medicines Agency.

RECOMMENDED: Iran tests more missiles, says capable of reaching Israel

A spokeswoman for Grindeks said the firm had not applied for a license for Mildronate from either the FDA or the EMA, but said the drug is registered in Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union.

She said it is designed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular diseases, including angina, chronic heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other cardiovascular disorders.

Grindeks' also promotes it for people with reduced working capacity from physical or psycho-emotional ""overload"", and during recovery from cerebrovascular disorders, head injury and encephalitis. It is not indicated for diabetes.

Tim Chico, a consultant cardiologist at Britain's Sheffield University, said it was unlikely that such a young and extremely fit woman would be suffering from a serious heart condition like angina, or would be able to play top level tennis if she were.

Asked how long the drug should be given to a patient, the Grindeks spokeswoman said in an emailed statement: ""Depending on the patient health condition, treatment course of meldonium preparations may vary from 4 to 6 weeks"". Such courses could be repeated two or three times in a year.

In an emailed reply to questions from Reuters about her medical reasons for using the drug, Sharapova's lawyer John Haggerty said: ""While I cannot go into detail out of respect for the ITF process, I can confirm that Ms Sharapova had abnormal EKG tests in 2006 and was also diagnosed with asthenia (a lack of energy or strength), decreased immunity and diabetes indicators.""

""She also had a family history of heart conditions,"" Haggerty said. ""The Mildronate and the other medicines recommended by her doctor treated these conditions.""

Munir Pirmohamed, a professor of molecular and clinical pharmacology at Britain's University of Liverpool, said the crucial issue with Mildronate for him is its lack of approval from EU and U.S. regulators.

""As a physician, this is not something I have, or would ever, prescribe,"" he said.

Others noted it was rare for a doctor treating illness to prescribe a drug that is unavailable in the country where the patient lives.

""Sharapova has been a U.S. resident since early in her career, which does bring in a question of how or why she is using a drug that is not licensed there,"" said Tom Bassindale, a lecturer in forensic science at Sheffield Hallam University.

Sharapova's agent Max Eisenbud was not available at his Miami office and did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

HELPS MUSCLES COPE

Whatever its medical benefits, research suggests Mildronate may have potential as a performance-enhancing drug for sports.

It reduces the level of a metabolite called carnetine in muscles, and by doing that helps muscles cope better with high levels of stress and low oxygen levels.

""Because it effects the cellular metabolism, it would increase energy production within cells and therefore make oxygen utilization more efficient,"" said Pirmohamed.

In a 2010 academic paper published in a review journal called Seminars in Cardiovascular Medicine and cited on the Grindeks company website, it has been shown to improve exercise tolerance in patients with heart problems.

The World Anti-Doping Agency, which banned the drug in January after previously having it on a ""watch list"", ranks it as a prohibited metabolic modulator and cites ""evidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance.""

Grindeks says the drug could protect athletes from cell damage, but says it would be unlikely to improve their competitive performance.

It would be ""reasonable to recommend (sports people) to use meldonium as a cell protector to avoid heart failure or muscle damage in case of unwanted overload,"" the spokeswoman said.

Athletes ""should not expect increase of physical capacity, but, for sure, they will be protected against ischemic damages of cells in case of overload.""

The court, which said its full bench of judges will participate, did not set a date or elaborate on why it will hold the review of the law a three-judge panel from the court said in an August 2015 decision violated the U.S. Voting Rights Act through its ""discriminatory effects.""

The measure was signed into law in 2011 by then Texas Governor Rick Perry, a Republican, and has been in effect since even as the legal challenges have wound their way through the courts.

Plaintiffs have argued the law hits elderly and poorer voters, including minorities, hardest because they are less likely to have such identification. They contend the measure is used by Republicans as a way suppressing voters who typically align with Democrats.

The measure, which supporters say will prevent voter fraud, requires voters to present a photo identification such as a driver's license, passport or military ID card.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican welcomed the court's decision.

""Todays decision is a strong step forward in our efforts to defend the states Voter ID laws. Safeguarding the integrity of our elections is a primary function of state government and is essential to preserving our democratic process,"" he said in a statement.

Critics contend that voter fraud is a miniscule problem overblown by Republicans for political purposes. Republicans contend voter fraud erodes the fabric of the democratic process.

Civil rights groups have urged the court not to re-hear the case.

U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos ruled in October 2014 that the law, which was challenged by the administration of President Barack Obama and civil rights groups, was unlawful under the Voting Rights Act and U.S. Constitution in part because it discriminates against minority voters.

The Obama administration has been trying to counter a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June 2013 that overturned parts of the Voting Rights Act. That ruling freed several states, mostly in the South, from strict federal oversight.

BERLIN South-eastern Europe's ""Balkan route"", the main passage for migrants to reach more affluent countries to the north, will remain closed permanently, Austria's Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner told German newspaper ""Die Welt"" on Thursday.

On Wednesday, Macedonia sealed its border with Greece to illegal migrants after Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia, which are on the way to Austria, announced tight new restrictions on migrant entry.

""My position is clear: the Balkan route remains closed and that permanently, Mikl-Leitner told the newspaper.

She said only such a ""consistent signal"" will deter migrants, many of them fleeing war and conflict in the Middle East and beyond, from crossing the Mediterranean from Turkey to reach European shores.

As a result of the route's closure, thousands of migrants have built up on the Greek side of the Macedonian border and around 1,000 more are stranded in a refugee camp on the Macedonian side of the Serbian border.

""This alliance of reason has so far provided the decisive contribution to preserve stability and order for the people in Europe,"" Mikl-Leitner said in reference to the Balkan countries along the route.

In late February, Austria set off what it called a ""domino effect"" of national restrictions by imposing daily caps on the number of migrants to limit the flow of people toward it.

Last year, over 1.5 million migrants arrived in Europe, unleashing fierce political debates across the continent over how to handle the crisis.
