fivethirtyeight.com,2016-03-09 12:32:04+00:00,We Now Have Algorithms To Predict Police Misconduct,['Rob Arthur'],"On a sweltering Monday in late June 2015, the city council in Charlotte, North Carolina, met to discuss, among other items in a seven-hour marathon, how to carry out a controversial new approach to predicting police misconduct. Opinions were divided, and the discussion was tense. One council member was afraid of upsetting the troops. A second called the use of data about individual police officers an invasion of privacy. In response, another said, Im always a fan of third parties looking over our shoulder.

Finally, Kerr Putney, soon to be sworn in as Charlottes new police chief, got up to reassure the council. He spoke about the need to balance public need versus what officers may want. He seemed to persuade several members.

So it wont be used for retribution? one asked. Absolutely not, Putney replied.

Minutes later, the council voted to work with a group of data scientists to develop a sophisticated system for predicting when cops will go bad. These researchers, part of the White Houses Police Data Initiative, say their algorithm can foresee adverse interactions between officers and civilians, ranging from impolite traffic stops to fatal shootings. Their system can suggest preventive measures  an appealing prospect for police departments facing greater scrutiny and calls for accountability. Two other large departments  the Los Angeles County sheriff and the Knoxville police  have signed on to use the research to develop new systems, and several other agencies have expressed interest. The scientists hope their method can serve as a template for stopping police misbehavior before it happens.

Many police departments have early warning systems  software that tracks each officers performance and aims to forecast potential problems. The systems identify officers with troubling patterns of behavior, allowing superiors to monitor these cops more closely or intervene and send them to counseling.

The researchers, a mixed group of graduate and undergraduate students working together at the University of Chicago with backgrounds in statistics, programming, economics and related disciplines, are trying to build a better kind of early warning system. They began their task last summer with a request from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department: Predict when police officers would participate in adverse interactions with civilians.

To build their early warning system, the University of Chicago group first looked for signals in the data that an officer might be going astray. They used a comprehensive data set of interactions between cops and the public gathered by Charlotte police officials over more than a decade. The researchers found that the most potent predictor of adverse interactions in a given year was an officers own history. Cops with many instances of adverse interactions in one year were the most likely to have them in the next year. Using this and other indicators, the University of Chicago groups algorithm was better able than Charlottes existing system to predict trouble.

The algorithm holds great promise for its cleverness and its accuracy. But the idea of using statistical models to predict police misconduct is not new, and past efforts have often met with resistance. In fact, the Chicago Police Department  now under intense federal scrutiny in the wake of the Laquan McDonald shooting  constructed such an algorithm more than 20 years ago, only to abandon it under pressure from the officers union, the Fraternal Order of Police.

Ironically, the Chicago Police Department crafted the approach partly because of criticism from the union. A previous early warning system, based on the recommendations of departmental supervisors, was itself the subject of a union grievance calling it subjective and inconsistent. Seeking a more objective way to identify troubled officers, the Internal Affairs office bought state-of-the-art software from a company called California Scientific. The software was to use neural-network-based data analysis to build models for predicting which officers would be fired for misconduct.

The departments forward-thinking approach immediately attracted press attention. Articles in outlets as diverse as Scientific American and Playboy praised the sophistication of the method while raising questions about its moral dimensions: Could any computer algorithm, they asked, take into account the particular circumstances of officers behavior and foresee whether they would commit misconduct?

The list of predictive factors Internal Affairs found using the software is consistent with other studies of police misconduct, including my own. Along with each officers past history of complaints, Internal Affairs identified personal stressors linked to bad behavior. If an officer had recently divorced or gone into serious debt, for example, he was flagged by the algorithm as more likely to commit misconduct in the future. Like employees of any other kind, cops are likely to see their job performance suffer when there is trouble in their personal lives.

The neural network didnt last long: about two years from the first announcement to its formal shutdown. (And all its reports and predictions went missing at some point in that period.) Soon after the model produced its first predictions, the union intervened; its president, Bill Nolan, called the system absolutely ludicrous. In particular, he objected to the way administrators responded to the predictions: Internal Affairs handed over a list of about 200 officers to Human Resources, which called each one into the office for questioning the union called adversarial.

Human Resources then recommended some officers for a counseling program (about half of the flagged officers were already enrolled in counseling because of previous bad behavior). Nolan said police officers were being punished for crimes they had not yet committed.

At the time, the notion of using predictive analytics to forecast potentially criminal behavior was still quite foreign. Although 27 percent of departments reported using some kind of early warning system in 1999 (according to a Department of Justice study), most existing models were simple, based either on supervisor observations or on an officers exceeding a certain number of complaints in a given period. (Both Chicagos current system and Charlottes previous algorithm use such thresholds.) The idea of a more sophisticated algorithm seemed spooky back then, and union leaders called the Chicago PDs model a crystal-ball thing. Mark Lawrence, the CEO of California Scientific, received a handful of inquiries from other police departments, but he said interest in his software dropped off rapidly after the unions well-publicized objections. (The Fraternal Order of Police did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.)

Now, advanced statistical models designed to quantify, measure and predict crime have become common tools in police departments across the country. But the Chicago experience illustrates the difficulty in getting smart early warning systems to stick. By developing their algorithm in partnership with officers, the University of Chicago team hopes to gain acceptance from the Charlotte police force as a whole and not just its administrators.

Instead of identifying and intimidating officers at risk of being fired, the new algorithm seeks to head off troublesome behavior. The team worked in close collaboration with the Charlotte police force, which volunteered for the program to upgrade its early warning system and prevent misconduct, despite having a relatively low rate of officer-involved violence. Over the course of several ridealongs, focus groups and field interviews with officers, the data scientists developed a feel for some of the challenges of modern policing. Officers deal with a lot of things the typical person on the street doesnt really think about, said Joe Walsh, a data scientist and mentor assigned to supervise the project.

In addition to the prognostic value of past complaints, the University of Chicago group uncovered some less obvious factors that may predict police misconduct. Incidents that officers deemed stressful were a major contributor; cops who had taken part in suicide and domestic-violence calls earlier in their shifts were much more likely to be involved in adverse interactions later in the day. Its notable that although stressful calls emerged as a powerful predictor, right now there is no way to control which officers are dispatched to crimes based on the number or kind of previous calls during their shifts.

Charlottes previous early intervention system was based on a simple threshold formula: Cops who had more than three adverse interactions in the past 180 days were flagged as a risk for problems in the next year. Supervisors then decided what corrective action to take, from changing the officers duties to recommending them for counseling.

To compare the systems effectiveness with that of their new algorithm, the Chicago researchers broke their data into yearlong chunks. After training the algorithm to look for variables that predicted adverse interactions in past years, they tested the algorithm on more recent data to see whether it could make accurate predictions for individual officers, taking into account whether they had been disciplined or sent to counseling during the year.

The researchers say the prior system overestimated the number of officers at risk: 50 percent of the flagged officers in the data set did not go on to participate in an adverse interaction in the next year. And this was not because of successful interventions by the police department, since officers flagged by the system were often not directed to counseling.

The new algorithm flags 15 percent fewer officers than the old one, creating a smaller list for the department to monitor. (The researchers did not provide me with absolute numbers.) Yet it correctly identified more of the officers who went on to participate in adverse interactions in the following year, suggesting that the new system is more sensitive.

Because the algorithm is still in a pilot phase and not in active use, the researchers dont know whether their predictions will translate into interventions that reduce the probability of adverse interactions. But three separate studies of police agencies that implemented early warning systems (in Miami, Minneapolis and New Orleans) have shown that targeted intervention can reduce citizen complaints against officers as much as 66 percent over two to three years. The more accurate the predictions, the more powerful those interventions become, and the more adverse interactions can be prevented.",[]
fivethirtyeight.com,2016-03-07 17:21:33+00:00,Donald Trump Would Be Easy To Stop Under Democratic Rules,['Nate Silver'],"The other Republican candidates chances of stopping Donald Trump look marginally better today than they did on Friday. Trump won just two of five contests over the weekend and only 30 percent of delegates. Trump remains the front-runner, however, having won 43 percent of the delegates overall among the 20 states and territories to have voted so far.

Although thats short of a majority, Trump will have a chance to improve on his pace as the calendar turns toward states that have more aggressive delegate allocation methods  especially winner-take-all Florida and Ohio, which vote March 15. If Trump wins both states, hell have a good chance of eventually getting a delegate majority. If he loses both, we might be headed to a contested convention in Cleveland. And if Trump splits them  perhaps the most likely outcome based on where polls stand  well continue to be on knifes edge.

The reason these details matter so much is because of how the GOPs delegate rules are structured. If the Republican nomination were contested under Democratic delegate rules instead, Trump would find it almost impossible to get a majority of delegates, and a floor fight in Cleveland would already be all but inevitable. If every state awarded its delegates winner-take-all, conversely, Trump would be much further ahead, although the bigger swings these rules enable would give his opponents a chance to catch up later on. In the rest of this article, Ill run the numbers on how many delegates Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio would have won so far under three alternate sets of rules, including the two I just mentioned.

First, Ill apply winner-take-all rules in every state.

Second, Ill apply Democratic delegate rules. Unlike Republicans, Democrats have essentially the same rules from state to state. Specifically, their delegates are allocated proportionally, subject to a 15 percent qualifying threshold. Also, about 15 percent of Democratic delegates are superdelegates who will go to the convention unbound to any candidate. One complication Ill ignore: States award some of their Democratic delegates by congressional district  some states Republican rules do this also  but this makes relatively little difference under proportional allocation, so my calculations are based on the statewide vote instead.

Third, Ill apply what I call uniform Republican rules. This one requires a bit more explanation. Republican delegate rules vary quite a bit from state to state, ranging from being extremely proportional (as in, say, North Carolina) to strictly winner-take-all (in Arizona, for instance). Under my uniform rules, the allocation is the same in each state instead and is intended to reflect a compromise between proportional and winner-take-all methods. Specifically:

One-third of delegates in each state are awarded to the winning candidate. If the winning candidate gets more than 50 percent of the states vote, the bonus increases to half a states delegates.

Five percent of delegates in each state are unbound, essentially making them superdelegates.

The remaining delegates in each state are allocated proportionally, subject to a 15 percent minimum threshold.

These rules might seem arbitrary, but theyre meant to reflect a rough average or consensus of the methods Republicans are applying now. For instance, about 23 percent of Republican delegates are awarded winner-take-all by state and another 14 percent are winner-take-all by congressional district. Thats 37 percent total, close to my one-third winner-take-all bonus.

Meanwhile, states where Republican delegates are awarded proportionally usually have a qualifying threshold, as Democrats do. The average threshold is about 15 percent, so thats what my uniform rules apply. Furthermore, some of the proportional states become winner-take-all if a candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote, although others dont. Hence, my compromise rules award half of the delegates to any candidate winning with a majority of votes, plus whatever additional delegates he picks up from his proportional allocation.

Finally, although Republicans dont have superdelegates in the same way that Democrats do, they will have some delegates go to the convention unbound. Specifically, the delegations from North Dakota, Wyoming and several territories wont be bound to any candidate; also, some delegates selected in Pennsylvanias loophole primary are technically unbound. These cases represent about 5 percent of Republican delegates or perhaps a bit more, depending on how you evaluate some ambiguous rules in West Virginia and other states.

Heres how many delegates Trump would have under each allocation method:

Trump had 391 delegates as of Sunday evening, according to The Green Papers. Under my proposed uniform Republican rules, hed have pretty much the same number of delegates, 398. In other words, so far Trump has neither been helped nor hurt much by the variation in delegate rules from state to state. States where Trump has benefited from more aggressive methods, such as South Carolina, have been offset by others like proportional Massachusetts.

But switching to Democratic rules would make a big difference. Between the highly proportional allocation method and the large number of superdelegates, Trump would have received only 306 delegates so far, more than any other candidate but still just 34 percent of the total. It would be hard for Trump to ever get a majority under these circumstances; hed have to get at least 72 percent of the elected delegates from the remaining states, or hed need help from superdelegates who might not be willing to provide it to him.

Conversely, if all Republican delegates were awarded winner-take-all, Trump would already have 526 delegates, or 58 percent of the total so far. Hed be in good shape for the nomination, although hed still have to worry about another candidate like Cruz getting hot and winning most states in the second half of the calendar.

Speaking of which, here are the numbers for Cruz:

CRUZS DELEGATE COUNT UNDER ... DATE STATE OR TERRITORY CURRENT RULES WINNER-TAKE-ALL RULES DEM. RULES UNIFORM GOP RULES Feb. 1 Iowa 8 30 9 17 Feb. 9 New Hampshire 3 0 0 0 Feb. 20 South Carolina 0 0 12 9 Feb. 23 Nevada 6 0 6 4 March 1 Alabama 13 0 11 8 Alaska 12 28 10 17 Arkansas 15 0 12 9 Georgia 17 0 18 13 Massachusetts 4 0 0 0 Minnesota 13 0 11 8 Oklahoma 16 43 14 24 Tennessee 16 0 14 10 Texas 104 155 65 99 Vermont 0 0 0 0 Virginia 8 0 8 6 March 5 Kansas 24 40 19 27 Kentucky 15 0 15 11 Louisiana 18 0 19 14 Maine 12 23 12 16 March 6 Puerto Rico 0 0 0 0 Total 304 319 255 292 Share of all delegates 34% 35% 28% 32% How Cruzs delegate total would change under different rules Source: The GREEN PAPERS

Cruzs total is somewhat indifferent to these rules changes. Hed have slightly more delegates under a winner-take-all system than he does now, but hed also be much further behind Trump. As a corollary, although hed have fewer delegates under Democratic rules, hed be much closer to Trump.

Rubios delegate math is more sensitive to rules changes:

RUBIOS DELEGATE COUNT UNDER ... DATE STATE OR TERRITORY CURRENT RULES WINNER-TAKE-ALL RULES DEM. RULES UNIFORM GOP RULES Feb. 1 Iowa 7 0 8 6 Feb. 9 New Hampshire 2 0 0 0 Feb. 20 South Carolina 0 0 12 9 Feb. 23 Nevada 7 0 7 5 March 1 Alabama 1 0 9 7 Alaska 5 0 4 3 Arkansas 9 0 10 7 Georgia 16 0 18 13 Massachusetts 8 0 8 5 Minnesota 17 38 13 23 Oklahoma 13 0 11 8 Tennessee 9 0 12 9 Texas 3 0 27 19 Vermont 0 0 3 2 Virginia 16 0 16 12 March 5 Kansas 6 0 6 5 Kentucky 7 0 8 6 Louisiana 5 0 0 0 Maine 0 0 0 0 March 6 Puerto Rico 23 23 20 22 Total 154 61 192 161 Share of all delegates 17% 7% 21% 18% How Rubios delegate total would change under different rules Source: The GREEN PAPERS

Of course, winner-take-all would be awful for Rubio, who has won only Minnesota and Puerto Rico; together theyd give him just 7 percent of delegates. However, Democratic rules would be pretty good for him. Hed have 21 percent of delegates, not all that far behind Cruzs 28 percent and Trumps 34 percent, and with a chance to emerge as the nominee out of the highly probable contested convention.

Note how profoundly all of this would change the strategy for Republicans hoping to stop Trump. Under winner-take-all rules, it would be essential to winnow the field down to one main challenger, if it werent already too late. Under Democratic rules, the strategy would be for candidates to stay in the race instead, keeping Trump well short of a majority as everyone prepared for a contested convention. The Republicans actual rules are somewhere in between, making it hard to find the right approach.

But for the loss to come against the lowly Los Angeles Lakers? They of the 12-51 record, a full 4412 games worse than Golden States tally going into the matchup? It bordered on the unthinkable, particularly because basketball sees fewer upsets than other sports.

Yet this kind of loss does happen from time to time in the NBA, and to teams favored even more heavily than Golden State was on Sunday. According to our Elo ratings, which measure the strength of each NBA team and can be used to estimate the odds of victory when any two teams face off, the Lakers went into the game with a 6.5 percent chance of upsetting the Warriors. In the entire history of the league, thats only the 23rd-lowest pregame win probability for a team that won:

A couple of times in April 1993, the disastrously bad Dallas Mavericks entered games with greater than a 97 percent probability of losing  and won! In those games, the Mavs averaged a win probability nearly three times lower than the Lakers had against the Warriors on Sunday. A couple of percentage points may not seem to matter much, but they add up when were talking about the likelihoods of extremely rare events.

Its also worth noting that LAs victory over Golden State is unique in one other important respect: The Lakers are the only home team on our list. Every other top-40 upset was pulled off away from a teams home court, which makes sense because home-court advantage is baked into the Elo formula. Starting the game on the road is a significant built-in disadvantage  between two otherwise evenly matched teams, Elo would expect the road team to win only 36 percent of the time  and, conversely, being at home is such an advantage that its difficult to be a very heavy underdog there. Theres a case to be made that this formulation shortchanges home underdogs by not giving them enough credit for their upset wins, but the gap between the Warriors and Lakers was so great that, even though LA was at home, it still managed to have a 93.5 percent likelihood of losing.

And somehow, the Lakers still won. Absurdly implausible results like that dont happen often in the NBA, but they still occur frequently enough to remind us that even the most unbeatable of teams has to lose every once in a while.",[]
fivethirtyeight.com,2016-03-08 18:11:37+00:00,This Down Year Could Be Good For Anthony Davis After All,['Neil Paine'],"Even as Stephen Curry and LeBron James were dueling under the bright lights of the NBA Finals last season, the leagues collective presumption was that both would soon have to make room for Anthony Davis as the face of the NBAs future. But by the time the postseason rolls around this year, almost certainly without Davis and his New Orleans Pelicans in it, that presumption may be due for a re-examination  and not just because Curry has only gotten more superlative since June.

Davis has stalled out this season. The Pelicans are significantly worse than they were a year ago, and Daviss own numbers have endured a major setback. By Box Plus/Minus, his dip from +7.1 in 2014-15 (sixth in the league) to a mere +2.5 (33rd) this year is tied for the 11th-biggest single-season decline since the NBA introduced the 3-point shot in 1979-80.

Based on Daviss track record going into the season, wed have predicted there was only a 0.2 percent probability of his numbers slipping as drastically as they have.

Its not all bad or all Daviss fault

Some of these struggles can be explained, however, and some portion of Daviss offensive drop-off  from a BPM of +4.2 at that end of the floor to +1.0  may even be in the service of an expanding all-around game. For instance, during his first three NBA seasons, Davis scarcely ever wandered out to the 3-point line  fewer than 1 percent of his field-goal attempts came from beyond the arc those years  but this season 9.2 percent of Daviss shots have been launched from downtown. He hasnt been very accurate out there, converting about 32 percent of his 3-point tries (the league average is 35 percent), and its an obvious drain on his offensive efficiency when the alternative is making 51 percent of his 2-point attempts (the equivalent of making 34 percent on threes). But the eventual development of a reliable deep jumper would make Davis the most frightful scorer this side of Curry.

And many of Daviss statistical markers are down because hes being asked to do a little more with a lot less. Before the 2014-15 season, a simple projection of the Pelicans roster would have called for their offense to be 0.3 points better than average (per 100 possessions) even if Davis were swapped out for an average player; this season, the same process would have predicted an offense 1.3 points below average (again per 100 possessions) without Davis. Eric Gordon, Jrue Holiday and Ryan Anderson are a solid (offensive) trio to have on your side, but Davis has also shared the floor often with a steaming pile of Alonzo Gee, Dante Cunningham, Norris Cole and Omer Asik.

Downturns in the quality of a players teammates arent always associated with declines in personal offensive performance, but in Daviss case, it does help explain some of why his usage rate has risen, his scoring efficiency is down and his turnovers are up. And in addition to Daviss increased offensive responsibility, New Orleans has focused on getting him more low-post touches; according to Synergy Sports Technology, Daviss number has been called on the low block about 1.3 more times per game than a year ago, with post-ups now making up over 18 percent of Daviss total offensive plays. This helps account for why Davis isnt notching as many helpers (per SportVU data from NBA.com, assists are about 20 percent less common on post touches) and may even explain why his rates of putbacks and other offensive boards are also down. (Anecdotally, Davis spent plenty of time following up on teammate misses last year; that has become less possible this season with the ball in his hands so often.)

But what about that defense?

With his combination of athleticism, mobility and length  including an albatross-like 7-foot-5.5-inch wingspan  Davis is the prototypical defensive big man for an era that favors speed over mass. Its hardly unreasonable to expect a player with his off-the-charts attributes to at least anchor a solid defense, and during his first three seasons, Davis was on track to do just that. Over that span, he tied for the seventh-best defensive BPM of any player aged 21 or younger since 1973-74, and his defensive Real Plus-Minus was even better. He was, without question, following the same defensive path laid out by Tim Duncan, Dwight Howard and Kevin Garnett early in their careers.

This season, though, Davis hasnt traced the same trajectory. At age 22, Duncan, Howard and Garnett were averaging a defensive BPM of +3.0, and their teams averaged a defensive rating 3.3 points better than the NBA average per 100 possessions. By contrast, Daviss defensive BPM is only +1.5  his RPM, at +1.9, isnt much better  and his Pelicans are carrying a defensive rating 2.5 points worse than the NBA mean.

It should not come as a surprise to hear that the rest of the Pelicans roster stinks defensively. The guards are mostly sieves (heres looking at you, Holiday, Gordon and Norris Cole!), Daviss frontcourt partner Anderson is one of the leagues worst defensive bigs, and the plodding Asik, the only other Pelican capable of defending the paint, has been hobbled by injuries and is logging only 17 minutes a night in Alvin Gentrys up-tempo scheme anyway (more on this later). But Daviss teammates were equally putrid on D last year, and the teams overall defensive rating has only gotten worse since then.

Besides, the whole point of a metric like RPM is to filter out the distorting effects of a players teammates using a complex, regression-based methodology to isolate individual performance. And those stats say Daviss defense is trending in the wrong direction: Among big men with as many minutes as Davis this season, only OKCs Serge Ibaka has seen a bigger drop in defensive RPM since last season.

A redefined defensive role

So clearly something is off with Davis and the Pelicans defense. But at the granular level of simply assigning plays to individual defenders and tracking the efficiency they allow, its tough to account for the decline. According to Synergy, the distribution of play types that Davis defends against hasnt changed much from a year ago. More than two-thirds of his defensive tasks still involve either grappling with pick-and-rolls (he switches to the ballhandler around 70 percent of the time) or closing out on a shooter who has inched away from the paint for a spot-up jumper, and hes improved against both on a per-play basis. And although his post defense has been slightly less efficient this year, Synergy still classifies it as average.

In other words, Daviss individual defensive data points havent changed much from last season. But thats also kind of the point  given the seismic shift that Daviss defensive role has undergone, his numbers should have changed. In a roundabout way, that they havent helps explain why New Orleanss defense has backslid.

Simply put, these arent the same Pelicans as last season. Led by Gentry, theyre a much smaller, faster team than they were under Monty Williams in Daviss first three seasons, and thats required Davis to log far more time at center than he did a year ago. Back then, Davis spent more than half his minutes sharing the floor with Asik, a highly traditional defensive center who ranked among the leagues better rim protectors. Davis himself was below average by SportVUs rim protection metrics, but he and Asik clicked as New Orleanss best defensive combo because each made up for the others shortcomings.

By contrast, less than a third of Daviss court time this season has been spent alongside Asik, often leaving Davis as the Pelicans sole rim-protecting presence inside. Its a role in which hes improving  getting close to average this season, in fact, according to Nylon Calculuss metrics  but still one to which hes not fully suited. The situation is made worse, of course, by the fact that nearly half of Daviss minutes have come manning the 5 alongside a grievous defensive liability like Anderson. As APBRmetricians, we still dont have great ways to account for these kinds of changes to a players role, particularly on defense, where with-or-without-you style plus-minus measures are so central to our method of evaluation.

Earlier, I mentioned Duncan and Garnett as prototypes for Davis. But their best defensive teams  Duncans Spurs in 2003-04 and Garnetts 2007-08 Celtics  had them playing power forward alongside lumbering behemoths like Rasho Nesterovic and Kendrick Perkins, much like Davis and Asik a year ago. Those combos worked in a league ruled by size, but they couldnt be used for more than brief stints against, say, the 2015-16 Warriors. To compete in todays NBA, Davis doesnt get the luxury of playing power forward alongside a bulky pivot anymore.

Instead, perhaps Howards 2008-09 Magic offer a template for the type of team that could eventually thrive around Davis, with a single dominant defensive center surrounded by tons of floor-spacing shooters. (Coincidentally, Anderson bridges the gap between Howards Magic and Daviss Pelicans, having played a sort of Rashard Lewis 2.0 role on Howards final Magic squad.) Howard at 22 was much more of a rim protector and one-on-one post defender than Davis is now, so Davis still has a bit of work to do in those areas. But if everything goes right, he could blossom into a more versatile offensive player than Howard with a similar level of defensive impact.

To do that, though, Davis first has to ride out the growing pains of this season. And if his game successfully adapts, Davis could find himself in the finals limelight like Curry and James sooner than we might think.",[]

What are you trying to say

Of significance?

 Stephen Ziliak, Roosevelt University economics professor

How many statisticians does it take to ensure at least a 50 percent chance of a disagreement about p-values? According to a tongue-in-cheek assessment by statistician George Cobb of Mount Holyoke College, the answer is two ... or one. So its no surprise that when the American Statistical Association gathered 26 experts to develop a consensus statement on statistical significance and p-values, the discussion quickly became heated.

It may sound crazy to get indignant over a scientific term that few lay people have even heard of, but the consequences matter. The misuse of the p-value can drive bad science (there was no disagreement over that), and the consensus project was spurred by a growing worry that in some scientific fields, p-values have become a litmus test for deciding which studies are worthy of publication. As a result, research that produces p-values that surpass an arbitrary threshold are more likely to be published, while studies with greater or equal scientific importance may remain in the file drawer, unseen by the scientific community.

The results can be devastating, said Donald Berry, a biostatistician at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Patients with serious diseases have been harmed, he wrote in a commentary published today. Researchers have chased wild geese, finding too often that statistically significant conclusions could not be reproduced. Faulty statistical conclusions, he added, have real economic consequences.

The p-value was never intended to be a substitute for scientific reasoning, the ASAs executive director, Ron Wasserstein, said in a press release. On that point, the consensus committee members agreed, but statisticians have deep philosophical differences about the proper way to approach inference and statistics, and this was taken as a battleground for those different views, said Steven Goodman, co-director of the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford. Much of the dispute centered around technical arguments over frequentist versus Bayesian methods and possible alternatives or supplements to p-values. There were huge differences, including profoundly different views about the core problems and practices in need of reform, Goodman said. People were apoplectic over it.

The group debated and discussed the issues for more than a year before finally producing a statement they could all sign. They released that consensus statement on Monday, along with 20 additional commentaries from members of the committee. The ASA statement is intended to address the misuse of p-values and promote a better understanding of them among researchers and science writers, and it marks the first time the association has taken an official position on a matter of statistical practice. The statement outlines some fundamental principles regarding p-values.

Among the committees tasks: Selecting a definition of the p-value that nonstatisticians could understand. They eventually settled on this: Informally, a p-value is the probability under a specified statistical model that a statistical summary of the data (for example, the sample mean difference between two compared groups) would be equal to or more extreme than its observed value. That definition is about as clear as mud (I stand by my conclusion that even scientists cant easily explain p-values), but the rest of the statement and the ideas it presents are far more accessible.

One of the most important messages is that the p-value cannot tell you if your hypothesis is correct. Instead, its the probability of your data given your hypothesis. That sounds tantalizingly similar to the probability of your hypothesis given your data, but theyre not the same thing, said Stephen Senn, a biostatistician at the Luxembourg Institute of Health. To understand why, consider this example. Is the pope Catholic? The answer is yes, said Senn. Is a Catholic the pope? The answer is probably not. If you change the order, the statement doesnt survive.

A common misconception among nonstatisticians is that p-values can tell you the probability that a result occurred by chance. This interpretation is dead wrong, but you see it again and again and again and again. The p-value only tells you something about the probability of seeing your results given a particular hypothetical explanation  it cannot tell you the probability that the results are true or whether theyre due to random chance. The ASA statements Principle No. 2: P-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone.

Nor can a p-value tell you the size of an effect, the strength of the evidence or the importance of a result. Yet despite all these limitations, p-values are often used as a way to separate true findings from spurious ones, and that creates perverse incentives. When the goal shifts from seeking the truth to obtaining a p-value that clears an arbitrary threshold (0.05 or less is considered statistically significant in many fields), researchers tend to fish around in their data and keep trying different analyses until they find something with the right p-value, as you can see for yourself in a p-hacking tool we built last year.

Indeed, many of the ASA committees members argue in their commentaries that the problem isnt p-values, just the way theyre used  failing to adjust them for cherry picking, multiple testing, post-data subgroups and other biasing selection effects, as Deborah Mayo, a philosopher of statistics at Virginia Tech, puts it. When p-values are treated as a way to sort results into bins labeled significant or not significant, the vast efforts to collect and analyze data are degraded into mere labels, said Kenneth Rothman, an epidemiologist at Boston University.

The 20 commentaries published with the ASA statement present a range of ideas about where to go from here. Some committee members argued that there should be a move to rely more on other measures, such as confidence intervals or Bayesian analyses. Others felt that switching to something else would only shift the problem around. The solution is not to reform p-values or to replace them with some other statistical summary or threshold, wrote Columbia University statistician Andrew Gelman, but rather to move toward a greater acceptance of uncertainty and embracing of variation.

If theres one takeaway from the ASA statement, its that p-values are not badges of truth and p < 0.05 is not a line that separates real results from false ones. Theyre simply one piece of a puzzle that should be considered in the context of other evidence.

This story began with a haiku from one of the p-value documents companion responses; lets end it with a limerick by University of Michigan biostatistician Roderick Little.

In statistics, one rule did we cherish:

P point oh five we publish, else perish!

Said Val Johnson, thats out of date, Our studies dont replicate

P point oh oh five, then null is rubbish!

fivethirtyeight.com,2016-03-09 21:34:54+00:00,"College Presidents Say Race Relations Are Just Fine (Students, Not So Much)",['Hayley Munguia'],"Despite the recent wave of campus protests over racism, a vast majority of college presidents believe race relations on their campuses are good  and the share of presidents who believe it is even higher this year than it was last year.

Students arent nearly so optimistic, as the protests at campuses such as Yale and the University of Missouri have demonstrated, and as separate survey data shows. My colleague Leah Libresco has written about student demands to address race relations on campuses nationwide; the most common request is a more diverse faculty.

The data on college leaders attitudes comes from the sixth annual Survey of College and University Presidents from Inside Higher Ed and Gallup, which covers 727 presidents at public, private and for-profit institutions.

The survey also asked the presidents about things like the financial health of their institutions and their views of President Obamas performance on higher education, but the questions on race relations give the first comprehensive look since the fall protests at how administrators are thinking about these issues.

Eighty-four percent of the presidents surveyed said race relations on their campuses were good or excellent  a 3-point increase from last year. When asked how they thought race relations on campus today compare to five years ago, 69 percent said theyre about the same or better. Notably, presidents believe their own campus is doing better on the issue than others across the country, but the overwhelming majority still believe that race relations are fair or good on campuses nationwide.

College students dont feel quite the same way. A survey of 19,580 students at a mix of 26 colleges and universities found that 57.5 percent said they had witnessed discrimination on campus, and 41 percent of those who had experienced discrimination said it was based on race. (The survey, from UCLAs Higher Education Research Institute, focused on questions of diversity on campus; it was conducted between October 2014 and June 2015  before widespread campus protests began in the fall.)

A five-year study, also from UCLAs HERI, found that discrimination was pervasive on the least diverse campuses, those with less than 20 percent minority representation. At least half of African-American and Latino students at these schools said they had experienced discrimination in the form of verbal comments.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, colleges across the U.S. are becoming more and more diverse. From 1976 to 2012, the share of white students fell from 84 percent to 60 percent, while the share grew for all racial minorities.

But things havent changed as much at the administrative level. The American Council on Education conducts a study of college presidents every few years, and in 2011 (the last year available), the council found that only 13 percent of college presidents were racial minorities  a 5-point increase from 1986.

In 1986, the first year of ACEs college president study, the demographic profile of the typical campus leader was a white male in his 50s, the studys author, Bryan Cook, wrote. He was married with children, Protestant, held a doctorate in education, and had served in his current position for six years. Twenty-five years later, with few exceptions, the profile has not changed.",[]
fivethirtyeight.com,2016-03-09 21:52:54+00:00,Why The Polls Missed Bernie Sanderss Michigan Upset,['Carl Bialik'],"If Bernie Sanders were to defeat Hillary Clinton in Michigans Democratic primary, it would be among the greatest polling errors in primary history, our editor in chief, Nate Silver, wrote Tuesday evening when results started to come in. Sanders pulled it off, and now were left wondering how it happened. How did Sanders win by 1.5 percentage points when our polling average showed Clinton ahead by 21 points and our forecasts showed that Sanders had less than a 1 percent chance of winning?

With a polling miss this big, no single factor is likely to explain it, so more than one answer could be correct. Also, not every pollster releases detailed data, and it may take some time to fully diagnose what went wrong. Its a little bit of everything, Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray told The Huffington Post.

Here is our initial assessment of some possible explanations, along with comments from some of the pollsters who had reported a big Clinton lead:

Pollsters underestimated youth turnout. Voters under 30 made up 19 percent of Democratic primary voters, nearly as large a share as voters 65 or older, according to exit polls. Mitchell Research and Communications, which showed a 37 percentage point Clinton lead in a poll conducted Sunday, found that people younger than 50 would make up less than a quarter of all voters; they made up more than half instead. Mitchell was one of the only pollsters in the state to poll using only calls to landlines, and most Americans younger than 45 live in households without landlines. But even Monmouth, which dialed cellphones, too, underestimated the turnout among younger voters. Perhaps all the polls showing a big Clinton lead sowed complacency among Clinton supporters, who skew older  though big leads in polls in Southern states didnt stop her supporters from helping her romp to big victories.

Pollsters underestimated Sanderss dominance among young voters. Not only did more young voters turn out than expected, but Sanders won 81 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds. A YouGov poll showed him winning 66 percent.

Pollsters underestimated the number of independent voters who would participate in the primary. YouGov expected Sanders to beat Clinton by 38 percentage points among independent voters participating in the open Democratic primary. He won those voters by 43 percentage points. But no one expected independents to make up 27 percent of voters; YouGov expected about 12 percent. There were too many Democrats in the poll, said Will Jordan, elections editor at YouGov.

Pollsters underestimated Sanderss support among black voters. Sanders had won less than 20 percent of black voters in most states with large black populations, and Mitchell and YouGov both showed Sanders winning less than 20 percent of them in Michigan. Instead he won 28 percent.

Pollsters missed a late break to Sanders by not polling after Sunday. Clinton and Sanders debated in Flint on Sunday and met in a town hall in Detroit on Monday. No public pollsters contacted voters after either event. Sanders did slightly better among voters who decided in the week before the primary, according to exit polls. An earlier polling miss, in the Iowa Republican caucuses, may have resulted in part from a scarcity of late polls. And there were signs before Sunday that Sanders was closing the gap: In the YouGov poll, 45 percent of Michigan Democrats said their opinion of Sanders was getting better, and just 8 percent said it was getting worse. For Clinton, the numbers were 38 percent and 19 percent.

Some Clinton supporters chose to vote in the Republican primary. We know 7 percent of voters in the Republican primary identified themselves as Democrats to exit pollsters, compared with just 4 percent of voters in the Democratic primary who said they were Republicans. Those 7 percent of Dems were likely mostly Hillary voters who thought she had an easy win and they could do their part trying to stop [Donald] Trump, said Bernie Porn of pollster EPIC-MRA. The exit-poll samples are too small, though, to check that.

Pollsters had little recent history to work with. Michigans Democratic primary was weird in 2008 (Barack Obama wasnt on the ballot), and the state party held caucuses in 2000 and 2004 that werent really competitive. So relying on voter history could lead pollsters astray. Remember, we havent had a real Democratic presidential primary in Michigan lately, said Matt Grossmann, director of the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at Michigan State University, which showed the tightest race of any late polls, with Clinton leading by 5 percentage points.

This is an outlier, a perfectly rotten combination of bad luck and bad timing. Several pollsters pointed out that they used the same methods in the Michigan Democratic primary as in other primaries  including Michigans Republican primary  with relative success.

Polls on the Republican race, including ours, were generally OK, said Barbara Carvalho of the Marist Poll. She added that all polls on the Democratic race had Clinton winning. So, something clearly changed in the closing days.",[]
fivethirtyeight.com,2016-03-09 06:09:08+00:00,What The Stunning Bernie Sanders Win In Michigan Means,['Harry Enten'],"Bernie Sanders made folks like me eat a stack of humble pie on Tuesday night. He won the Michigan primary over Hillary Clinton, 50 percent to 48 percent, when not a single poll taken over the last month had Clinton leading by less than 5 percentage points. In fact, many had her lead at 20 percentage points or higher. Sanderss win in Michigan was one of the greatest upsets in modern political history.

Both the FiveThirtyEight polls-plus and polls-only forecast gave Clinton a greater than 99 percent chance of winning. Thats because polling averages for primaries, while inexact, are usually not 25 percentage points off. Indeed, my colleague Nate Silver went back and found that only one primary, the 1984 Democratic primary in New Hampshire, was even on the same scale as this upset. In that contest, the polling average had Walter Mondale beating Gary Hart by 17 percentage points, but it was Hart who won, with slightly more than 9 percentage points over Mondale.

Indeed, my initial thought was to compare the Sanders upset with Clintons over Barack Obama in the 2008 New Hampshire Democratic primary, but that undersells what happened Tuesday night. I was in New Hampshire when Clinton won in 2008 and sat in stunned disbelief  Obama lost by about 3 percentage points, when the polling average had him ahead by 8 percentage points. In other words, tonights error was more than double what occurred eight years ago.

The question I am asking myself now is whether this means the polls are off in other Midwestern states that are holding open primaries. Im talking specifically about Illinois and Ohio, both of which vote next Tuesday. The FiveThirtyEight polling average in Illinois gives Clinton a 37 percentage point lead, while the average in Ohio gives her a 20 percentage point lead. If Michigan was just a fluke (which is possible), then tonight will be forgotten soon enough. If, however, pollsters are missing something more fundamental about the electorate, then the Ohio and Illinois primaries could be a lot closer than expected.

Either way, this result will send a shock wave through the press. Heck, Im a member of the press, and you might be able to tell how surprised I am. This will likely lead to increased news coverage of the Democratic race, which Sanders desperately needs in order to be competitive next Tuesday and beyond.

Sanders must rack up big wins, and fast. Thanks to an 83 percent to 16 percent win in Mississippi, Clinton gained in the overall delegate count on Tuesday and leads Sanders by more than 200 pledged delegates. Her strong performance in Mississippi also put Sanders further behind his FiveThirtyEight delegate targets. That may not be as sexy as the tremendous upset in Michigan, but math is rarely sexy.

Sanders, however, can breathe a deep sigh of relief that all the states in the Deep South have already voted. He can hope that tonights Michigan win will help propel him to victory or at least make him more competitive in states with large delegate prizes left, like California, Florida, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Well see if it does.

fivethirtyeight.com,2016-03-09 17:17:46+00:00,Religious Liberty Has Replaced Gay Marriage In GOP Talking Points,['Anne Li'],"It was so casual, the way Marco Rubio slipped same-sex marriage, unprovoked, into his closing statement at the Feb. 13 Republican debate.

We are going to be a country that says that life begins at conception and life is worthy of the protection of our laws, he said. Were going to be a country that says that marriage is between one man and one woman. We are going to be a country that says the Constitution and the rights that it talks about do not come from our president, they come from our creator.

In 2008, and especially in 2012, such a statement would not have surprised anyone. But this year, same-sex marriage no longer seems as prominent an issue in the GOP campaign. Though preserving and protecting traditional marriage remains in the official GOP platform, the Conservative Political Action Conference this month approved the Log Cabin Republicans as a conference sponsor after having been accused of discriminating against the pro-gay-marriage organization by rejecting their request to participate in previous conferences.

And in the Republican presidential debates, same-sex marriage and variations of that term have come up less frequently than they did in GOP debates during the 2012 and 2008 primary elections.

The chart above shows totals, but on average, gay marriage and its variants have only come up up 4.45 times per debate so far in this year. It came up 6.75 times per debate in 2012 and 5.13 times per debate in 2008.

Has the Republican Party all but given up on same-sex marriage? There seems to have been a shift since the Supreme Courts 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. But Gregory Angelo, president of the Log Cabin Republicans, says that the change started earlier  that the GOP learned from its mistakes in 2012, when the Republican electorate began to split on same-sex marriage. No longer a wedge issue that worked to the partys advantage, it became a divisive topic within the party, prompting this statement in its post-2012 election report: We need to campaign among Hispanic, black, Asian, and gay Americans and demonstrate that we care about them, too. Now, Angelo says, standing against gay rights will not win you many votes.

Just hours before the South Carolina primaries, he said, a robocall went over from a Ted Cruz super PAC that said if Donald Trump were president, you could expect forward motion on gay rights. Four years ago, eight years, ago, an ad like that could turn the dime.

Instead, Trump, who has flip-flopped on same-sex marriage several times, won the state primary, including 34 percent, a plurality, of the evangelical vote. His win may be due, in part, to rapid changes in the GOP electorate. According to the Pew Research Center, while evangelicals are the partys largest constituency nationwide, 14 percent of Republicans had no religious affiliation in 2014, up from 10 percent in 2007. And 61 percent of young Republicans support same-sex marriage. Paris Dennard, a GOP strategist, says more conservatives are leaning libertarian, meaning that they believe in limited government, even when it comes to gay marriage.

Not everyone has given up the marriage fight. But Russell D. Moore, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, a unit of the Southern Baptist Convention that advocates Christian values to government leaders, acknowledges that the conversation has shifted.

Whatever their definition of marriage, he says, Americans should be concerned by the Supreme Courts decisions, both in terms of the power of the government and the reasons given for the redefinition.

I think thats where the conversation is now, he went on. What sort of justices and judges would a president appoint, and how would they be restricted by a constitution itself?

The shift from talking directly about same-sex marriage to more glancing references is also reflected in the GOP debate rhetoric. Mentions of religious, religious liberty and religious freedom appeared more than ever in this years debates when referring to the rights of business owners to refuse services to gay customers. Its code, Dennard says, for gay marriage.

What you can fight about is the ramifications of it, he said, that it affects small business, that it affects Christianity. What is the root issue? Christianity is under attack. You can say that values are under attack without coming out against gay marriage.

The shift has strategic significance, too. Gay marriage has long been a gateway issue, an important indicator for many voters as to whether the party shares their fundamental values. By standing against gay marriage, the party risks alienating new members.The shift is also, as Dennard notes, an indicator of how diverse the party really is.

You have people who are gay and in the party. The Republican Party is not a monolithic group. We are diverse, he said. But the question is, at the end of the day, who is going to be able to win, and how can you galvanize the people to feel a part of the party, while still maintaining an essence of the party?",[]

The subject of the investigation, Timothy Parker, edits both the USA Today Crossword and the syndicated Universal Crossword. The copyright for both puzzles is owned by Universal Uclick (formerly the Universal Press Syndicate). According to an analysis of a newly completed database, 65 puzzles edited by Parker perfectly replicated themes and theme answers that were originally published in New York Times puzzles, with some using the same clues and grids. Hundreds more USA Today and Universal puzzles, edited by Parker, were re-published in those same two outlets with extremely minor changes and often under fake author names.

Since FiveThirtyEight published its initial article, USA Today and Universal Uclick have issued statements in response, and it appears that Parker is, for now, no longer in charge of either puzzle.

On Monday afternoon, Universal Uclick said the following:

Timothy Parker has edited thousands of puzzles for Universal over many years, and we have high regard for his work.

fivethirtyeight.com,2016-03-09 21:51:09+00:00,Gonzaga Is A Major Team In A Minor Conference,['Neil Paine'],"Going into conference tournament week, the Gonzaga Bulldogs were no lock to extend their string of consecutive NCAA tourney berths to 18 years. To maintain the streak, the Zags probably needed to run the West Coast Conference tournament table, since an at-large bid was unlikely with seven losses on their resume. The automatic-bid route was how Gonzaga qualified for 13 of the previous 17 NCAA tournaments, but it wasnt even the conference favorite this year.

The streak, tied for seventh-longest in history, seemed to be in jeopardy.

Three victories later, the Bulldogs are West Coast champs and tournament-bound. Since its streak began in 1998-99, Gonzaga has been the best non-power-conference school, going by cumulative adjusted net efficiency:

ADJUSTED NET EFFICIENCY SCHOOL PRIMARY CONFERENCE WINS LOSSES TEAM OTHER CONF. MEMBERS DIFF 1 Gonzaga West Coast 484 117 +17.57 -0.34 +17.92 2 Memphis Conference USA 442 172 +14.84 +4.34 +10.50 3 Xavier Atlantic 10 355 145 +14.64 +4.11 +10.54 4 Butler Horizon League 356 136 +12.83 +0.34 +12.49 5 BYU Mountain West 395 185 +12.07 +4.48 +7.59 6 Temple Atlantic 10 373 222 +11.99 +4.56 +7.44 7 Creighton Missouri Valley 353 147 +11.62 +4.02 +7.60 8 Wichita St. Missouri Valley 373 208 +10.39 +3.72 +6.67 9 Dayton Atlantic 10 384 203 +9.54 +4.72 +4.82 10 UNLV Mountain West 371 201 +9.16 +5.34 +3.82 Best non-power-conference programs of the last 18 seasons SourceS: Ken Pomeroy, Daniel Myers

(Note that Im defining power conferences as the ACC, Big 8/Big 12, Big East  but not its offshoot the AAC, which has had the power ratings and total NCAA bids of a mid-major thus far  Big Ten, Pac-10/Pac-12 and SEC. I also filtered out teams like Cincinnati and Louisville that played fewer than three-quarters of their games in a non-power conference.)

As you might expect, Gonzaga towers over the other mid-majors. But even more striking might be the heights to which its risen over its fellow WCC members; as the Bulldogs were putting together the 12th-best rating of any program in the nation, the average non-Gonzaga WCC team has been worse than the average Division I school over the same span. Since 99, the Bulldogs have dominated their conference more than any other mid-major; second place (Butler) isnt especially close.

The same holds true if we expand beyond our admittedly selective endpoints and look at more than Gonzagas streak. Here are the top non-power teams of the 64-team NCAA Tournament era (since 1984-85):

ADJUSTED NET EFFICIENCY SCHOOL PRIMARY CONFERENCE WINS LOSSES TEAM OTHER CONF. MEMBERS DIFF 1 Memphis Conference USA 733 324 +13.61 +5.96 +7.65 2 Temple Atlantic 10 689 351 +13.37 +4.18 +9.19 3 Xavier Atlantic 10 640 267 +12.45 +2.95 +9.50 4 Gonzaga West Coast 689 279 +11.64 -0.47 +12.11 5 UNLV Mountain West 715 310 +11.33 +3.60 +7.74 6 Utah Western Athletic 531 289 +10.37 +4.11 +6.26 7 BYU Western Athletic 648 362 +9.52 +3.78 +5.74 8 New Mexico Mountain West 658 357 +8.47 +4.30 +4.17 9 Tulsa Missouri Valley 631 381 +8.19 +2.23 +5.96 10 Butler Midwestern Collegiate 554 323 +7.69 +0.48 +7.21 Best non-power-conference programs of the 64-team bracket era SourceS: Ken Pomeroy, Daniel Myers

Over this extended time period, the Zags are surpassed by Memphis, Temple and Xavier overall but remain the most dominant relative to the rest of their conference. On the one hand, this can be seen as Gonzaga beating the tar out of weak conference opponents. On the other, over more than three decades now, no mid-major has beaten the tar out of its conference the way Gonzaga has beaten down the WCC.",[]

13 percent

This could get rough: According to a Monmouth University poll in Michigan ahead of Tuesdays primary vote, Marco Rubio is way behind in the Republican race with 13 percent support. The poll of likely GOP voters shows Donald Trump with 36 percent support and Ted Cruz with 23 percent. John Kasich of all people has 21 percent.

fivethirtyeight.com,2016-03-07 18:49:29+00:00,SMU And Louisville Are Two Of The Best Teams Ever Banned From The NCAA Tournament,['Neil Paine'],"Any shining moments for Louisville and Southern Methodist will come and go before the NCAA Tournament begins. Although the Cardinals and Mustangs each rank among the nations top 20 teams according to Ken Pomeroy and others, both were barred from the 2016 postseason amid scandal.

(SMUs ban, for academic fraud, came from the NCAA; Louisville banned itself in an attempt to avoid harsher sentencing when the NCAA finishes investigating allegations that the team used strippers and prostitutes in its recruiting efforts.)

By the numbers, these are two of the best teams ever to be banished from postseason play. Since the NCAA tourney expanded its field to 64 teams in 1984-85, only one banned team has had a better statistical profile, the 1991-92 Runnin Rebels from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. (We used adjusted differential between offensive and defensive Pomeroy ratings for seasons since 2001 and estimated the differential for earlier teams using Daniel Myerss research on schedule-adjusted historical team ratings.)

YEAR TEAM WINS LOSSES RATING 1992 UNLV 26 2 +20.74 2016 SMU 25 5 +19.65 2016 Louisville 23 8 +19.65 2003 Georgia 19 8 +18.94 1991 Kentucky 22 6 +18.87 SMU and Louisville are among the best teams to be banned Sources: Kenpom.com, Daniel Myers, Sports Reference

That UNLV squad wasnt at quite the same level as the version that went 69-6 over the previous two years under the leadership of future NBA talent such as Larry Johnson, Stacey Augmon and Greg Anthony. But its best player was J.R. Rider, a future NBA 20 PPG scorer, and a few of his teammates had brief stints in the pros. Louisville and SMU, by contrast, each carry only one top-100 NBA prospect apiece  Chinanu Onuaku (No. 56) and Shake Milton (No. 87), respectively  and even those guys are at the fringes of the mock draft universe. (The Cardinals fifth-year senior transfers Damion Lee and Trey Lewis may eventually get a shot at the NBA but are by no means locks.) Rick Pitino and Larry Brown can punch weight with the towel-chomping Jerry Tarkanian, but in terms of record, efficiency and roster, the 92 Rebels were probably the best of the three.

Still, its a relatively close contest. And lets emphasize again that two of the top three banned squads in recent memory both hail from the 2015-16 season. In what seems destined to be a wide-open NCAA field this year, the Mustangs and Cardinals could have seized upon that opportunity and produced deep tournament runs. But by running afoul of the NCAA, theyre here instead, hypothetically runnin with the 92 Rebels rather than taking the court against present-day teams in the real-life tourney.",[]
fivethirtyeight.com,2016-03-08 02:44:42+00:00,Bloomberg Might Have Produced President Trump,['Nate Silver'],"That Michael Bloomberg wont be running for president cant be considered a huge surprise. The former New York mayor was previously rumored to be seeking the White House in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, according to news reports compiled by The Atlantics David Graham, but failed to enter each time.

Bloombergs decision, announced on Monday afternoon, is still a reasonably big deal, however, because as Bloomberg himself concluded, his candidacy could potentially have thrown the election to Donald Trump.

There are various ways to get at this conclusion. While there hasnt been a ton of public polling testing Bloombergs candidacy, most of it showed Bloomberg taking more votes from Hillary Clinton than from Trump in a potential three-way race.

Ideologically, Bloomberg wouldnt have all that much space to himself. Bloombergs policies are more center-left than truly centrist, making it hard for him to differentiate himself from Hillary Clinton. And Trump already in many ways resembles an independent candidate.

Bernie Sanders, if he were the nominee, might have provided Bloomberg with slightly more running room. But after Super Tuesday, with Sanders running well behind the delegate pace he needs to win the Democratic race, Clinton now looks like the much more likely Democratic nominee  perhaps a factor in Bloombergs decision.

Its also hard to see how the demographics would work for Bloomberg. As it happens, Ive been working on a model of a potential third-party candidacy. Because were writing this story on short notice, Im going to be more circumspect than usual about describing it. But the basic conclusion is that its incredibly hard to find many votes for a center-left third-party candidate without eating substantially into the Democratic coalition.

The model, which is built on data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, divides the American electorate into six roughly equal groups:

African-Americans (12 percent of voting population) : extremely Democratic-leaning.

: extremely Democratic-leaning.

Hispanic, Asian, other and mixed races (14 percent): Also strongly Democratic leaning, especially in recent elections.

Also strongly Democratic leaning, especially in recent elections.

White evangelicals (23 percent) : Strongly Republican .

Strongly Republican

White cosmopolitans (20 percent) : These are white, non-evangelical voters who favor both gay marriage and a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who entered the country illegally. Theyre a highly Democratic-leaning group, mostly concentrated in urban areas and college towns.

: These are white, non-evangelical voters who favor both gay marriage and a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who entered the country illegally. Theyre a highly Democratic-leaning group, mostly concentrated in urban areas and college towns.

White picket fence voters (15 percent) : These are whites who are neither evangelicals nor cosmopolitans, but have high socioeconomic status as indicated by income, education levels, home ownership and other factors. This is a largely suburban, center-right group who went for Mitt Romney over Barack Obama about 2 to 1 in the previous election.

: These are whites who are neither evangelicals nor cosmopolitans, but have high socioeconomic status as indicated by income, education levels, home ownership and other factors. This is a largely suburban, center-right group who went for Mitt Romney over Barack Obama about 2 to 1 in the previous election.

White working-class voters (16 percent): Whites who are neither evangelicals nor cosmopolitans, and have lower socioeconomic status. Once a good group for Democrats, they now vote Republican about 2 to 1.

As Ive said, Ive found it very difficult to get Bloomberg to more than about 30 percent of the vote. Even that would be extremely generous, in my view. But it isnt that hard to imagine him taking most of his potential votes from Clinton. Heres one hypothetical case:

PREDICTED VOTE SHARES VOTER GROUP SHARE OF ELECTORATE CLINTON BLOOMBERG TRUMP African-Americans 12% 80% 15% 5% Hispanics, Asians and other races 14 65 25 10 White evangelicals 23 10 10 80 White cosmopolitans 20 45 50 5 White picket fence voters 15 15 65 20 White working-class voters 16 15 15 70

In this scenario, Bloomberg wins about half of white cosmopolitans, along with about two-thirds of white picket fence voters. But he doesnt make much inroads with the other groups, especially white evangelicals and working-class voters, who mostly go with Trump. Bloomberg takes a few black and Hispanic votes away from Clinton, but not many.

This would produce a fairly close popular-vote outcome: Trump 35.5 percent, Clinton 34.7 percent, Bloomberg 29.8 percent. (To repeat, I think this is probably very optimistic for Bloomberg.) But hed deprive Clinton of some of the white swing voters shed need to win the Electoral College. In fact, according to our model, this scenario would result in a fairly lopsided Electoral College win for Trump, with Trump getting 311 electoral votes to 181 for Clinton and 46 for Bloomberg, whose wins would be restricted to a handful of predominantly white states like New Hampshire with a high number of moderate and independent voters.

To repeat, this scenario does not have Trump winning all that many votes: only 35.5 percent, a figure that coincides with his low favorability ratings among the general population. But that would nonetheless be enough for Trump to win most swing states if Clinton and Bloomberg split the remainder of the vote. Here are the estimates our model produces for the traditionally most competitive states:

STATE CLINTON BLOOOMBERG TRUMP WINNER Colorado 33.6 32.1 34.3 Trump Florida 34.6 29.1 36.3 Trump Iowa 30.0 32.9 37.1 Trump Michigan 35.4 29.9 34.6 Clinton Minnesota 31.7 33.6 34.7 Trump Nevada 36.4 29.9 33.7 Clinton New Hampshire 29.2 37.8 33.0 Bloomberg New Mexico 39.0 32.6 28.4 Clinton North Carolina 33.8 24.0 42.2 Trump Ohio 32.2 28.7 39.1 Trump Pennsylvania 32.8 31.8 35.4 Trump Virginia 35.2 28.8 36.0 Trump Wisconsin 31.0 34.7 34.3 Bloomberg

Clinton holds up well in states in states such as New Mexico, where Democrats rely on a substantial minority turnout. But shed be vulnerable in predominantly white states, which would mostly go to Trump (Iowa, Ohio, Minnesota) or in some cases to Bloomberg (Wisconsin, New Hampshire).

As Ive said, these scenarios are hypothetical. But Id encourage you to play around with the numbers yourself and see if you can get a Bloomberg-like third-party candidate within range of an Electoral College victory. More likely, a candidate who appealed to wealthy, secular, cosmopolitan white voters, but not religious whites or working-class whites, and who still ceded most minority voters to Democrats, would have a heck of a time building a plurality (much less a majority) coalition. Essentially, such a candidate would be splitting the Democratic base, while only picking up a few voters who ordinarily vote Republican.

That would be bad news for Clinton, bad news for Bloomberg  and great news for Trump. And despite fanciful maps put forward by Bloombergs advisors that had him competing in Tennessee and Texas, Bloomberg saw the writing on the wall and decided not to run.

fivethirtyeight.com,2016-03-09 06:23:44+00:00,Marco Rubio Never Had A Base,['Nate Silver'],"Except in the improbable event that he comes back to win the Republican nomination, Marco Rubio is likely to become a political idiom. As Mike Huckabee is synonymous with a candidate who wins Iowa on the basis of evangelical support but cant expand beyond that, or Fred Thompson is a stand-in for a candidate who launches his campaign too late, a Rubioesque candidate will be one who is everyones second choice.

For a long time, polls have shown Rubio as perhaps the most broadly acceptable candidate within the Republican field, with high favorability ratings and competitive performances in hypothetical one-on-one matchups against Donald Trump. But Rubio has just about 20 percent of the Republican vote so far and has won only Minnesota and Puerto Rico. Hawaii results are still pending as I write this, but he did terribly everywhere else on Tuesday and will probably fail to receive any delegates from Michigan, Mississippi or Idaho.

Data like this can produce cognitive dissonance. At times during the campaign, Rubio perpetually seemed to be either overrated or underrated, depending on who was doing the rating. But theres nothing inherently contradictory about it. If Trump is the candidate with a high floor of support but perhaps a relatively low ceiling, Rubio is the opposite, with a lot of potential supporters but a low floor  he doesnt have much of a base.

Increasingly, that potential looks as though it will go unrealized. But I want to back up and consider why Rubio is in this predicament. I wont focus on recent strategic decisions made by his campaign, such as his potty humor directed at Trump, insofar as these decisions are more the effect of his problems (when youre losing, its rational to employ high-risk strategies) than the cause of them. Instead, I see three main issues for Rubio that have dated back to the start of his campaign:

Problem No. 1: Rubio hasnt built up a lot of voter loyalty.

Its not my job to judge the candidates credentials, but I sympathize with Republicans who think Rubios are a little light. As a first-term senator at a time of political gridlock, he hasnt gotten much legislation passed: According to the Thomas database, the only bill to have become law of which Rubio was the main sponsor is the Girls Count Act of 2015. His most high-profile legislative effort, on immigration reform, ended in failure. Rubio did have some accomplishments as speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, although he hasnt talked about them much on the campaign trail. Perhaps thats because Rubio is wary of drawing comparisons to Barack Obama, who, likewise, was a first-term U.S. senator and a former state legislator when he sought the presidency.

But Rubio didnt replicate Obamas success in one important way. Whereas Obama built a gigantic ground operation from the earliest stages of his campaign, Rubio failed to develop much of one. That contributes toward a low floor. If youre not contacting voters personally, they arent all that invested in you, and although they may come your way from time to time, they also may abandon you at the first sign of trouble.

Also unlike Obama, Rubio didnt receive all that much media exposure. Instead, like every other Republican candidate, he was overshadowed by Trump, who got nine times as much coverage on network news as Rubio did in 2015. Without that vetting having taken place earlier in the campaign, Republicans are learning a lot about Rubio as theyre already in the midst of voting, contributing to the volatility in his political standing.

Problem No. 2: Trying to be everything to everyone isnt easy.

You may remember our old friend the Republican five-ring circus diagram, which depicts the overlapping constituencies that the Republican candidates seek to win votes from. From the start, weve put Rubio in the establishment circle, thinking hes too far removed from his days as a tea-party-backed candidate to still qualify as one.

The establishment circle is a special place, however. Its not that there are literally all that many establishment voters (except, maybe, in the northern Virginia suburbs, where Rubio performed well). Instead, the more successful establishment candidates seek to be consensus candidates, keeping the peace with some or all party factions. Consider Mitt Romney, who was elected governor in Massachusetts as a pragmatic moderate, then ran as a movement conservative in the Republican race of 2008 and then was somewhere in between those things when he was nominated in 2012. Or Obama, who in 2008 ran as a post-partisan candidate to some Democratic voters and as a progressive hero to others.

Such candidates can be accused of shape-shifting or flip-flopping, but they often capture their partys nomination. Such a strategy requires a lot of political dexterity, however. Not only do you have to stay on message, you have to sustain multiple messages to multiple audiences. (Trump, although hardly a consensus candidate, has some of this ability.) It helps to have surrogates vouching for you to different constituencies, something Rubio didnt have a lot of until recently. And it helps to have enough media exposure to avoid being typecast in one role, something Rubio hasnt had all that much of in Trumps shadow.

Problem No. 3: Rubios cosmopolitan image is an odd match for his conservative politics.

The Republican race is tricky to map demographically, especially in comparison to the Democratic one. Trumps best congressional districts so far, according to data that my colleague Aaron Bycoffe and I have collected, include such diverse places as NV-1 (Las Vegas), AL-4 (rural northwest Alabama) and MA-9 (far eastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod).

Rubios best districts have a bit more in common. Here are the five congressional districts where he received the largest share of the vote through Super Tuesday:

TX-33: A highly Democratic district covering parts of Dallas and its suburbs.

MN-5: A highly Democratic district covering parts of Minneapolis and its suburbs.

GA-5: An extremely Democratic district covering parts of Atlanta and its suburbs.

MN-4: A highly Democratic district covering parts of St. Paul, Minnesota, and its suburbs.

VA-8: A highly Democratic district in northern Virginia, covering the Washington suburbs.

Now, if Rubio were a moderate or liberal Republican (or a conservative running in moderate garb, like John Kasich), this is pretty much what youd expect to see. But he isnt: Rubios voting record and issue positions are quite conservative, and hes run as a conservative. Furthermore, although this has varied some from state to state, exit polls havent shown Rubio doing especially well with moderate voters; in South Carolina, for example, he won 23 percent of the vote from moderate Republicans, about the same as his share of the vote overall. It may be that Rubios most reliable voters are conservatives who live among liberals, a difficult group to build a base from.

The other thing we can tell about Rubios supporters is that they have high socioeconomic status, especially as measured by education. So do Kasichs  whereas by contrast, Ted Cruzs and especially Trumps have lower incomes and education levels. Roughly speaking, you can plot the Republican candidates on a two-by-two grid that looks like this:

That chart is a simplification, of course, most notably because it implies that the four quadrants are equally sized when they probably arent. Trump, in particular, is proving that theres a fairly large market for populism among Republicans and independents who vote in Republican primaries, especially those with lower socioeconomic status. Trumps voters average out to being fairly moderate, although they arent conventionally so: From what we can tell, for instance, his voters dont care very much about abortion or gay marriage, although they do care about immigration.

Rubio, by contrast, may be proving that theres not all that large a market for what you might call an upscale or cosmopolitan conservative. Many voters in the near-in suburbs, Rubios best areas geographically, long ago left the Republican Party. Rubio might have the image to win them back  young, Hispanic, optimistic  but he doesnt have the policies, being staunchly conservative on issues such as abortion and gay marriage. Likewise, while Rubio appears to do well among nonwhite Republicans, there are very few of them voting in the primaries, and Rubio has turned away from the moderate immigration positions that once might have won him more Latino support.

Rubio is also somewhat boxed in by Cruz and, to a perhaps underappreciated extent, Kasich. If Cruz werent in the race, there would be a scramble between Rubio and Trump for voters in the bottom-right corner of the chart, who have lower socioeconomic status but are highly conservative (and often very religious). Rubio might win it: He could position himself as the only true conservative in the race, and polls suggest that more Cruz supporters have Rubio as their second choice than Trump. If Kasich were out of the race, meanwhile, Rubio could pivot more toward the center  at an opportune time, given that the calendar is turning to blue and purple states. But with Cruz and Kasich still running  and in fact, seeming to gain ground in recent days  Rubio is back to where he started, as a lot of voters second choice.",[]
fivethirtyeight.com,2016-03-08 21:31:56+00:00,Could Michigan Change The Course Of The GOP Race?,['A Fivethirtyeight Chat'],"For this weeks politics Slack chat, we preview todays primaries and caucuses. The transcript below has been lightly edited.

Check out our live coverage of todays primary elections.

micah (Micah Cohen, politics editor): Its not quite as super as Super Tuesday, but its Tuesday and there are elections, so thats something. Republicans vote in four states: Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho and Hawaii. Democrats go to the polls in two: Michigan and Mississippi. So lets set the stakes in each state one by one. Lets start in Michigan. Clare, whos favored in the GOP race? And what should we be looking for in the results?

clare.malone (Clare Malone, senior political writer): Well, Donald Trump is still favored to win in Michigan, and that lovely little bifurcated state is pretty much the big prize of today.

natesilver (Nate Silver, editor in chief): Dont call my state bifurcated, Clare.

clare.malone: Its gimpy, man. I just call it like I see it.

natesilver: Just gonna plant this little clip here:

harry (Harry Enten, senior political writer): Wheres the Columbia Lions football clip?

clare.malone: I think as far as what were looking for in the results, especially following some unexpected results on Saturday, where Trump didnt win some states we thought he might, were looking to see if people have slumped a bit in their support of him. John Kasich has been spending an awful lot of time in Michigan, and Trump might have turned off some sensible Michiganders with his Thursday night debate performance, so itll be interesting to see what the win, place, show is up there.

Oh, and to Nates above, all I have to say is muck fichigan.

natesilver: Our polls-plus model gives Trump an 8 percent chance of losing Michigan. Which is not high, obviously, although also not zero.

In general, today isnt a huge day for delegate allocation because everything is quite proportional. But Michigan will matter for The Narrative, will it not? And in turn how everything plays out between now and March 15.

clare.malone: I think the narrative point is key here  Mitt Romney, Ill note, recorded robocalls for Kasich and Rubio, both in Michigan.

harry: The state has 59 delegates at stake, with a 15 percent threshold, and awards its delegates proportionally. One candidate can take all the delegates if they clear 50 percent, but no one is likely to do that.

micah: Will Marco Rubio clear 15 percent?

natesilver: Id put Rubio at less than even money to reach it. Our polls-plus model puts him at 14 percent, and it wouldnt surprise me if theres some last-minute tactical voting shifting from Rubio to Kasich.

harry: Yeah, there are signs Rubio will not make the threshold. Moreover, there are signs from the latest Monmouth University poll that Rubio is declining and Kasich is rising quickly. Itll be interesting to see if Kasich beats out Ted Cruz for second and if he can replace Rubio as the mainstream conservative in the Illinois primary next Tuesday; Trump leads in Illinois but is only at 33 percent in our weighted polling average for the state.

The narrative coming out of Michigan could be that Kasich has some momentum, and thats important since next Tuesday is do or die for Kasich in Ohio, where our polls-plus model has him as a slight favorite but our polls-only model has him as a slight underdog.

natesilver: If Kasich comes close to Trump in Michigan, that will obviously bode very well for him in Ohio. If Kasich beats Trump  well, I think thats a different ballgame.

clare.malone: Thats all assuming that a lot of people who have recently joined the Trump train are doing so because they figure hes got the momentum so why the hell not  Kasich winning in Michigan might get some of those people to stop a little.

micah: Clare, what is Trumps appeal in Michigan?

clare.malone: Its the whole white working-class Democrats demographic that weve been hearing so much about as one of the big strongholds of Trump support. Michigan is filled with people who have been hurt by globalization, jobs leaving the country, etc., and theres something about the Trump aura and his promises to return America to greatness that really speaks to the Rust Belt; its a nostalgic region in many ways.

natesilver: While Michigans economy has recovered quite nicely  unemployment is around 5 percent  its working-class population has been through some hard times in the past decade or two.

clare.malone: Right. There are a lot of notions of perpetual underdog-ness that are a big part of the region. Thats up Trumps alley.

natesilver: There are parts of Michigan that are good for each of the candidates, however. Western Michigan has more evangelicals than youd think, which will be good for Cruz. It has a fairly pragmatic state Republican Party, which could be good for Rubio. And it borders Ohio, good for Kasich.

Part of the reason Trump might hold on there, in fact, is because the rest of the vote will split two or three ways.

harry: Rick Santorum did quite well in Michigan in 2012. One other thing Id like to point out is that the primary in Michigan is open. Itll be interesting to see if we get a crossover vote from independents and Democrats who want to stop Trump, as they tried to do in Virginia, or if the openness merely allows Trump to do well as he has tended to do in open contests so far.

natesilver: John McCain won Michigan in 2000, for what its worth.

micah: Before we move on, give me some vote/delegate benchmarks: What would be good for Trump/Rubio/Kasich/Cruz?

harry: To be on track to win the nomination, per our benchmarks, Trump should get 25 delegates, Rubio 23 and Cruz 22. Kasich isnt even listed on our tracker.

micah: Well, Kasich, even if he wins Ohio and Michigan, doesnt really have a delegate path to the nomination, right?

harry: Kasich is basically playing for a contested convention.

clare.malone: Right. He said it would be exciting the other day.

natesilver: Im just going to take our polls-plus forecast and basically add 3 percentage points to everyone to say what would constitute a good night. Trump would love to get 40 percent, which would quiet some of the talk about his having a ceiling, although the mid-to-high 30s would probably still suffice for him to win. Kasich would love to get in the high 20s. Cruz would love to break 25 in a state that wasnt expected to be good for him. Rubio would just like to get on the board with some delegates, which means 15 percent.

micah: OK, whats going to happen on the Democratic side in Michigan?

clare.malone: Democratic side: Hillary Clinton probs gonna win that one. #analysis

natesilver: Yeah, Trump losing Michigan wouldnt be a Lakers-Warriors upset, but it would be a big upset. Clinton losing would be an ENORMOUS upset.

harry: Clinton, by the way, has led in every single poll taken in Michigan, and its a state that Bernie Sanders should win if he is to have any shot at the nomination. According to our demographics-based targets, Sanders would win Michigan by 4 percentage points if the race were tied nationally.

micah: Lets go to Mississippi GOP ...

clare.malone: Mississippi could be another place for Cruz to shine, right?

micah: Isnt Trump favored in Mississippi?

natesilver: Trump is favored in Mississippi. Though we havent gotten enough polls to run a forecast for the state, hes won every surrounding state. You could get into an interesting argument about whether Mississippi or Michigan is the more likely upset state, I suppose.

harry: Mississippi is fascinating to me because it is the last Deep South state to vote. (Florida is not the Deep South.) So far, Trump has been able to win with support in the lows 40s in the Deep South. But there were strong signs on Saturday that Cruz was taking supporters from the other non-Trumps, and Cruz nearly won in Louisiana. Can he do the same in Mississippi tonight? It may be too little too late in terms of the delegates, but it would be something else given that the polling hasnt generally been all that close.

natesilver: Yeah, so thats why its tricky. Mississippi should inherently be stronger than Michigan for Trump. But, also, theres a clear anti-Trump to coordinate around in Mississippi but less so up north.

clare.malone: Right, I think Cruz is actually the most interesting guy to watch tonight. Hes the most proven spoiler so far this race  Im still on the Maine results. And if Cruz can kill the Rubio faux-momentum with more strong finishes or even notch an upset in, say, Mississippi, well then ... what the heck does that do to the race? Thats probably mostly just a thought exercise, since it seems unlikely Trump would fall that far but still.

natesilver: Weird question, but is Rubio hoping for Trump to have a kinda-good night?

micah: Honestly, Im not sure anything helps Rubio beyond winning states.

clare.malone: Hmm ... maybe in some twisted way, yes. That campaign, Rubios, is obviously in a little bit of turmoil  there were reports from CNN that some campaign aides were thinking that he should drop out pre-Florida if he doesnt do well today. If Cruz did well and Rubio didnt, that wouldnt look so hot.

harry: It depends on whether or not Rubio can come away with a victory or two, say in Hawaii or Idaho.

natesilver: Would a Hawaii win matter for The Narrative? We wont get results in until the wee hours of the morning. BTW, I hate The Narrative, but it matters more than usual in this case because both voters and party actors are trying to coordinate around several different strategies.

Lets talk Idaho, though. A Rubio win there would be a real surprise.

micah: Harry seems to think its possible.

clare.malone: Last poll in February had Cruz in second behind Trump.

harry: I just think its unknowable, and I do know that Rubio campaigned out there recently. I would not trust any of the polls from that state, to be honest. Its a closed primary, and it is rarely competitive.

clare.malone: KNOWN UNKNOWNS!

natesilver: That poll had Trump up. But its also a couple of weeks old, and we know that Cruz has gained on Trump nationally since that time. Also, Cruz has an outright lead on Trump in Google searches in Idaho, which seems meaningful if were looking for little scraps of information. I think Idaho leans Cruz.

harry: Concur with Nathaniels assessment.

micah: And Hawaii?

natesilver: Betting markets have Rubio favored there, I guess on the theory that he does well on islands? Or in states where people are nice, like Minnesota? Hawaii is an island with really nice people, so maybe it favors Rubio?

clare.malone: Yeah, for some reason, I see Hawaii as a Rubio state: Rich Republicans with island houses. I think the idea would be that Hawaii Republicans are analogous to those rich suburbanites who love Rubio in the Midwest and elsewhere.

natesilver: I dunno, though, Cruz seems like a pretty good default pick in eccentric caucus states too.

harry: Hawaii has a lot of Mormons at the BYU campus. It is not a Trump state.

clare.malone: Want me to fly out and see what Cruzs Hawaii ground game is like?

natesilver: Also a lot of Mormons in Idaho. One annoying thing about Nevada is that the entrance poll didnt include a breakout of LDS voters.

clare.malone: Anecdotally, they were fairly split between Cruz and Rubio when I talked to people in Nevada.

micah: Two more things before we wrap: 1) Clinton is favored in Mississippi by a ton, right?

harry: Clinton is a HUGE favorite.

natesilver: Yeah, and Sanders is even at some risk of not getting 15 percent, which would deny him any delegates.

clare.malone: Whoever can spell Mississippi fastest wins that primary, I believe. So could be a tossup. But Clinton is pretty verbally dexterous, so Id concur with the stats guys on this.

harry: And this is the whole problem with Sanderss campaign. Its not just that he loses states; he loses states by a big margin. You cant do that when delegates are allocated proportionally. Clinton learned that in 2008, and Sanders is learning that now.

natesilver: I feel like were underselling the importance of Michigan to the Democratic race. It should be among the more representative states to have voted so far. A fairly large black population, but also some huge college campuses. Liberal-ish but not super liberal. So if Clinton wins there by 20 or something, it doesnt bode well for Sanders. Then again, I have a gut feeling  WHICH YOU SHOULD TOTALLY IGNORE  that Sanders could beat his polling there.

clare.malone: I mean, if Sanders does well with working-class whites, then maybe he could, sure.

harry: Whats your definition of beating polling, Nate? I do think hell beat the Mitchell poll that had him down 37 percentage points.

natesilver: The polls have sorta been all over the place on the Democratic side in Michigan, so fair point. Our polls-only forecast has it at Clinton +21. But Im talking single digits, I suppose. Err ... Im not predicting single digits, but I think Bernies range is a little wider than our model has it.

micah: Lets say Sanders keeps it close, what would that suggest about the overall state of the Democratic race?

clare.malone: Well, it would depend on which types of voters he did well with, right? If he did better with minority voters, that could say something significant.

harry: According to our delegate tracker, Sanders should win a majority of delegates if hes on pace to win the nomination. If he falls short of that but is competitive, I think it means Clinton isnt blowing him away nationally but she has a clear lead.

natesilver: It might suggest a little bit of complacency on the part of Clintons voters. In sports, wed call Michigan a let-down game. Michigan was also home to one of the most famous upsets in polling history, when Engler beat Blanchard in 1990 as Democrats thought they had it in the bag and didnt turn out to vote.

harry: Nate was 12 for that one. Lets just say I was younger.

clare.malone: A young man never forgets his first polling upset.

micah: All right, to close, lets play our headline game; what will the headline of The Wall Street Journal be tomorrow morning?

clare.malone: DOW PLUNGES, which is basically what it is 50 percent of the time.

natesilver: DOW RISES.

harry: Mike Bloombergs decision continues to sadden Wall Street.

natesilver: Micah, Im better at New York Times headlines.

clare.malone: Trump Tramps Through Three States (Could not get one more T for the life of me.)

micah: I like that.

natesilver: Trump Survives Challenge As Rivals Look To Sharpen Pitch

clare.malone: Or flatten it (that was a music joke that ... fell flat).

micah: Nate, what the hell does that mean?

natesilver: I mean, the modal outcome is pretty ambiguous. Trump wins MI/MS but not by as much as we would have expected a couple of weeks ago. Loses ID/HI but nobody pays much attention to them. Status quo, so you get a weird ambiguous headline.

clare.malone: Basically, everyone is just waiting for NEXT Tuesday: Nation Waits With Bated Breath For A Week From Now.

harry: Id like to point out that we still have contests before next Tuesday. The Virgin Islands Republican caucus is on Thursday, and the Guam and Washington, D.C., Republican conventions are on Saturday. I will be following those closely because I have no life.

natesilver: We want to break some news here, actually. We contacted the Virgin Islands Republican Party and confirmed that their caucus is on Thursday. Other sites list the date incorrectly.

micah: BREAKING!

natesilver: No, seriously. Theyre having their caucus on March 10, not March 19.

micah: Credit to Aaron Bycoffe.

natesilver: Credit to Bycoffe, yes. Also the Republican National Committees rulebook, which says March 10.

micah: Harry, we still need your headline!

fivethirtyeight.com,2016-03-09 21:52:54+00:00,Why The Polls Missed Bernie Sanderss Michigan Upset,['Carl Bialik'],"If Bernie Sanders were to defeat Hillary Clinton in Michigans Democratic primary, it would be among the greatest polling errors in primary history, our editor in chief, Nate Silver, wrote Tuesday evening when results started to come in. Sanders pulled it off, and now were left wondering how it happened. How did Sanders win by 1.5 percentage points when our polling average showed Clinton ahead by 21 points and our forecasts showed that Sanders had less than a 1 percent chance of winning?

With a polling miss this big, no single factor is likely to explain it, so more than one answer could be correct. Also, not every pollster releases detailed data, and it may take some time to fully diagnose what went wrong. Its a little bit of everything, Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray told The Huffington Post.

Here is our initial assessment of some possible explanations, along with comments from some of the pollsters who had reported a big Clinton lead:

Pollsters underestimated youth turnout. Voters under 30 made up 19 percent of Democratic primary voters, nearly as large a share as voters 65 or older, according to exit polls. Mitchell Research and Communications, which showed a 37 percentage point Clinton lead in a poll conducted Sunday, found that people younger than 50 would make up less than a quarter of all voters; they made up more than half instead. Mitchell was one of the only pollsters in the state to poll using only calls to landlines, and most Americans younger than 45 live in households without landlines. But even Monmouth, which dialed cellphones, too, underestimated the turnout among younger voters. Perhaps all the polls showing a big Clinton lead sowed complacency among Clinton supporters, who skew older  though big leads in polls in Southern states didnt stop her supporters from helping her romp to big victories.

Pollsters underestimated Sanderss dominance among young voters. Not only did more young voters turn out than expected, but Sanders won 81 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds. A YouGov poll showed him winning 66 percent.

Pollsters underestimated the number of independent voters who would participate in the primary. YouGov expected Sanders to beat Clinton by 38 percentage points among independent voters participating in the open Democratic primary. He won those voters by 43 percentage points. But no one expected independents to make up 27 percent of voters; YouGov expected about 12 percent. There were too many Democrats in the poll, said Will Jordan, elections editor at YouGov.

Pollsters underestimated Sanderss support among black voters. Sanders had won less than 20 percent of black voters in most states with large black populations, and Mitchell and YouGov both showed Sanders winning less than 20 percent of them in Michigan. Instead he won 28 percent.

Pollsters missed a late break to Sanders by not polling after Sunday. Clinton and Sanders debated in Flint on Sunday and met in a town hall in Detroit on Monday. No public pollsters contacted voters after either event. Sanders did slightly better among voters who decided in the week before the primary, according to exit polls. An earlier polling miss, in the Iowa Republican caucuses, may have resulted in part from a scarcity of late polls. And there were signs before Sunday that Sanders was closing the gap: In the YouGov poll, 45 percent of Michigan Democrats said their opinion of Sanders was getting better, and just 8 percent said it was getting worse. For Clinton, the numbers were 38 percent and 19 percent.

Some Clinton supporters chose to vote in the Republican primary. We know 7 percent of voters in the Republican primary identified themselves as Democrats to exit pollsters, compared with just 4 percent of voters in the Democratic primary who said they were Republicans. Those 7 percent of Dems were likely mostly Hillary voters who thought she had an easy win and they could do their part trying to stop [Donald] Trump, said Bernie Porn of pollster EPIC-MRA. The exit-poll samples are too small, though, to check that.

Pollsters had little recent history to work with. Michigans Democratic primary was weird in 2008 (Barack Obama wasnt on the ballot), and the state party held caucuses in 2000 and 2004 that werent really competitive. So relying on voter history could lead pollsters astray. Remember, we havent had a real Democratic presidential primary in Michigan lately, said Matt Grossmann, director of the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at Michigan State University, which showed the tightest race of any late polls, with Clinton leading by 5 percentage points.

This is an outlier, a perfectly rotten combination of bad luck and bad timing. Several pollsters pointed out that they used the same methods in the Michigan Democratic primary as in other primaries  including Michigans Republican primary  with relative success.

Polls on the Republican race, including ours, were generally OK, said Barbara Carvalho of the Marist Poll. She added that all polls on the Democratic race had Clinton winning. So, something clearly changed in the closing days.

fivethirtyeight.com,2016-03-10 17:17:56+00:00,Why Am I Right-Handed?,['Maggie Koerth-baker'],"The questions kids ask about science arent always easy to answer. Sometimes, their little brains can lead to big places adults forget to explore. With that in mind, were starting a new series called Science Questions From a Toddler, which will use kids curiosity as a jumping-off point to investigate the scientific wonders that surround us all. I want the toddlers in your life to be a part of it! Send me their science questions and they may serve as the inspiration for a column. And now, our first toddler ...

Q: Why am I right-handed?  Josephine Kimball, age 5.

The short answer, dear Josephine, is that you are right-handed because most of humanity is right-handed. About 90 percent of us are righties  though the rate can vary by country and time period. Also, almost all the information we have on this comes from Western countries after the year 1900. As you grow up, you will learn to raise a mighty eyebrow at generalizations taken from such limited data. Sometimes, though, its all youve got.

Its pretty cool that you asked the question this way  why are people right-handed? When we adults talk about handedness, we tend to focus on the lefties. There are fewer of them, so we think theyre the strange ones. But the reality is that we dont know which is strange and which is not, because we dont really know what causes handedness at all. If there is an inherent biological tendency toward being right-handed, then yeah, the lefties are weird. But if theres not  and there might not be!  then its the righty majority whose existence becomes super confusing. Most of us think of handedness as simple and binary. Even scientists used to think the distinction between lefties and righties was mostly genetic. Turns out, thats wrong.

Heres what we do know: Humans are pretty asymmetrical creatures. That applies to both how we use the body parts we have and where things are in the first place. Our hearts tend to be on the left. Our livers tend to be on the right. Not only do these asymmetries exist, but some of them seem to be interconnected. People who are right-handed tend to process language on the left side of their brain.

Theres a way to see this connection: the Wada Test, a tool that doctors sometimes use to prepare people for brain surgery. First, you have your patient hold up both hands and talk. Then you inject a syringe full of barbiturates into her left carotid artery. (Please do not try this at home.) As soon as the drugs hit the left side of the brain and anesthetize it, 90 percent of right-handed people will lose control of their right hand, says William Hopkins, a professor of neuroscience at Georgia State University. Itll just drop into their lap, and theyll become unable to speak. But whats strange is that about 70 percent of left-handed people will also lose their language ability if you paralyze the left side of the brain. The rest are about evenly split between processing language on the right and processing it with both sides. Nobody knows why most righties are asymmetrical and most lefties arent.

That alone should tell you theres something a little weird about handedness. But scientists used to think it was a simple trait, easily explained. One of the most popular genetic models for handedness was proposed in 1985 by psychologist Chris McManus. Called the dextral/chance model, it proposed that handedness is determined by a single gene that comes in two varieties, dextral (D), meaning righty, and chance (C), meaning literally just chance. People who got a C variant from both parents would have a 50-50 chance of being lefties. The pairing of CD would take that chance down to 25 percent. People with DD would all be right-handed.

But in 2013, a paper published in the journal Heredity demonstrated that handedness had to involve more genes than that  a lot more. The researchers analyzed the genomes of 3,940 twins whose handedness was recorded from previous studies. First, they found that identical twins, who share all the same genetic material, werent significantly more likely to have the same dominant hand than fraternal twins, who are just regular siblings who shared a womb. That alone starts to rule out simple genetics.

Second, they failed to find any genes that stood out as connecting unrelated people who had the same dominant hand. If the genetics of handedness were simple, we ought to be able to look at the genomes of a bunch of unrelated righties and see a gene or genes they all shared. One of the co-authors was the same Chris McManus who first proposed the dextral/chance model. To John Armour, a professor of human genetics at the University of Nottingham in the U.K. and an author on the paper, thats a big deal. Its safe to say the simple models are out of date now, he told me.

On the contrary. I think the dextral/chance model is still the best explanation we have, McManus wrote in an email. The important thing is that there probably isnt a gene for left-handedness. Its still likely that we are dealing with genes that either make a person right-handed or leave her handedness to chance, the latter of which results in some left-handed people. All that has changed, McManus wrote, is that we now know this must involve many genes, rather than just one. He published a paper in 2013 that made this same basic point. Armour was one of his co-authors.

However Armour and McManuss debate hashes out, their research fits right in with a growing body of evidence, drawn from other studies of twins, that suggest genetics only accounts for about 25 percent of the variation in handedness. Some of these studies have involved as many as 30,000 sets of twins. If there were simple inheritance going on, that should be a big enough sample to show it. But Armour says researchers were still surprised by how little of the variation seems to be genetic.

To put it in context, blood groups (the immune system categories that determine who can take a blood transfusion from whom) are based on simple inheritance and are almost 100 percent attributable to genetics. Height is more complex, involving 300-odd genes, the most powerful of which accounts for only about 4 millimeters of growth, Armour told me. But even that is highly heritable. The numbers vary depending on the study, but scientists think 60 percent to 80 percent of your height comes from genetics. Body mass index, skin color, hair color, eye color  most obvious physical traits have high rates of genetic heritability. Sixty, 70 percent or above, Armour told me. Handedness is a distinct outlier.

So, if you arent right-handed because of your genes, what causes it? We know handedness can be affected by social forces. In most Western cultures, for instance, generations born at the beginning of the 20th century had left-handedness drilled (or sometimes beaten) out of them, says Tulya Kavaklioglu, a graduate student at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics who is studying the connections between handedness, language and genetics. She pointed to a study from 1981 on the prevalence of left-handed Australians. Among the study population, only about 2 percent of Australians born in 1880 were left-handed. Of the generation born in 1969, 13.2 percent were lefties. As it became more acceptable to be a lefty, Kavaklioglu says, more people were.

But culture doesnt totally explain it, either, Hopkins says. Human fetuses suck their thumbs in the womb, and almost all of them favor the right-hand digit, he told me. And theres a big debate over the hand our closest relatives prefer. Some researchers who have studied chimpanzees and other apes in the wild think that the chances of an individual ape being right-handed are about 50-50. Hopkins disagrees. That research counts a broad range of behaviors, from nose-picking to the hand an ape uses to touch a friend on the shoulder. His research narrows in on specific behaviors such as tool use, and it shows that apes, like humans, are mostly righties. The ratio of right-handed to left-handed chimps is lower than the ratio of right-handed to left-handed humans  2:1 as opposed to 9:1  but Hopkins told me he thinks the genetic determinant for apes might be stronger than it is in humans. In other words, humans are more likely to be right-handed than chimps, but chimps could be more likely to have inherited their handedness.

So is it nature or is it nurture? Its difficult to make all this evidence fit together in a way that makes sense. But Hopkins, Kavaklioglu and Armour say its easier if you understand this: Heritability isnt just about genetics. You are right-handed because of genes. You are right-handed because of culture. And you are right-handed because of other factors that affect you both before and after birth  things that can be heritable without being genetic.

Its not just your genes or what you explicitly learn. For instance, higher testosterone exposure in the womb is associated with increased rates of left-handedness, Kavaklioglu told me. Theres also implicit learning after birth, the kind that happens when babies watch and copy their parents behavior. Its possible, Hopkins says, that chimps and humans differ because human babies are born with less-developed brains. Theres more opportunity for our environments to turn a right-handed fetus into a left-handed child. Nobody knows for sure. But either way, handedness is a great example of how our perspective on genetics, as a whole, has changed. People used to think you could just hone in on the magic gene, Armour says. But weve come to appreciate that it can be more complicated than that.

fivethirtyeight.com,2016-03-10 19:18:40+00:00,Americans May Be Too Religious To Embrace Socialism,"['Andrew R', 'Paul A']","For over a century, scholars have wondered why the United States has never had a viable socialist movement. Socialist parties in other Western democracies, such as Britains Labour Party and Germanys Social Democratic Party, are regularly in and out of power, but the best socialist showing for president in the U.S. was Eugene Debss 6 percent in 1912.

Bernie Sanders has made socialism relevant again in this country. But will the U.S. join much of Western Europe in developing a successful socialist political tradition? Short of that, will the Sanders campaign ignite a new movement? Both are unlikely, at least for now, and a big part of the explanation why may lie in religion  religion inhibits socialisms spread and explains its lack of political mobilization.

To understand the relationship between socialist values and religion, we used the 2013 Public Religion Research Institutes Economic Values Study. As part of the survey, respondents were asked how much they agreed with a battery of statements regarding economic values, including It is the responsibility of the government to take care of people who cant take care of themselves, The government should do more to reduce the gap between the rich and poor and The government should guarantee health insurance for all citizens. We combined these into a socialism scale, the results of which suggest the average American is just left of center.

The conventional wisdom is that the individualist, evangelical style of American religion is a strong antidote to socialism. If faith alone can lead you to salvation, then efforts to reshape society are beside the point. But the animosity between them has been more pointed, especially regarding so called Godless communists who portrayed religion as the opiate of the masses. In these data, those who agreed that social problems would be resolved if enough people had a personal relationship with God were 20 percent less socialist than those who disagreed. A worldview that pits faith directly against collective action explains clearly why collectivist efforts have traditionally foundered in the U.S.

By the same token, Americans who are not religious (sometimes called the Nones) would be those most likely to hold socialist values. And indeed, this is what we find: Nones are 10 percent more socialist, on average, than religious Americans. The gap is greater among older people (15 percentage points at retirement age) and smaller among the young (5 percentage points at 18-24), perhaps because younger people are exposed to many more Nones and to greater economic insecurity than their elders. In what may be seen as a cruel irony given Sanderss difficulty with black voters, there is no such gap among nonwhite respondents  support for socialist values is high across the board. Even more, nonwhite respondents favor socialist values at equivalent levels as white Nones.

It seems that the Nones are key to socialisms fortune. While their growth in numbers may lead to more openness to socialist ideas, that is by no means certain. Nones are at a disadvantage in politics precisely because they lack religious affiliation: Churches are the most widespread social organizations in the U.S. Though not their primary purpose, churches connect individuals to political organizations and identities. Nones lack the organizational structure that helps connect their ideology to politics  in these data, 20 percent more young Nones are Independents than their religious peers, and they vote in very low numbers (about 12 percent in recent elections). Perhaps a portion of the lower than expected turnout among the young this nomination season can be attributed to the Nones.

Will socialism take hold in America in the near future? Though surveys continue to note majority support for socialist positions (especially among the young), its path is more difficult without the unifying and mobilizing force of religion.

For now, expect to see more of Hillary Clintons liberalism than Sanderss democratic socialism.",[]
fivethirtyeight.com,2016-03-10 20:37:06+00:00,Ted Cruz Might Still Be Able To Stop Donald Trump,['Nate Silver'],"The good news for the Republican establishment is that theres a man who might be able to stop Donald Trump. The bad news is that its Ted Cruz, someone they may dislike almost as much.

Cruz, who won Idaho on Tuesday while finishing second to Trump in Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii, is within striking distance of Trump. So far, 29 percent of Republican primary voters have voted for Cruz as compared with 35 percent for Trump. Meanwhile, Cruz trails Trump by 100 delegates: not a trivial gap, although only one more than the 99 at stake in winner-take-all Florida next Tuesday.

The problem for Cruz is that Florida and the rest of the calendar probably arent as favorable to him as the states that have voted so far. (Florida looks like a Trump state as Marco Rubio loses ground.) But Cruz does have a few things going for him. Hes tended to outperform his polling almost everywhere. Hes won states in all four major regions of the country. And he potentially stands to gain if Rubio and perhaps John Kasich drop out.

The exit polls in Michigan and Mississippi asked voters who theyd pick in a two-way race between Trump and Cruz, also giving them the option to say theyd sit out the race. Among Rubio voters, on average between the two states, about 75 percent said theyd still vote in a Trump-Cruz race, and of those, 80 percent would prefer Cruz to Trump. Kasich voters were somewhat more equivocal; 55 percent said theyd still vote, and of those, two-thirds would go to Cruz over Trump. Although this is the first time the exit polls have asked about one-on-one matchups, the results are consistent with national polls showing Trump losing ground as the field winnows, as well as exit polls in previous states showing Trump being unpopular with Republicans who arent already supporting him.

What would the rest of the map (and more importantly, the delegate tally) look like in a potential two-way race between Trump and Cruz? Im not ready to predict that. Beyond Florida and Ohio, which vote on Tuesday, there isnt much polling in the other states. Nor has the Republican race been all that predictable along demographic lines, with Trump having performed well in states as diverse as Massachusetts, Alabama and Hawaii.

What I will do, however, is retrodict how the race might have gone had it been a two-man contest between Cruz and Trump all along. Could Cruz have beaten Trump in South Carolina, for instance? To do this, Ill redistribute support from Rubio, Kasich and other candidates to Cruz and Trump based on the exit poll answers I described above. To repeat, these assume that most of their support would have gone to Cruz but not all of it, and also that a fair number of voters (especially Kasich voters) would sit out the race without their candidate on the ballot.

Heres how things might have looked:

ESTIMATED SHARE OF VOTE DELEGATES UNDER UNIFORM GOP RULES DATE STATE TRUMP CRUZ TRUMP CRUZ Feb. 1 Iowa 40.7 59.3 5 23 Feb. 9 New Hampshire 57.3 41.0 18 4 Feb. 20 South Carolina 47.6 52.3 10 37 Feb. 23 Nevada 56.7 42.9 22 6 March 1 Alabama 55.4 42.4 37 10 Alaska 43.4 56.6 6 21 Arkansas 43.1 54.5 8 30 Georgia 50.7 48.0 55 17 Massachusetts 64.9 32.5 34 6 Minnesota 34.7 65.2 6 30 Oklahoma 38.5 60.0 8 33 Tennessee 50.3 47.4 42 13 Texas 34.1 62.7 24 123 Vermont 53.3 43.0 12 3 Virginia 49.9 48.9 32 15 March 5 Kansas 30.5 68.4 6 32 Kentucky 45.9 52.4 10 34 Louisiana 47.0 49.8 14 30 Maine 39.0 59.7 4 18 March 6 Puerto Rico 29.8 64.2 3 19 March 8 Hawaii 50.4 48.4 14 4 Idaho 34.4 62.4 5 25 Michigan 49.2 45.7 39 17 Mississippi 52.5 45.0 30 8 Total 444 558 Share of delegates 42% 53% What if Trump and Cruz had run one-on-one?

These figures estimate that Cruz would have won South Carolina, Arkansas, Kentucky and Louisiana in addition to the states where he already beat Trump. He also would have won Minnesota and Puerto Rico, which originally went to Rubio. Several other states, such as Michigan, Georgia and Virginia, would have been close between Trump and Cruz. Trump would be fairly dominant in the Northeast, however, and would still have won Nevada easily.

Overall, however, its likely that Cruz would have a delegate lead on Trump. I havent gone through each states delegate rules in detail, which would require estimating the vote by congressional district. Instead, Ive applied something I call uniform Republican rules, which I introduced in a previous article. These are simplified delegate rules that give one-third of the delegates to the winner in each state, with an additional bonus for finishing with more than 50 percent of the vote, and distribute most of the rest proportionately. (The uniform rules also assign a small number of unpledged delegates in each state; these are not shown in the table.) Basically, they represent a compromise between winner-take-all and proportional methods that roughly reflects the rules in the average Republican primary and that approximates actual delegate allocations reasonably well.

Under these rules, Cruz would have 558 delegates to 444 for Trump. So instead of trailing Trump by 100 delegates, hed lead him by roughly that amount instead.

This might sound too optimistic for Cruz, and certainly there are things a method like this cant account for. (If Cruz had won South Carolina rather than Trump, for example, it would have changed media coverage of the race.) But keep in mind that Cruz is doing most of the work himself  he hasnt trailed Trump by all that much in the states that have voted. So giving him even some of the Rubio and Kasich voters is enough to put him over the top in several states that he narrowly lost.

Perhaps we shouldnt be grouping Rubio and Kasich together, however. Whereas Rubios numbers have been going downhill in Florida and other places, Kasich is even money or maybe a little better to win Ohio. And if hes sustained himself this long on the basis of little more than a few second-place finishes in the Northeast, why would he drop out if he wins his home state?

The exit polls havent asked many questions about how supporters of the other candidates view Kasich, so well assume that Kasich gets about as many votes from Rubio as Cruz does. (This makes a certain amount of sense: Rubio supporters have more in common with Kasich voters demographically but more in common with Cruz voters ideologically.) Specifically, well assume that support from former Rubio voters goes 42.5 percent to Cruz, 42.5 percent to Kasich and 15 percent to Trump. Well also assume that 80 percent of them still vote, slightly up from 75 percent because weve given them another option. Kasich also gets to keep all of his own supporters, obviously. Heres how that would shake out:

Kasich wins Vermont under this math, but thats the only state he gets. Meanwhile, the votes Kasich takes back from Cruz allow Trump to narrowly win South Carolina, Kentucky and Louisiana, when he would have lost them in a two-way race.

Overall, under uniform delegate rules, Trump wins slightly more delegates with Kasich running than without! Even though he wins fewer votes, the winner-take-all bonuses really help him. Cruz falls back behind Trump, meanwhile, while Kasich still isnt doing that well, with only 75 delegates to date.

So if Republicans want to stop Trump from being their nominee, they should encourage Kasich (along with Rubio) to drop his bid? Thats one reasonable interpretation of this data, yes. Trumps great weakness is that he loses ground as other candidates drop out. The most parsimonious strategy is just to get it to a one-on-one race.

However, I think the details make the case a bit more equivocal than that. Kasich could make a few good arguments for staying in the race:

O-H-I-O.

Southern states, Kasichs weakest region, are overrepresented so far.

Cruz is weak in the Northeast, and even if Kasich cant win those states, he might be able to prevent Trump from hitting winner-take-all thresholds in states like New York, where a candidate wins all statewide or congressional district delegates if he gets more than 50 percent of the vote.

Rubio voters probably wouldnt just split their votes 50-50; instead, they could behave tactically, going to Kasich in Connecticut (for example) but Cruz in Arizona.

Overall, I think its a close call between Cruz and Kasich having a better shot of stopping Trump as a tandem or Cruz being better off on his own. Kasich doesnt appear likely to drop out before Ohio, in any event, so what happens there will probably go a long way toward determining his plans.

Rubios chances are hanging by a thread, however. Hell presumably drop out if he loses Florida, but theres an argument that his chances are slim enough in Florida that anti-Trump Republicans would be better off if Rubio dropped out immediately, which would give Cruz and Kasich better chances to win delegates in Ohio, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina, all of which also vote Tuesday.

Either way, theres likely to be some sort of endgame after March 15. Even if Trump wins both Ohio and Florida, Cruz might run relatively well against him in a one-on-one race from that point forward. Would it be too little and too late, especially with a lot of states in Trumps northeastern base still left to vote? Possibly, but Republican party elites would finally have to make the very choice they were most hoping to avoid.",[]
