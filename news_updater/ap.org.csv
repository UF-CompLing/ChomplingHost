ap.org,,Calling on governments to create a culture of safety for journalism,[],"Here is the text of his formal remarks:

Speaking at todays gathering , Associated Press Vice President-International News John Daniszewski argued that a set of safety principles and best practices for news organizations and freelance journalists that were agreed-upon in 2014 are not enough.

We have been living through a crisis in journalism safety. In 2015, at least 71 journalists were killed worldwide for the work that they did. Scores more suffered serious injury. And too many have been arrested or censored. Global news coverage has always been fraught with danger. But as vice president of international news for The Associated Press, I have witnessed a growing impunity for crimes against the dedicated reporters, photographers and videographers who work every day to deliver the news to billions around the world. Some work for the AP and other large news organizations, but in most cases those who suffer the most are the most vulnerable practitioners: freelance and local journalists. My frustration and anger has only grown to see that in many cases it is not only armed militias and criminals carrying out crimes against journalists, but sometimes people acting on behalf of governments  governments that are pledged and obligated under international law to protect journalists along with other civilians in conflict zones. Often these same governments will state that the arrests or harassment of journalists in their country has nothing to do with their work, but that strains credulity. Whether by murder, violence, arrest or intimidation, the crimes taking place against journalists have become far too common. They have become normalized. That is part of the reason that in late 2014 an idea for an agreed set of safety principles and best announced these principles to the world in February last year, with AP, Reuters, AFP and a score of other news organizations and freelance groups among the charter signatories. By now, more than 90 news and journalism organizations around the world have signed on to these principles. But what I want to say at this forum is that it is not enough. Journalists and their supporters can work among themselves to enhance safety best practices. But unless governments, and organizations like the United Nations and UNESCO recommit themselves to the importance of a free media in a free world, all the talk among journalists will only help at the margins. What is needed is for governments to work hard in areas they control to create an environment where the role of a journalist is respected and protected, in accordance with international standard for free expression. Furthermore, we need governments to hold to account other governments who routinely deny media freedoms. The aim that we all share is to create a culture of safety for journalism. It can only occur if governmental bodies fulfill their proper role, alongside journalists and private groups, and all those who believe in the importance of a free media.





APs news leaders and CEO have been outspoken on the need to protect journalists worldwide  a cause more deeply felt at the news organization since AP photojournalist Anja Niedringhaus was shot to death in Afghanistan in 2014 and correspondent Kathy Gannon was seriously wounded.

Senior Vice President and Executive Editor Kathleen Carroll addressed the Inter American Press Association last October and she stressed before the UN Security Council in 2013 the right of journalists around the world to work without threat or peril.",[]

Kaster described how she positioned herself to capture her winning photo of Trump:

I took this image after an event in front of the Capitol. There were a lot of supporters and media trying to get close to Mr. Trump as he left. As he exited the back of the stage, he was mobbed. I could not get close to him right away, so I positioned myself in his path in front of a solid table of audio equipment near the stage, hoping the bottleneck would bring him to me. It did. The crush opened up so I could capture this moment.

Harnik recalled how he got his winning shot of Menendez:

It was a busy day on Capitol Hill and we had a number of APs photo staff spread out across the Capitol building and the Capitol Hill office buildings to cover various meetings and hearings. One of the big stories that was developing was on the indictment of Sen. Bob Menendez and I was assigned along with another photographer to track him down. I found him at the Senate subway, where reporters often wait for senators to come and go between the Capitol building and their offices. Reporters and photographers quickly swarmed around him as he attempted to board a train. I happened to be directly in front of him just as he reacted to a reporters question. I knew I had something when I took the photograph but because it was such a big story I stayed with him, boarding the train and following him back to his office. His unhappy reaction to such intense, unwanted attention definitely summed up the story visually.

ap.org,,How we count the votes for the NFL's top awards,[],"Each year on the eve of the Super Bowl, the NFL hosts its Honors awards show to recognize top players and coaches from the season. I talked with Barry Wilner, our lead NFL writer, about who decides the winners and how the players feel about the show.

Barry Wilner

Which awards are announced by The Associated Press?

- Most Valuable Player

- Coach of the Year

- Assistant Coach of the Year

- Offensive Player of the Year

- Defensive Player of the Year

- Offensive Rookie of the Year

- Defensive Rookie of the Year

- Comeback Player of the Year

Who decides the winner of each award?

AP doesnt decide  we just count the ballots. There are 50 media members from around the country who cover the NFL regularly and do all the voting. Some are writers; others are broadcasters. But theyre all picked because theyre the best in the business in covering the sport. They are totally independent of the league itself  no one works for NFL Network, for example  and have varying degrees of reporting experience.

Well-known voters include former players Troy Aikman (Fox Sports) and Cris Collinsworth (NBC Sports), as well as former coaches Tony Dungy (NBC Sports) and Herm Edwards (ESPN).

How does the voting process work?



Its pretty simple  each of the 50 voters casts a ballot for each award, and the player or coach with the most votes wins. We just began the assistant coach of the year last year, and the comeback player of the year in 1998. All the others date back to the 1950s and 60s.

Are the voters the same each year?



The majority are the same each year because they are very good at what they do. But well make changes now and again. There are a variety of reasons for why we may change a few voters  someone may drop off the NFL beat, another might retire. But in general, they are consistent.

How long has AP been involved?



Since the 1950s, but I was obviously not involved back then. I think the first year we gave out awards was 1957. There were some awards given out that predate our involvement, but the NFL didnt really recognize them.

What is your role?

I joined AP in 1976, but didnt start with the awards until the early 1990s. My job is to line up all the voters, chase down all their votes and then open them. We also select the All-Pro team, which is a little more complicated than the awards process. So Im in charge of all that, and have been for at least 25 years.

During the season, I also cover the whole league and certain games we see fit for me to go to  though I dont travel as much as I used to.

Whats your favorite part of the process?

My favorite part is probably discussing with the different voters whom they voted for and why. I like to hear their perspective and their input on the various choices they make. Its enlightening to me and it helps me with my job.

What are your favorite stadiums and cities to visit?



Cities: San Francisco (site of Super Bowl 50) and Nashville.

Stadiums: Baltimore and Charlotte.

The Associated Press also publishes weekly Pro32 rankings during the season. What are those?

The Pro32 are power rankings where we have 12 people who actually vote on the awards and the All-Pro team at the end of the year. They rank the teams 1-32 each week and send in their ballots with an explainer on some of the teams and why they rank them there. Weve been doing the power rankings for four years now.

Why are the Pro32 power rankings the most objective of all the ones out there?



Most of the power rankings during the season are done by one person at various publications. We have 12 people doing it. We dont do it for advertising; we dont do it for publicity or marketing purposes. We do it for news. And I think thats why they have more veracity than any other power rankings would have.

What are other ways fans can keep up with the NFL through AP?



We run stories almost daily on every team throughout the season, starting at the beginning of training camp. Well do previews of games during the season, as well as follow-ups after them. We have columns each week; I write two analyses every week  one on Monday and one for the weekend.

We have an NFL personality story that moves most weeks, highlighting something special about somebody involved in pro football. A lot of it focuses on off-the-field stuff. We also do capsules every week on every game  they get a lot of use. We have a notebook for the weekend that gets tremendous use. We never stop.

Finally, how do the players feel about NFL Honors?



The fact that we have NFL Honors now on the night before the Super Bowl is a great thing for our awards and its a great thing for the NFL because I think it humanizes the players a little more when they appear at this show. I think people get a look at these guys when theyre not in their armor for a game.

And I know, in fact, that the players take very seriously our All-Pro team and our awards. To them, its a true honor when they win these awards. These players will tell us that, and I guarantee youll see that at each NFL Honors through the years. Theyre absolutely honored to win these awards.

Instead of sticking with the typical long-form writethru about an event that hadnt happened yet, they also started a running story with small  but quick  updates on airport closings, comments from government officials and other newsworthy tidbits as they occurred.

Kristin Gazlay. (AP photo)

For AP members who were very interested in the story, they could catch up with the latest developments in an easy-to-read format, said Kristin Gazlay, who led the project.

Dubbed The Latest, the idea came about after she consulted market research and found that all of APs distinct customer segments prefer information that feels more immediate. Gazlay wasnt surprised, as increasing numbers of consumers look at news on their mobile devices, specifically smartphones.

Bringing customers into the conversation

As the newsroom started using The Latest for additional stories, customer feedback suggested a few tweaks to the format.

And after about two or three iterations, we hit the mark, said Ken Romano, an AP product director.

Romano explained that the days of conducting a years worth of exploration and testing before a huge product launch are over  the industry simply moves too quickly. APs new strategy, therefore, is to push bite-sized prototypes to market as quickly as possible to get them in the hands of users.

Not every project succeeds. Some require a complete reboot; others, such as The Latest, require fine-tuning. While accelerated timing is a goal, it isnt the main one.

We want to make sure were engaging our customers in developing the products together, Romano said. We still verify that everything going out is accurate and fact-based, but theres a way to experiment and bring users into the conversation, rather than just talking at them.

Theres a way to experiment and bring users into the conversation, rather than just talking at them.

An insiders perspective

The Latest delivers story developments faster and with an insiders perspective. During the November terrorist attacks in Paris, it received close to the same number of page views on AP Mobile as the traditional text story, according to Gazlay.

It confirmed to us that people want a vehicle to more easily keep up with the latest events on a big, breaking story, she said. And its also faster for us to get new developments out to consumers.

Were able to find a home for nuggets that maybe would never make their way into the main story, but help keep The Latest interesting and fresh.

The Latest works well for digital and mobile platforms because of its ability to build upon itself as events unfold, and allows broadcasters to read updates directly on-air. It does not replace any existing formats, but rather provides an additional option for customers to differentiate their coverage.

If you want to know whats happening with a big story, The Latest is where you would go, Gazlay said.

ap.org,,Paywalls are not the answer for every media organization,[],"Editors note: We spoke with Michael Sinkinson, an assistant professor of business economics and public policy at the Wharton School, about the repercussions of advertising sources moving from print to digital.

Traditionally, the deal was you could support a newspaper by selling advertising. And it was very valuable for advertisers to reach readers of newspapers. Then consumers started reading the news online. And the reality was advertisers did not see the same value in placing ads in online formats. And that problem has not yet been solved by anyone that Im aware of.

So what weve seen is, some of the very high-end publications  The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal  have been able to put up paywalls. The reality is that might not be a viable strategy for every newspaper. So its unclear how the middle of the market, the lower end of the market, is going to survive if they cant enforce the paywall on their content.

His research focuses on questions of market structure as they relate to the industries of media, technology and telecommunications.",[]
ap.org,,Enslaved fishermen freed: How we got that story,[],"Margie Mason, Robin McDowell, Esther Htusan and Martha Mendoza spent over a year investigating Thailands multi-billion dollar fishing industry, built on the backs of forced labor. Their reporting freed more than 2,000 slaves and connected slave-caught seafood to U.S. supermarkets, retailers and major pet food brands.

After months of networking, poring over documents and chasing down tips and leads, Mason learned that stories of abuse were starting to filter out from Benjina, a little-known island village in the far eastern waters of Indonesia. But because no outsiders had visited, it was impossible to know just how bad conditions were.

The journalists offered additional details to the Donald W. Reynolds National Center for Business Journalism, which presented the awards in Phoenix, about the challenges and dangers they faced in reporting the story:



In November 2014, McDowell arrived to find men locked in a cage and a company graveyard filled with dozens of fishermen buried under fake Thai names. After realizing there were hundreds of captive slaves on the island, most of them from Myanmar, she called in Burmese reporter Esther Htusan from Yangon for help.

Once the men understood the AP was there to tell their stories, they opened up. A few wiped tears as they spoke. Some chased after the journalists on dusty paths, shoving pieces of paper into their hands with the names and addresses of their parents in Myanmar.

The reporters got caught in a harrowing boat chase in choppy waters on their last night and, finally, were ordered off the island by angry company officials.

Still, the reporting team realized they needed more in order to have real impact. They were determined to trace the slave-caught fish to American dinner tables, and to name names.

We used satellites to track a huge refrigerated cargo ship filled with slave-caught fish from Benjina to Thailand. From there, we climbed into the back cab of a pickup with tinted windows because we were repeatedly warned it wasnt safe for journalists to be seen near the port run by a violent fish mafia. We stayed hidden for hours over four nights as we followed truck after truck of seafood being delivered to cold storage facilities, processing plants and the countrys largest seafood market.

After weeks of working to nail down that some of these smaller companies were selling to two major Thai exporting businesses, Mendoza started connecting the dots in the U.S.

She used U.S. Customs records to determine that tainted fish can wind up in the supply chains of some of Americas biggest stores including Wal-Mart, Kroger, Albertsons and Safeway, along with the nations largest food distributor, Sysco. It can also find its way into the supply chains of some of the most popular brands of canned pet food, including Fancy Feast, Meow Mix and Iams.

The journalists waited to publish the story until the slaves they interviewed were safe. The International Organization for Migration worked with the Indonesian government to move the men off the island.

Just over a week after our story ran, the Indonesian government made a dramatic rescue, freeing more than 300 slaves from the island. Since then, nearly two years since our reporting began, more than 2,000 men have been identified or repatriated, arrests have been made, Thai cargo vessels have been seized in two countries, businesses have cut ties with tainted suppliers, Congressional hearings have been held, lawsuits have been filed and U.S. federal legislation has been written. The impact has surpassed anything we ever could have imagined, but major problems still persist in the Thai and global seafood industries. Our investigation continues.

ap.org,,Documentaries are back,[],"I recently attended the annual Realscreen Summit with Claribel Torres, APs director of digital media and entertainment, and spoke with executives and producers looking to make an impact with audiences who have more entertainment options available to them than ever before.

Claribel and I spoke about the trends we noticed from the conference and what they could mean for the industry in the year ahead.

Claribel, based on your conversations with other attendees and the panels you watched, what were some trends that you noticed?

Claribel Torres

The No. 1 thing I noticed was that documentaries are back. Ive attended Realscreen for 13 years, and Ive seen it go through many phases. During that time, I have never heard the word documentary said as many times as I did this year.

Of course, reality series are still here, but to some viewers they arent as relevant as they were a few years ago. Im not saying reality as a genre is going away, but audiences are now much more savvy.

Theyre looking for premium content and networks are responding. One network in particular  Discovery  is revamping its approach to include content less likely to be ratings stunts (remember the man-eating anaconda that wasnt?).

It seems as if, because of the success of shows on new platforms such as Netflix and Hulu, that producers are open to hearing any kind of idea. No longer are distributors looking for content just to fill time  they want everything to be amazing because the next big hit could come from anywhere. Did you get that impression as well?

I think thats a big part of it. And I think with documentaries, theres a certain authenticity thats missing from other types of programming  you cant go back and reshoot history. When audiences see and hear original content from a major history event from their lives, they stop and think about where they were when it happened. Theres an emotional connection there.

And I think with documentaries, theres a certain authenticity thats missing from other types of programming  you cant go back and reshoot history.

Something else I heard was an emphasis on having a unique access point  networks wanted to know how producers could execute their ideas better than anyone else. How can producers do that?

Well at The Associated Press, we work with producers to bring their projects to life. We have reporters based around the world who not only produce multimedia stories, but also know their local cultures inside and out. For example, for the 30th anniversary of the Challenger disaster, we worked with Tom Jennings Productions on a documentary for the National Geographic Channel.

In addition to providing video, images, text and never-heard-before audio clips from our archives, we also secured access to the AP reporter who was at the Kennedy Space Center for liftoff in 1986. He was able to provide personal audio soundbites from the scene, as well as notes and story ideas to staff at the production company. We looked at all of these assets and determined with them which ones would best tell the story they wanted to build for Nat Geo.

So, how can a documentary stand out from the competition?

I think the perspective you take on covering a story can be a difference-maker. The National Geographic special zeroed in on the life of Christa McAuliffe, who was scheduled to be the first teacher launched into space. The way the documentary was presented  using prerecorded footage and interviews without narration  also made it stand out from other features about the tragedy.

I think the perspective you take on covering a story can be a difference-maker.

At AP, we also have easily licensable clips that can complement or help form your storylines  for example, I recently received a phone call from a producer who needed a particular clip of certain buildings in Salt Lake City, Utah.

While we didnt have an exact match of what he wanted in our archives, we were able to use our Content Services team to send a local crew to film the footage. The producer wanted a shot of the city at a certain angle at a particular time of day  we were able to do it within two hours, saving the production company from sending a remote crew in for a full day.

Documentaries are in, but what other trends did you see at the conference?

There was a lot of buzz around virtual reality, which could easily be its own discussion for another day. The mechanics of filming in virtual reality are still being worked out, and were still experimenting with it at AP.

The panelists themselves said were not even in Chapter 1 of the medium, which makes it more impressive when I put on the headset and look up, down and around and feel like Im in the story. But based on the interest weve seen, I think its fair to say virtual reality is here to stay.

ap.org,,7 ways PR pros use AP's planning tool,[],"Editors note: Join us for an informational WebEx presentation about AP Planner this Friday, March 11, at 2 p.m. Eastern.

1. Generate press release and article ideas.

Awareness days and anniversaries provide great opportunities for outreach and tying your company to various causes.

For instance, did you know today is Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day? Highlight your female employees working in STEM fields on your digital channels, or better yet, have one of them sign up to be a role model to inspire girls to find their own engineering spirit.

Planner tip: Find this event and others by creating a saved search in the Planner Search tab and select the categories Anniversaries and Awareness Days/Campaigns.

2. Develop relationships with press contacts.

Think you have amazing content (such as a blog post about your female engineers) that should be shared throughout a specific industry? Of course you do! But finding the right people to promote it outside your company can be difficult.

The good news is many events are now looking for quality content to share with their own audiences, including potential customers and influencers. With AP Planner, most entries include a press contact for you to get directly in touch with for amplifying your stories.

Planner tip: Find contacts by any topic, industry or location through the Contacts tab.

3. Turn employees into spokespeople.

Employees can make the best brand ambassadors (and not just because you hired them!). They can share their testimonials working for your company on your website or even through their own social channels, but that only reaches so many people.

One way to get your companys message in front of untapped audiences around the country is having staff participate on panels and give keynote addresses at trade conferences, where they can develop a reputation as a leader in their respective field.

Planner tip: Search for event topics that align with the strengths of your employees.

A screenshot of the home page of Planner along with the first major news event listed for today

4. Predict trending topics in the media and on social networks.

Did you know tonight marks the 200th episode of one of the most popular shows on television? In fact, the mayor of Pasadena, California, named today after this sitcom.

While you may not watch it, odds are some of your customers do. Make sure youre part of the conversation with content relevant to both the mission of your company and the major entertainment events sure to get the country buzzing.

Planner tip: Create a saved search for major events and top stories in entertainment.

5. Know what keywords your audiences are searching for.

Keep an ear to the ground and stay updated on what your customers are talking about by attending events  they dont have to be conferences, which can be expensive  and talking with attendees.

What people discuss in person often leads to what theyll be searching for online. Take advantage of what you hear by aligning your companys messaging to popular interests. (For even better results, make sure your content is optimized for search engines.)

Planner tip: Search for topics related to the audiences you would like to learn more about.

6. Manage an organizations reputation in local communities.

Every company  no matter how large or small  interacts with the communities it serves. While knowing current events on a national level is certainly important, understanding the events occurring on a local level can have deeper resonance with your audiences.

Corporate philanthropy and social responsibility are not new ideas, but many businesses dont know where to begin. Let AP Planner show you how to take the first steps.

Planner tip: Use the Daybooks tab to filter events by city and state.

ap.org,,Experimenting with live video output to meet customer demand,[],"Editors note: Following a series of significant changes to our live video operations in 2015, the coming year will see a continued focus on increased output and wider content choice. Derl McCrudden spoke to journalism.co.uk to explain in more detail:

We were the first news agency to launch a live news service for broadcasters, in 2003, covering the invasion of Iraq. In 2012, we went on to launch live video news available to digital publishers on our AP Video Hub platform. Since then, the demand for live video content has continued to grow, leading us to launch multiple live streams and an extended content choice for digital publishers last February. In September, we announced those developments were also being opened out to broadcasters.

At the time, McCrudden said: The needs of broadcasters continue to change along with the audiences they serve. Not only do they now have more television channels to fill, but many of them also have a digital offering  reaching consumers across several platforms. Live video is clearly playing a significant role in broadcasters strategies and the latest changes help strengthen their ability to retain and attract audiences across all their platforms.

In Q4 2015, we offered broadcast and digital publisher customers 2,073 live stories and events, compared with 1,605 in Q4 2014. The increase has been made possible by the technical changes made across 2015 and reflects the changing demands from customers.

journalism.co.uk reported:

The rise came as the company started making significant changes to its live video operations in 2015, to increase the volume and variety of content it offered to digital publishers and broadcasters. A new service called Live Choice was introduced, consisting of three additional live streams that covered a range of stories, including breaking news events, throughout their duration.

For example, some publishers in Europe expressed a desire for live video of slow news, or events that develop slowly over a period of time. AP has been experimenting with different types of coverage, such as footage of smog and pollution in Beijing, taken during the climate change talks held in Paris at the end of 2015. However, the main focus has still been around breaking news events, like the terror attacks in Paris and the crash of a Russian airplane over the Sinai Peninsula.

In order to provide the increased volume in live video output, we have invested in additional live newsgathering capacity as well as looked at new ways of doing things. One of those ways has been to start the rollout of an app called Iris Reporter, which has been developed by Bambuser, allowing any reporter to stream live from their smartphone into Live Choice or AP Direct.

The article reports: So far, the company has tested the app with a group of 30 employees worldwide across multiple departments, including editorial and photography as well as video, and is hoping to make it available to its entire staff over the next six to eight weeks.

ap.org,,Reporters investigation exposes abuse of migrant children,[],"During an interview on San Francisco public station KQEDs Forum, Burke described the case of Marvin Velasco, now 15 years old, whose situation AP learned about through interviews. He was able to escape from his sponsors home.

The plight of Marvin Velasco, 15, from Guatemala, is among those described in an AP investigation on the treatment of migrant children. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)

Marvin came up here in September of 2014, sort of at that tail end of the huge surge of kids coming from Central America. He had a difficult journey here; he had to go across a river when he didnt really know how to swim, sort of made his way through this frigid desert and then ultimately was picked up by border patrol agents, processed and sent to the home of a man ... he had never met, who was the father of his brother-in-law. And this man was living in this really small apartment in L.A. So, Marvin woke up there the next morning after the government had placed him with this guy and found that there were actually nine other people living in the apartment. And pretty soon the sponsor told him, You know I just dont have enough money to feed you anymore and you really need to stay in the house. You cant leave this apartment. Obviously as a young man here in this foreign country, essentially being held in a locked apartment without food, Marvin really began to despair. Ultimately he was able to escape and ended up telling some parishioners at a nearby church all of this horrible  these horrible things he had gone through. And one of the parishioners stood up and said, Well, Ill take you in, and shes now become his legal guardian. And hes living in this new immigrant family in L.A. and is actually doing quite well.

National Investigative Reporter Garance Burke

Burke described a case from July in which federal prosecutors sued sponsors in Ohio who had lured unaccompanied minors from Guatemala with the promise of education. Instead, they were forced to work on egg farms under threats of death. This case, Burke said, made headlines, but many others had not.



As part of my investigation for AP, I found other, troubling cases that hadnt made the news at all. A young woman who was forced to work over a period of several months at cantinas in Florida where women drink and dance and, in some cases, are forced to have sex with patrons. A Guatemalan teen who was forced to work in a restaurant for 12 hours a day. So these kids are here, theyre in our communities, and sometimes the conditions that theyre living in are sort of hiding in plain sight.



Burke was also interviewed Monday by Los Angeles public station KPCC. She explained that sources told her these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg.



She said:

The government was so overwhelmed by the number of children appearing at the U.S. Southwest border that they started weakening some of the child protection processes that had been in place, sometimes for years, in order to really speed these children out of government shelters and into sponsors homes.

ap.org,2016-03-03 18:32:04+00:00,The Associated Press Wins the 2016 Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting from Harvard's Shorenstein Center,[],"March 3, 2016, Cambridge, MA  The $25,000 Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting from the Shorenstein Center has been awarded to Margie Mason, Robin McDowell, Martha Mendoza and Esther Htusan of The Associated Press for their investigative report Seafood from Slaves.

Additionally, the Shorenstein Center awarded the Career Award for Excellence in Journalism to Walter Isaacson. The Goldsmith Book Prizes were awarded to Harold Holzer for Lincoln and the Power of the Press: The War for Public Opinion and to Erik Albk, Arjen van Dalen, Nael Jebril and Claes H. de Vreese for Political Journalism in Comparative Perspective.

The Associated Press uncovered extensive use of slave labor in the Thai seafood industry, which supplies major U.S. supermarkets, restaurants, and food suppliers, such as Wal-Mart, Kroger, Sysco, Nestle, Whole Foods and Red Lobster. The investigation led to the freeing of more than 2,000 enslaved fishermen from Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos, the jailing of perpetrators, congressional hearings and the proposal of new laws. The U.S. State Department used the series as part of its decision to give Thailand the lowest rating for human trafficking and has discussed the findings during diplomatic talks.

Seafood from Slaves is investigative journalism at its best, said Thomas E. Patterson, the Shorenstein Centers interim director. The story was extraordinarily difficult to uncover and its impact on peoples lives and public policy will last far into the future.

Launched in 1991, the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting honors journalism which promotes more effective and ethical conduct of government, the making of public policy, or the practice of politics by disclosing excessive secrecy, impropriety and mismanagement.

The five finalists for the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting were:

The Guardian US

Jon Swaine, Oliver Laughland, Jamiles Lartey, Ciara McCarthy and Guardian US interactive staff

The Counted

The Guardian documented the number of people killed by police in the U.S., telling the stories of who they were, and establishing the hidden trends in how they died, through a database, special reports, and multimedia. The investigations final tally for 2015 of 1,134 deaths was two and a half times greater than the last annual total recorded by the FBI. After the publication of The Counted, the FBI announced at the end of 2015 that it would overhaul its system of counting killings by police. The Department of Justice also began testing a new program for recording arrest-related deaths, drawing on Guardian data.

InsideClimate News

Exxon: The Road Not Taken

InsideClimate News reported that Exxon conducted cutting-edge climate research decades ago, and then, without revealing to shareholders and the broader public what it knew about the effects of climate change, worked to manufacture doubt about the scientific consensus that its own research had confirmed. As a result of the reporting, New Yorks attorney general has launched a probe of Exxon. Other lawmakers around the country and environmental leaders have also urged the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission to conduct investigations of Exxon.

The New York Times

Beware the Fine Print

The New York Times investigated clauses in numerous consumer and employee contracts and reported that they deprive Americans of their ability to sue, insulating companies whose business practices are deceitful or illegal. The Times revealed how a coalition of credit card companies and retailers enshrined class-action bans in contracts. They also reported that some companies require disputes be settled according to biblical principles or by company-related arbitrators. Bills have since been introduced in Congress to exempt secular disputes from religious arbitration; to prevent nursing homes from requiring arbitration in residents contracts; and to bar for-profit schools from using arbitration clauses in enrollment agreements.

Tampa Bay Times

Michael LaForgia, Cara Fitzpatrick and Lisa Gartner

Failure Factories

The Tampa Bay Times exposed how the Pinellas County School Board abandoned integration, then deprived black schools in poor neighborhoods of resources until they were awash in violence and academic failure, making Pinellas County the most concentrated site of academic failure in the state of Florida. As a result of the series, officials enacted reforms including increased funding, improved teacher training, and the converting of three of the affected schools into magnets. The Florida Department of Education opened an investigation into the districts use of federal Title I dollars to ensure that money is spent properly.

The Washington Post

The Washington Post staff

Fatal Shooting by Police

The Washington Post launched an effort to tally every fatal shooting in the U.S. by an on-duty police officer in 2015. Their database chronicled shootings in real time, using news reports and other public sources  compiling a record more extensive than that of the FBI, which spurred the agency to take action to enact better federal recordkeeping. The FBIs new approach will reflect that of the Posts, capturing shootings and other violent incidents in real time and logging many of the same details. The Posts coverage also was cited by two senators when they introduced legislation in June to force states to report officer-involved shootings to the FBI.

The judges for the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting were Karen de Sa, San Jose Mercury News; Mike Greenfield, the Greenfield Foundation; Carol Marbin Miller, Miami Herald; Bill Mitchell, affiliate faculty member, Poynter Institute for Media Studies; Michael Rezendes, The Boston Globe; and Debra Adams Simmons, current Nieman Fellow. Thomas Patterson, Shorenstein Center interim director, chaired the meeting as a non-voting member of the committee.

The Goldsmith Book Prize is awarded to the academic and trade books that best fulfill the objective of improving democratic governance through an examination of the intersection between the media, politics and public policy.

The Goldsmith Book Prize for best academic book was awarded to Erik Albk, Arjen van Dalen, Nael Jebril and Claes H. de Vreese for Political Journalism in Comparative Perspective, Cambridge University Press.

The Goldsmith Book Prize for best trade book was awarded to Harold Holzer for Lincoln and the Power of the Press: The War for Public Opinion, Simon & Schuster.

The Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism was awarded to Walter Isaacson, former chairman of CNN, former editor of TIME, president and CEO of the Aspen Institute, and author of bestselling books on Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein and Benjamin Franklin.

ap.org,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Cities Flattened by Japan Tsunami Literally Rise,['Ap Images Team'],"Photos by David Guttenfelder and Eugene Hoshiko

Where once there was only debris and destruction, and then a year later a cleared but barren landscape, now there is fresh earth.

Tons of it, covering areas where roads and building foundations once stood, as if to obliterate the past.

A steady stream of trucks is bringing soil and construction materials to towns along Japans northeast coast, destroyed by a tsunami of historic proportions on March 11, 2011. It is a massive undertaking to raise the ground level of entire neighborhoods, to better protect them from inundation, before rebuilding from scratch.

Five years after the disaster, construction work is clearly underway but far from done. Rebuilt roads stretch to the horizon between still largely vacant expanses.

Fishing is the lifeblood of many of these seaside communities, and there are signs of life as new piers and fish processing and refrigeration facilities go up. The progress seems slower in residential areas.

Five years ago, something caught my eye on the side of the road in the deserted city of Onagawa, amid the volunteers, soldiers, rescue workers and others searching and cleaning up: A Japanese flag, dingy and flapping in the wind, in the middle of the debris.

The debris is long gone, and with it, the flag. In their place, the flattened city is literally rising, as trucks arrive with more soil, leveled by bulldozers into a hoped-for foundation for the future.

See these photos on APImages.com

Below are galleries with before and after photos of locations showing the destruction after the Tsunami hit in 2011, to the progression of reconstruction by 2016.

ap.org,,Testing new ways to survey voters,[],"The experiments will build on similar online surveys GfK conducted for AP during last years midterm elections in Georgia and Illinois. Candidate estimates from the two GfK surveys were significantly more accurate than the exit poll, both among Election Day and absentee voters. In addition, the online survey in Georgia did not require an expensive telephone survey of absentee voters to supplement the exit poll.

The news industry is becoming increasingly receptive to online surveys as pollings longtime gold standard, the telephone survey, faces more and more methodological challenges. AP started using GfKs probability-based, online Knowledge Panel for its political surveys two years ago. Other media, including The New York Times, CBS News and NBC News, also have begun using online surveys in some cases. None of the organizations, however, has tried using online panels to replace any of the dozens of telephone polls needed to supplement exit polls in states with high levels of absentee voting.

The AP decided to experiment with online panels in Kentucky and Mississippi to address one potentially serious issue with traditional exit polls: the interaction between the interviewer and the voter. Right or wrong, that interaction has been blamed for the disproportionate refusal by Republican voters to participate in the exit poll. Those GOP refusals have consistently led to a systematic overstatement of the Democratic vote. But what happens if there is no interviewer-voter interaction? The Kentucky and Mississippi experiments will answer that question, as survey participants will be selected from both GfKs Knowledge Panel and other online volunteer panels. All participants will complete their questionnaires online.

A major downside to online surveys is they cannot guarantee that actual voters are being interviewed. Online participants are screened into the surveys voter pool based on their answers to a series of questions. Exit poll participants, on the other hand, are asked to fill out questionnaires as they leave their precincts after voting. Of course, telephone polls of absentee voters cant guarantee that participants are actual voters either, and they make up more than a third of the national exit poll sample. To address this issue, AP has asked the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago to explore the possibility of using GPS tracking on cellphones of online panel participants  with their permission  to verify that they have voted before asking them to participate in election surveys.

Further experiments around these and other issues are planned for next years presidential primaries and the fall general election. The APs goal is to develop innovative and more accurate ways to identify and survey voters who elect national and state leaders, both to help in calling election winners and in explaining the vote.

ap.org,,The Next Generation Beyond Exit Polls,[],"Voters are increasingly ... challenging exit polls ability to fully capture the electorates opinion on Election Day unless extensive supplemental telephone polling is also done, Washington Bureau Chief Sally Buzbee told the Nieman Lab blog, as AP today was awarded a $250,000 grant from the Knight Foundation for a research project called The Next Generation Beyond Exit Polls.

Innovation is required to ensure our work continues to be accurate and complete into the future, Buzbee added.

AP works with a consortium, the National Election Pool, made up of AP and the networks (ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox and NBC), which contracts with the well-respected Edison Media Research to conduct exit polls.

Working with APs two polling partners, GfK and the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, AP will test new methodologies and methods during a handful of elections this fall and the early 2016 presidential primaries.

The Knight Foundations website further describes APs research plans and presents our grant proposal.

One of the things we really appreciate about the Knight Foundation is that work funded by their election challenge grants must be open and transparent, Buzbee said. That pleases us.

Here are bios of the AP team leading this effort:

Sally Buzbee is a vice president of The Associated Press and has been its Washington bureau chief since 2010. Under her leadership, an AP investigative team won the Pulitzer Prize in 2012 for its probe of the New York Police Departments intelligence activities following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

David Pace is a Washington-based news editor for The Associated Press who organizes and supervises the news agencys election race calling operation. For each national election, he recruits and trains a team of about 40 of the APs top reporters, editors and managers to call winners in more than 4,000 national and state races.

ap.org,,"A ""digital transformation"" in Latin America",[],"Editors note: I recently caught up with Brian Hopman, our general manager of Latin America and Spanish media markets, and asked him a few questions about the region and how were responding to any trends his team is seeing. His responses are also available in Spanish and Portuguese.

What trends are developing in the Latin American market?

A strong U.S. dollar, combined with economic weakness around the region, has made the environment more challenging for us and for our customers. However, with that said, our commitment to Latin America as a market remains firm and our outlook remains optimistic. The transition to digital has increased in pace while the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro will hold the worlds attention in August.

Production costs have also lowered, hopefully providing an incentive for those who havent gotten into video to take another look at it. We hope media companies continue to innovate and keep their audiences engaged, because those that do will more likely prosper in the long term. We hope they keep trying new things, even if they have to do that at the expense of something else they considered essential.

Where is the Latin American market in terms of digital adoption?

Use of digital devices and media continues to grow at an explosive pace. Just like in the U.S., the digital transformation has brought everyone onto the same playing field  broadcasters need more text and photos than they did a handful of years ago, while newspapers need more video than ever before. Weve been able to assist both groups in this shift by offering multimedia content  found only on AP  relevant to their local audiences from our staff located around the world.

We also offer verified, viral content that we source from outside AP, such as user-generated content, to further broaden our content options and help our customers experiment to see what works best for them and their audiences.

Youve also previously mentioned growth in pay TV in Latin America. Can you provide an update on how its doing?

Were still seeing increasing numbers of pay-TV subscribers, which translates to additional revenue for many of our customers. Its also led through the years to launches of new channels, such as 24-hour news networks, which we think is healthy for the marketplace. Each channel requires content to inform and entertain audiences, and weve worked to provide options that best apply to each genre and format.

Notably, weve increased our investment in live video by recently adding three content channels offering scheduled global and regional events in addition to breaking news. We know that media audiences expect to see coverage whether theyre watching TV or online, and weve received positive feedback from customers about these additions.

How has AP prepared for the upcoming Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro?

Our Global Media Services team has been working with NewSource Globo, part of Brazils leading media group, to secure access to broadcasting services, live stand-up positions and studio facilities in high-profile locations across Brazil, such as Copacabana beach. Having access to top-notch infrastructure and unique positions will be critical once everyone descends upon Rio in August.

In addition to live video resources, weve also signed an agreement with NewSource Globo to distribute videos from its collection through our archives. This will help media outlets not only in Latin America, but around the world, prepare stories and interviews before and during the games.

Having access to top-notch infrastructure and unique positions will be critical once everyone descends upon Rio in August.

Other than Rio, what are APs goals in the next 12 months?



Were excited to be rolling out emerging, third-party platforms such as NewsWhip, SAM and Bambuser that weve joined with to go beyond content and toward other solutions that help folks in their newsrooms. So thats something were really excited about in the first part of the year.

Another thing were prioritizing is the U.S. elections and the role AP plays in covering them. Our coverage includes some pretty cool stuff, including customizable maps and results feeds, which were increasingly localizing for the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking markets, and which can serve audiences in different ways.

We continue to look for ways of connecting the events from the U.S. to Latin America, because as compelling and entertaining as the race has been up to this point, the world is still following along.

ap.org,,Stepping back from the horse race,[],"Another recent survey found more than 6 in 10 respondents expressed only slight confidence  or none at all  that the federal government can make progress on the problems facing the nation in 2016.

A poll released this week found that reducing income inequality, a message championed by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, resonates deeply with Democrats. More than three-quarters of them said narrowing the gap between rich and poor is very or extremely important for the next president to address.

Many of the surveys breakdowns reflect the debate among Republican presidential hopefuls. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz characterize the Obama administration as an irresponsible manager of taxpayer resources thats unable to ensure national security and protect U.S. interests amid international threats and strife.

AP Washington Bureau Chief Sally Buzbee said: Our goal with AP-NORC surveys in a presidential election year is to dive deeply into the issues that Americans care about  the issues that drive their votes, their attitudes, their feelings  rather than just the horse race of whom they plan to vote for at any given moment in time. We feel thats ultimately much richer, more illuminating and more compelling to our readers and viewers.

The horse race will change all the way up until the moment voters cast their ballots, U.S. Political Editor David Scott said. What were after is how voters get to that moment. We want to know what Americans value and how that shapes the choices they make about the countrys leadership.

AP-NORC Center Director Trevor Tompson said: One mission of the center is to use polling to really give a voice to Americans in the political process. Our work focuses on the most important issues that are facing the nation and the world. It asks what issues people want their government and their leaders to focus on, and what should be done to address those problems.

Tompson added: So while we are not really changing our strategy for the election, it is especially important in an election year for us to do this work to help inform candidates, policy makers, journalists and the public about what issues the people want addressed in the campaign, and what the people think about the key issues that are facing the country.

ap.org,,New film brings sense of movement to virtual reality,[],"At the beginning of our new virtual reality experience, The Second Line, viewers find themselves strolling through a New Orleans neighborhood accompanied by the soulful tunes of a trumpet.

Filming that opening scene, though, required a technical feat seldom seen so far in VRs nascent existence.

Up until now, 360-degree video cameras have needed to be stationary while recording. Such was the case in our first film, Seeking Home, which worked around the lack of movement by relying on scene transitions.

In The Second Line, the camera sits atop a custom-built rig and dolly operated by remote control, creating a better, more natural experience for viewers. No longer tied to a specific location, viewers have additional flexibility in the way they can consume the story.

This is an entirely new approach to VR filmmaking, where the camera can roam freely up to a speed of 50 mph with full stabilization control, said Nikolay Malukhin, the founder and CEO of Spherica, which developed the technology. Its a game-changer.

Producing a stable cinematic experience is critical for virtual reality because of the ease with which viewers can get motion sickness. But the freedom of camera movement itself also carries important ramifications.

For storytelling, we now have the ability to film in potentially unsafe environments ranging from construction sites to natural disasters to war zones. Like drones, this technology enhances journalists ability to provide in-depth coverage from around the world.

At AP, we continually ask ourselves how we can tell stories in new ways while adhering to best practices.

Its just the latest tool for reporters, who have long experimented with innovative ways of sharing news with the general public. At AP, we continually ask ourselves how we can tell stories in new ways while adhering to best practices.

With emerging technologies such as virtual reality, the answers arent always clear. Thats why weve worked our way into the medium cautiously, starting with The suite life, which involved stitching together still images from a 3-D camera from Matterport.

We then worked with RYOT to produce Seeking Home before bringing in Spherica to help with The Second Line. Collaborating with companies at the forefront of virtual reality helps us better understand how its evolving and better create industry-leading content for our customers.

With the medium still in such early phases, we dont yet have much in the way of off-the-shelf tools and techniques that we can use in our stories, said Nathan Griffiths, APs interactive editor. Thats whats so exciting about it.

As we experiment with new tools and different techniques, were beginning to establish the vocabulary of virtual reality.



In addition to this post, viewers can find The Second Line on APs new virtual reality and 360-degree video channel powered by AMD, which features all of our stories in these formats. After going to places as diverse as the red carpet and a massive package-sorting facility, we cant wait to see where were going next!

AP has a rich history over the past 170 years of bringing audiences closer to the news, said Paul Cheung, our director of interactive news. Virtual reality is one of the most immersive new approaches to storytelling, so its a natural fit with what were trying to accomplish.

A challenge with filming in virtual reality is that producers need to be out of the shot.

ap.org,,"When vulgarity becomes part of the story, what's a news agency to do?",[],"When it comes to obscenities and the increasingly vulgar language in the U.S. presidential campaign, AP keeps a few things in mind.

First, we have our own standards: We use vulgar and obscene quotations only when we feel theyre essential to telling a story.

Second, the stories, audio and video we post often go automatically to our subscribers websites and mobile apps. Our subscribers have standards, too. They vary somewhat, but most tell us to avoid gratuitous vulgarity, carrying only whats really important.

Whats important, of course, is open to interpretation. Our first reaction to Trump saying pussy was that the specific word he used wasnt essential to convey. So we wrote: When an audience member shouted out an insult directed at Cruz  a vulgar term for coward  Trump repeated the term and jokingly reprimanded the woman.

My own feeling was that it would have been OK to use the word. A couple of weeks later, we used the actual word in a story about Trumps speaking and tweeting style.

As for batshit, you could argue it was hardly necessary to quote that one word in Grahams lengthy diatribe against Trump and the Republicans. But when a key senator and former presidential candidate becomes so worked up that he uses such vocabulary, thats news in itself. We decided to use the word in our text services for newspapers and online.

(On our wire for broadcast stations, mindful of the FCC regulations that many stations operate under, we toned it down: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham says his party has gone absolutely crazy  using an even more colorful term for emphasis.)

Our point here isnt that pussy or batshit was absolutely right or wrong to use. Opinions will vary, including among AP staffers. The most important thing is for us to discuss how important such language is to a story, before the story goes out. We also need to be in constant touch with our subscribers so were aware how their standards are evolving.",[]
ap.org,,Storytelling with a global audience in mind,[],"Editors note: We spoke with The Associated Press vice president for U.S. news, Brian Carovillano, about the importance of understanding audiences from around the world when assigning and editing stories from the States.

Here is how he responded:

Our customers and the relationships that we have in Asia, one of the most valuable things to them is APs footprint and our presence in the United States. So now that Im the managing editor for U.S. news, its very important for me to understand that the audience for the content that we produce in the States doesnt end at the borders of the U.S.

Theres just as much interest in Japan or South Korea or Australia. It causes us to think about how we cover the United States, to think about an audience thats way beyond where the news is happening. You would write a story differently, you would select your images differently  youre thinking about a global audience for your story.

So how we present that story to an international audience might be different from how we present that story for a domestic audience.
