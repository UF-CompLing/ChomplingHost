Microsofts new ad campaign poses one simple question: Can you name any female inventors?

The young science-loving girls featured in the spot can rattle off a list of male inventors like Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison, but are completely stumped when asked to name a single female creator. In school it was always a male inventor, I just realized, said one girl. The ad points out that not everything in this world was man-made and proceeds to list some of the many, many female inventors who often go unrecognized for their contributions to the science and tech world. Women like Mary Anderson, who invented windshield wipers; Ada Lovelace, who wrote the first-ever computer algorithm; and Gertrude Belle Elion, who created important drugs that battle HIV, malaria and leukemia.

The ad, pegged to International Womens Day, encourages the next generation of young women to get out there and invent and #makewhatsnext.",[]

time.com,2016-03-09 14:51:31,How the Death of CDs Is Changing How We Listen to Music,['Victor Luckerson'],"



Kanye West has, at various times in his career, attacked the prison-industrial complex, Wiz Khalifa, homophobia in hip-hop, water bottles on airplanes and late night televisions Jimmy Kimmel.

Next up on his wide-ranging hit list: compact discs.

I was thinking about not making CDs ever again... Only streaming, West tweeted March 7. No more CDs from me. The outspoken rapper said that his 2013 album Yeezus, which was released in a clear jewel case with no album artwork, was an open casket for the dying music format.

Make no mistake: Kanye is going to release more albums. Hes already hyping another project slated for this summer. And other artists will continue to release compact discs for years to come. Americans bought 125 million CDs last year, after all.



But the albums role as the structural spine of the industry is over. This shift is fundamentally changing how music is created, distributed and interpreted.

Popular music has been beholden to technology for decades. The seven-inch vinyl records known as 45s could only hold about 4.5 minutes of music on either side, so artists like Elvis focused on short, individual songs that could stand on their own. That changed in the 1960s, when acts like The Beatles and The Beach Boys helped make the LPa 12-inch vinyl record that plays around 44 minutes of musicthe primary mode of recorded musical expression.

The advent of CDs brought yet another change. Record labels tried to justify CDs higher prices by filling up as much of their available 74 minutes as possible. The extra bloat was in turn upended by the rise of MP3s, which let listeners easily buy (or steal) single songs from the comfort of their computer. In the words of Sum 41, customers were freed up to get all killer, no filler.

Through all these changes, the one constant was the nature of the monetary relationship between fan and artist. Until recently, listeners paid a certain amount of money for a certain amount of music and owned it forever. But streaming services like Spotify have changed all that. Now listeners pay for access, forking over $10 a month to effectively rent millions of songs. (Or they pay with their attention by watching or listening to ads.)

The result is that fans can now choose to utterly disregard the album as a single, creative work. YouTube, the most popular source of online music, places little emphasis on albums. On Spotify, a majority of songs are accessed by playlists  the companys app didnt even offer an easy way to save albums for later listening until 2014. The main pitch of Apple Music is curated playlists that pluck from a variety of different works.

The song is the unit, says Catherine Moore, a music business professor at New York University. The whole concept of the album as an umbrella under which several songs fit doesnt really matter anymore.

Kanyes latest release, The Life of Pablo, feels like its purposefully playing with listeners fast-shifting expectations. Kanye erratically live-tweeted the final days of the albums development, which included multiple title changes, complete rearrangements of the tracklist and memes galore. He has said the album, currently an exclusive on streaming service Tidal, will never go on sale. A single cryptic tweet promising to fix one of the albums songs led fans to assume a remixed version of the album will arrivefor purchase?in the future.

Combined, these factors have led many facts to view the Tidal-released album as a kind of beta version. The Internet is home to plenty of fan-made reorderings of the tracklist that include alternate takes on the Pablo songs or leaked, unofficial music from the albums recording sessions. And why not? Pablos existence is entirely abstract. The version floating in Tidals cloud could change or disappear at any moment, according to Kanyes whims. (Hundreds of thousands of pirates will be able to hold onto the album forever, though.)

Other big artists are also finding success outside the traditional album release structure. Canadian rapper Drake released two feature-length mixtapes last year. But his biggest recent release was the music video for Hotline Bling, a song that originated on SoundCloud and hasnt yet found its way to an album. Beyonce, the reigning queen of surprise releases, dropped a politically-charged song and video the day before the Super Bowl. But theyve been used to promote her upcoming tour, not an LP.

Instead of album sales, these artists are vying for your attention. They want to be top of mind when listeners are deciding who to place in their Spotify playlists or which tours they want to attend this year. Releasing an album is no longer the only way  or even the best way  to do that.

What can [artists] put in front of fans that theyre going to want to keep? Moore asks. Keep can mean play repeatedly and send to your friends. It doesnt mean keep in the sense of having something physical.

Artists may not have much of a choice but to adapt. CD sales continued a decade-plus decline in 2015, falling more than 10%, according to Nielsen. Digital album sales, a short-term bright spot for the industry, fell about 3% in a decline thats likely to continue. At the same time, the number of streams across platforms such as Spotify, YouTube and Google Play doubled during 2015. (Thats without counting Apple Music, which is now the second-most-popular subscription streaming service.)

These streams pay a pittance compared to albums. A mainstream artist can earn between $2 and about $3.40 for a CD sale depending on the terms of his or her contract, according to The Root. Spotify pays rights holders between $0.006 to $0.0084 per stream, with only a portion going to the artist. YouTube offers even less. Its no surprise to see artists focusing on efforts that can help them stay consistently relevant instead of popping up every two to three years with a set of 15 carefully manicured songs.

Expect to see more experimentation as album sales continue to decline. Artists may officially release the B-sides from a prestigious album right after the fact, instead of waiting for a tenth-anniversary remaster, as Kendrick Lamar just did with the release of his untitled unmastered EP. Instead of releasing an album all at once, a band might release songs slowly over the course of a year, like the indie band White Violet is doing right now. Major artistic statements arent going to disappear from music, but in the world of streaming, theyll look very different.

The money will come, says Moore, but not in a predictable way.",[]

The issue is at the heart of the dispute in Oregon

A group of armed men in Oregon seized an empty federal building over the weekend in protest of Dwight and Steven Hammonds prison sentences for arson on federal land, drawing new focus to the millions of acres of land the U.S. government owns across the country.

Tensions have long simmered over the fact that the federal government owns 28% of all U.S. landespecially in the West, where federal agencies often own far more than that. The federal building occupied by militia members in Oregon sits in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, which represents just a small fraction of the 53% of Oregon land owned by the government, including vast national forests. And that pales in comparison to Nevada, where Uncle Sam claims 85% of land. (Sons of Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher who clashed with the federal government over grazing rights, are helping to lead the new Oregon protest.)

All 10 states where the government owns the most land, shown in the list below, fall in the West. Many treaties required states to surrender any claim to federal lands within their border as a prerequisite for admission to the Union, according to a 2014 Congressional Research Service report. Competing and conflicting use of the land remains an issue in places where the federal government is a large landholder, the report found.

Interracial couples have become increasingly common in the past decade

NBC recently debuted a Friday-night sitcom, Truth Be Told, that features an interracial couple and promises that no topic is off-limits. While the reception was generally cold, some critics were at least sympathetic to the attempt to feature the changing face of American marriages.

If TV shows want to stay abreast of the times, however, theyre going to have to start including a lot more interracial couples, even if the plot lines dont read like college diversity seminars. Mixed-race marriages are growing at rapid rates, according to a TIME analysis of Census data. The above interactive chart shows marriage rates for any combination of race or ethnicity and gender of each spouse.

While the number of white men wedding white women has dropped almost 7 percent since 2000, marriages between white men and non-white womeneither Hispanic, Black, Asian, American Indian, or Multiracialis up 36 percent. (The reverseWhite women and non-White menis up 33 percent.)

In some cases, the disparity between genders is more pronounced. In 2013, there were over 130,000 marriages between White men and Black women, while there were nearly 320,000 marriages between White women and Black men. Both combinations are trending heavily upward.

time.com,,How Valuable Is Your Primary Vote?,[],"How Valuable Is Your Primary Vote?

Use this calculator to find out how much your vote influences the outcome of your party's presidential primary.

Its a quadrennial complaint across 48 states: Why do Iowa and New Hampshire seem to play such an oversized role in picking the next president? The process for selecting presidential nominees is not remotely democratic. First, not everyone votes at once, making earlier votes more consequential in narrowing the field. Second, while some states invite tens of thousands of people to weigh in on the allegiance of a few delegates, others hold Byzantine caucuses in which a few thousand people determine a swath of representatives to the convention.

Which got us wondering: Is there a way to figure out how influential any particular votestretching from Maine to Californiais in the primary process? Candidates are nominated at the conventions this summer not based on the share of the vote theyve won but on the number of delegates allotted to them through voting. We devised a simple formula to measure the impact of each states ballot. Try it out below.

The reasoning behind the ranking is simple. First, we estimate the ratio of pledged delegates to voters using historical turnout data from a variety of sources. (Many states also send unpledged delegates to the convention, but these delegates are not bound by the voters wishes.) States with higher delegate-to-voter ratios are considered more influential, since any one voter has a bigger impact on the outcome. Turnout is estimated by the higher turnout figure of the last two contested primaries in each party: 2008 or 2012 for Republicans and 2004 or 2008 for Democrats.

Since the calendar is staggered, we also consider when in the process a state votes. Those that hold primaries or caucuses late in the process are less likely to be influential since theres a greater chance that the race will already be decided. This factor is determined by looking at the percentage of delegates that remain to be allocated on the day a given state votes.

time.com,,See the Entire History of the Oscars Diversity Problem in One Chart,[],"See the Entire History of the Oscars Diversity Problem in One Chart

Last weeks Oscar nominations have sparked outrage for their lack of diversity with zero non-white nominees in the acting categories for the second year in a row. An analysis of the full 92-year history of the Academy Awards shows that Hollywoods highest honors have lagged the population on issues of race and representation.

In all, as the graphic below shows, 6.4% of acting nominations of the total 1,668 since the awards began in 1929 have gone to non-white actors. Isolating for the past 25 years, only 56 actors11.2% of the totalwere non-white.

This years lack of diversity has led Oscar-nominated director Spike Lee and actress Jada Pinkett Smith to promise to boycott the ceremony. On Monday, the president of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, issued a statement declaring that the effects of recent efforts to diversify the Academys ranks are not coming as fast as we would like. She added that the organization will soon conduct a review of its recruitment practices to ensure much-needed diversity in our 2016 class and beyond.

In the Oscars first several decades, the nomination of even one non-white actor was an exception to the rule, few and far between. In some ways, this tracks with the homogeneity of the country that produced these films. Between 1940 and 1950, according to the U.S. Census, America remained 89 percent white. (During that period, there were 3 non-white nominees out of 200 chosen, or 1.5%.) In past 25 years, the number of non-white actors earning nominations has steadily increasedpeaking at 7 in 2006. Since 2010, 7.5% of acting nominees have been non-white.

The dominant reaction to this years crop of Oscar nominees, announced on Jan. 14, has been dismay at the groups homogeneity coming during a year that saw a number of worthy performances from actors of color, including Will Smith in Concussion, Idris Elba in Beasts of No Nation, Michael B. Jordan and Tessa Thompson in Creed, Teyonah Parris in Chi-Raq, Samuel L. Jackson in The Hateful Eight and Benicio Del Toro in Sicario. Their names did not receive enough of the Academys votes to make the cut. Not since 1979-1980 has the Academy gone two years without nominating a non-white actor in any of the top 4 categories.

As of 2012, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences was, according to a Los Angeles Times study, 94% white. Many attribute the paucity of nominations for non-white actors to this lack of diversity. Others point to a film industry in which people of color have historically had less access to financing, fewer opportunities to direct and a continuous need to contend with studios fearssometimes explicitthat movies with non-white leading actors wont make enough money.

Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders arrive in Miami on Wednesday for the last Democratic debate in March, one day after splitting victories and delegates in Mississippi and Michigan.

Wednesday nights debate will likely be intense: with Sanders showing new signs of life, Clinton will hope to quickly dispatch him. But as she looks ahead to a general election, shell need to make sure she doesnt alienate Sanders supporters either. Sanders, meanwhile, will drive home his message against political corruption and income inequality with the ferocity of an insurgent who may not have a national platform for much longer.

While Sanders staged a morale-boosting upset in Michigan, Clintons lopsided victory in Mississippi won her most of the delegates up for grabs on Tuesday. She is well on her way toward the nomination with a large lead in pledged delegates.



Sunday nights debate in Flint, as most of the contests, appeared to end in a wash. But even with Sanders hewing close to his core platform and Clinton again demonstrating her nimble grasp of policy, the tone was feistier and more urgent than in previous debates.

Sanders was sometimes dismissive of Clinton on Sunday night, adopting a pitch that some critics said was patronizing of the former Secretary of State. His hyperactively wagging finger and bass protestationsExcuse me, Im talking, he said to Clinton on Sundaywere supposed to turn off Michigan voters.

But Sanders still beat expectations by winning Michigan, with some speculating that Clintons attacks against Sanders and claims that he opposed the auto bailout backfired.

On Wednesday, Clinton will likely talk about her economic plans to create manufacturing jobs and paint Sanders as a backward-looking candidate, as she did on Sundays debate. You know, if were going to argue about the 1990s instead of talking about the future Clinton said several times.

Clintons aides say she has the advantage in looking ahead and explaining drawn-out policy proposals. I think Senator Sanders has continued to look backwards and talk about the past in terms of economic policy, said Robby Mook, Clintons campaign manager. What voters are looking is for candidates to look forward to the future.

Clinton heads into contests after the debate that should be favorable to her, including Florida, Illinois and North Carolina, while Sanders sees opportunities in states like Ohio and Washington.",[]

Here's how roles are opening up for women

The Army permanently opened Ranger School to all women this month, just weeks after two female soldiers graduated from the school for the first time. That decision is part of a series of efforts that will expand where and how women serve in the U.S. armed forces.

On Jan. 1, 2016, with the repeal of a 1994 rule that excluded women from direct combat assignments, all positions in the U.S. military will be open to women unless the services can convince Defense Secretary Ashton Carter that some should remain closed. Currently, women account for 15.3% of active-duty personnel in the U.S. military. The Marines have the lowest percentage of women, at 7.6%. Twenty of 336 Marine jobs are closed to women. The Air Force and Navy have the highest percentage of women serving: 17.8% for the Navy, and 18.7% for the Air Force.

According to a report by Women In International Security, 255,000 additional positions will open to female service members in 2016.

Women have been involved in the U.S. military since the Revolutionary War, but were only made a permanent fixture with the Womens Armed Service Integration Act of 1948, which prohibited women from combat positions.

A growing demand for equality combined with reduced male enlistments led the Department of Defense to steadily ease bans on how closely women could get to the front lines. And as the lines between combat and noncombat roles became increasingly blurred in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the 1994 rule barring women from direct ground combat has become increasingly contested.

In 2003, enemy forces in Iraq captured three Army women assigned to a noncombat unit providing logistic support to ground unitshighlighting the threat to women, often without the recognition or promotion that comes with combat positions. As of April 2015, 161 women had lost their lives and 1,1015 were wounded since President George W. Bush declared the Global War on Terror on Sept. 20, 2011.

The military services have until next month to explain to Carter why women should continue to be barred from any military assignments beginning next year.",[]

Online food delivery company GrubHub, which now serves more than 20 million meals each quarter, analyzed delivery orders sent to more than 100 colleges in 47 states during the 2014-2015 academic year to see which students are making healthy choices at meal time. (The company used e-mail addresses ending in .edu to determine which orders came from people associated with college and universities.)

The University of Buffalo, home to 30,000, students, leads the competition when it comes to making healthy choices when students log online for food delivery. To determine the most health conscious schools, GrubHub analyze deliveries, looking for the highest percentage of orders at schools that contained any of 31 options which suggested students had made healthy food choices, like substituting a salad for another side dish or telling restaurants to go light on dressing.

What schools are most often ordering vegetables? The University of North Carolina tops the list, according to GrubHubs analysis, followed by University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University, Harvard University and the University of Virginia.

Take this interactive quiz to find out

President Barack Obama is now revisiting an issue that marked the very beginning of his presidency: Equal pay for men and women. On Jan. 29, seven years to the day after Obama signed into effect the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, he acknowledged that the wage gap still persists to an alarming degreeand introduced several new measures to help address the problem.

One of these efforts is a proposal to increase the amount of data the federal government receives about employee pay. But a great deal of this information already exists in detailed data collected by the Census in their annual American Community Survey. According to a new analysis by TIME and Motto, women earn less than men at every age range, from 15% less between ages 22 and 25 to a staggering 38% less between ages 51 and 64.

We analyzed the wages earned by more than 15 million Americans surveyed by the Census Bureau between 2008 and 2012, who were classified into 460 different occupational categories. We found that 372 of those occupations contained enough information to determine that there was a statistically significant gender pay gap in at least one of the seven age ranges we examined.

In all, we found 1,490 combinations of age and occupation in which there existed a statistically significant difference in how much men and women make. Only 22 of those 1,490 involved women making more money than men. All 22 situations where women out-earned men occurred among the youngest cohorts in an occupation. (The gaps are statistically significant to at least a 90% level of confidence, the same threshold the Census uses).

There was not a single occupation where women age 30 and above took home significantly higher average salaries than their male colleagues, even if they start out making as much or more.

Looking at the earning patterns for secondary-school teachers helps tell this story. From ages 22-25, women actually earn 10% more than their male colleagues. By the time those teachers turn 30, there is no statistical difference between them and their male peers. By 35, the men make more. Its a pattern we see repeated with librarians, social workers, secretaries and preschool teachers. Notably, these are all female-dominated professions. In male-dominated professions like engineering and finance, women typically make less from the very start.

Some occupations stand out as particularly egregious in our research. For example, the tax-preparation industry, where we had a sample of over 5,000 people, has one of the worst records of pay disparity of any job in the country. From ages 26-30, female tax preparers, on average, earn around half as much as their male counterparts. It gets worse from there. Among those between 41-50, women in the tax-preparation business bring home only a third as much as their male colleagues.

One explanation for pay disparity is that many occupations offer higher- and lower-paying tracks. We could hypothesize, for instance, that more female lawyers choose public service and more male lawyers choose high-paying firms, perhaps explaining why male lawyers in their 40s earn 51% more than their female counterparts. But the sheer breadth of occupations in which men make more than women suggests something other than self-selection into tracks. For instance, male dishwashers in their 50s are paid 20% more than female dishwashers. Male janitors in their 40s are paid 63% more.

Joining a profession where women make up the majority of workers may not give women a pay advantage eitheror even parity. There is research to show that in female-dominated professions, men get promoted more quickly than women do in their field, an effect that has been termed the glass escalator. Male and female registered nurses, our research shows, make roughly the same pay in the youngest cohorts, only to have a significant wage gap open up in their 30s and beyond.

The survey does confirm that there are more men than women in certain high-paying professions (financial analysts, dentists) and more women in certain low-paying professions (teaching assistants, telemarketers). But within all of those professions, men still make significantly more. Having more women in higher-paying professions, in other words, would not eliminate the overall gap.

Some point to the fact that women remain primary caregivers in many families as the cause for their wages lagging behind those of men. A woman might leave the work force to raise a child and when she returns enter at a lower wage and never catch up. While this may happen in some places, childcare alone cannot account for the vast inequality we measured across almost every profession and age group.

The calculations in our analysis exclude anyone who did not earn an income, but do include part-time workers. While men who work part-time still tend to earn more than women who work part-time, there are some occupations and age cohorts where female part-timers outnumber male part-timers. This could explain some of the gap in those groups, but it cannot explain it all. Researchers found that among full-time workers only there is still an intractable gap, even after controlling for things like occupational segregation and employment gaps due to maternity and childcare.

Alarmingly, the discrimination happens not just during promotion season but when a job candidate first shows up at a company. In a variety of professions, male-dominated or female-dominated, experiments have shown that employers are biased toward male job candidates. In a 2012 double-blind study, science faculty at research universities were asked to rate identical resumes for a lab tech position, one with a male name and one with a female name. When the name on the resume was John, faculty suggested a higher starting salary than when the name on the resume was Jennifer.

A school district in Newark, N.J. is shutting off its water fountains after testing found lead in building drinking water, according to state health officials.

Drinking water at 30 schools in Newark tested positive for levels of lead higher than the federal standard, according to a joint announcement from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the Newark Public Schools. The Environmental Protection Agencys action level for lead, the threshold requiring additional action, is 15 parts per billion and drinking water in Newarks schools ranged from 16-558 ppb.

Of the some 300 water samples taken from the Newark school buildings, 59 were above the EPAs action levels for testing and no building had more than four samples above the action level. The water in Newarks schools is nowhere near some of the high levels of lead in Flint, Michiganone home there tested as high as 13,200 ppb.

time.com,,Hollywoods Glaring Gender Gap,[],"Hollywoods Glaring Gender Gap

How much harder is it to make in Hollywood as a woman? While male actors see their careers peak at the age of 46, female actors reach their professional pinnacles at age 30, according to a TIME analysis of the careers of over 6,000 actors and actresses. And things arent getting better in the film industry: Women today who are under the age of 60 are seeing the number of roles they are cast in decline faster than their older peers once did. At the same time, younger men are seeing their careers peak even later than their older peers.

The plight of sexism in Hollywood recently reached the forefront when it was revealed that 51-year-old Sandra Bullock is playing the lead in Our Brand is Crisis, a role originally intended for George Clooney. And as Vulture noted recently, Hollywood is fond of pairing young actresses like Emma Stone with considerably older male leads.

The problem is not a new phenomenon in the workplace, where men reach their peak earning potential much later than women. Hollywood is not only guilty of this same sexism, but displays an even greater disparity than most industries.

Methodology

To collect a sample of actors and actresses, we compiled the top five leading actors and actresses from the top 5,000 grossing movies in the Internet Movie Database, which stretches back to the 19th century . (While some movies choose to list the cast alphabetically, our spot checks suggest IMDB is good about listing the most prominent roles first in the cast list.) The gender of each actor was imputed from the pronouns in his or her mini-biography, a method that appears to have very high accuracy.

After parsing out those with incomplete information on their pages, we were left with a list of 6,000 actors and actresses who have appeared in a lead role in at least one major movie. For each of those individuals, we then looked at every movie he or she has appeared in and his or her age at the time. The graphs above show a moving total of roles over a five year period. For example, the value at age 40 represents the total roles a person received between ages 38 and 42 while the value at age 45 represents the total roles a person received between ages 43 and 47.",[]

Over the past 115 years, the global Catholic population has more than quadrupled, from 266 million in 1900 to 1.2 billion in 2015, according to the World Christian Database. This growth mirrors the worlds soaring population in the same period, with Catholics hovering around 17% of the total population throughout. Despite unchanged global representation, Catholic geographic distribution has altered dramatically, with massive growth sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia and waning numbers in Europe.

As of 2015, Europe had 267 million total Catholics, second only to South Americahome to the most populous Catholic country, Brazilwith 335 million faithful. But Europe is the only continent that will see a shrinking Catholic population in the coming years, according to projections by the World Christian Database. By 2030, Catholics in North America and Africa will soar past European estimates. African Catholics will even pass their peers in South America, with 450 million followers by 2050.

Declining numbers in Europe largely reflect low birth rates. Take Spain for example, where 1.43 children are born per woman in 2014, compared with 4.8 children per woman in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Growth in Southeast Asia follows a similar trend, like in the Philippines where 3 woman are born on average to each women.

In the United States, about a quarter of the population has remained Catholic for several decades, shows a 2013 Pew Research Center report. In 2015, 73.6 million U.S. Catholics made up 6% of those faithful to Francis worldwide.",[]

See when it actually feels like autumn where you live

Autumn may officially begin on September 22 or 23 each year, but it often feels like the weather takes a few weeks to get the memo.

Here at TIME Labs, we were curious when it begins to actually feel like fall around the country. To do so, we looked at 21 years of data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, defining autumn as the first five consecutive days in which the high was lower than 70 percent of a regions yearly range in temperatures. (For example, a place with yearly lows of 10 and yearly highs of 90 would have a fall line of 66 degrees, which is 70 percent of the distance between those extremes.) Enter your city or county below to see when you can expect cooler weather in your neighborhood.

This sort of analysis is more Farmers Almanac than fine meteorology, but in most cases summer does overstay its welcome for at least a few days. In playing around with our own interactive, we found many instances of fake outs in which there would be a few fall-like days in August or early September followed by a resurgence of sweltering weather.

Methodology

Weather data can be as finicky as the weather itself as measuring stations go on and offline. For this interactive, we looked at the five closest weather stations to the center of a city or county, limiting the search to stations that have been active since 1995. We then averaged the high temperature for each of those stations for each day from Jan. 1, 1995 to the present. In limited cases in rural areas, there were not five stations within a 50-miles radius.",[]

One of the most frustrating aspects of data journalism is that, even when data is publicly available and easy to download, it is often in a format thats nearly impossible to work with.

(WASHINGTON)  Volkswagens top U.S. executive is stepping down amid the companys ongoing emissions cheating scandal, the company announced Wednesday.

U.S. President and CEO Michael Horn is leaving to pursue other opportunities effective immediately, the automaker said in a statement. He had been with the German auto maker for 25 years, assuming his most recent post in 2014.

Horns sudden departure comes as the company continues to grapple with the fallout from its admission last year that nearly 600,000 cars were sold in the U.S. with software that regulators say was designed to cheat on required emissions tests.

The company potentially faces more than $20 billion in fines from state and federal regulators, as well as hundreds of class-action lawsuits filed on behalf of angry vehicle owners. The Justice Department is also conducting a criminal investigation.

It was Horn who was sent to apologize to consumers at a congressional hearing in October. But at the same time, he told lawmakers that top corporate officials had no knowledge of the cheating software installed in 11 million diesel cars worldwide.

To my understanding this was not a corporate decision, this was something individuals did, Horn said, adding that he felt personally deceived.

A federal judge has given the company until March 24 to reach an agreement with the government on recalling the affected vehicles. U.S. District Court Judge Charles R. Breyer wants to know about available technical solutions to fix the cars and the status of negotiations on a potential settlement with affected owners. Volkswagen has not indicated whether it will be able to meet the deadline.

Volkswagen in September admitted to U.S. regulators that it had used illegal software installed in its so-called Clean Diesel engines. The cheating allowed cars to pass laboratory emissions tests while spewing levels of harmful nitrogen oxide at up to 40 times the level allowed when operating on real roads.

The company is negotiating with lawyers for the owners of the defective cars, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board. Both state and federal regulators will have to sign off on any planned recall.",[]

Titled The History of Magic in North America, the online tales will detail the evolution of the previously unexplored North American wizarding world.

The first installment of the series, Fourteenth Century  Seventeenth Century, was published on Rowlings interactive website Pottermore Tuesday and explores the origins of the magical community in the New World. Rowling begins by clarifying that European and African witches and wizards were in contact with their North American brethren long before the country was colonized by European No-Majs (the American term for Muggles) in the 1600s. She goes on to discuss Native American magic, explaining that many witches and wizards were revered by their tribes for their healing and hunting abilities. Some Native American legends  such as that of skin walkers  were even borne from wizarding lore.

Rowling ends by stating that the biggest difference between new and old world magic was that Native Americans were masters of wandless magic. The magic wand originated in Europe. Wands channel magic so as to make its effects both more precise and more powerful, although it is generally held to be a mark of the very greatest witches and wizards that they have also been able to produce wandless magic of a very high quality, she writes. As the Native American Animagi and potion-makers demonstrated, wandless magic can attain great complexity, but Charms and Transfiguration are very difficult without one.

President Obama has made his share of foreign policy mistakes, particularly in the Middle East. But its ironic that Republican critics now hammer him hardest over his nuclear deal with Iran, a bet that has already paid out for those who want to undermine Irans hard-liners. Elections for Irans parliament and its Assembly of Expertswhich picks the nations Supreme Leaderwere hardly free and fair. Conservatives managed to block the candidacy of almost every well-known pragmatist and reformeryet the few who were allowed to run made stunning gains in both elections.

Its the Iranian people, not Obama, who produced this outcome. But without the nuclear deal that Obama pushed forand the sanctions relief and economic surge its about to deliver in Iranits unlikely that voters would have cast ballots to endorse change in such big numbers. A hard-line approach from the West would have surely provoked a hard-line response from Irans clerics, with support, or at best apathy, from the vast majority of Iranians. Instead, the nuclear deal and the accompanying optimism have driven a wedge between those in Iran who want to protect the cleric-controlled status quo and those who want a more open and dynamic society.

This is not a revolution. Hard-line conservatives held their own with voters outside Tehran. They still control the army, the courts, state-run media and the Revolutionary Guards, the dominant force in Irans foreign policy. When the current Supreme Leader, Ayatullah Ali Khamenei, dies, conservatives will work hard to ensure their candidate replaces him by any means necessary. A thaw in relations between Iran and the U.S. wont come soonif it comes at all.

But after the popular unrest that followed a rigged presidential election in 2009, the first-round landslide that lifted reformer Hassan Rouhani to the presidency in 2013 and this latest expression of the popular will, no one can deny that a large segment of Irans nearly 80 million people want a more open society and a more pragmatic approach to the outside world. This election was shaped in part by activists who took to social mediaincluding Telegram, a messaging app popular with millions of Iraniansto organize and inspire like-minded people. Prominent conservatives were left to weave laughable conspiracy theories about foreign plots, undermining their already limited credibility with Iranians too young to remember the revolution.

Iran is one of the only countries in the Middle East where popular will matters. There is not yet a crucial shift in the balance of power within Iran, but for the moment reformers, including the countrys popular President, are emboldened. Hard-liners are on the defensive. Thats in part because Obama and other outsiders gambled on ending Irans isolation and giving its people a reason to invest in the promise of change.

time.com,2016-03-09 08:00:01,Game of Thrones: San Francisco Chefs Throw Pop-Up Feasts,"['San Francisco', 'Katy Steinmetz']","



Their sigil is an armored hand clutching cutlery. Their house motto is as tantalizing as it is obvious: Dinner is coming.

These are the flourishes two young chefs have given their Guild of Cookery, an outfit dedicated to throwing medieval pop-up feasts that are literally inspired by George R.R. Martins book series A Song of Ice and Fire, which inspired the HBO series Game of Thrones. On Monday night in the Castro neighborhood, Graham Bellefeuille, 30, and Ty Cox, 29, recreated an eight-course meal that Tyrion Lannister eats while across the narrow sea in the free city of Pentosfrom the cold egg lime soup to the goose livers drowned in wine and suckling pig with plum sauce, finishing with the traditional cup of sweet wine. (Theres a full menu embedded at the bottom of this page.)



Each of the guests at the small, sold-out, $65 dinner was led to a seat where the menu, sealed with red-wax crown, bore their name in Game of Thrones style (e.g. Lady Katy of House Steinmetz). Bellefeuille then began by setting the scene from the books in a room that had chopped wood piled up halfway to the ceiling, like it might be in quarters at the Wall.

To avoid spoilers, suffice it to say Tyrion wasnt in a super mood in a place far off from Kings Landing, but was finding some solace in his cups and some exquisite, butter-kissed mushrooms. Bellefeuille also explained that the dishes the guests were about to eat, like the quail drenched in honey, arent modern interpretations; both chefs are devout students of historical cookery and, as much as they can, they base their dishes on recipes handed down from medieval times. (These are recipes that have instructions like Spice to your masters taste, written in Old English, which both of them can now sight read.)

The Guild of Cookery decorates banners and menus with their sigil and house motto.

The idea was we wanted to eat the food, says Bellefeuille. We wanted to experience what George R.R. Martin was describing. Cox doubles down on their promise to be faithful. Our goal is to be 100% accurate to the books, he says. This is not an expression of our inner creativity. Though there is an official Game of Thrones cookbook, for this feast the chefs mostly drew on recipes from Maestro Martino da Como, a famed Italian culinary expert from the 1400s.

The series of books about kings and queens that inspired the chefs to form their guildbefore the wildly popular TV series existedis a natural for pop-up feasts. Amid the intrigue and political machinations, back room dealings and beheadings, is relentless food porn. Lemon cakes. Black tar rum. Capons upon capons. Relishes made of bits of lime and orange, pushed aside so that characters can suck meat off of bones. Much like in true medieval timesand even, you might argue, among wealthy classes todayprivilege is embodied and displayed in the elaborate dishes the elite have laid in front of them by people who are going to go home and eat soup out of a pot.

To date, the duo has done eight menus two or three times each, like the Feast of Winterfell and the Red Vipers Feast. And Bellefeuille and Cox have gone to great lengths to procure the necessary foodstuffs. When whipping up a Dornish feast, for instance, they imported python from Vietnam for a fiery hot snake stew. But they have strayed a little from the script. The duo has slimmed down Martins menus when there were too many dishes for them to make, or feed people in a single night. And they admit that there are some things that are beyond their means to recreate. Lamprey, a favorite for pies in Westeros, isnt commercially fished, they say. Or something like a whole roast aurochs on a spit, says Bellefeuille. Thats just not going to happen. Still they do their best, in that case subbing in a steamship round of beef roasted whole and then sliced.

Despite the fact that these dinners have been going on and selling out for years, the Guild of Cookery has remained fairly under the radar. Part of that is because the chefs were using borderline medieval means of advertising in the beginning, like posting paper flyers. Neither of them had a Facebook page or Twitter account. If youre hanging out in a kitchen all day every day and youre reading books from 600 years ago, marketing is probably not your strong suit, Cox says. We went into it thinking if we just put this stuff forward, its a good enough thing. Theres a lot of interest in Game of Thrones. We want this. Other people want this. So if we build it, they will come.

And it is good, and people do come, as well as come back. At the dinner in the Castro, people who were otherwise strangers recognized each other from previous feastssome dressed in costumes, for which they received a free glass of Myrish Cider (Poma Aurea) or Arbor Gold (Verdejo wine). A teenage boy, complete with earbuds in, ate with his parents and had goose liver for the first time. Nearby, blue-haired, beanie-clad hipsters were using words like intellectual to describe the broth of crab and monkfish, for which the chefs had to substitute lobster. And the saddle of lamb was juicy, just like Tyrions storyline.

People make friends here, says Bellefeuille of why so many there are return feasters. Part of it is also novelty. There is a thing about people trying something theyve never had before, and thats a harder and harder thing to do. Obviously there are exotics meats, there are exotic techniques. We had capon at our last dinner. How many people have had that?

The next feast is on March 21 in San Francisco, and tickets are available here.

Today we are thrilled to introduce you to a new site called TIME Labs, the home base for interactive data journalism at TIME. We have gathered some old favorites and added some new ones, and well be continually updating the site with new projects and posts.

What can you expect from TIME Labs? The ever-blossoming technologies in Web browsers and smart phones give us tremendous potential to make things that youve never seen before on a news Web site. In the past few months, weve published apps that let you draw logos from memory, declared Makati City, Philippines, to be the selfie capital of the world, and even attempted to turn Census data into a dating app. The ever-blossoming technologies in Web browsers and smart phones give us tremendous potential to make things that surprise, entertain and inform all at once.

Were calling articles on Labs stories, because thats just what they are: Narratives built from data where you control the plot. But TIME Labs is more than just a clearinghouse for stuff we think is cool. Its also a place where you can explore the data that powers our projects. In addition to stories, weve also created pages called data sheets that take you behind the scenes to see the whole story of how a bunch of numbers can become a map, a chart, a game or anything else you see here.

A data sheet might not sound tremendously exciting, but one goal of TIME Labs is to push the boundaries of what we mean when we say data. The word tends to conjure up spreadsheets, scientific papers and debates over government surveillance. To us, it means any sort of human artifact that can be represented quantitatively and analyzed by a computer. A Census record of the number Iranian-Americans living in each state is data, but so are the transcripts of The Big Bang Theory, the color values of each pixel in the Mona Lisa, and the chord changes in every Neil Young song.

Theres no mathematical or computing expertise necessary to understand these pages. The purpose is to be transparent about the strengths and limitations of the data we use in our projects. If you do happen to like to write your own code and do your own analysis, well also be giving readers access to as much of our code as possible. You can find links to our Github repositories on the data pages. We think this is an important piece of transparency too.

We hope you are delighted by the projects here. Were grateful to the millions of people who have calculated how much time theyve spent on Facebook, discovered what state best matches their personality, lost a half hour to the latest in baby names and participated in many other stories that now live here. Your enthusiasm for these stories has helped make Time.coms interactive articles some of the most popular journalism created at TIME.

We want to hear from you. Send us any ideas you have for ways to make numbers come alive. You can reach me any time at chris.wilson@time.com, on Twitter or on GitHub.",[]

Chipotle announced Monday that the chain will no longer serve food containing genetically modified organisms (GMO), raising the bar for transparency in the United States, where theres no requirement to indicate the presence of GMO ingredients on food labels or in restaurants. Likewise, biotechnology companies arent required to report which genetically modified seeds are used in production.

Yet the use of GMOs is undoubtedly widespread. Since GMOs were approved for commercial use, and then first planted into U.S. soil in 1996, their production has increased dramatically. More than 90% of all soybean cotton and corn acreage in the U.S. is used to grow genetically engineered crops. Other popular and approved food crops include sugar beets, alfalfa, canola, papaya and summer squash. More recently, apples that dont brown and bruise-free potatoes were also approved by the FDA.

time.com,,See Who 2012 Political Donors Support Today,[],"See Who 2012 Political Donors Support Today

This interactive chart let's you follow the political money from 2012 donors who have giving to candidates in 2016

A TIME analysis of Federal Election Commission records indicates that, while donors to Barack Obama in 2012 have largely transferred their support to Hillary Clinton, Mitt Romneys donors are divided in their support of the 2016 hopefuls.

While those donors favor Jeb Bush, having given the former Florida governor more than $5.4 million since through Sept. 30, they are also giving Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson significant financial support.

Perhaps most surprising, more Romney money has flowed into Democrat Hillary Clintons coffers (more than $640,000 so far) than has been given to Republicans Rand Paul, Carly Fiorina or Chris Christie. Meanwhile Jeb Bush has collected nearly $125,000 so far from 2012 donors to Obama.

The chart above gives the clearest view of where party donors of old are placing their newest bets. While Obama donors overwhelmingly favor Hillary Clinton (no surprise), Newt Gingrich donors are giving the most to Ted Cruz this time around. Rick Perry bowed out of the 2016 race in September. During the 2016 cycle, his 2012 supporters gave more to fellow Texan Ted Cruz than they did to Perry himself.

The money above represents that given to the campaign committees of candidates for president. It excludes money giving to political action committees and so-called super PACs, which are legally separate from the campaigns, but increasingly count for a vast proportion of campaign spending. Campaigns are only required to disclose donations of $200 or more, so small donors to 2012 candidates are not represented in these figures.

With open fields in both parties, donations to candidates in 2011 far outpaces the equivalent period from four years ago. Donors have shelled out $166,000,000 to presidential campaign committees so far this cycle, compared to $106,000,000 during the equivalent period in the previous cycle.",[]

Not all states are equal when it comes to getting rest. New York, home to the city that never sleeps, does in fact turn in the latest on average, at 11:54 PM. But the state doesnt rise until 7:36 AM  sleeping in past every state except North Dakota, according to new sleep data provided by Withings exclusively to TIME. Colorado is the first to rise, at 7:07AM, followed closely by Rhode Island and South Dakota. As a region, midwestern states likewise goes to bed the earliest, with South Dakota turning the lights out first.

So which state is getting the least sleep? Residents of Delaware, on average, are sleeping less than the rest of the country, at 7 hours and 36 minutes each night. Rhode Island, New York, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C. all follow closely behind. Which Americans are getting the most rest? Montanans, with 8 hours and 20 minutes each night. Other places with heavy sleepers include: South Dakota, Wyoming and Maine. The chart below shows where all states plus Washington, D.C., rank.

Those users are sleeping on average 7 hours and 50 minutes each night. While thats nearly an hour less than findings from 2013 American Time Use Survey undertaken by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), wearable technology could provide a more accurate picture of whats happening in Americas beds. The BLS survey asks respondents when they sleep and rise, without taking into account the time it takes to fall asleep or other activities in bed. Sleep-tracking devices detect body movement and heart rate, producing what may be a more accurate measure of time slept.

Caution, sleep-seekers! Note that Withings users, according to the company, are often men aged between 35 and 40 years old who are interested in technology.

time.com,2016-03-09 10:59:21,Hillary Clinton Super PAC to Spend $4.5M in March Primaries,['Sam Frizell'],"



Priorities USA Action, the main super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton, is spending heavily over the coming weeks in the March primary states, part of an effort to boost the former Secretary of State in her race against Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination.

Radio ads and direct mail funded by Priorities will go on the air and into mailboxes in Ohio, Illinois, Arizona and Florida, focusing in particular on turning out Latino and African-American voters in support of Clinton. Priorities plans to spend a total $4.5 million to boost voter turnout in the March states, building on spending that began in February.

The expenditures are a tacit recognition of Bernie Sanders enduring strength in the primary; Sanders has posed a greater challenge to Clinton in the nomination than her allies expected. The super PAC bought radio time supporting Clinton ahead of Michigans hard-fought primary on Tuesday, which Clinton narrowly lost.

But beyond the primary, Priorities spending also could position Clinton better in a general election against a Republican, assuming she wins the nomination, by energizing Democrats and countering Republican spending against her.

This allows us to continue making investments in primary states to ensure Hillary Clinton enters the general election in the strongest possible position, said Guy Cecil, co-chairman of Priorities, in an open memo published March 2. The coming onslaught from Republican outside groups makes our work crucial to a Hillary Clinton victory.

The super PACs increased involvement in the Democratic primary began shortly after Sanders landslide victory in New Hampshire. Priorities has already spent $4.2 million since the beginning of February, according to FEC filings, going through $1.3 million on direct mail and more than $2.9 million on radio ads in states like South Carolina, Georgia and Texas.

Tad Devine, top strategist for the Sanders campaign, warned last week that the spending would hurt Clintons image in primary states. Some Sanders staffers have discussed pushing at the Democratic convention for a commitment from Democrats not to spend money super PAC money in any future presidential or congressional primaries. Priorities is spending millions, Devine said last week. As this starts coming more into focus, people are going to get very motivated to come out for Sanders.

Priorities, however, is not the only super PAC spending money in the Democratic primary. National Nurses United for Patient Protection, a super PAC affiliated with a nurses union that has endorsed Sanders, has spent $1.9 million supporting the Vermont senator, including with billboards, canvassing and radio buys.

As the campaign has ramped up, fundraising for Priorities has steadily increased since last year. The super PAC raised $10 million in January, compared with $16 million in the first six months of last year.",[]

For all the talk of American exceptionalism, there is at least one thing that is unexceptional about the United States: its flag. The Star-Spangled Banners particular shade of red shows up in 14.3 percent of all national flags, making it the second most common color after white. And the dark blue of the American flags canton is also shared by 13 other nations.

In fact, the worlds 196 countries stick to a surprisingly small palette when it comes to picking their flags. The most popular shade of yellow, for example, shows up in the flags of Lithuania, Columbia, Ghana, St. Lucia and Vietnam, among many others, giving it a foothold on five continents and making it third most popular individual shade. (Overall, blues and greens are more popular than yellows.)

Sometimes, its not just the colors that seem familiar. In perhaps the most famous example of two countries showing up somewhere wearing the same outfit, Liechtenstein and Haiti both arrived at the 1936 Olympics flying identical banners.

Methodology

The complete code used to generate this data, which uses Mathematica 10, is available on the Wolfram Cloud.

After downloading the 196 flag images from Flagpedia.net, we added up the total number of pixels of each color. This yielded 527 different shades across 36.6 million pixels. Because digital images are only approximations of the colors in the physical flags, we decided it was safe to further simplify these colors down to the traditional web safe palette of 216 possible colors. That reduced the number of distinct shades from 527 to 63.

These 63 colors were then grouped into parent categories of white, black, red, blue, green and yellow using a simple algorithm to determine which parent color each shade most resembled. This process required a small about of manual tweaking for colors on the border between green and blue.",[]

J.K. Rowlings latest story on North American witchcraft and wizardry dives deep into American history, specifically the Salem Witch Trials.

Seventeenth Century and Beyond is the second installment in The History of Magic in North America, Rowlings collection of four new stories about the previously unexplored American wizarding world. The author is using these pieces to set the scene for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a Harry Potter prequel film set in 1920s New York City.

The tale explains why witches and wizards who emigrated to America from Europe struggled to adjust to their new home. First, there were fewer resources for potions and no established wandmakers. Secondly, the Puritans, a group that instigated conflict with the Native American population, made witches and wizards extremely wary of their magic.

And lastly, the Salem Witch Trails of 1692-93 were a tragedy for the wizarding community, Rowling writes due to a group called Scourers, an unscrupulous band of wizarding mercenaries of many foreign nationalities, who formed a much-feared and brutal taskforce committed to hunting down not only known criminals, but anyone who might be worth some gold. The Scourers sound similar to the Death Eaters, as the group also indulged a love of authority and enjoyed bloodshed and torture.

Rowling clarifies that during the Salem Witch Trials among the so-called Puritan judges were at least two known Scourers, and that a number of the dead were indeed witches, though utterly innocent of the crimes for which they had been arrested. Others were merely No-Majs who had the misfortune to be caught up in the general hysteria and bloodlust.

The events at Salem led to the creation of the Magical Congress of the United State of Americas in 1693.

The demographics of the United States will look radically different in the next several decades. But you dont have to wait 45 years to see a picture of that America. Just go to Texas.

The racial and ethnic makeup of the Lone Star State today closely resembles what the entire country is expected to look like half-a-century from now. Roughly a third of population is Hispanic and less than half the population is white.

Its possible, using projections the Census Bureau has released for every year through 2060, to match each states current demographics to the year it most resembles on a national levelpast, present or future. For example, the Florida of today very closely resembles where the nation is expected to be in 2029. Meanwhile, Connecticut is frozen in the demographic amber of 2001, and neighboring Massachusetts looks like the America of 1993. North Dakota is like the America of 1930.

To produce a year for each state, TIME compared the current percentage of white, black, Hispanic and Asian residents to the same percentages on a national level for every year from 1900 through 2060.

Some matches are closer than others. States with small black populations, like Iowa, are typically matched to the year 1930, the year with the lowest percentage of black residents nationally. States with large Hispanic populations typically match to future projections.",[]

An 8-year-old Rhode Island boy with terminal cancer, whose last wish to become famous in China sparked a viral social media campaign, has died.

Dorian Murray passed away in his parents arms late Tuesday after a four-year battle with rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare soft tissue cancer, his family told TIME on Wednesday. He went quite peacefully, his father Chris Murray said. It was something we knew was coming. We were both holding him.

The world granted the little Westerly boys dying wish to become famous just hours after his father sent out a call on social media in January. The inspired #DStrong campaign reverberated around the world, gaining attention from celebrities and sports stars like New England Patriots Rob Gronkowski, Justin Bieber, Morgan Freeman and Olivia Wilde.



The response to a simple conversation with my son that I posted up was incredible, Chris Murray said, adding that hes still stumped as to why his son chose China. The fact that he got his wish and he became so famous is a blessing.

Dorians dad said he knew the request was a tall order, but felt he had to try since his son rarely ever asked for things or complained about his disease since being diagnosed at age 4. The family had just learned the cancer was no longer treatable. It was just one of those things, knowing what was happening, to try to make everything I could happen for him, the 36-year-old said. That was my biggest thing. So, I started asking around.

Dorian remained defiant even as the disease worsened in the last few months, his father said. He would always tell us, Dont worry. Ill kick cancers ass. I beat it once, Ill beat it again. He was always positive, Chris Murray said. No matter what came his way, he took it in stride and kept fighting even to his last breath.

Dorians family said they hope the little boys courageous journey continues to touch thousands of more lives after his death. They have launched the Dorian J. Murray Foundation to spread awareness of pediatric cancer and raise money to support research and affected families.

From everything that hes gone through, we hope that everybody can take note of his strength and courage and hopefully his sacrifice will lead to a better world, Chris Murray said. If Dorians legacy is to bring everyone together and bring awareness to pediatric cancer, if he helps save the life of even one kid, it was all worth helping him get his wish.",[]

Homework dominates after-school time in many households and has been dubbed the 21st centurys new family dinner. Overtired children complain and collapse. Exasperated parents cajole and nag. These family fights often ends in tears, threats, and parents secretly finishing their kids homework.

Parents put up with these nightly battles because they want whats best for their kids. But, surprise, the opposite is more likely to be true. A comprehensive review of 180 research studies by Duke University psychologist and neuroscientist Harris Cooper shows homeworks benefits are highly age dependent: high schoolers benefit if the work is under two hours a night, middle schoolers receive a tiny academic boost, and elementary-aged kids? Its better to wait.

If you examine the researchnot one study, but the full sweep of homework researchits clear that homework does have an impact, but its not always a good one. Homework given too young increases negative attitudes toward school. Thats bad news, especially for a kindergartener facing 12 more years of assignments.

Children rebel against homework because they have other things they need to do. Holler and run. Relax and reboot. Do family chores. Go to bed early. Play, following their own ideas. Children have been told what to do all day long at schoolwhich is mostly sitting still and focusing on the academic side. Academic learning is only one side of a child. When school is out, kids need time for other things.

Some schools are already realizing this. New York Citys P.S. 116 elementary school made news last year when its principal Jane Hsu abolished homework and asked families to read instead. Individual schools and teachers from Maryland to Michigan have done the same, either eliminating homework in the elementary years or making it optional. But schools also report that if teachers dont give it, some parents will demand it.

Believers in homework say it teaches soft skills like responsibility and good study habits. Thats another problem with homework in elementary school. Young kids can rarely cope with complex time management skills or the strong emotions that accompany assignments, so the responsibility falls on parents. Adults assume the highly undesirable role of Homework Patrol Cop, nagging kids about doing it, and children become experts in procrastination and the habit of complaining until forced to work. Homework overtakes the parents evening as well as the childs. These roles arent easy to shake.

Read More: How Hard Is Too Hard to Push Kids?

When homework comes at a stage when it can academically benefit students, it can also be a students responsibility. That means a high school student should be expected to do her homework without being reminded. It may take a year or two of practice in middle school, but it doesnt require years of practice. Before age 11, responsibility can be taught in other ways. For a 6-year-old, that means remembering to feed the cat and bring home her lunchbox.

If we want students to improve memory, focus, creative thinking, test performance and even school behavior, the answer is not more homework, the answer is more sleep. The National Sleep Foundation reports that our children are suffering sleep deprivation, partly from homework. If we pride ourselves on a rational, research-based approach to education, we must look at the right facts.

Parents often feel stuck with homework because they dont realize they have a choice. But they do. Schooling may be mandatory, but homework isnt. Families can opt out. Parents can approach the teacher either about homework load or the simple fact of doing homework at all, especially in elementary school. Many teachers will be more than happy with the change. Opting out, or changing the homework culture of a school brings education control back down to the local level.

Thats another thing the new Education Secretary has promised: to turn more control for education decisions over to states and local school districts. That could spell good news for students  if local teachers and principals do their own homework and read up on what the research says about making kids do school work after school is done.",[]

Emma Watson kicked off HeForShes inaugural Arts Week in New York City Tuesday on International Womens Day with a discussion about challenging gender norms.

Chirlane McCray, the First Lady of New York and Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the Executive Director of UN Women, introduced the Harry Potter star alongside actor and director Forest Whitaker, who runs the Whitaker Peace & Development Initiative.

I think about the performing arts and how we perceive masculinity and have rigid definitions and ideas of a leading man and what a leading man can or cant do or how he should or shouldnt act, Watson said. Challenging these perceptions make the roles that each of us get to play more complex, more real, more authentic, they make our jobs more interesting and truthful.



In Watsons eyes, being an active bystander can help mitigate the difference between recognizing the problem and making a tangible change.

Empowering people to know and think that its their role when they see something that isnt right to say something about it, thats how to be an active bystander, she said. Most men and women can name a moment in their lives when they were a witness to a man or a woman being treated unfairly because of gender and it just takes someone calling it out.

Watson, who delivered a much-praised speech on gender equality at the U.N. in 2014, recently said she is taking a year off from acting to focus on gender studies and her feminist book club.",[]

Few candidates arriving at tonights GOP debate have the option of doing so in their very own Boeing 757. But then again there are few candidates like Donald Trump.

According to data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration via a Freedom of Information request, Trumps two planesthe 757 and his Cessna Citation Xhave flown a total of 504,316 miles over the course of 538 trips between Jan. 2011 and April 2015.

Trumps favorite destination, outside of his hometown of New York City is West Palm Beach, the airport closest to the Trump resort Mar-a-Lago. Trumps planes have landed in the Florida city 53 times during the period. The second most popular destination for Trumps flights are Washington, D.C., followed closely by Oxford, Connecticut.

Trumps travels in 2015 reflect his recent presidential bid, with three flights to Manchester, N.H., where he leads in the polls by over 10 points according to Real Clear Politics.

The 757 has touched down in Iowa three times in 2015, in January, April, and most recently in June after announcing his presidential bid.

Trumps Boeing 757, purchased in 2011, reportedly comes with 24k gold-plated seat belts and flies at speeds over 500 miles per hour.

time.com,2015-09-28 00:00:00,How Rare is a Perfect Game Through Four Innings?,[],"How Rare is a Perfect Game Through Four Innings?

Ive seen the Phillies face Stephen Strasburg in Washington twice this season. The first time, on July 19, the fireballer retired the first 14 batters he faced. The second time, this past Saturday, he retired the first 12.

This says as much about the poor Phillies as it does about Strasburg, but it got me wondering how long a pitcher has to have a perfect game going before one should start to get excited.

Using data from Retrosheet, I attempted to calculate, for every game between 2000 and 2014, the number of consecutive outs each of the two starting pitchers has recorded before allowing his first man on base. (Data isnt yet available for 2015.) The code, which is open-source on Github, correctly identifies the seven perfect games of the 21st century and the four games spoiled by the last batter. It turns out that even a perfect game through four innings is fairly rare, having happened 215 times since 2000, not including the current season. Between 2000 and 2014, 0.29% of games featured a pitcher whose thrown four or more perfect innings.

Heres a graph showing the frequency of incomplete perfect games (plus seven complete ones) starting with the fourth inning, charted by the last batter faced before the perfect game was broken up. The data its cumulative; the games broken up after 12 batters dont include those broken up after 15, etc.

Its curious that there are fewer 25-out and 26-out near-perfect games than there are actual perfect games. This may be statistical randomness. Even with 71,982 starts between 2000 and 2014, its so uncommon to make it deep into a game without allowing a man on base that one is left with a fairly small sample. Or it may be adrenaline on the pitchers part. Or perhaps its just that you cant play the Phillies all the time.",[]

The latest government data show some encouraging declines in death rates from major diseases, but the good news comes with some caveats

In the latest analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association of a massive amount of government-collected health data from 1969 to 2013, theres good news. The death rate among Americans, at any given age, from all causes decreased by 43% from 1969 to 2013. In fact, of the six leading causes of death, five showed declines during that period, with only mortality from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increasing.

Death rates per 100,000 people for all causes

The good news hides some potentially less welcome trends.

The death rates from three major causesheart disease, stroke and diabetesare starting to flatten after continuous declines. The researchers speculate the death rates didnt continue their steady decline because the obesity epidemic started to emerge around that time. As Americans became heavier, their risk of these diseases increased, blunting some of the improvements that new drugs, better education and lifestyle changes have made in the morality from these conditions.

Declines in leading causes of death, by sex Age-adjusted death rates shown



The other less rosy news comes from a closer look at the breakdown of mortality trends by race. A TIME analysis of the Centers for Disease Controls mortality database, used in the JAMA study, provided age-adjusted death rates by race and ethnicity. The graph below shows data back to 1999, when CDC updated disease classifications. While death rates declined among African Americans, they were still higher than those for whites in 5 out of 6 leading causes of death.

Death rate per 100,000 people, by race

Analyzing death rates in this way, say the study authors, is critical to better understanding where our health system is improving the health of Americans, and, perhaps more importantly, where it is not. The fact that declines in mortality for some diseases is beginning to slow down highlights the need to address obesity and its effect on our health more aggressively, while gaps among different racial and ethnic groups stresses the importance of improving access, quality and education about health care to all groups.",[]
time.com,,This Map Shows Where Immigrants Send the Most Money Home,[],"This Map Shows Where Immigrants Send the Most Money Home

As politicians turn an eye to remittance payments that immigrants send home, some countries rely heavily on the cash flow.

In his proposal for stricter security at the U.S-Mexico border, Donald Trump seized on an issue that could make him very unpopular among immigrants: remittances.

Remittance paymentsmoney that immigrants send back to their home countriesare one of the latest targets for Trump, who proposed that unless Mexico funds a wall at its northern border, the U.S. should impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages of Mexicans working in the U.S.

Mexico currently receives nearly $24.4 billion in remittances each year from immigrants in the U.S., accounting for about 2 percent of the Mexican GDP, according to the World Bank. Across the globe, immigrants sent $583 billion back to their home countries in 2014, with $440 billion of that going to developing countries. Remittances usually form just a small fraction of a countrys national GDP, but they still accounted for almost four times the $135 billion in global foreign aid that was disbursed last year. In the following map, you can click on any country to see where it immigrants living there send money home.

And Trump isnt the only one with his eye on remittance payments. World leaders who recognize the importance of the remittance industry in their economies include Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose recent visit to the United Arab Emirates put the issue in the spotlight as he worked to attract greater foreign investment in India. This is for good reason, since remittances tend to increase in times of recession while other forms of investment decrease, as tougher times at home can elicity more money from friends and family abroad. India receives about $12 billion in remittances from the UAE, and remittances from the broader Gulf region play a significant part in the economy of South Indian states like Kerala.

While Trumps plan to confiscate the remittances of undocumented workers may be impracticalnot to mention controversialglobal remittances provide an interesting look at how immigrants in the U.S. and beyond are lifting people from their own countries out of poverty by sending money home. The practice is most prevalent in Tajikistan, which receives about 40 percent of its national GDP in the form of remittances.

Methodology

Remittances and migration unit data are provided by the World Bank Group. The estimates of total migrant population were obtained from the World Banks Bilateral-Remittance matrix. The estimates in this data set are compiled from various primary and secondary sources for international migrant population and remittance outflows, and may in some cases fail to capture the complete volumes of remittances.

For those who dont believe that Donald Trump or Ben Carson can win the Republican nominationneither have any governing experiencethe most important question is who their masses of supporters would pick as a second choice.

We can find one clue to these tangled allegiances in which candidates a person follows on Twitter. TIME Labs examined the 6.2 million people who follow at least one of the 16 candidates and looked at the overlaps for anyone who followed more than one.

Whats striking here is that, while Florida Senator Marco Rubio is only polling at around 5 percent, he is the most jointly followed candidate among 10 of his 15 competitors.

While all the usual caveats about Twitter data applythe demographics are considerably younger than GOP primary voters, and a follower does not a voter makeits significant that so many people who follow any of the other candidates also follow him. This suggests that he may very well be the second choice of many people who support another candidate.

Half of English majors move home after graduating college

Its an old joke among humanities majors: You may be nourishing the soul, but when you graduate, its back to living with your parents while you look for a job with that degree.

To test the truth of this assertion, TIME examined five years of Census data on those with Bachelors degrees, accounting for both their field of study and whether they are listed as living with at least one parent. Of course, this could mean a person is in a graduate program and still using his or her home address. And living at home doesnt mean a person is unemployed. Census data suggests most such individuals do have jobs.

Like which school you attend, what you major in seems to have the most bearing on the years just after school. While half of English majors live at home right out of collegeincluding this reporter, for several monthsonly about a third of Engineering majors do. By age 29, however, the difference has dropped to 5 points (12 percent of English majors and 7 percent of Engineering majors.) This is generally true across the board.

So major in what you like. The worst that can happen is youll be living at home for an extra year or two. See below for the rates for every major.

Major Percent living at home at age... 22 25 29

Methodology

Using Census microdata from 2009-2013, individuals were considered to be living at home if either of the variables MOMLOC or POPLOC were equal to 1, meaning a parent was the head of the household. Only those with completed bachelors degrees between ages 22 and 29 were examined.

Take clearer low-light photos without using flash

One of the Galaxy S7s biggest improvements compared to its predecessors is the ability to take better images in dim conditions. Samsung has increased the size of the pixels in its camera sensor, which lets it take in more light.

I found this to be true. A picture shot in a dark bar looked brighter and less grainy when taken on the Galaxy S7 versus the iPhone 6s Plus. That being said, Apple also has its own methods of improving photography in poorly lit situations. The iPhone 6s is capable of using the phones screen as a flash when taking photos with the front-facing camera, for instance.

Make a payment using your phone without NFC

Most mobile payment systems, including Apple Pay, rely on a technology called Near Field Communication (NFC) to connect your smartphone to a payment terminal. While NFC support is becoming more common in the retail world, its still not everywhere.

Samsung Pay, however, can be used with almost any payment terminal. That means it works just about anywhere credit cards are accepted regardless of whether or not the cash register supports NFC.

Charge your phone without plugging it in

Like many Android smartphones, Samsungs Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 can be charged wirelessly. Rather than plugging the phone into an outlet, users can rest the device on a charging pad to replenish its battery.

The type of wireless technology built in to Samsungs newest phones (and the Galaxy S6) is made to work with just about any charging mat available. Although some tinkerers have developed workarounds that allow wireless charging on the iPhone, the feature is not officially supported.

Add extra storage space

Users who store hours worth of movies, TV shows, and music on their mobile devices will appreciate this feature. Galaxy S7 owners can add more storage space to their device by popping in a new microSD card. Both phones support up to 200GB in extra storage space.",[]

And being the wonderful female supporter she is, Harry Potters J.K. Rowling chimed in to back her on-screen Hermione.

Watson spent the morning in New York kicking of HeForShes Inaugural Arts Week, saying that the best way to affect change in the inequality landscape is by acting as an active bystander.

time.com,2016-02-22 00:00:00,How We Made the Candidates Speak 30 Times Slower,[],"How We Made the Candidates Speak 30 Times Slower

Earlier this month, TIME published a series of slow motion videos of 2016 presidential campaign events in Iowa, overlaid with audio of the candidates speaking against a haunting background noise. As one of the technicians who worked on the series, Ive had several people ask me about that underlying audio. What is it? Is that music? How did you do that?

While we were discussing the approach to audio in The Candidates, filmmaker Christopher Morris described his vision of how it should sound. He wanted audio of each candidates event: the sound of the crowd and of the candidate speaking. But because the camera would slow down the action, he wanted to slow down the audio as well.

The camera would be filming at 720 frames per second (fps), while typical playback speed is 24 fps. This means that 1 second of action captured in real-time will be 30 seconds of footage when played back. There would be some use of standard-speed audio of the candidates speaking, but to complement the cameras visual aesthetic, we wanted background audio that was slowed to the same degree that the camera was slowing the visual action. So we needed to slow down the audio by 30 times.

There are two main approaches to lengthening audio. First, you can simply slow down the playback, much like playing a record player or cassette tape at a slower speed. But this also lowers the pitch of the sound, in our case by five octavesfar too low to be practical. The other way is to repeat tiny chunks of the audio to lengthen its playback time without altering the pitch. This is the method used in most editing programs like Final Cut Pro. However, this introduces noticeable artifacts after a speed change of around 20  50 percent, and we needed 3000 percent. So neither of these traditional methods would work for The Candidates. What would?

A few years ago, the WNYC show RadioLab aired an episode on the subject of time. One segment was about a 24-hour version of Beethovens 9th Symphony. Stretching the music creates a striking and ethereal sonic landscape. It allows the listener to fully saturate in the moment-to-moment complexity of the piece. A quick online search will reveal many works of music transformed in this way, including several familiar pop songs. Most are unrecognizable and eerily detached from their original versions, but are endlessly meditative and remarkable.

It turns out this type of audio time-stretching is accomplished with an open-source software application called PaulStretch. It can lengthen any sound, not just music, and lengthened human speech often takes on an intensified musical quality. This seemed ideal for The Candidates, where the slowed-down audio of the candidates speeches would provide us with an abstracted sense of place, but also serve as a soundtrack for each film.

For the first few events we only had enough time between shots to record perhaps 10-15 minutes of ambient audio  more than enough for a 5-10 minute film  but we wanted longer amounts so we would have more variety to best match the visual content. So at later events, we recorded the entire time we were there, with a separate track set aside for the feed from the public address system. This was much more effective at bringing out the inner musicality of the speakers voice.

At this point, you might be wondering how PaulStretch works. Basically, it looks at individual portions of the sound one at a time. For convenience, well refer to this portion of sound as a window. For each window, we get an impression of the frequency spectrum of that sound. For example: are there a lot of high-pitched sounds or low-pitched sounds? The longer the window, the more the sound will smear, much like a long camera exposure might cause an image to smear from motion blur. In The Candidates, we used a window that was around one second in length. To create the sense of smearing, we have to detach the frequency information further from where it exists in time. So we take that component of the information and randomize it. Now that we have a smeared sonic impression of the window, we play it back. So far we have one second of input audio and one second of output audio.

But this doesnt seem like it would stretch the sense of time, does it? Heres how the sound is lengthened: For the next window, rather than moving forward in the audio file by one second, we move forward by only a fraction of a second. Were actually looking at much of the same information again, having lost a small amount at the beginning of the window and gained a little at the end. Even though we only moved forward by a fraction of a second in the original input audio, weve generated another full second of output audio. This process is repeated over and over as we move incrementally though the file  and consequently the audio coming out is much longer than the audio going in.

If youve made it this far and youre curious to look at the Python version of the app, its astonishingly simple: both a testament to the brevity of the Python programming language, and the clarity of the algorithm itself.

A few tech specs: we used the Zoom H6 recorder with an XY microphone, and recorded everything at 24-bit 96KHz for maximum flexibility. We ended up converting all the files to 16-bit 48KHz for consistency with Final Cut Pro. For the PaulStretch conversions, we used the same settings for all the films and stretching them by 30 timesexactly the same as the camera is doing with the images. So for a 15 minute recording, we would have almost 8 hours of stretched audio. Plenty (if not too much) for the filmmaker, Chris, to select from.

To choose the slowed-down audio we wanted, I left it playing on my laptop while he was editing. Every once in a while, hed ask me to make a note of where the playback was, or to find another section to try out. Then he put these in Final Cut and we made selections of the real-time audio of the candidate that would layer briefly above the stretched audio during the first few moments of each film.

We were immediately moved by the effect: a slow, reverberant echo of the candidates voices. It was both jarring and oddly familiar  a striking compliment to the powerful images Chris had filmed  and a bridge between the known and the unseen.

In all, he traveled approximately 721,000 miles, an equivalent of 31 times around the earth, according to an estimate by John Trigilio. Paul VI visited 15 countries before ceasing travel after being stabbed in the Manila airport in 1970. He expanded the popes international presence as the first to leave Europe in over a century, and the first to fly.

Since the start of his papacy in 2013, Francis has visited 16 countries, with a focus on his native continent of South America and Asia.

time.com,2016-03-07 04:00:46,Fugitives in Their Own Lands: Meet Kenya's LGBT Refugees,['Rachel Lowry'],"Last summer marked a landmark moment for the gay rights movement in the U.S.: the legalization of same sex marriage. Crowds celebrated on the White House steps, rainbow-tinted profiles exploded across Facebook and thousands of marriage ceremonies in the following months lauded the cultural victory for LGBTs in America. But nearly 9,000 miles away, acceptance remains a mere ideal.

Photographer Jake Naughton, who worked last year with Kenya-based journalist Jacob Kushner, has documented LGBT refugees from East Africa, where leaders are imposing harsher laws on gays and lesbians. They have experienced beatings, torture, public humiliation, extortion, family disownment and sexual abuse. Some have been outed in their high schools, others labeled as terrorists and even put behind bars. Hundreds of them seek a new life in the west, fleeing to Kenya to wait in a refugee camp, Kakuma, for asylum or resettlement abroadin Europe, Canada, or the U.S. That is, after a long and dangerous wait.

It can take years, sometimes decades, to be granted asylum to leave Africa, Naughton tells TIME. They flee to Kenya, expecting some sense of safety, or at least the ability to securely wait out their processing time when in fact, they walked into the same nightmare.

Gay equality has a long way to go in Africa. Nearly 90% of the Kenyan population believe homosexuality should not be accepted, according to a 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center. Of the continents 54 countries, only one, South Africa, has legalized same-sex marriage. While Kenya is known to be more liberal to gays and lesbians, homophobia remains rampant throughout the country, amid a rising Evangelical movement. In 2011, President Barack Obama called for expedited resettlement of LGBT refugees, but as Congress allocated little funding for the new legislation, agencies, churches, charities and NGOs that wish to help lack the resources to do so.

Naughtons pictures depict the living conditions in Kakuma. While the UNHCR covers lodging and offers healthcare access to refugees, living conditions are destitute. Its extremely hot, very dusty, with 182,000 people packed into the camp, Naughton says. Its huge, its sprawling and it was never designed to hold that many people.

The photos, taken with a strobe flash, cast an intense light on each refugee. The light is so bright and so direct, it mimics the intense scrutiny that all these people are under, he says. But then by its nature, it casts these deep shadows, which is kind of where the refugees find themselves confined to.

The refugees scars are physical reminders that a new life abroad is worth waiting for: One man poses, a smile thrown off-kilter by a jagged scar from a seven-man machete attack in his apartment after seen with his boyfriend; a woman holds her arm out, showing a deep scar from shoulder to elbow, the fallout of an attack after giving an interview a few years ago on BBC radio.

As a gay person who came of age after the worst of the experience of the LGBT community here in the U.S., I always felt disconnected from the stories that my mom told me about what my gay uncle experienced, Naughton says. But in Kenya, I witnessed that. [It was] amazing to see the way the community came together and supported each other in the face of horrifying violence and hardship and abuse.

The images are the first part of what Naughton and Kushner envision as a three-part project that follows refugees from beginning to end: from Uganda, where they came from; to Kenya, where they fled to; to the U.S., where two have resettled. It is our hope to create a record of the experience of the LGBTs that is underreported and unsung, Naughton says.

Jake Naughton is a photographer with is interested in the intersection of LGBT and immigration issues. He is a frequent contributor to The New York Times, and his work has appeared in Al Jazeera America, Newsweek and the Atlantic.

A lawyer for music producer Dr. Luke is responding to a report that Sony Music Entertainment will cut ties with him amid his legal battle with pop star Kesha, who has accused him of verbal and sexual abuse. The allegations are part of an ongoing lawsuit that has consumed the music industry in recent weeks.

Earlier Wednesday The Wrap reported that Sony will end its working relationship with Dr. Luke (real name: Lukasz Gottwald) a year before his contract is set to expire.

Jim Bates of Sitrick and Company issued a statement to TIME from Christine Lepera, an attorney for Luke:



This is not true. Luke has an excellent relationship with Sony. His representatives are in regular contact with executives at the highest levels at Sony and this has never come up.

A representative for Sony declined to comment to TIME. Representatives for Kesha did not return TIMEs request for comment.

Kesha (real name: Kesha Sebert) first accused Gottwald of sexual assault in a 2014 lawsuit. Gottwald, who produced many of Keshas hits in addition to songs for Katy Perry, Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus, has repeatedly denied the allegations. (He also filed a countersuit in 2014.) At a hearing last month, a judge ruled that Kesha could not be let out of her recording contracts while her lawsuit plays out in court. Since then, artists such as Lady Gaga and Adele have voiced their support for the singer. Taylor Swift also donated $250,000 to the singer.

Lawyers for Sony suggested at the hearing that the company was open to having Kesha record new music without Dr. Lukes involvement, but Keshas lawyer, Mark Geragos, called this an illusory promise and said such an arrangement would set Kesha up for failure. The companys ties to Gottwald, he argued, would keep Sony from properly promoting Keshas music.

Kesha is signed to Gottwalds Kemosabe Records, a Sony subsidiary, through a deal with Gottwalds Kasz Money production company. Last month, an attorney for Sony told the New York Times that the company did not have the power to terminate Keshas recording contract: Sony has made it possible for Kesha to record without any connection, involvement or interaction with Luke whatsoever, but Sony is not in a position to terminate the contractual relationship between Luke and Kesha.

Fans of the singer announced Wednesday that they are planning a Friday march on Sony Music Entertainments New York City headquarters, where they plan to present petitions with more than 400,000 signatures calling for Kesha to be released from her contracts.",[]

Schools back in session and for U.S. business schools, many eager to advertise their worldliness, that means welcoming droves of students who dont call America home. Stanford Graduate School of Business boasts a recent class that is 42 percent foreign. Harvard Business Schools Class of 2014 was 34 percent international. More than one out of three students at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business now calls somewhere else home.

So which country outside the United States is home to students most interested in studying there? The best measure may be the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), administered by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), which is typically required by M.B.A. programs in the United States.

In China, where the number of college and universities has doubled in the last decade, the number of GMAT exams taken has boomed from 8,779 in 2000 to 62,740 in 2015. And while China and India, where 29,055 tests were taken in 2015, now represent the vast majority of GMAT tests taken aboard, the rate of increase in test takers has grown far faster in other countries, according new numbers released by GMAC to TIME.

The number of tests taken in Saudi Arabia has gone up 952 percent from 252 in 2000 to 2,400 in 2015. The number of tests taken in Vietnam has increased 921 percent from 163 in 2000 to 1,501 in 2015. In Kuwait, the number has jumped from 95 to 647 during that period. While in Nepal, 506 tests were taken in 2015 compared to 75 tests in 2000.

U.S. test-takers now make up a little more than a third of all test-takers when they once represented a majority.

The recent shooting at Oregons Umpqua Community College, which claimed 10 lives in one of the nations deadliest mass shootings in recent years, has brought new scrutiny to the ease with which anyone can purchase a gun in America.

Authorities say that the 26-year-old gunman Christopher Harper-Mercer purchased the 14 weapons he owned legally. This has contributed to calls from politicians such as Hillary Clinton for expanded background checks, along with an end to the Charleston loophole, which allows for thousands of guns  55,887 between 1998 and 2014  to be sold to people with criminal records and mental illness, such as Dylan Roof.

How does that happen? Individuals attempting to purchase a gun through a licensed dealer  rather than at a private show or unlicensed online  are subject to a criminal background check conducted by the FBIs National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). In spite of its name, however, the system does not always return an instant verdict on whether the purchaser can buy the firearm. Since 1998, according to data from the FBI, federal and state governments have run 202 million background checks on prospective gun owners. Nine percent of these checks delay the sale. If three business days pass without a verdict from the FBI, licensed dealers can sell the gun anyway  a provision known as a default proceed.

Scroll through the interactive below to see how the background check loophole has put an average of 3,490 guns in the wrong hands every year since 1998.

The ATF said it could not provide information on how many of these weapons were recovered.

ATF spokeswoman Dannette Seward said that so far, theres been no uniform method by which agents are entering firearm retrievals into a database, so we have no meaningful way to pull that data.

It was this three-day NICS loophole that allowed Dylan Roof to legally purchase the gun he used to kill nine churchgoers during a Bible study in Charleston, S.C. on June 17, 2015. Roofs background check returned a recent arrest in Columbia, S.C., delaying the transaction. An FBI examiner contacted the Lexington County Sheriffs Office, who told her to check with Columbia Police. The examiner couldnt find a Columbia police department in Lexington County, not knowing a small part of the city of Columbia  where Roof was arrested  lies in neighboring Columbia County. Meanwhile, three days passed, allowing Roof to return and purchase the gun as a default proceed. We are all sick this happened, FBI Director James Comey said, we wish we could turn back time. From this vantage point, everything seems obvious.

The default proceed loophole was made possible by a last minute amendment added to the 1993 Brady Act by Congressman George Gekas, a Republican from Pennsylvania. The FBI has since suggested that more time be allotted to investigate delayed transactions, but the law remains unchanged. In response to questions about how NICS accommodates the three-day delay, FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer wrote in an email that the FBI continues the ongoing hiring initiative to increase the staff for the NICS section.

Following the shooting in South Carolina, Democratic Congressmen James Clyburn introduced the Background Check Completion Act, proposing the elimination of the three-day loophole. And Hillary Clinton went a step further Monday, discussing the possibility of exercising executive action to close the loophole if elected president.

While there has been no change at the federal level, several states and the District of Columbia have extended the three-day rule. In Tennessee, for instance, examiners are given 15 calendar days to examine the buyers background before a default proceed.

Some vendors have gone even further to close this loophole. Two years after a 2000 FBI report found that delayed background checks are 20 times more likely to be denied, Walmart refused to sell any firearm without a completed background check. But few other chains have adopted a dont know, dont sell policy.

time.com,2016-03-07 14:38:02,Surprise Medical Bills,['Haley Sweetland Edwards'],"



Almost exactly a year ago, John Elfrank-Dana, a 58-year-old father of three, slipped on the steps of a New York subway, slammed his skull on the metal and concrete, and was launched into what can only be understood as the seventh circle of modern medical billing hell.

As a public school teacher in New York City, Elfrank-Dana gets his medical insurance through the districts Emblem plan. He pays a small premium each month and, like the rest of us, thought that meant he was covered in the event of an emergency. He would pay his deductibleand the insurance would pick the rest, right?

But that, Elfrank-Dana quickly discovered, is not how it actually works.

Five weeks after sustaining that head injury, Elfrank-Dana started feeling dizzy, checked into the nearest emergency room in Bergen County, New Jersey, and was rushed in for a craniotomy, a surgical procedure that removes part of the skull. After that, the hospital visits started piling up. He was treated for a fistula, then another surgery to drain the blood from his head again, then a series of appointments to address a brain infection related to the original craniotomy. It just never ended.

At one point in that nightmare, the medical bills started rolling in. A few thousand here. Ten thousand there. Twenty-two thousand more. By end of the year, Elfrank-Dana was staring down roughly $106,000 in medical bills. And none of it was covered by his insurance.

My insurance had made payments to the hospital and anesthesiologist but it was a fraction of what they were asking, Elfrank-Dana told TIME recently. So they started going after me for the balance.

While Elfrank-Dana didnt know it at the time, he had become the latest victim of what is known, aptly, as surprise medical bills. They arise when what an insurer pays a provider doesnt match up with what a doctor, physicians group or out-of-network hospital actually charges. It happens all the time.

According to a 2015 survey by Consumer Reports, surprise medical bills are extremely common. An estimated 1 in 3 American adults with private health insurance fell victim to a surprise medical bill in the past two years.

This weeks TIME magazine has a feature, The Hidden Cost of Surprise Medical Bills, describing the problem, its causes, and solutions, an includes more stories from people like Elfrank-Dana. Heres the Cliffs Notes version.

Surprise medical bills happen most often when a hospital contracts with medical providersincluding doctors, surgeons, anesthesiologists, lab techniciansthat do not accept the same insurance plans that the hospital does. That means that patients, like Elfrank-Dana, can walk into an in-network hospital, see an in-network doctor, and suddenly find himself on the hook for thousands of dollars anyway, just because he inadvertently received care from a provider, such as a lab technician or physician, who was out-of-network.

Surprise medical bill are especially common in emergency rooms and surgical theaters. Often, a patient will go in for a procedure with an in-network surgeon at in-network hospital, but then wake up from anesthesia to discover that, at some point, an out-of-network physician had popped into the room to provide a consultation or help with the surgery. And when that happens? Boom: the patient receives an out-of-network bill.

The whole problem of surprise medical bills arises from the convoluted way that medical billing works in this country. As it is, an insurance company, like Emblem or Blue Cross Blue Shield, negotiates a set of repayment rates with hospitals and medical providers, which they then list as in network. If a hospital or physicians group refuses to accept the insurance companys repayment ratesoften because theyre too lowthen those providers are listed as out-of-network.

But heres where it gets complicated. Often times, an insurance company will successfully negotiate with a hospital, but the hospital will then turn around and sign a sole contract with a group of, say, anesthesiologists or surgeons, who do not accept that same type of insurance.

That puts the patient in the awkward middle. A patients insurance covers all in-network costs after the patient reaches his deductible, but meanwhile, the patient himself is receiving bills from any and every out-of-network provider that contributed to his care. In many cases, insurance plans pay just a small percentage of such out-of-network bills, or nothing at all.

Obamacare was supposed to fix these sorts of problems, and the 2010 law does go part of the way there. But it leaves open two big loopholes.

The first has to do with emergency medical care. Under Obamacare, Americans dont have to worry about whether the nearest hospital is in-network or out-of-network. During medical emergencies, insurance companies are required to bill patients as if the hospital where they end up is in-network, even if its not. That means that if a patient usually pays a 20% co-pay for care at an in-network facility and 80% for care at an out-of-network facility, the insurers must abide by the 20% in-network co-pay.

Thats a huge step in the right direction, but it still leaves patients wide open to surprise bills. After all, theres nothing stopping any out-of-network medical provider at that hospital, including emergency room doctors, from sending patients a separate bill later, charging them for whatever their insurance company didnt cover. Thats what happened to Elfrank-Dana.

The second issue has to do with the total amount that patients can be charged out-of-pocket. Under Obamacare, insurers are required to cap out-of-pocket payments at $6,850 (and $13,700 for families). Again, thats progress. But those caps only include in-network care. If a patient like Elfrank-Dana reaches the $6,850 cap, but then receives $80,000 in surprise, out-of-network bills, after leaving the hospital, then, well, hes out of luck.

The big question on most peoples mind is whos to blame. And the answer is a political hot potato: if you pass a law that prohibits saddling patients with surprise bills, then someone else is going to be on the hook. And that someone else will be one of the three most powerful players in the American medical industry: insurance companies, hospitals and the physicians lobby. None of them want to be left holding the bag.

Jay Kaplan, the president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, says his heart goes out to patients, who he and his association work with on a person-to-person basis. We want patients out of the middle as much as everybody does, he told TIME recently. He puts the onus on insurers to offer higher reimbursement rates, in order to include more providers in-network. Insurance companies use their own black box database to determine how much theyre going to repay physicians, he says, and often times, those reimbursement rates are just not enough for doctors to accept them.

Tom Nickels, an executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, agrees: it should be the insurance companies that pay more, expand their networks, and eliminate the problem.

Insurance companies, meanwhile, say thats not realistic. Insurers already offer medical providers reimbursement rates that are as high as possible, while keeping costs for consumersyou, me, our employersare low as possible, said Clare Krusing, who represents Americas Health Insurance Plans. If insurers began paying doctors and hospitals as much as they asked for, insurance premiums would spike.

Providers that choose not to participate in a network plan have a variety of reasons, the main one being that they want to charge higher rates for their services, Krusing told TIME. When you have a pricing structure like that that, patients are being asked to write a blank check.

According to the 2015 Medscape survey, the average compensation for $284,000 for specialists and $195,000 for primacy care doctors. Average salaries have increased modestly but consistently since the passage of Obamacare in 2010. Emergency room physicians made a mean salary of $306,000 in 2015, up from $270,000 in 2013.

A year after his accident, Elfrank-Dana says his billing saga continues. His insurance company and the surgeon at the New Jersey hospital eventually reached a settlement totaling about $56,000, but hes still on the hook for roughly $50,000 more for both the hospital bill and the anesthesiologist. He recently got help from a consumer rights advocate and a billing secretary at a New York-based hospital, both of whom are coaching him, he says, on how to fight the charges. Despite two brain surgeries, Elfrank-Dana said that by last September, he started firing off one letter a day.

Its so hard figuring out whos the bad guy, he added. I know some people who take out a second mortgage to pay for these kinds of bills. For me, if I paid these bills, it would deplete my college savings for my kids. And I was saving for half of state school tuition for three kids. Thats the opportunity cost here. It makes me all the more indignant.",[]

A school district in Newark, N.J. is shutting off its water fountains after testing found lead in building drinking water, according to state health officials.

Drinking water at 30 schools in Newark tested positive for levels of lead higher than the federal standard, according to a joint announcement from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the Newark Public Schools. The Environmental Protection Agencys action level for lead, the threshold requiring additional action, is 15 parts per billion and drinking water in Newarks schools ranged from 16-558 ppb.

Of the some 300 water samples taken from the Newark school buildings, 59 were above the EPAs action levels for testing and no building had more than four samples above the action level. The water in Newarks schools is nowhere near some of the high levels of lead in Flint, Michiganone home there tested as high as 13,200 ppb.

During Wednesday nights Democratic debate, Bernie Sanders opened up an old line of attack against Hillary Clinton.

The Vermont Senator harkened back to one of Clintons stumbles from her 2008 campaign about whether undocumented immigrants should be able to get drivers licenses.

When we talk about efforts to assist immigrants, Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the Governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, who wanted to do the right thing and provide drivers licenses to those who are undocumented. She said dont do it, and New York State still does not do it.

In Vermont by the way, I worked with officials, and undocumented people in Vermont do have the ability to get drivers licenses, he continued.



When he invoked the license issue, Sanders was referencing a moment during a Democratic debate in 2007 when the moderators were unable to pin Clinton down on her views on whether or not to give undocumented immigrants drivers licenses.

After defending the reasoning behind Spitzers bill, Clinton said, I did not say that it should be done, but I certainly recognize why Governor Spitzer is trying to do it. When the moderators continued pressing her on giving a yes or no answer, she replied, This is where everybody plays gotcha, and still refused to answer directly.

Clinton later came out against drivers licenses for the undocumented. But in her current campaign, she has taken has taken a firm stance this election cycle in favor of them.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz went to Florida Sen. Marco Rubios hometown Wednesday to announce the endorsement of former HP CEO Carly Fiorina. Speaking at Miami-Dade College, just steps from where his rival announced his presidential campaign, Cruz timed the surprise as gut-punch to a flailing rival, not as a tactic to win Floridas 99 delegates, which almost certainly remain out of his reach.

Hurting Rubio is also why Cruz has opened 10 field offices in the state and on the heels of a seven-figure investment from Cruzs super PAC on Florida airwaves. On its surface, the spending is unremarkablea fraction of what it takes to make a significant difference in the statebut it flies in the face of the GOP establishments best-laid plans to trip-up Donald Trump.

Its chess, not checkers, says one Cruz strategist, surveying what remains of the field. Its not only about stopping Trump, its about making Ted Cruz president, said another.

Read More: Donald Trump Tries to Close the Deal in Florida

Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney laid out the case last week in Utah, encouraging Republicans to vote for the best-positioned Trump alternative in their given state. The goal, argued Romney, was not to elect another candidate, but to simply deny Trump delegates. In Florida, the candidate for achieving that goal is undoubtedly Rubio, the home state senator who sits in second place. A vote for Cruz is a vote for Donald Trump, Rubios campaign repeated on loop in Florida, as donors and anti-Trump operatives privately fretted on that same concern.

And though he is claiming hes competing hard to win Florida, Cruz is way back in third place, without any real hope of picking up delegates in the winner-take-all state. If many in the anti-Trump movement had their way, Cruz would shift his Sunshine State support to Rubio to bolster the chances of keeping the bombastic front-runner from securing the state, or at least refrain from actively trying to block Rubios path.

But thats not the Cruz way.

A deeply strategic thinker with a penchant for taking stiff gambles, Cruz is working to craft an I win, or you lose choice for the Republican Partywhere after March 15th the GOP establishment that despises him will have to contend with rallying around him, or being stuck with Trump as its standard-bearer. The first step: Cruz needs to push Rubio out of the raceby handing Floridas delegates to Trump. Every dollar he spends in Florida is going to that goal. Its a high-stakes wager that could easily backfire, particularly if Trump uses a Florida win to secure a majority of delegates. Cruzs team believes the potential rewards outweigh the risk.

Cruz aides believe a three person race would swiftly yield a two-person contest, and even in it didnt, that their 300-delegate lead on Ohio Gov. John Kasich would effectively make it one. Kasich faces his own make-or-break moment in Ohio, where he is fighting to deny Trump the Buckeye delegates.

Underpinning the strategy are surveys showing Cruz resoundingly defeats Trump in a two-person race if Trump does not win the nomination outright. Despite the lack of any love lost between himself and the partys leadership in Washington, Cruz believes they will be forced to come around his way to keep their party intact. Cruzs path to securing 1,237 delegates to the convention for the first ballot is slim. But in forcing the party to choose between himself and Trump, Cruz is already seeing signs that his Sophies choice for the GOP establishment will pay off.

In recent weeks, senior Republican figures have starting coming to grips with needing to rally behind Cruz to stop Trump. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who mused openly about shooting Cruz on the Senate floor weeks ago, has capitulated on backing his rival, suggesting a Cruz/Rubio or a Cruz/Kasich ticketin that orderbe formed to stop Trump.

time.com,2016-03-10 06:41:24,The Republican Party Is No Longer the Party of Reagan,['Peter Wehner'],"



With the death on March 6 of a dignified First Ladyan influential cultural figure in her own right and the devoted keeper of her husbands flameboth Ronald and Nancy Reagan have now passed into history. Increasingly, it appears, the same can be said of the party they took such care in shaping.

The most obvious evidence of this is the rise of Donald Trump, a man who is the antithesis of so much that Ronald Reagan stood for: intellectual depth and philosophical consistency, respect for ideas and elevated rhetoric, civility and personal grace. The fact that Trump is the favorite to win the Republican presidential nomination shows how far the GOP has drifted from the animating spirit of the most consequential and revered Republican since Abraham Lincoln.



Trumps attempt at a hostile takeover is not a thunderclap on a cloudless day. It was years in the making. And when the mantle worn by Reagan might be settling on the likes of Trump, this end-of-an-era moment demands that we reflect on what has happened to our Republican Party.

For those of us open to such self-examinationto understanding what conditions gave rise to Trump and Trumpismthe explanation starts with certain harmful habits. These include employing apocalyptic rhetoric, like the assertion that America is on the verge of becoming Nazi Germany. Such reckless language is evidence of fevered and disordered minds and paves the way for Trumps incendiary rhetoric.

But thats hardly the whole of it. Republicans embraced the political knife-fighting tactics of Newt Gingrich in the 1990s and light-as-air political figures like Sarah Palin in the 2000s. Many Republicansincluding self-proclaimed constitutional conservativesbegan to speak of compromise as a synonym for capitulation, which is odd given that the Constitution itself was the result of a whole series of accommodationsand Reagan was a gifted compromiser. (In the debate over the Constitution, there was even a deal struck that came to be known as the Great Compromise, by which every state was to have two members in the U.S. Senate, offsetting proportional representation in the House.) Republicans became suspicious too of the spirit of moderation that James Madison argued is essential in understanding which measures are in the public good. What many modern Republicans are looking for is conflict, confrontation, the politics of the cage match.

At some point along the way, it became fashionable in the Republican Partyin some quarters, anywayto replace reason with rage, to deny science when it was at odds with ideology and to cheer mindless stunts like shutting down the federal government rather than responsibly managing and relimiting it.

Voters are complicit in this too; many of them have come to confuse cruelty, vulgarity and bluster with strength and straight talk. And Republican lawmakers compounded a problem they had promised to solve, promoting rather than ending corporate welfare and crony capitalism.

Theres another explanation as wellpolitical and intellectual sclerosis, by which I mean the failure to apply enduring principles to changing circumstances. This is something that Reagan did quite well. He developed a policy agendaon taxes, monetary policy and regulationsthat addressed the problems of his era, including high inflation, high interest rates and high unemployment. He understood the hardships facing ordinary Americans. He gave voice to them. And he offered concrete solutions to them. He adjusted to the realities of his time.

Ronald Reagans heirs have been decidedly less skilled at doing so.

One reason for this is that Reagan was so successful. The shadow he cast was so large that many of the Republicans who followed him could not escape it. For them, every year was 1981. Every problem could be solved by simplistically applying Reagans policy to it, even if the situations were not remotely comparable. (When Reagan took office, the inflation rate was in the double digits. Today it is less than 2%.) Republicans became uncreative and intellectually lazy. They placed themselves in an ideological straitjacket, trying to be more Reagan than Reagan (for example, promising they would not raise any taxes under any conditions for any amount of spending cuts). In the process, they became captive to the past.

As a result, too many Republicans lost touch with ordinary Americans. They had almost nothing to say about wage stagnation, the struggles of working-class Americans, the lack of social mobility, soaring tuition and health care costs, and how to extend health insurance to the uninsured. They were unable to explain, let alone address, huge structural changes caused by globalization, advances in technology and automation, which had harsh effects on low-skill workers. Blue collar Americans in particular felt unheard, ignored, abandoned.

Out of all this has emerged an opportunistic populist by the name of Trump.

Its still too early to know what will come of all this. If Trump wins the nomination, he will go some distance toward undoing the influence of Reagan on the modern Republican Partyon policies like trade and immigration, in its commitment to limited government and cultural renewal, and in its concern for justice. Just as significant would be the dramatic change in tone, countenance and ethos. We are in the process of seeing the grace and joie de vivre of Reagan replaced by the crass and cruel insults, the obsessive Twitter attacks and the vindictiveness of Trump. The party of Lincoln and Reagan would be led by a man who embraces, at least in part, the ethics of Nietzsche.

Trump still has a ways to go before securing the nomination. (To date, roughly two-thirds of Republican primary voters are voting against him.) Yet even if he succeeds, many of us who are children of the Reagan revolution will not go gently into the good night. We will not vote for Trump under any circumstances, even if he is the nominee; whats more, we will do everything in our power to reclaim the Republican Party from this demagogic and authoritarian figure.

This does not mean the mechanical imposition of Reagan-era policies, but it does mean being guided by conservative principles that seek to limit the size and reach of the state, that take into account human nature, defend human dignity and promote human flourishing. It means articulating an enduring vision of a limited government sustaining the space for society to thrive in an age of social fragmentation and weakening institutions, in the words of Yuval Levin, whose forthcoming book The Fractured Republic grapples with these issues. And just as important, it means recapturing the spirit of Reaganmaking our Republican Party a welcoming party once again, inclusive and open, united in its commitment to American ideals, hopeful about the future and attractive to working-class Americans. The kind of party, in other words, that Ronald and Nancy Reagan would be proud of.

At debates, Hillary Clinton often answers direct questions like an attorney chewing over a difficult legal brief, while Bernie Sanders sounds like hes writing a bumper sticker.

The two Democratic presidential candidates differ on issues from health care to immigration, and their disagreements show in the way they answer the thorny questions posed by debate moderators in the eight times theyve faced off.

Clinton, the Yale Law School graduate whose last job was as the nations top diplomat, tends to step lightly and avoid sweeping declarative statements that might cause trouble down the road. Sanders, the former activist and longtime independent, embraces absolutes.

On health care, Clinton defends the tradeoffs of the Affordable Care Act and calls for strengthening the law through careful tweaks; Sanders supports universal health care for everyone. On trade, Clinton wants to look carefully at future trade deals before deciding and restructure the tax code to discourage corporate inversions; Sanders opposes free trade deals.

The difference was highlighted again Wednesday as the two met in Miami for a debate co-hosted by CNN and Spanish-language network Univision. Moderator Jorge Ramos attempted four times to pin down Clinton on whether she would deport undocumented children.

Will you deport children? Ramos asked Clinton.

Let me say this. I would give every person, but particularly children, due process to have their story told. And a lot of children will, of course, have very legitimate stories under our law to be able to stay, Clinton said before several rounds of questioning, as she explained she would deport criminals and push for comprehensive immigration reform. Clinton finally answered, I will not, before ending on a slightly ambiguous note: I do not want to see them deported, she said of the undocumented.

But when it was Sanders turn, his answer would fit in a tweet. No, I will not deport children from the United States of America, he said.

The differences stem in large part from their backgrounds. As First Lady, U.S. Senator and Secretary of State, Clinton has been at center stage of national politics, absorbing body blows of criticism for her views since 1992, while Sanders has represented the nations second-smallest state as an independent as a U.S. Representative and then Senator during that same time period. She has learned to temper criticism by couching everything in nuance, while Sanders drew more attention for making provocative arguments.

The two are also waging very different campaigns. Clinton has played the cautious frontrunner, eager to get through the primary fight without committing herself to positions that would hurt her in the fall against a Republican opponent. Sanders, meantime, is cast in the role of the underdog with nothing to lose, attempting to change the terms of the debate by staking out bold positions.

The difference showed up at Sundays debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Michigan. The two Democratic contenders were asked whether they support fracking as a method of removing natural gas from the ground. Clinton delivered a nuanced answer explaining that she opposes it unless it meets strict conditions. She showed an understanding of methane release, the chemicals used in fracking and various regulations on the practice.

Her final answer? Its complicated. By the time we get through all my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place, Clinton said.

Sanders did not hesitate. My answer is a lot shorter, Sanders said. No, I do not support fracking.

The difference came up again at Wednesdays debate. Clinton has proposed making college debt-free, a plan that would involve giving grants to states to lower costs and allowing students to refinance their loans, among other measures. Sanders, on the other hand, has proposed eliminating tuition at public colleges altogether.

I do believe we should make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and I dont believe we should punish millions of young and not-so-young people with outrageous levels of student debt, Sanders said during the debate.

When Sanders was asked directly if he would allow even real estate mogul Donald Trumps children to go to college for free under his plana criticism Clinton often levels at himhe answered unequivocally with a single word.

Absolutely! he said.",[]
time.com,2016-03-10 06:41:30,Donald Trump Distracted the Media from John Kasich,['Joe Klein'],"



On the day before the Michigan primary, when there still seemed a glimmer of a sliver of a possibility that John Kasich might emerge as the sane Republican alternative to Donald Trump, the governor of Ohio was having fun at a town meeting in Monroe, Mich. He barged into the middle of his wife Karens attempt to introduce him. What did you just say? the candidate asked, looking, as usual, as if hed just gotten out of bed. Shed just said that they smiled and laughed every day. And now she added, You smiled at me this morning. He said that was only because she had shared a box of chocolate-covered cherries with him. My staff knows, he went on, I never share.



With the casual, slightly goofy tone established, Kasich set off on one of his magical mystery toursIve never seen him give the same speech twicewhich included this response to a question about immigration: Im in favor of building the Ohio-Michigan border fence, he said. I need to protect the Ohio-speaking people.

I thought about the modest chocolate cherry on election night, watching Donald Trump celebrate his victories surrounded by heaping platters of Trump steaks, bottles of Trump wine and Trump water and copies of Trump magazineand a slew of Trump flunkies, society folks, members of his Jupiter, Fla., country club, including the golf clubs champion. Trump admitted that hed won some club championships too, which had prepared him for ... the presidency, because you gotta know how to close.

Kasich and Trump are the two great political performance artists this year, and they are night and day. Trumps speeches are all about him: his polls, his edifices, his steaks. Kasichs speeches are about the audience. He encourages people to tell their stories. Often, these have little or nothing to do with politics. After Monroe, in Grosse Pointe Woods, he was riding a favorite hobbyhorse, about how spending a year or two in community college on the way to a four-year degree could save you a lot of money. Im doing that! interrupted 19-year-old Alexa Kelly, who also admitted that she had lost some family members last summer and had been very depressed. What you said before about getting help [if youre feeling all alone], that really works. Cue hug, applause, tears.

What Kasich is doing is so unusual that its taken some time for the public to catch on, in large part because we the media have been so caught up in Trumpery. Kasich is the least hortatory candidate in the race. You listen to Hillary Clinton making grand pronouncementsAnd isnt it about time that we had equal pay for women?and you cringe: Yeah, of course, it is ... but why are you yelling at me? Yelling is what politicians did before there were microphones.

Kasich rarely raises his voice. He tosses off casual admissions of failure. Michigan has a lower income tax than we [in Ohio] do, he said in Monroe, and its killing me. He has the substantive side of the campaign coveredand occasionally, his offhand insights can be striking. Talking about Trumps wild threats and promises, he mused in Monroe, Most of the things that people like to hear, they know theyre never going to happen. They just like to hear them.

In the days before the Michigan primary, there were portents of a Kasich breakthrough. An NBC poll showed him doubling his strength nationally, leaping past Marco Rubio, whose collapsing campaign offered Kasich space to run as the moderate alternative to Trump. A strong second-place finish in Michigan might open the door to a victory in Ohio. But Kasich finished third, behind Ted Cruz. It was an improvement, and victory in Ohio seemed possible, but Trumps wins in Michigan and Mississippi, the relentless quality of his juggernaut, made the quixotic nature of Kasichs questand Cruzs, for that matterall the more obvious. (The governor of Ohio would have to be seen as a strong vice-presidential possibility, though.)

A few months ago, even before the voting began, Kasich was asked why he was still in the race, given his microscopic poll numbers. He shrugged and went off on one of his riffs, talking about how some candidates save the real truths for their concession speeches: And you ask yourself, Why couldnt he have said that stuff when he was running? Well, Kasich went on, he was trying to make every speech like thattell the truth, let the chips fall. In the months since, he has been as good as his word. And if and when he does drop out, the regrets should be all ours: What a fresh voice we have squandered.

time.com,2016-03-10 00:40:26,Aung San Suu Kyi Nominates Proxy President Htin Kyaw,['Simon Lewis'],"



Its now (almost) official: the icon of Burmas long struggle for democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi, will not be the countrys next president. But the Nobel Peace Prize winner, who spent much of the 1990s and 2000s confined to her lakeside villa in the former capital, Yangon, looks set to rule the country from behind the scenes, as a drawn out  but still remarkable  transition from military dictatorship continues.

Her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), on Thursday nominated Suu Kyis close aide  and former driver  Htin Kyaw to be the lower house of parliaments candidate in a complex presidential selection process over the coming days, the Associated Press reports. The party won a landslide election in November, securing almost four out of every five elected seats in the legislature  enough to make Htin Kyaw the president ahead of a military nominee.

The NLD-dominated upper chamber elected Henry Van Thio as a further nominee, AP said. A member of the Chin ethnic minority, he is expected serve as one of two vice presidents (the other will be the military nominee). His nomination is symbolic for the countrys ethnic minority groups, who make up more than a third of the population. The candidates still need to be approved to make sure they meet the criteria for president; the winner will assume the role of head of state at the start of April.

As expected, the primary criteria for the NLDs choice appears to have been loyalty to the party chairperson. Htin Kyaw serves as a senior executive at the charitable foundation that Suu Kyi runs in honor of her mother, and has pedigree in Burmas pro-democracy movement. According to local magazine The Irrawaddy, Htin Kyaws father was a renowned poet who was elected as a lawmaker in the 1990 elections  which the NLD won, but the military junta ignored. His wife, Su Su Lwin, is a lawmaker for the NLD in the new parliament, and is the daughter of one of the partys founding members.

Htin Kyaw, believed to be 70 years old, is expected to play the role of a puppet president, with Suu Kyi pulling the strings.

Novembers election, while the freest and fairest in the countrys modern history, took place within limitations set by the generals of the former junta, who forced through a new constitution in 2008 via a rigged plebiscite. While a new set of lawmakers took their seats in parliament last month, they were joined by a contingent of military officials dressed in fatigues, since the charter gives the commander-in-chief the right to select 25% of MPs (as well as one vice president and three key ministers).

Another obstacle built into the constitution is the rule that bars those with close family members of other nationalities from taking the top job. Suu Kyi and her late husband, a British scholar, had two sons, who are U.K. citizens.

The current military leadership rejected Suu Kyis last ditch attempt to reach a deal that would bypass the constitutional provision and allow the countrys most popular politician to assume the presidency. But Suu Kyi has been preparing for this eventuality. Shortly before the election, she told reporters the constitutional clause wont stop me from making all the decisions as the leader of the winning party. She would be above the president, she said.

The idea of a proxy leadership has been tried elsewhere in Asia. Indias Congress party chairperson Sonia Gandhi selected Manmohan Singh to become prime minister after 2004 elections. In Thailand, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra went into exile avoiding a conviction for corruption, only for his younger sister, Yingluck, to be elected later by his supporters. In both cases, the administrations have since been kicked out of office  in Indias case at the polling booth and in Thailands by a coup.

But many Burmese are positive that such an arrangement can work. Given that the president and cabinet are ultimately being appointed by Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD leadership, the mechanics of a proxy presidency are not necessarily as complicated as some may make it out to be, Nyantha Maw Lin, managing director at advisory firm Vriens and Partners in Burma, told TIME.

However, he said, the real challenge will be dealing with the military, which retains a significant role across the political system. On one issue already  constitutional change  it is apparent that the NLD will likely have to play by the militarys sense of timing, Nyantha Maw Lin said. Both sides will need to find a model for cooperation given the stakes involved.

Burma has undergone a significant political and economic opening since a quasi-civilian regime, stacked with former generals, took power in 2011. Hundreds of political prisoners have been released and a vibrant press has been unleashed. But Suu Kyi, a former prisoner of conscience herself, will be taking over a system that has continued to stifle dissent. With military appointments running the defense, interior and border affairs ministries, the NLD-run government will be hamstrung, especially when it comes to dealing with the countrys long-running civil wars with ethnic armed groups, who still control swaths of territory along the borders.

She could move fast to amend abusive laws and release political prisoners, but she has little constitutional power to rein in the military and their ongoing abuses, or compel insurgents to end human rights violations, said David Mathieson, Human Rights Watchs senior Burma researcher.

The mostly-Buddhist country has also been wracked by anti-Muslim sentiment and outbreaks of violence in recent years, particularly in the western Rakhine state, where more than 1 million stateless Rohingya Muslims live. Challenging a pervasive Buddhist chauvinism should be a priority for Suu Kyi, but will likely not be on the agenda, he said. It would be too risky for her social and political capital to challenge ultranationalist monks or defend the Rohingya, Mathieson added.",[]
time.com,2016-03-10 00:27:49,Read the Full Text of the Eighth Debate,['Ryan Teague Beckwith'],"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders met for the eighth Democratic debate in Miami Wednesday.

Hosted by CNN and Univision at Miami Dade College, the debate focused on immigration issues but also touched on foreign policy, climate change and Wall Street reform.

The moderators were Univision anchors Maria Elena Salinas and Jorge Ramos and Washington Post reporter Karen Tumulty.

Here is a full transcript of the debate.

RAMOS: (SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

SALINAS (through translator): This will be the first and only debate the candidates will do, taking into account the millions of (inaudible) voters (inaudible) Univision News, together with the Washington Post.

RAMOS (through translator): Here with us tonight is Karen Tumulty, Washington Post correspondent (inaudible) specialized in national policy.

SALINAS: Welcome, Karen.

SALINAS (through translator): Now, were going to welcome the protagonists of this debate. First, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.

(APPLAUSE)

And Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.

(APPLAUSE)

Welcome to both of you. Thank you for being here.

(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

SALINAS (through translator): Welcome to both of you.

RAMOS (through translator): But before we continue, we want to welcome Sebastian de la Cruz (ph) who is going to sing the national anthem.

Sebastian, welcome. Good evening.

(STAR SPANGLED BANNER)

(APPLAUSE)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

SALINAS (through translator): Thank you for being with us. The Washington Post and Facebook, these are the results of this debate that the candidates have accepted. They will have 90 seconds to answer each question. When their rival mentions them in an answer, they will have 30 seconds to answer and another 30 seconds to answer questions, follow-up questions that we ask.

RAMOS (through translator): We will make our questions in English and they will be translated simultaneously into Spanish for our viewers. And right now, each one of them has one minute for your initial words. We begin with Secretary Clinton.

CLINTON: Thank you very much. Ive been looking forward to this debate, and I want to thank Univision, the Washington Post, Facebook and Miami-Dade College, the largest college in North America for hosting us here this evening.

(APPLAUSE)

And tonight I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how we knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead, starting with the economic ones. My focus is on more good paying jobs with rising incomes for families and how we prevent corporations from taking jobs out of our country by imposing an exit tax, making them pay back any tax breaks theyve gotten.

But we also need to be having a positive agenda for manufacturing. for small businesses and entrepreneurs, for more clean energy jobs. And I also look forward to discussing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship that will be one of my priorities in my first 100 days as president. And I will also be talking about education, every child deserves a good teacher and a good school.

SALINAS: Thank you, Secretary.

CLINTON: And so thank you for having us, and I look forward to the debate.

(APPLAUSE) SALINAS: Thank you. Senator Sanders, your opening remarks.

SANDERS: Thank you  thank you all very much. Im running for president of the United States because given the crises facing our country, it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.

Together were going to have to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Billionaires and Wall Street should not be buying elections. Weve got to end this rigged economy where people are working longer hours for low wages, almost all new income and wealth going to the top 1 percent, and of course, we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.

And here in Miami...

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: ... here in Miami as much as any city in America, we know that we have got to combat climate change, transform our energy system, and leave this planet in a way that is healthy and habitable for our kids and our grandchildren.

SALINAS: Thank you, Senator.

First question, Secretary, you have been starting to sound like the nominee lately, but many voters are saying, not so fast. Where did you fail last night in Michigan?

CLINTON: Well, look, I won one of the contests and lost another close one. I am continuing to work hard for every single vote across our country. I was pleased that I got 100,000 more votes last night than my opponent and more delegates.

So this is a marathon, and its a marathon that can only be carried out by the kind of inclusive campaign that Im running, a campaign that reaches out to everybody, a campaign that offers real positive solutions to the problems that we face, a campaign that is based on how together we can make progress, because I am a progressive who likes to get things done.

So Im excited about the upcoming contests, including right here in Florida. And well continue to work as hard as I can to earn the vote of every single voter.

SALINAS: What went wrong in Michigan?

(APPLAUSE)

SALINAS: What went wrong in Michigan? What went wrong in Michigan? What failed in Michigan specifically?

CLINTON: It was a very close race. Weve had some of those. Ive won some. Ive lost some. But, you know, I was very pleased by the overall outcome last night. And now were on to the states for next Tuesday and Im looking forward to campaigning hard in all of them.

SALINAS: Senator, aside from your astounding upset last night in Michigan, you are still far behind Secretary Clinton in delegate count. She has 1,221 delegates, including superdelegates, and you have 571. What is your pathway to make up the deficit, and can you realistically catch up?

SANDERS: Well, you know, when we began this campaign, I was 3% in the polls. I was probably 60 or 70 points behind the Secretary. We have come a long way in 10 months. We have won...

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: ... including Michigan last night, which some people,considered one of the major political upsets in modern American history. We have won nine state primaries and caucuses. And I believe that our message of the need for people to stand up and tell corporate America and Wall Street that they cannot have it all is resonating across this country.

And I think in the coming weeks and months, we are going to continue to do extremely well, win a number of these primaries, and convince superdelegates that Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Secretary Clinton, I want to disclose once again that my daughter Paula works for your campaign. And now I have a question about your emails. Your Republican opponents say that those emails have endangered our national security. When you were secretary of state, you wrote 104 emails in your private server that the government now says contain classified information according to The Washington Post analysis.

That goes against a memo that you personally sent to your employees in 2011 directing all of them to use official email, precisely because of security concerns. So it seems that you issued one set of rules for yourself and a different set of rules for the rest of the State Department.

So who specifically gave you permission to operate your email system as you did? Was it President Barack Obama? And would you drop out of the race if you get indicted?

CLINTON: Well, Jorge, theres a lot of questions in there. And Im going to give the same answer Ive been giving for many months. It wasnt the best choice. I made a mistake. It was not prohibited. It was not in any way disallowed. And as I have said and as now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing and many other people in the government. But heres the cut to the chase facts. I did not send or receive any emails marked classified at the time. What you are talking about is retroactive classification. And the reason that happens is when somebody asks or when you are asked to make information public, I asked all my emails to be made public. Then all the rest of the government gets to weigh in.

And some other parts of the government, were not exactly sure who, has concluded that some of the emails should be now retroactively classified. Theyve just said the same thing to former Secretary Colin Powell. They have said, were going to retroactively classify emails you sent personally.

CLINTON: Now I think he was right when he said this is an absurdity. And I think that what we have got here is a case of overclassification.

RAMOS: If we get your permission...

CLINTON: I am not concerned about it. I am not worried about it and no Democrat or American should be either.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Secretary Clinton, the questions were, who gave you permission to cooperate? Was it President Obama?

CLINTON: There was no permission to be asked. It had been done by my predecessors. It was permitted.

RAMOS: If you get indicted would you going to drop out?

CLINTON: Oh, for goodness  thats not going to happen. Im not even answering that question.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Senator Sanders, you have gone from saying the following, the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e- mails, to claiming that it is a very serious issue. Which is it?

SANDERS: There is a process under way, and that process will take its course. Today in America, the middle class is disappearing. We have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, climate change threatens the whole planet, 47 million people live in poverty. Im going to focus on the issues facing the working families of this country. That process specifically.

TUMULTY: Secretary Clinton, you have known Donald Trump a long time. You have seen what kind of campaign hes running. Secretary Clinton, is Donald Trump a racist?

CLINTON: Karen, Im going to follow my friend Senator Sanders model here. If Im so fortunate enough to be the Democratic nominee, there will be a lot of time to talk about him. I was the first one to call him out. I called him out when he was calling Mexicans rapists.

When he was engaging in rhetoric that I found deeply offensive. I said basta (ph), and I am pleased that others... (APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Others are also joining in making clear that his rhetoric, his demagoguery, his trafficking in prejudice and paranoia has no place in our political system. Especially from somebody running for president who couldnt decide whether or not to disavow the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke. So people can draw their own conclusions about him. I will just end by saying this. You dont make America great by getting rid of everything that made America great.

(APPLAUSE)

TUMULTY: Secretary Clinton, my question was about his character. And that is one of the primary things that Americans think about when they choose their next president. How would you describe the character of a person who has said the sorts of things he has about Mexican immigrants, about women, and who would ban people from entering this country based on their religion?

CLINTON: I think its un-American. I think what he has promoted is not at all in keeping with American values, Karen. And I am going to take every opportunity to criticize him, to raise those issues.

Im not going to engage in the kind of language that he uses. I think we can make the case against him if he is the nominee, by pointing out what he has said. What he claims to believe in The values hes promoting and I think thats a better way for the American people to draw their conclusions.

TUMULTY: Senator Sanders, do you think its fair to call Donald Trump a racist?

SANDERS: This is what I think. I think that the American people are never going to elect a president who insults Mexicans, who insults Muslims, who insults women, who insults African-Americans. And let us not forget that several years ago, Trump was in the middle of the so- called birther movement, trying to delegitimize the president of the United States of America.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: You know, I find it very interesting, Karen, my dad was born in Poland. I know a little bit about the immigrant experience. Nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate. Maybe it has something to do with the color of my skin.

(APPLAUSE)

TUMULTY: So what does that tell you about his character?

SANDERS: And I am very pleased  I am very pleased that I think in the last national poll that I saw, we were running 18 points ahead of Donald Trump.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: On (inaudible), people are talking about immigration, and this map shows where in the country they are talking about it the most.

Maria Elena?

SALINAS: So Secretary, I have a question for you. In 2003, you said on a radio show, specifically it was John Gamblings radio show in New York, that you were adamantly against illegal immigrants and that people have to stop employing illegal immigrants. Your new immigration plan is that you would expand President Obamas executive actions and that you would push for legislation that would include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

So, are you flip-flopping on this issue? Or are you pandering to Latinos, what some would call Hispandering?

(LAUGHTER)

CLINTON: In 2003, I sponsored the DREAMER (sic) Act. I sponsored I think in every Congress after that. I have been consistent and committed to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.

I think our best chance was in 2007, when Ted Kennedy led the charge on comprehensive immigration reform. We have Republican support. We had a president willing to sign it. I voted for that bill. Senator Sanders voted against it.

Just think, imagine where we would be today is we had achieved comprehensive immigration reform nine years ago. Imagine how much more secure families would be in our country, no longer fearing the deportation of a loved one; no longer fearing that they would be found out.

So I am staunchly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform and have been so over the course of my public career.

(APPLAUSE) SALINAS: Now, Senator Sanders, in 2007, you voted against immigration reform. You now say that it was because the bill had guestworker provisions which seemed semi-slavery. But back then, this is what you said to CNNs Lou Dobbs. Lets listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SANDERS: Poverty is increasing. And if wages are going down, I dont know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guestworkers who will work for lower wages than American workers and drive wages down even lower than they are right now.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

(CROSSTALK)

SALINAS: So, Senator, were you concerned with working conditions for guestworkers, or really because you think immigrants drive down wages and take jobs from Americans?

SANDERS: Well, you have guestworker programs that have been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center, one of the important institutions in this country who studies these issues, as guestworkers programs akin to slavery, where people came in. They were cheated. They were abused. They were humiliated. And if they stood up for their rights, they would be thrown out of the country.

Of course, that type of (inaudible) leads to a race to the bottom for all of our people. And I worked very hard on that issue. And of course, I supported the 2013 immigration reform bill. And what I believe right now is not only that we need comprehensive immigration reform, if the Congress does not do its job, as president of the United States I will use the executive powers of that office to do what has to be done, to do what President Obama did, and expand on that.

SALINAS: But if youre saying that you would...

(APPLAUSE)

... if youre saying that you would expand on the executive actions, how do you that theyre not going to end up in a legal battle just like Obamas executive actions?

SANDERS: Well, we do the best  we dont know. And I should also say with regard to that 2007 immigration bill, as you may know, LULAC, the major Hispanic organization in his country, also opposed that bill as did many other Latino organizations.

But to your point, we have to do the best we can. I applaud President Obama for his efforts on DAPA and DACA. And I think we have got to expand those efforts.

CLINTON: If I could...

(APPLAUSE) You know, I think its very hard to make the case that Ted Kennedy, Barack Obama, me, La Raza, United Farmworkers, Dolores Huerta, leaders of the Latino community, would have supported a bill that actually promoted modern slavery. That was one of the many excuses used not to vote for the 2007 bill.

And I will go back to what I said. If we had been able to get that passed, we would be so much further along now. Im committed to defending DAPA and DACA. Im committed to going even further to get more people deferred action, to go as far as I can under the law. And I am committed to introducing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship in the first 100 days of my presidency.

SALINAS: Secretary Sanders (sic). Senator, would you like to respond?

SANDERS: Well, when we talk about efforts to assist immigrants, Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Elliot Spitzer, who wanted to do the right thing and provide drivers license to these who were undocumented, she said dont do it, and New York State still does not do it. In Vermont, by the way, I worked with officials and undocumented people in Vermont do have the ability to get drivers license.

(APPLAUSE)

When we talk about immigration, the secretary will remember that one of the great tragedies, human tragedies of recent years is children came from Honduras where theres probably more violence than almost any place in this country, and they came into this country. And I said welcome those children into this country, Secretary Clinton said send them back. Thats a difference.

CLINTON: Let me  let me respond again because the misrepresentation cant go unanswered here.

First of all, that is something that is not fair about what I said. I did say we needed to be very concerned about little children coming to this country  on their own, very often  many of them not making it. And when they got here, they needed, as I have argued for, legal counsel, due process, to make a decision. We need to end private detention, we need to end family detention.

And in 2006, when Senator Sanders was running for the Senate from Vermont, he voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minute Men who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants.

So I think when you were running for the Senate, you made it clear by your vote, Senator, that you were going to stand with the Republicans. When you got to the Senate in 2007, one of the first things you did was vote against Ted Kennedys immigration reform which hed been working on for years before you ever arrived.

SALINAS: One last response.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Let me respond  let me respond to that.

SALINAS: Go ahead.

SANDERS: You know, Ted Kennedy was a very close friend of mine, and I served on the committee he chaired, the Health, Education, Labor Committee. And Ted Kennedy was kind enough to allow me to hold a hearing in 2008, I believe, in Congress, dealing with the plight of undocumented tomato pickers in Immokalee, Florida.

(APPLAUSE)

And I went there on my own. Wasnt an issue really for the state of Vermont to expose the horrendous working conditions and the semi slavery, if you like, that those workers lived under. And the result of that hearing and the work that many, many people did was to significantly improve the wages and working conditions of those workers.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Senator, Secretary, were going to take a break and well continue talking about immigration when we come back.

CLINTON: Great. Thank you.

RAMOS (through translator): So this is the moment of talking about deportations. Were going to immigrants.

SALINAS (through translator): (Inaudible) Facebook page (inaudible). Tell us what you think of the debate in the comment section. We will come back after the break.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

RAMOS (through translator): Were back to the Democratic debate.

Secretary Clinton, the last time we talked in January, in Iowa, I asked you if you could be the next deporting chief. And you told me, no, that you wouldnt be the next deporter in chief. However, you refused two times to say you would not deport children. This is what you said.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

RAMOS: And can you promise that you wont deport immigrants who dont have a criminal record?

CLINTON: Heres what I can promise Jorge, I can promise that I will do everything possible to provide due process.

RAMOS: But will you deport children?

CLINTON: Let me say this. I would give every person, but particularly children, due process to have their story told. And a lot of children will, of course, have very legitimate stories under our law to be able to stay.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

RAMOS: So secretary, you seem to be defending President Obamas deportation policy. And as you know, so far he has deported more than 2.5 million immigrants. So if you really dont want to be the next deporter in chief, can you promise tonight that you wont deport children and that you wont deport immigrants who dont have a criminal record and this time, could I get a yes or no answer?

CLINTON: Yes, you can because the question you were asking me were about children seeking asylum. And we have laws. That was the most critical thing I said. Under our laws. I would like to see those laws changed. I would like see added to them, a guaranteed counsel and other support for children.

CLINTON: But if you are asking about everyone who is already here, undocumented immigrants, the 11-12 million who are living here, my priorities are to deport violent criminals, terrorists, and anyone who threatens our safety. So I do not have the same policy as the current administration does. I think its important that we move to our comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, stop the raids, stop the round-ups, stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives, doing their jobs, and thats my priority.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: But again, yes or no, can you promise tonight that you wont deport children, children who are already here?

CLINTON: I will not deport children. I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family members either, Jorge. I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. Thats a relatively small universe.

RAMOS: OK. So I want to be very specific. So you are telling us tonight that if you become president you wont deport children who are already here?

CLINTON: I will not.

RAMOS: And that you wont deport immigrants who dont have a criminal record?

CLINTON: Thats what Im telling you. Now I dont want  because Im not contradicting what I told you in the interview. Asylum is a particular legal process. Id like to see it changed. Id like to see us give more support to people who come fleeing the terrible violence that they do. But under our law, we have a process we have to go through which is different.

RAMOS: So you will stop those deportations.

CLINTON: I would stop...

RAMOS: The deportations for children...

CLINTON: Yes.

RAMOS: ... and those who dont have a criminal record. CLINTON: Of the people, the undocumented people living in our country, I do not want to see them deported. I want to see them on a path to citizenship. That is exactly what I will do.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Senator Sanders, would you  can you promise us tonight that you wont deport children?

SANDERS: Let me just say this. I dont think that the secretary fully answered your question, and I think the proof may be in the pudding. Honduras and that region of the world may be the most violent region in our hemisphere. Gang lords, vicious people torturing people, doing horrible things to families. Children fled that part of the world to try, try, try, try, maybe, to meet up with their family members in this country, taking a route that was horrific, trying to start a new life.

Secretary Clinton did not support those children coming into this country. I did.

Now I happen to agree with President Obama on many, many issues. I think he has done a great job as president of the United States. He is wrong on this issue of deportation. I disagree with him on that.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: So to answer your question, no, I will not deport children from the United States of America.

RAMOS: And can you promise not to deport immigrants who dont have a criminal record?

SANDERS: I can make that promise.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: This is why I go back to that 2007 vote because if we had been successful then, a lot of the issues we are still discussing today would be in the rear-view mirror. I want us to be able to achieve comprehensive immigration reform if Im so fortunate enough to be president. And we do have to take a look at asylum laws.

When I was secretary of state, I worked to try to support many different approaches to ending the violence in Central America. I was there meeting with leaders, security leaders, and others. And I think the Congress should support the presidents request to fund programs that would protect people and change the culture of criminality and violence in Central America, helping people be able to stay safely in their homes and countries.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERFS: Let me just answer, I want to get back to this 2007 immigration bill. Its true, Ted Kennedy, a good friend of mine, and I think of the secretarys, did work very hard on that bill. But does anyone really believe that if that bill was all so good, as the secretary is touting, that LULAC and other major Latino organizations, the largest Latino organizations in this country said no to that bill.

And I worked very hard in improving the guest worker provisions so that in 2013 a bill I strongly supported, people who were in the guest worker program in America would not be treated like slaves.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Let me just conclude by saying that United Farm Workers considered that bill in their words the last best hope for farm workers and immigrants.

They have proven to be right in the succeeding years. I only hope that we can put together a coalition to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the next Congress. And as I said earlier, in 2006, Senator Sanders supported indefinite detention for people facing deportation...

SANDERS: Its...

CLINTON: ...and stood with the Minutemen vigilantes in their ridiculous, absurd efforts to, quote, hunt down immigrants.

So look, I think the goal here is to elect a Democratic Senate, elect a Democratic president and get to work immediately to get comprehensive immigration reform.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Did you support the Minutemen, Senator? Did you support the Minutemen?

SANDERS: Im sorry?

RAMOS: Did you support the Minutemen, as Secretary Clinton has said?

SANDERS: Of course not. There was a piece of legislation supported by dozens and dozens of members of the House which codified existing legislation. What the secretary is doing tonight and has done very often is take large pieces of legislation and take pieces out of it.

No, I did not oppose the bailout or the support of the automobile industry. No, I do not support vigilantes, and that is a horrific statement, an unfair statement to make.

(APPLAUSE)

I will stand (inaudible) of my career, political career fighting for workers, fighting for the poorest people in this country. Madame Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week. (APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Well, lets do that. Lets talk about that. Lets talk about that.

RAMOS: Secretary, you said this morning...

CLINTON: Lets talk about the auto bailout because I think its important for people to understand what happened. In December of 2008, we were both in the Senate, there was a vote on a free-standing bill to rescue the auto industry. We both voted for it. was the right vote. Unfortunately, it did not succeed. The Republicans marshalled the votes against it.

A month later, in January, a new piece of legislation was offered that contained the money that would be used for the auto rescue. Then President-elect Obama  before hed even been sworn in  sent word to all of us that he really hoped we would support it. He was still in the Senate, I was still in the Senate.

And I voted for it. It was a hard vote. Ill tell you, it was a hard vote. A lot of the votes you make are hard votes. But the fact is the money that rescued the auto industry was in that bill.

SALINAS: Secretary...

CLINTON: Now, Senator Sanders voted against it. Thats his perfect right to vote against it. But if everyone had voted as he voted...

RAMOS: OK, Senator.

SANDERS: Yeah, let me...

CLINTON: ... we would not have rescued the auto industry.

RAMOS: You have 30 seconds and then well pass to another. Thirty more seconds and then well move to another...

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Let me  lets  so that everybody knows, the bill that Secretary Clinton is talking about, that is  that was the bailout of the recklessness, irresponsibility and illegal behavior of Wall Street. It was the Wall Street bailout.

(APPLAUSE)

And I find it interesting that when Secretary Clinton, who was the former senator of New York, of course, when she defended her vote, she said, well, its going to help the big banks in New York. Those are my constituents. And then you go to Detroit and suddenly this legislation helps the automobile workers. There was an article just yesterday...

SALINAS: Your time is up, Senator. SANDERS: ... where people like Senator Bayh and Ron Wyden, Byron Dorgan...

SALINAS: Senator  your time is up, Senator.

SANDERS: ...former senators said, no, this wasnt the automobile bailout. It was the bailout of Wall Street.

RAMOS: Thank you.

SALINAS: We have to move on. Senator, the time is up. We have to move on.

(APPLAUSE)

Next question. Secretary Clinton, you recently said instead of building walls we need to tear down barriers. However, last November in New Hampshire, you openly said that as senator you voted numerous times to build the wall with Mexico. Whats the difference between what you did, voting to build the wall, and what Donald Trump wants to do now?

CLINTON: Well, I think both of us, both Senator Sanders and I, voted numerous times to enhance border security along our border. We increased the number of border security agents. We did vote for money to build a fence, a pedestrian fence in some place, a vehicle fence in other places. And the result is that we have the most secure border weve ever had.

Apprehensions coming across the border are the lowest theyve been in 40 years, which just strengthens my argument that now its time to do comprehensive immigration reform.

CLINTON: The Republicans, the opponents no longer have an argument. And certainly, we hear a lot coming from the Republican side that is absolutely out of touch with reality. We raised money through the congressional appropriations process. We enhanced the border security. That part of the work is done.

Everybody that I know has looked at it said, okay, we have a secure border. Theres no need for this rhetoric and demagoguery thats still is carried out on the Republican side. Youve run out of excuses. Lets move to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. And I think that makes a very strong argument in favor of doing it.

SALINAS: But the question is, what is the difference between the wall that you voted for and Donald Trumps wall?

CLINTON: Its a big difference. First of all, as I understand him, hes talking about a very tall wall.

(LAUGHTER)

Right? A beautiful tall wall. The most beautiful tall wall, better than the Great Wall of China, that would run the entire border. That he would somehow magically get the Mexican government to pay for. And, you know, its just fantasy. And in fact, if he cared to know anything about what members of Congress, like the senator and I have done, where it was necessary, we did support some fencing.

Where it was necessary, we did add border patrol agents. We have done what by any fair estimate would have to conclude is a good job, quote, securing the border. So lets get about the business of comprehensive immigration reform.

SANDERS: Let me just say...

SALINAS: Senator...

SANDERS: I think the secretary and I mostly, I think, agree on this issue. Look, in this country, immigration reform is a very hot debate. Its divided the country. But I would hope very much, that as we have that debate, we do not, as Donald Trump and others have done, resort to racism and xenophobia and bigotry.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: This idea of suddenly, one day or maybe a night, rounding up 11 million people and taking them outside of this country is a vulgar, absurd idea that I would hope very few people in America support.

TUMULTY: Your time is up, senator. Thank you.

SALINAS: Now we have a question from the audience for both of you.

QUESTION (through translator): We have a question from the public. I want to go to Lucia Aquiette (ph). Shes an immigrant from Guatemala, shes here with her five children who have not seen their father since he was deported three years ago. She has a question for both of you.

QUESTION (through translator): I would like to ask  me and my children  hardworking men in the field  (inaudible).

QUESTION: Senator Sanders, as you can see, these are a very painful and personal issue for Lucia and her family. She wants to know what you would do to stop deportations, but most importantly, to reunite families like hers.

SANDERS: Well, I absolutely support that. At the heart of my immigration policy and I should say that the New York times editorial board called my immigration policy the most progressive and the strongest of any candidate running.

But to answer your question, the essence of what we are trying to do is to unite families, not to divide families.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: The idea that a mother is living here and her children are on the other side of the border is wrong and immoral. A number of months ago, I talked to a young man who was serving in the United States military and while he was serving in the military, his wife was deported.

That is beyond comprehension and policies that should not be allowed to exist. So, maam, I will do everything that I can to unite your family. Your children deserve to be with their mother.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Thank you Senator Sanders.

QUESTION (through translator): Secretary Clinton, youve also said you want to stop deportations. But whats your plan to reunite families and thousands of children, U.S. citizens, with their parents?

CLINTON: First of all, please know how brave I think you are, coming here with your children to tell your story. This is an incredible act of courage that Im not sure many people really understand. And I want you to know that in the work that Ive done and the many families that Ive met, I have heard similar stories like yours, where your husband is deported. Your childrens father is gone.

You are doing your very best to support your children. But it is time to bring families together. And I dont think theres any doubt that we must do more to let stories like yours be heard more widely so that more Americans know what the human cost of these policies are.

And I will do everything I can to prevent other families from facing what you are facing. And I will do everything I can to pass laws that would bring families back together. And I hope that your children are all either citizens born in this country or eligible for the programs that President Obama has put into place, DACA and DAPA, because I will defend those and I will absolutely protect your children, yourself, and try to bring your family back together.

(APPLAUSE)

QUESTION: Secretary Clinton, thank you.

Secretary Clinton, they are U.S. citizens (inaudible).

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you.

Now lets go back to Karen.

TUMULTY: Thank you, Enrique.

Secretary Clinton, a Washington Post poll just yesterday found that only 37 percent of Americans consider you honest and trustworthy. Now, when youve been asked about this in the past, you have said that this is the result of many, many years of Republican attacks upon you. But Americans have also had 25  more than that  years to get to know you for themselves.

Is there anything in your own actions and the decisions that you yourself have made that would foster this kind of mistrust?

CLINTON: Well, first Karen, obviously its painful for me to hear that. And I do take responsibility. When youre in public life, even if you believe that its not an opinion that you think is fair or founded, you do have to take responsibility. And I do.

And I also have, you know, very much committed to the best of my ability my energies and efforts to helping people. Thats something that I care deeply about. And I will continue to do that, to demonstrate by my past actions and my present levels of commitment and plans that people can count on me.

That is certainly what happened to me in New York, where people got to know me. They saw me in action. And they did.

Look, I have said before and it wont surprise anybody to hear me say it, this is not easy for me. Its not easy to do what I think is right, to help people, to even the odds, to hear a story like the womans story we just heard. And to know that I can make a difference and I want to in every way possible.

I am not a natural politician, in case you havent noticed, like my husband or President Obama. So I have a view that I just have to do the best I can, get the results I can, make a difference in peoples lives, and hope that people see that Im fighting for them and that I can improve conditions economically and other ways that will benefit them and their families.

TUMULTY: Thank you. Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

Senator Sanders, you have demanded that Secretary Clinton release the transcripts of her paid Wall Street speeches. Why is this important? Do you have reason to believe that she says one thing in private and another in public?

SANDERS: Well, what I have said is that when you get I believe it is $225,000 for giving a speech, and she gave several speeches to Goldman Sachs, one of the Wall Street financial institutions whose greed and illegal behavior helped destroy our economy a number of years ago, when you get paid $225,000, that means that that speech must have been an extraordinarily wonderful speech.

(APPLAUSE)

TUMULTY: So does this mean that you would not think she should have to disclose...

SANDERS: I would think that a speech so great that you got paid so much money for, you would like to share it with the American people. So I think she should release the transcript.

(LAUGHTER)

(APPLAUSE)

(CROSSTALK)

SANDERS: As the secretary said, well, she will do it if other people do it. I will do it. I didnt give any speeches, there is no transcript.

(APPLAUSE)

TUMULTY: But my question was, do you think she saying one thing in the speeches and another in public?

SANDERS: That is exactly what releasing the transcripts will tell us. This I do know. This I do know. There is a reason why Wall Street has provided $15 million just in the last reporting period to the secretarys super PAC.

Now, the secretary says it doesnt influence her. Well, thats what every politician says who gets money from special interests.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: The question that the American people have to determine  you know, can you say that Wall Street is greedy, theyre fraudulent, but theyre not dumb. Why are they making those kind of large contributions?

TUMULTY: Thank you, your time is up.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Well, let me respond, as I have numerous times during this campaign. You know, I have a public record and you can go look it up. I went to Wall Street before the Great Recession and basically called them out, said that their behavior was putting our economy at risk, called for a moratorium on foreclosures.

I went to the Orlando area during the 08 campaign to make the same case, visiting with families who had been defrauded by mortgages, these subprime mortgages that put them and their homes at risk.

TUMULTY: Thank you, Secretary Clinton.

CLINTON: I called for those changes. I have been on the record and now I do have the toughest, most comprehensive plan to go after Wall Street. And not just the big banks, all the other financial interests that pose a threat to our economy. And I have said no bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jail, and I will use the powers that have now been passed by the Congress, by President Obama, who, incidentally, took a lot of money from Wall Street, which didnt stop him from signing into law the toughest regulations on the financial industry since the Great Depression.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Look, clearly, clearly, the secretarys words to Wall Street has really intimidated them, and that is why they have given her $15 million in campaign contributions.

TUMULTY: Thank you, Senator.

SANDERS: Now, what I believe is in fact that we have a corrupt campaign finance system. And its not just Wall Street, its the drug companies, (INAUDIBLE) received millions of dollars from the fossil fuel industry. Weve got to overturn Citizens United and end that.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Wait a minute. I just think its worth pointing out that the leaders of the fossil fuel industry, the Koch brothers, have just paid to put up an ad praising Senator Sanders. There are a lot of different powerful interests in Washington. Ive taken them on. I took on the drug companies. I took on the insurance companies. Before there was something called Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare, and I worked really hard...

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: ... to get comprehensive health care reform, and they beat me. So I have a long record of standing up to special interests. And I will continue to do so.

RAMOS: Were going to move on to the next question.

(BOOING)

(CROSSTALK)

(LAUGHTER)

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: You have 30 seconds, Senator.

SANDERS: There is nobody in the United States Congress who has taken on the Koch brothers, who want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and virtually every federal program passed since the 1930s more that Bernie Sanders.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: And I am proud that the gentleman who is head of Goldman Sachs, now, he didnt give me $225,000 for speaking fees, he said I was dangerous and hes right. I am dangerous for Wall Street.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Well, if I can say...

RAMOS: Were going to move on to the secretary.

CLINTON: ... you know though, I guess Senator Sanders, that the Koch brothers, as you said, are sensible with how they use their money. And I agree with you. They stand for things that I find abhorrent, that would be bad for our country, bad for our future.

But they did just put up a little video praising you for being the only Democrat who stood with the Republicans to try to eliminate the Export/Import Bank, which has helped hundreds and hundreds of companies here in Florida be able to export their goods and employ more Floridians. So from my perspective, you sided with the Koch brothers.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Let me respond.

RAMOS: Yes. Just a few seconds.

SANDERS: The Export/Import Bank is often called the bank of Boeing, because Boeing corporation gets 40 percent of the revenue.

RAMOS: OK. Were going to move on.

SANDERS: It is corporate welfare and yes, I oppose corporate welfare.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: OK, next question. I want to continue with the issue of trust. Secretary Clinton, on the night of the attacks in Benghazi, you sent an e-mail to your daughter Chelsea...

(BOOING)

RAMOS: ... saying, that Al Qaida was responsible for the killing of the Americans.

(BOOING)

RAMOS: However, some of the families claim that you lied to them. To that speed, the mother of the information officer, Chaznea (ph). Lets listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SMITH: Hillary and Obama and Panetta and Biden and all of  and Susan Rice, all told me it was a video, when they knew it was not the video. And they said that they would call me and let me know what the outcome was.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

RAMOS: Secretary Clinton, did you lie to them?

CLINTON: You know, look. I feel a great deal of sympathy for the families of the four brave Americans that we lost at Benghazi. And I certainly cant even imagine the grief that she has for losing her son, but shes wrong. Shes absolutely wrong.

I and everybody in the administration, all the people she named, the president, the vice president, Susan Rice, we were scrambling to get information that was changing, literally by the hour. And when we had information, we made it public. But then sometimes we had to go back and say we have new information that contradicts it.

So I testified for 11 hours.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Anybody who watched that and listened to it knows that I answered every question that I was asked and when it was over the Republicans had to admit they didnt learn anything. Why? Because there had already been one independent investigation. There had been seven or eight congressional investigations, mostly led by Republicans who all reached the same conclusions, that there were lessons to be learned.

And this is not the first time we lost Americans in a terrorist attack. We lost 3,000 people on 9/11. We lost Americans serving in embassies in Tanzania and Kenya when my husband was president. We lost 250 Americans, both military and civilian, when Ronald Reagan was president in Beirut.

And at no other time were those tragedies were they politicized

(APPLAUSE).

CLINTON: Instead people said, lets learn the lessons and save lives. And thats when I did.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: But Secretary Clinton, what theyre saying is that  what the families are saying is that you told your daughter Chelsea one thing and a different thing to them.

CLINTON: Jorge, that makes my point. At the time I e-mailed with my daughter, a terrorist group had taken credit for the attacks on our facility in Benghazi. Within 16, 18 hours, they rescinded taking credit. They did it all on social media. And the video did play a role.

We have captured one of the lead terrorists and he admits it was both a terrorist attack and it was influenced by the video. This was fog of war. This was complicated. The most effective, comprehensive reports and studies demonstrate that.

Look, as I said in the beginning, I deeply regret that we lost four Americans.

RAMOS: Thank you senator.

CLINTON: And I of course sympathize with members of the families who are still, you know, very much grieving.

And I wish that there could be an easy answer at the time, but we learned a lot, and the intelligence kept...

RAMOS: Thank you.

CLINTON: ... improving, and we learned enough to say what we think happened at Benghazi.

RAMOS: You have 30 seconds, Senator.

SANDERS: Well, Im not going to comment on the Benghazi tragedy, but I will say this. A series of articles in the New York Times talked about Secretary Clintons role in urging the administration to go forward with regime change, getting rid of Gadhafi in Libya.

Gadhafi was a brutal dictator, theres no question. But one of the differences between the secretary and I is Im not quite so aggressive with regard to regime change. I voted against the war in Iraq because I had a fear of what would happen the day after.

(APPLAUSE)

And Secretary Clinton talks about Henry Kissinger...

RAMOS: Thank you, Senator.

SANDERS: ... winning the praise of Henry Kissinger, I dont want Henry Kissingers praise at all.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Were going to  were going to take a break.

SALINAS: Were taking a break.

Were taking a break. (through translator) Well continue with topics that are of interest to Spanish (inaudible) education, what to do with student debt. Two topics that we will deal in a moment in the Democratic debate.

RAMOS (through translator): We remind you that you can download (inaudible) and well come back with the Democratic presidential debate.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(UNKNOWN) (through translator): And we continue now, connected with Univision for you to send us (inaudible) first Democratic debate focusing in Hispanic topics. I have (inaudible) that supported (inaudible).

Good evening, good evening.

We heard a lot about immigration, about the deportations and race. In your opinion, who (inaudible) better and who presented the immigration proposal?

QUESTION (through translator): The two candidates did a good action of talking, explaining, but what concerned me a bit is that we  we havent seen the plan of Senator Bernie Sanders, and we have not seen a plan in writing from Secretary Hillary Clinton. So we want to see what she says. That is important,

The six months  that we have seen as immigration is concerned, and we see that theyre moving towards. The community needs to not only immigration reform, but the raids have to stop. Families that we have seen that are suffering, they have to be reunited.

(UNKNOWN) (through translator): We heard very emotional testimony of a mother that was brave enough to come here with her five children. How did you feel when you heard her story? And do you think that the candidates had empathy with the story?

QUESTION (through translator): I believe that this was the saddest moment that we had here at the debate, a mother with her children, separated from her husband. And those children suffering because they do not have their father.

And this is what we see that is happening, that Republicans are doing not  by not approving a migratory reform, but also President Obama. So we need  we need not only words, but plans as well. And we need as a community to both stand up and support women as her.

(UNKNOWN) (through translator): Thank you, Gabby (ph), and now the debate  the Democratic debate continues with Jorge Ramos and Maria Elena Salinas. Thank you.

SALINAS: Thank you, (inaudible).

Well continue with the debate now.

Senator Sanders, you call your opponent Hillary Clinton an establishment politician. You yourself are a career politician. Why should voters prefer a career politicians over an establishment politician?

SANDERS: Well, youve got to look at what the career is about. And this is a career that has stood up to every special interest in this country. I dont take money from Wall Street. I demand that we break up the large financial institutions.

I dont take money from the pharmaceutical industry because I believe they are ripping off the American people and charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.

(APPLAUSE)

I dont take money from the fossil fuel industry because they are destroying  they are destroying this planet through their emissions of carbon and creating the terrible climate change that we are seeing.

So I think it is true that I have served in Congress for many years. But if you check my record, it is a record of strength for the environment, for workers, for seniors. Unlike the secretary, I believe we should expand Social Security benefits. It is a record of achievement for veterans, working with Republicans, helping to craft the most significant veterans healthcare bill passed in many decades.

So I think the point is look at the record, and its a record that I am proud of.

(APPLAUSE)

SALINAS: Secretary, (inaudible) Latinos, according to the Univision-Washington Post poll, the number one issue is jobs and the economy. Latino unemployment rate is higher than the national average. Their net worth has gone down 42 percent during the Obama years, and 60 percent of Latinos make less than $15 an hour.

So, last week you tweeted that for the GOP, the economy is an after thought. Well, many Latinos feel that they are an after thought. Do you understand what the specific needs of Latinos are to improve their living conditions?

CLINTON: Well, I certainly know what all Americans need, and that is more jobs, with rising incomes. Its something that I have worked on for many years. Its why Ive laid down the only really comprehensive plan about how to create more good jobs.

And there are several things that need to be addressed. We do have to do more infrastructure spending. That will put many Americans to work. Its a good job that gets you on the ladder to the middle class. We need to improve the conditions for manufacturing in our country and punish those companies that want to export jobs. We need them to be incentivized to create jobs right here in America.

We also do have to combat climate change, and no state has more at stake in that than Florida. And the best way to do that is not only enforcing the laws we have, but also the clean power plan that President Obama has put forth that I support, and the Paris agreement that I think was a huge step forward in the world, that Senator Sanders said was too weak, but I helped to lay the groundwork for that.

CLINTON: But we need more clean energy jobs and we have to do more to help small businesses. You know, the fastest-growing segment of small businesses are minority and women-owned small business, and we need to help businesses get started.

The very distinguished congresswoman from New York whos been on the Small Business Committee, Congresswoman Velasquez, knows exactly what we need to be doing to create more small businesses. We do need to raise the minimum wage and we have to guarantee equal pay for women.

SALINAS: Secretary, what would you do...

CLINTON: That will help Latinos as well as every other working person in our country.

(APPLAUSE)

SALINAS: Secretary, you talked in general terms, but you havent really said what you would specifically do to improve the living conditions of Latinos.

CLINTON: Everything I just said will improve the living conditions, and Ive spent a lot of time and effort talking to and mostly listening to Latinos. Jobs are the number one issue, with rising incomes. Close behind is education.

Every child deserves a good teacher in a good school, regardless of the zip code that they live in. Following behind that is health care and how important it is to continue to build on the Affordable Care Act and provide access to health care. And then there are a number of other issues  comprehensive immigration reform certainly at the top.

SALINAS: Your time is up, Secretary  sorry, your time is up.

SANDERS: OK, let me answer that question because its a huge question. And one of the  huge, I know.

(LAUGHTER)

One of the points that Ive been making, and media does not seem to pick up on it, is that we have a real crisis not only with real unemployment in America being close to 10 percent, but youth unemployment in this country.

If you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed...

SALINAS: Your time is up.

SANDERS: Oh wait a minute. Can I have...

RAMOS: Go ahead.

SANDERS: ... a little bit of time here please? African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent. Thats why I co-sponsored legislation to put $5 billion into a jobs program to put our kids to work because I would rather invest in education and jobs than jails and incarceration.

(APPLAUSE)

We have got to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The United States has got to join the rest of the industrialized world in guaranteeing health care to all people as a right.

(APPLAUSE)

We need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. And when we do that, under my plan, we create 13 million decent-paying jobs.

SALINAS: Thank you, Senator.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: We have a question on education. Senator, Ill continue with you. You propose free college tuition.

SANDERS: No, I do not propose free college tuition, I proposed free tuition at public colleges and universities. Yes I did.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: So under your plan, potentially, millions of students who can not truly afford college would be getting federal subsidies. Is that right?

SANDERS: No. What they would  look, this is what I believe, Jorge. This is the year 2016. Fifty years ago a high school degree got you a good job in the economy. Today, in many respects, a college degree is the equivalent of a high school degree.

We have got to go beyond first grade to 12th grade when we talk about public education.

(APPLAUSE)

So I do believe we should make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and I dont believe we should punish millions of young and not-so-young people with outrageous levels of student debt.

RAMOS: Because my question was if you think, for instance, if Donald Trumps grandchildren or  Im sorry  Hillary Clintons grandchildren, should they be able to go for free?

SANDERS: Absolutely.

RAMOS: For free.

SANDERS: Absolutely. They can go  I dont think they will, but Donald Trumps kids  Donald Trumps kids can go to public school right now, I think Secretary Clinton is talking about making community colleges free, they can go to those things.

The point is we are going to get to Donald Trump by raising the taxes on the top 1 percent and our millionaires and billionaires. But all of our people, in my view, regardless of income, should have a right to get a higher education. I want children in the third grade to know that if they study hard, no matter what the income of their families, my family didnt have any income, my parents didnt go to college, they didnt have good income. I want every kid to know if you do your school work, study hard, yes, you will be able to get a college education.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Well continue this  well continue talking about education. For that, we go Enrique Cevedo (ph) has a question. Enrique Cevido (ph).

QUESTION (through translator): We just heard about free tuition from Senator Sanders, but right now there are millions of students who cant afford to pay their loans. Maria Martinez is 20 years old and shes a major of political science at Miami-Dade College.

(UNKNOWN): Secretary Clinton, she said she wants to go to grad school and get a PhD. What are you going to do to help her achieve that goal and pay off her student debt?

CLINTON: Well, congratulations on your education. And also on your plans for the future. And heres what I will do. Were going to refinance everyones existing student debt, 40 million Americans have student debt.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: And right now, I go around asking people at my events if they know what their interest rate is and the interest rates literally go from like 8 percent to 14 percent. Its outrageous that at a time when interest rates have been historically low, people borrowing money to invest in their education are paying some of the highest interest rates around.

And you can refinance your house to get a lower interest rate. You can refinance your car. Corporations can refinance their debt. Under my plan, you will be able to also lower your debt, move into a program to pay it back as a percentage of your income and more than that, my plan for debt-free tuition at public colleges and universities will eventually eliminate any student debt.

But for people who have it, Im going to put a date certain that after a certain number of years, you no longer have to pay anything. The government has to quit making money off of lending money to young people to get their education.

(APPLAUSE) (UNKNOWN): Karen, lets go back to you.

SANDERS: I think what Secretary Clinton just said is absolutely right. I think I said it many months before she said it, but thanks for copying a very good idea.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Now the question though, you know, I have been criticized a lot for thinking big. You know, thats for believing that we can do great things as a nation. One of the things we should not be doing obviously, is punishing people for doing what we want them to do and that is to get an education.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: But here is the point. My program, making public colleges and universities tuition free, allowing people with debt to refinance at the lowest possible interest rates is a fairly expensive proposal, about $70 billion a year.

You know how Im going to pay for it? Im going to pay for it by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: We bailed out  Secretary Clinton was one of those who voted to bail out Wall Street. Now I think its time for Wall Street to help the working families of this country.

RAMOS: Thank you senator. Thank you very much.

CLINTON: Well, Im going to respond to that, because I think its a very important issue. And by the way, everybody, who, quote, got money in the quote, bailout, that also included money for the auto rescue has paid it back.

So, the Treasury was out nothing. Now that will no longer happen because we have Dodd-Frank and we will break up banks that pose a systemic threat to our economy.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: But let me say this. Senator Sanders has talked about free college for everybody. Hes talked about universal, single payer health care for everybody. And yet, when you ask questions, as many of us have and more importantly, independent experts, its very hard to get answers.

And a lot of the answers say that this is going to be much more expensive than anything Senator Sanders is admitting to. This is going to increase the federal government dramatically. And, you know, my dad used to say, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

SANDERS: All right. Let me respond to this.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: And we deserve answers about how these programs will actually work and how they would be paid for. SANDERS: I want you all to think. What Secretary Clinton is saying is that the United States should continue to be the only major country on earth that doesnt guarantee health care to all of our people.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: I think if the rest of the world can do it, we can. And by the way, not only are we being ripped off by the drug companies, we are spending far, far more per capita on health care than any other major country on earth.

You may not think the American people are prepared to stand up to the insurance companies or the drug companies. I think they are. And I think we can pass...

RAMOS: Thank you senator.

(CROSSTALK)

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: This is a very important point in this debate, because I do believe in universal coverage. Remember, I fought for it 25 years ago. I believe in it. And I know that thanks the Affordable Care Act, we are now 90 percent of universal coverage. I will build on the Affordable Care Act. I will take it further. I will reduce the cost. \

But I just respectfully disagree. Between the Republicans trying to repeal the first chance weve ever had to get to universal health care, and Senator Sanders wanting to throw us into a contentious debate over single-payer, I think the smart approach is build on and protect the Affordable Care Act. Make it work. Reduce the cost.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Im on the committee, I know a little bit about this, Im on the committee, Health, Education, Labor Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act. And it has done a number of good things. But when Secretary Clinton says, well, 90 percent of the people have insurance, yes, not really.

Many of you may have insurance, but you have outrageously high deductibles and co-payments. One out of five Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe. Elderly people are cutting their pills in half.

I do believe that we should do what every other major country on earth does, and I think when the American people stand up and fight back, yes, we can have it, a Medicare for all health care system.

(APPLAUSE)

TUMULTY: Im going to call time here because I want to move on to a subject that more than two dozen Florida mayors have asked to raise with you. They have asked us to share with you their concern over the effects of rising sea levels and climate change in their communities.

(APPLAUSE)

TUMULTY: Just take a look at this map. You can see that no state has more at stake than Florida does. And no city has more at stake than Miami, the city in which we are sitting. But many Republicans argue that this is not a man-made problem.

Senator Sanders, is it possible to move forward on this issue if you do not get a bipartisan consensus, and what would you do?

SANDERS: Well, first of all, Karen, when you have Republican candidates for president and in Congress telling you that climate change is a hoax, which is Donald Trump and other candidates position, what they are really saying is, we dont have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: What candidates are saying is if we stand up to the fossil fuel industry, and transform our energy system away from coal and oil and gas to energy efficiency and wind and solar and geothermal and other sustainable technologies, you know what happens to that Republican who listens to the scientists? On that day, that Republican loses his campaign funding from the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry.

TUMULTY: So youve just described the problem, but how would you move forward given that this is the situation?

SANDERS: The way I would move forward in every other area. And what we are doing in this campaign is fighting not only to become president, but Im the only candidate who says no president, not Bernie Sanders, can do it all. You know what we need, Karen? We need a political revolution in this country.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: And when millions of people stand up and tell the fossil fuel industry that their profits, their short-term profits are less significant than the long-term health of this planet, we will win. That is the way change always takes place.

(APPLAUSE)

TUMULTY: Secretary Clinton, can we do this without a bipartisan consensus? No major environmental legislation has ever passed without bipartisan votes.

CLINTON: Well, Karen, first of all, I was proud a number of mayors from Florida campaign for me in South Carolina. I had a chance to talk to some of them about this issue. It is a really serious one. And there isnt much time left to do several things that I will move quickly to do.

You can see already whats happening in Miami, particularly in Miami Beach with tides rising. So we do have to invest in resilience and mitigation while we are trying to cut emissions and make up for the fact that this is clearly man-made and man-aggravated.

CLINTON: And there are certain things that the president has done through executive action that I will absolutely support. All the Republican say they will, if theyre elected, heaven forbid, repeal all of those executive actions. I will maintain them and act on them.

The clean power plan is something that Senator Sanders has said he would delay implementing, which makes absolutely no sense. We need to implement all of the presidents executive actions and quickly move to make a bridge from coal to natural gas to clean energy.

That is the way we will keep the lights on while we are transitioning to a clean energy future. And when I talk about resilience, I think that is an area we can get Republican support on.

(CROSSTALK)

SANDERS: Let me be very clear...

(CROSSTALK)

CLINTON: Because  because after all  excuse me.

SANDERS: I have introduced...

CLINTON: Excuse me, excuse me.

SANDERS: Did you ask me to speak?

CLINTON: After all, there are...

(APPLAUSE)

(CROSSTALK)

SANDERS: Madam Secretary, when he asked me to speak...

CLINTON: You know, you dont  you know, you dont have to do much more than look at rising insurance rates.

RAMOS: Secretary, thank you very much.

CLINTON: You know, most of the property in Florida will be at risk in the next 50 years. I think I can get a bipartisan consensus on resilience and then implementing the presidents orders until we frankly win back enough seats, take back the Senate, and get back to bipartisan... (CROSSTALK)

RAMOS: Senator Sanders?

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: (inaudible) have as much time as she just had.

RAMOS: Absolutely. This is your debate.

SANDERS: Thank you.

Lets be clear. Youre looking at the senator who introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the United States Senate.

(APPLAUSE)

Now, I hope that Secretary Clinton would join me if we are serious about climate change, about imposing a tax on carbon on the fossil fuel industry and making massive investments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy. And by the way, while we are on the subject of energy, I hope youll join me in ending fracking in the United States of America.

(APPLAUSE)

(CROSSTALK)

TUMULTY: Secretary Clinton, Senator Elizabeth Warren  Senator Elizabeth Warren says personnel is policy. And she says that there is a revolving door between Wall Street and the highest levels of economic policy-making and regulation in Washington.

Three of the last four Treasury secretaries appointed by Democratic presidents had ties to Citigroup. Do you agree with Elizabeth Warrens criticism that both your husbands administration and President Obamas have relied too heavily on advisers who represent the world view of the big banks?

CLINTON: Well, Karen, I do agree that we have to end the revolving door. I strongly support a piece of legislation from Senator Tammy Baldwin that would do just that. And I will be looking for people who will put the interests of consumers first, who will do more to try to make sure Main Street flourishes. And I will very much reach out and ask for advice as to who should be appointed, including to Senator Warren and many of my other former colleagues in the Senate.

But I think its important also to look at what we want to accomplish. You know, in the debates weve had  maybe this is the seventh or so  Senator Sanders is always criticizing the two recent Democratic presidents  President Clinton and President Obama. And thats fine, but I wish he would criticize and join me in criticizing George W. Bush, who I think wrecked the economy and created the conditions for the great recession. You know, at the end of the 90s, we had 23 million new jobs. Incomes went up for everybody. We were talking earlier about what needs to be done for Latinos and African Americans. Well, we were doing it by the end of the 90s. Median family income went up 17 percent. For minorities, it went up even more.

Along came the Republicans, trickle-down economics  one of the worst ideas since snake oil  was put back into place. And we ended up with the great recession. President Obama had to rescue the economy. And I dont think he gets the credit he deserves for doing that.

TUMULTY: Senator Sanders, your name was mentioned.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Now, let me say this. I gather Secretary Clinton hasnt listened to too many of my speeches.

(LAUGHTER)

Or followed my work in the Congress as very few people stood up to George W. Bush whether it was the war in Iraq or any other of his policies.

(LAUGHTER)

Now, when we talk about the policies of the 1990s, I worked closely and supported President Clinton. And obviously, I have worked very closely in supporting President Obama, who has taken our economy a very long way from where Bush left us.

SANDERS: But when you go back to the 1990s, lets remember, thats when Wall Street deregulation took place.

SALINAS: Thank you senator.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Thats when disastrous trade policies took place.

SALINAS: Were going to break now.

SANDERS: Yes, good things happened, but some dangerous mistakes were made that laid the groundwork for some of the problems were having with a disappearing middle class today.

SALINAS: Thank you senator.

TUMULTY: Time is up. Thank you.

RAMOS: Were going to take a break. And when we come back, well talk about Latin America. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

(UNKNOWN): When we come back, well talk about Latin America. Dont leave.

(UNKNOWN): Of course you can follow us on Facebook live. Dont forget.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(UNKNOWN) (through translator): We continue with the Democratic debate.

RAMOS: Lets talk about Latin America.

Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, it will be my welcome to Miami question. So it goes as follows. President Barack Obama is going to Cuba in two weeks. Forty percent of Cuban Americans supporting to uphold  oppose a new White House policy towards Cuba.

If you were president, would you meet with the dissidents in Cuba? Would you meet with Fidel Castro? And would you consider Raul Castro a president or a dictator? Welcome to Miami.

CLINTON: Well, first of all, I supported the presidents moves. I helped to implement some of them leading up to the announcements when I was secretary of state, expanding travel opportunities, remittances. And I certainly told the president toward the end of my time that I hoped he would be able to move toward diplomatic relations and to make more of an impact by building up the relationship.

CLINTON: And there are no better ambassadors for freedom, democracy and economic opportunity than Cuban Americans.

So the more that we can have that kind of movement back and forth, the more likely we are to be able to move Cuba toward greater freedom, greater respect for rights.

You know, Im looking forward to following the presidents trip. I do think meeting with dissidents, meeting with people who have been voices, tribunes of freedom and opportunity is important.

The Cuban people deserve to have their human rights respected and upheld, they deserve to be able to move towards democracy where they pick their own leads. And I think both Castros have to be considered authoritarian and dictatorial because they are not freely chosen by the people that are in Cuba.

(APPLAUSE)

I hope someday there will be leaders who are chosen by the Cuban people, and I hope that democracy will be deeply rooted in Cuban soil and that the people of Cuba will have every opportunity to fulfill their own dreams in their own country. That is my hope.

SALINAS: Senator Sanders...

RAMOS: On Facebook, by the way, this is the conversation that everybody is having, talking about Cuba. Senator Sanders.

SANDERS: Look, I understand that not everybody in Florida or in the United States will agree with me, but I think we have got to end the embargo.

(APPLAUSE)

I believe that we should move towards full and normalized political relations with Cuba. I think at the end of the day, it will be a good thing for the Cuban people. It will enable them, I think when they see people coming into their country from the United States, move in a more democratic direction, which is what I want to see. So right  Im sorry.

SALINAS: Lets continue with another question, Senator, if you dont mind.

SANDERS: Sure. SALINAS: In 1985, you praised the Sandinista government and you said that Daniel Ortega was an impressive guy. This is what you said about Fidel Castro. Lets listen.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

SANDERS: You may recall way back in, when was it, 1961, they invaded Cuba, and everybody was totally convinced that Castro was the worst guy in the world. All the Cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against Fidel Castro. They forgot that he educated their kids, gave them health care, totally transformed their society.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

SALINAS: In South Florida there are still open wounds among some exiles regarding socialism and communism. So please explain what is the difference between the socialism that you profess and the socialism in Nicaragua, Cuba and Venezuela.

SANDERS: Well, let me just answer that. What that was about was saying that the United States was wrong to try to invade Cuba, that the United States was wrong trying to support people to overthrow the Nicaraguan government, that the United States was wrong trying to overthrow in 1954, the government  democratically elected government of Guatemala.

Throughout the history of our relationship with Latin America weve operated under the so-called Monroe Doctrine, and that said the United States had the right do anything that they wanted to do in Latin America. So I actually went to Nicaragua and I very shortly opposed the Reagan administrations efforts to overthrow that government. And I strongly opposed earlier Henry Kissinger and the  to overthrow the government of Salvador Aliende (ph) in Chile.

I think the United States should be working with governments around the world, not get involved in regime change. And all of these actions, by the way, in Latin America, brought forth a lot of very strong anti-American sentiments. Thats what that was about.

SALINAS: Senator, in retrospect, have you ever regretted the characterizations that you made of Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro that way?

SANDERS: Im sorry. Please say that...

SALINAS: In retrospect, have you ever regretted the characterizations of Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro that you made in 1985?

SANDERS: The key issue here was whether the United States should go around overthrowing small Latin American countries. I think that that was a mistake...

SALINAS: You didnt answer the question.

SANDERS: ...both in Nicaragua and Cuba. Look, lets look at the facts here. Cuba is, of course, an authoritarian undemocratic country, and I hope very much as soon as possible it becomes a democratic country. But on the other hand...

(APPLAUSE)

...on the other hands, it would be wrong not to state that in Cuba they have made some good advances in health care. They are sending doctors all over the world. They have made some progress in education. I think by restoring full diplomatic relations with Cuba, it will result in significant improvements to the lives of Cubans and it will help the United States and our business community invest.

SALINAS: Thank you, Senator. Your time is up on that.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Secretary, I have a question on Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is bankrupt. It owes more than $70 billion it cannot pay and we have a question from Facebook. Lian Purvea (ph) is asking you the following; I would like to know if during the first 100 days of your presidency, you will help Puerto Rico restructure its public debt and help its economy. The first 100 days, secretary.

CLINTON: Absolutely, although it happens before I am president if I am so fortunate to be. I have been calling for months that the Congress must give authority to Puerto Rico to restructure its debts.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Just like it has enabled states and cities to restructure their debt. And its a grave injustice for the Congress, led by the Republicans to be refusing to enact that opportunity within the bankruptcy law.

And what we see in Puerto Rico now is a lot of suffering. We see schools being closed, we see health care being denied and we see a thousand Puerto Rican families a month moving to the United States, mostly to Florida.

Puerto Ricans are citizen of America.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: They deserve to be treated as citizens and to be given the opportunity to get back on their feet economically. And I just want to add one thing to the question you were asking Senator Sanders. I think in that same interview, he praised what he called the revolution of values in Cuba and talked about how people were working for the common good, not for themselves.

I just couldnt disagree more. You know, if the values are that you oppress people, you disappear people, you imprison people or even kill people for expressing their opinions, for expressing freedom of speech, that is not the kind of revolution of values that I ever want to see anywhere.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Well, as I said earlier, I dont believe it is the business of the United States government to be overthrowing small countries around the world. And number two, when you get to Puerto Rico, theres an issue that we have not talked about. That little island is $73 billion in debt and the government now is paying interest rates of up to 11 percent.

And many of the bonds that they are paying off were purchased by vulture capitalists for 30 cents on the dollar. And what I have said in talking to the leaders of Puerto Rico, weve got to bring people together. And its not the people of Puerto Rico, or the children or the schools.

TUMULTY: Senator, OK

SANDERS: But maybe some of these vulture capitalists who are going to have to lose a little bit of money in this process.

TUMULTY: We need to move on to another topic.

Secretary Clinton, there is a vacancy on the supreme court at a very crucial moment. Among other things, the court is considering the most significant abortion restrictions in a generation.

So I would like to share with you a question that we got from Facebook from Joshua Dansby, a law student in Washington, D.C. who wants to know what specific forms of qualifications you would look for in a Supreme Court justice?

CLINTON: Well, I think this is one of the most important issues facing our country right now. And I fully support President Obamas intention under the constitution to nominate a successor to Justice Scalia. And I believe...

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: I believe no state probably understands this better than Florida. Because lets remember three words: Bush versus Gore.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: A court took away a presidency. Now weve got the Republican Congress trying to take away the constitution. And we should not tolerate that.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: And so from my perspective, it is imperative that we put enormous pressure on the Republicans in the Senate to do their constitutional duty. Now, obviously you look for people who are not only qualified on paper, but have a heart, have life experience, understand what these decisions mean in the lives of Americans.

And understand the balance of power that their decisions can disrupt one way or the other. So clearly, I would look for people who believe that Roe v. Wade is settled law and that Citizens United needs to be overturned as quickly as possible.

(APPLAUSE)

TUMULTY: Its time to go to commercial. Were going to commercial. Well be right back. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

(CROSSTALK)

SALINAS (through translator): We go to a commercial. And when we come back, conclusions (inaudible).

RAMOS (through translator): (inaudible) which has heads of space and its the candidates to the presidents (inaudible) that are the (inaudible).

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

SALINAS (through translator): We come back with the Democratic debate, sponsored by Univision, Washington Post and Facebook. We are reaching the end, asking the candidates to give their last words.

SALINAS: Were coming to the end of this wonderful debate, and its time for your closing remarks.

Secretary Clinton, youre first.

CLINTON: Well, thank you very much for a lively debate. And I appreciate greatly all the questions, especially the questions in person from the people here and those coming at us from Facebook. It just reinforces my strong commitment to do everything I can to break down all the barriers that stand in the way of people living up to their own potential, and of our country doing the same.

So I am going to take on those economic barriers. I have a plan to create jobs and raise incomes. Im going to take on the education barriers that often leave too many children behind even after they have completed schooling. Im going to take on the healthcare barriers.

Im going to do everything I can to make sure that we unite our country. I will find common ground, just as I have as first lady, as senator and secretary of state. I will also stand my ground wherever matters of principles are at stake.

CLINTON: I would be honored to have your support in the upcoming primary on Tuesday, and hope to have the great honor of serving you as your president.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Senator Sanders, your closing remarks.

SANDERS: This has been a wonderful debate, but time being limited, some of the most important issues facing our country have not been asked. And that is, is it acceptable that in America the top 0.1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Is it acceptable that while the average American works longer hours for lower wages, 58 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent.

Is it acceptable that Wall Street and billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy elections? Is that democracy or this that oligarchy? Which is why I believe weve got to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.

Is it right that in the greatest, wealthiest country in the history of the world, so many of our young people cant even afford to go to college or leave school deeply in debt, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world? If we stand up, fight back, we can do a lot better. Thats why Im running for president.

(APPLAUSE)

SALINAS: Secretary and Senator, we want to thank both of you for being here, for joining us tonight. And, of course, we also want to thank also the wonderful crowd that was here today. Our audience has been wonderful, and thank you for being here.

(APPLAUSE)

TUMULTY: And on behalf of The Washington Post and Univision and Facebook, wed like to thank you again for joining us in this <debate and also to remind people to get out and vote.

RAMOS (through translator): We want to use these last moments, its very important to go out and vote, remember next Tuesday, March 15th is elections in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, all these states  in all these states the Hispanic vote is crucial (INAUDIBLE). Talk about the importance of Hispanic votes, how in very close races it is the Hispanic vote that can choose the next president of the United States. This is Hispanic power, but the only way that this can happen is if we all go out and vote.

So you know it perfectly, who does not vote doesnt count.

SALINAS (through translator): And as you know, nobody can reach the White House without the Hispanic vote. Remember, dont let others decide for you. The power is in your hands, you have to participate, you have to vote. Thank you for being with us this evening and thank you for trusting in Univision. Good evening.

RAMOS: Good evening.",[]

Extreme frugality is the secret to untold wealth, if the habits of billionaire Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad are anything to go by.

The mogul is so thrifty, he stocks his wardrobe with second-hand clothes. I dont think Im wearing anything that wasnt bought at a flea market, Kamprad says in an upcoming documentary for Swedish television, according to Agence France-Presse.

He also prefers cheap haircuts, explaining in a 2008 interview with Swedish newspaper Sydsvenskan:Normally, I try to get my haircut when Im in a developing country. Last time it was in Vietnam.

Kamprad, who turns 90 on March 30, said penny-pinching helped Ikeas success. It probably also helped him amass a fortune worth more than $40 billion, according to a Bloomberg estimate.

time.com,2016-03-10 05:25:43,Syrian Refugees Say No Deal Will Stop Them Going to Europe,['Shona Murray Kilis Turkey'],"



Syrian refugees say that any deal between the European Union and Turkey, proposed on Tuesday, will not stop them from traveling to Greece and then onto northern Europe.

Turkish and European diplomats agreed that refugees arriving in Greece from Turkey would be sent back and for every refugee sent back, the E.U. would re-settle a refugee in Turkey. Turkey has reportedly asked for $6 billion in aid to help it manage an estimated 2.5 million Syrian refugees. The deal has not been finalized and talks are due to continue in Brussels on March 17.

Syrian refugees say that they are not safe in camps in Turkey and have little hope of a normal life there. On Tuesday, eight rockets were fired at a camp in Kilis, killing a 55-year-old woman and a 4-year-old boy. The Turkish army says it came from Al-Bab, an area in North Aleppo controlled by ISIS. The Turks returned fire and continued to fire artillery shells throughout Tuesday.

Chris McGrathGetty Images

Rama, 20, from the Syrian town of Aleppo says she and her 50-year old mother and three brothers will travel to Izmir on the Turkish coast to find a people smuggler to help them travel to Greece. Even here in Kilis there are bombing noises  this is more trauma for us, she says. We have no life in Turkey, I want to be a civil engineer like my father, but its impossible for this to happen here.

Rama wants to join her father in Germany where he has been for a year. Her mother, Reem is a pharmacist by profession and her children were preparing for university when the family fled. The family endured the violence of the civil war but it was the threat of the Syrian army conscripting Ahmed, the eldest son of the family, that prompted the family to leave for Turkey.

They were forcing us to take him to the army; but we didnt want him to die, says Ali, Ramas 18-year-old brother. Several of Ahmeds friends were conscripted and one was killed soon afterwards. After that, we just left everything; every happy thing and our happy life, but we had to go, because this is not our war, he says.

Ali says that news of the E.U. plan will not hold them back.Yes, I heard about the E.U. plan. But I think we can still make it; we have to do it, says Ali. The family know that they not only risk death crossing the Aegean Sea to Greece but they may be penalised for traveling to the E.U. illegally.

If the E.U.-Turkey plan goes ahead, any irregular migrant coming to Europe from Turkey will be put on the bottom of the list for resettlement, European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker said after 12 hours of talks in Brussels on Tuesday.

Doha Amud, 39, from Aleppo, also has a husband in Germany. She applied for a visa to join him, along with her three children ranging from 8 months to 14 years of age. She says will take them all on a boat to Greece if she doesnt receive a response in the next few weeks. I will be worried about not getting there alive and if they stop us, but I cant live like this. God will help us, I hope. Were going to work, thats all we want to do, have some dignity, not to hurt anybody.

The [E.U.] plan simply wont work, and its not just because of the violence in places like Kilis, says Derek ORourke Regional Security Advisor for Goal Middle East, an Irish charity working inside Syria and Turkey. Refugees will do longer routes making the journey even more dangerous. And the smugglers are not going to walk away from a multi-million euro trade, he says.

Meanwhile, Reem is deeply distressed about the trip ahead. I cry every day, but this is the only chance for safety and to see my husband on the other side. She hasnt worked in two years and money is tight. Her greatest fear is seeing her children die on the journey  it keeps her awake at night. But then I dream that were all sitting at one table with my whole family; I just want to sit with them all at the same table  I miss my husband so much.",[]

In 1971, when I was in my first year of college at Northwestern University in Chicago, my mother told me she was going to be in New York for a few days. She was staying at the Waldorf Astoria, and I asked if I could come see her. Not only had I never been to New York before, I had never asked my mother if I could travel across miles to spend time with her. Our war-torn history went back a long way. My surliness had clashed with her impatience for so long; we were like America and Russia in the depths of the Cold War.



But I needed her right thenI needed her to be a mother. My mother. I needed her to listen to me, not judge me, to understand that I was in pain. I dont know why I was so certain she would do all those things, but I was.

Sitting with her high above the streets of Manhattan on a winter day, I told her I had been having an affair for nearly two years with my high school English teacher. He left my boarding school the same year I did, started teaching at a Midwestern college, and the idea was that we would be close enough geographically that we could still see each other. I had waited for his call all night in my Northwestern dorm room, when he said he would be arriving by train. He never showed up, never called; he stood me up and made a fool of me as he had many times before. On that long night I finally grew up enough to say it was over. I had wasted time on a fantasy that never had any possibility of materializing.

I can see my mother now as if it just happened days ago, not decades. Gray light spilled through the hotel window. She was wearing a chocolate brown sweater and a wool skirt. She was color-coordinated with the furniture. Her diamond wedding ring looked muted in that light. Her face, as I talked, was soft and tinged with tenderness. I realized she already knew.

Ive known for a long time, she said finally.

My parents had come to my Arizona high school and had met my English teacher. Shed intuitively figured it out and had kept silent about it for two years.

I dont want your father to know, she told me. It would really upset him.

So for all that time, shed kept her suspicions to herself, even from my father. She didnt want to upset him, but she also knew that she had to let me go through the pain and the drama. If she had interfered, it would have made things worse.

There were other times over the years when we stepped outside our troubled history into a smooth pool of light and bonded as mother and daughter. But that day in New Yorkwhen I felt ashamed and worn down in ways that a 19-year-old shouldnt, when I ran to my mother for comfort and she provided itis a memory that towers above all the others. Because I know that the mother she was on that day was who she really longed to be ... but so many things had gotten in the way.

At some point, to understand our parents, we have to look at theirs. In 1924, a 3-year-old girl named Anne Frances Robbins, who had been nicknamed Nancy, was taken to her cousins home by her mother and left there for five years. Her mother Edith Davis was a working actress who had gotten divorced shortly after her child was born. She tried taking the baby on the road, putting her backstage in a trunk that served as a cradle while she was onstage. But it became too hard, so she left the child with her older sisters family in Bethesda, Md., and she would visit occasionally. On one of those visits, after years had passed, she told her daughter that shed gone on an ocean cruise and had met a doctor whom she planned to marry. Nancy was uprooted again and taken to Chicago. She now had a new father and a stepbrother. The definition of family was an ever changing palette.

Over time, my mother decided to repaint her own history with pale sweet colors. According to her, she understood perfectly, at the age of 3, why her mother left herShe had to work, she would say, with a trace of defiance. Also, in her memory, she had instantly accepted the idea of a new father whom she hadnt yet met. I never believed her version, but it took me many years to understand how vital the revision was to her.

There was a moment when a window opened and I saw past the battles that had raged between us, as well as the guilt Id hung on to all my life. I was the baby inside her when she married the man of her dreams in a tiny chapel, wearing a gray suit, with only two witnesses present. Id always felt it was my fault that she didnt have a white wedding.

The moment when all of it looked different to me happened in a hospital room. My mother was well into her 80s and had fallen and hit her head. She was sitting on the edge of the bed, listening to the doctor. The back of her hospital gown had opened, and I reached over to retie the strings. She looked tiny and frail and vulnerable. Her back was soft and bent, and she was confused about how she had fallen. It was as if time parted for me and I got a glimpse of her as that small child, watching her mother leave and having no idea when she would be back. I felt how frightened and hurt she must have been, 3 years old and left with relatives. I understood then why she had dedicated so much of her life to reconfiguring the story. Imagination is a survival tool, and its a good one.

The man whom she would eventually call her father, Loyal Davis, was a harsh taskmaster. He was a neurosurgeon and a rigid perfectionist. I was frightened of my grandfather until the day he died. Everything had to be orderly, precise and punctual. Growing up, my mother desperately wanted to please him. She probably thought he might leave if she didnt.

In fact, I now think the fear of being left alone, abandoned, was a current throughout much of her life. A few years into my fathers descent into Alzheimers, when I was still living in New York, my mothers voice on the phone sounded so threadbare and distraught that I suggested she go out into the garden, sit by herself and talk to God ... or the moon, the stars, the night sky. Just be with yourself for a little while, I told her.

No. I cant do that. I dont want to do that, she said abruptly, closing the door on the subject.

I understand now the absurdity of my suggestion. Its what I would do in a period of distress, and its what my father would have done. But for my mother, sitting all by herself outside under the stars was a horrifying thought. Ghosts rise up from the earth when youre alone. Stories and memories rearrange themselves and fall into the shape of truth. Some of us need that; others will do anything to avoid it.

A while after my father died, she told me that she kept the television on all the time because it made her feel less lonely. It makes the house seem more lived in, she said. I had, on several occasions, given in to my annoyance and either turned the volume down or turned it off. I had to practically yell to be heard over whatever program she had onusually a news stationand sometimes I couldnt stand it. But after she told me that it filled in some of the loneliness, I never reached for the remote again.

When she fell and hit her head and the housekeeper found her in the morning, the television was blaring in her bedroom. I wondered if she had fallen asleep with it on, if her nights were made easier by its background noise. The thought of her dreading the empty darkness so much that she would leave the TV on made my heart hurt. More and more, I hung on to moments like that when thinking about my mother.

We have had a long journey together, she and I. Over a half-century of memories. Now that the journey has ended, I have a choice which ones to study, which ones to turn over in my hands and dust off. I choose to look at the ones that ache with a sweet truth not told often enough: there was love between us, it was just hard to find sometimes.

I choose to remember her face on that winter day in Manhattan, when I came to her with a broken heart. I choose to remember walking on the shore with her in summers when we rented a beach house; somehow the sea always transformed us. And how she looked on my wedding day when she handed me a bracelet that had belonged to my grandmother. Something old, she said. I wondered that day if there was some sadness in that moment because she had never gotten the wedding I know she dreamed of as a girl.

I remember how she and my father used to walk along the paths of the garden in the afternoonsboth of them older, their steps slow and cautious, his occasional questions splintery with Alzheimers, her answers patient and soft. She stopped walking in the garden after his death; I didnt need to ask why. I remember her weeping on my shoulder a week before he died and saying, Nothing will ever be the same without him. And the way she broke down when we had to leave his coffin after flying with it back and forth across the country, through several days of services. I cant leave him, she wept.

I remember how her eyes drifted toward the sky when she spoke about wanting to be with my father again when she died. Im sure God is listening to you, I would always tell her.

Well, he certainly better be, she said once.

Im sure God can take care of himself, but I hope for his sake that he was listening.

time.com,2016-03-10 06:41:30,Donald Trump Distracted the Media from John Kasich,['Joe Klein'],"



On the day before the Michigan primary, when there still seemed a glimmer of a sliver of a possibility that John Kasich might emerge as the sane Republican alternative to Donald Trump, the governor of Ohio was having fun at a town meeting in Monroe, Mich. He barged into the middle of his wife Karens attempt to introduce him. What did you just say? the candidate asked, looking, as usual, as if hed just gotten out of bed. Shed just said that they smiled and laughed every day. And now she added, You smiled at me this morning. He said that was only because she had shared a box of chocolate-covered cherries with him. My staff knows, he went on, I never share.



With the casual, slightly goofy tone established, Kasich set off on one of his magical mystery toursIve never seen him give the same speech twicewhich included this response to a question about immigration: Im in favor of building the Ohio-Michigan border fence, he said. I need to protect the Ohio-speaking people.

I thought about the modest chocolate cherry on election night, watching Donald Trump celebrate his victories surrounded by heaping platters of Trump steaks, bottles of Trump wine and Trump water and copies of Trump magazineand a slew of Trump flunkies, society folks, members of his Jupiter, Fla., country club, including the golf clubs champion. Trump admitted that hed won some club championships too, which had prepared him for ... the presidency, because you gotta know how to close.

Kasich and Trump are the two great political performance artists this year, and they are night and day. Trumps speeches are all about him: his polls, his edifices, his steaks. Kasichs speeches are about the audience. He encourages people to tell their stories. Often, these have little or nothing to do with politics. After Monroe, in Grosse Pointe Woods, he was riding a favorite hobbyhorse, about how spending a year or two in community college on the way to a four-year degree could save you a lot of money. Im doing that! interrupted 19-year-old Alexa Kelly, who also admitted that she had lost some family members last summer and had been very depressed. What you said before about getting help [if youre feeling all alone], that really works. Cue hug, applause, tears.

What Kasich is doing is so unusual that its taken some time for the public to catch on, in large part because we the media have been so caught up in Trumpery. Kasich is the least hortatory candidate in the race. You listen to Hillary Clinton making grand pronouncementsAnd isnt it about time that we had equal pay for women?and you cringe: Yeah, of course, it is ... but why are you yelling at me? Yelling is what politicians did before there were microphones.

Kasich rarely raises his voice. He tosses off casual admissions of failure. Michigan has a lower income tax than we [in Ohio] do, he said in Monroe, and its killing me. He has the substantive side of the campaign coveredand occasionally, his offhand insights can be striking. Talking about Trumps wild threats and promises, he mused in Monroe, Most of the things that people like to hear, they know theyre never going to happen. They just like to hear them.

In the days before the Michigan primary, there were portents of a Kasich breakthrough. An NBC poll showed him doubling his strength nationally, leaping past Marco Rubio, whose collapsing campaign offered Kasich space to run as the moderate alternative to Trump. A strong second-place finish in Michigan might open the door to a victory in Ohio. But Kasich finished third, behind Ted Cruz. It was an improvement, and victory in Ohio seemed possible, but Trumps wins in Michigan and Mississippi, the relentless quality of his juggernaut, made the quixotic nature of Kasichs questand Cruzs, for that matterall the more obvious. (The governor of Ohio would have to be seen as a strong vice-presidential possibility, though.)

A few months ago, even before the voting began, Kasich was asked why he was still in the race, given his microscopic poll numbers. He shrugged and went off on one of his riffs, talking about how some candidates save the real truths for their concession speeches: And you ask yourself, Why couldnt he have said that stuff when he was running? Well, Kasich went on, he was trying to make every speech like thattell the truth, let the chips fall. In the months since, he has been as good as his word. And if and when he does drop out, the regrets should be all ours: What a fresh voice we have squandered.

time.com,2016-03-10 06:41:24,The Republican Party Is No Longer the Party of Reagan,['Peter Wehner'],"



With the death on March 6 of a dignified First Ladyan influential cultural figure in her own right and the devoted keeper of her husbands flameboth Ronald and Nancy Reagan have now passed into history. Increasingly, it appears, the same can be said of the party they took such care in shaping.

The most obvious evidence of this is the rise of Donald Trump, a man who is the antithesis of so much that Ronald Reagan stood for: intellectual depth and philosophical consistency, respect for ideas and elevated rhetoric, civility and personal grace. The fact that Trump is the favorite to win the Republican presidential nomination shows how far the GOP has drifted from the animating spirit of the most consequential and revered Republican since Abraham Lincoln.



Trumps attempt at a hostile takeover is not a thunderclap on a cloudless day. It was years in the making. And when the mantle worn by Reagan might be settling on the likes of Trump, this end-of-an-era moment demands that we reflect on what has happened to our Republican Party.

For those of us open to such self-examinationto understanding what conditions gave rise to Trump and Trumpismthe explanation starts with certain harmful habits. These include employing apocalyptic rhetoric, like the assertion that America is on the verge of becoming Nazi Germany. Such reckless language is evidence of fevered and disordered minds and paves the way for Trumps incendiary rhetoric.

But thats hardly the whole of it. Republicans embraced the political knife-fighting tactics of Newt Gingrich in the 1990s and light-as-air political figures like Sarah Palin in the 2000s. Many Republicansincluding self-proclaimed constitutional conservativesbegan to speak of compromise as a synonym for capitulation, which is odd given that the Constitution itself was the result of a whole series of accommodationsand Reagan was a gifted compromiser. (In the debate over the Constitution, there was even a deal struck that came to be known as the Great Compromise, by which every state was to have two members in the U.S. Senate, offsetting proportional representation in the House.) Republicans became suspicious too of the spirit of moderation that James Madison argued is essential in understanding which measures are in the public good. What many modern Republicans are looking for is conflict, confrontation, the politics of the cage match.

At some point along the way, it became fashionable in the Republican Partyin some quarters, anywayto replace reason with rage, to deny science when it was at odds with ideology and to cheer mindless stunts like shutting down the federal government rather than responsibly managing and relimiting it.

Voters are complicit in this too; many of them have come to confuse cruelty, vulgarity and bluster with strength and straight talk. And Republican lawmakers compounded a problem they had promised to solve, promoting rather than ending corporate welfare and crony capitalism.

Theres another explanation as wellpolitical and intellectual sclerosis, by which I mean the failure to apply enduring principles to changing circumstances. This is something that Reagan did quite well. He developed a policy agendaon taxes, monetary policy and regulationsthat addressed the problems of his era, including high inflation, high interest rates and high unemployment. He understood the hardships facing ordinary Americans. He gave voice to them. And he offered concrete solutions to them. He adjusted to the realities of his time.

Ronald Reagans heirs have been decidedly less skilled at doing so.

One reason for this is that Reagan was so successful. The shadow he cast was so large that many of the Republicans who followed him could not escape it. For them, every year was 1981. Every problem could be solved by simplistically applying Reagans policy to it, even if the situations were not remotely comparable. (When Reagan took office, the inflation rate was in the double digits. Today it is less than 2%.) Republicans became uncreative and intellectually lazy. They placed themselves in an ideological straitjacket, trying to be more Reagan than Reagan (for example, promising they would not raise any taxes under any conditions for any amount of spending cuts). In the process, they became captive to the past.

As a result, too many Republicans lost touch with ordinary Americans. They had almost nothing to say about wage stagnation, the struggles of working-class Americans, the lack of social mobility, soaring tuition and health care costs, and how to extend health insurance to the uninsured. They were unable to explain, let alone address, huge structural changes caused by globalization, advances in technology and automation, which had harsh effects on low-skill workers. Blue collar Americans in particular felt unheard, ignored, abandoned.

Out of all this has emerged an opportunistic populist by the name of Trump.

Its still too early to know what will come of all this. If Trump wins the nomination, he will go some distance toward undoing the influence of Reagan on the modern Republican Partyon policies like trade and immigration, in its commitment to limited government and cultural renewal, and in its concern for justice. Just as significant would be the dramatic change in tone, countenance and ethos. We are in the process of seeing the grace and joie de vivre of Reagan replaced by the crass and cruel insults, the obsessive Twitter attacks and the vindictiveness of Trump. The party of Lincoln and Reagan would be led by a man who embraces, at least in part, the ethics of Nietzsche.

Trump still has a ways to go before securing the nomination. (To date, roughly two-thirds of Republican primary voters are voting against him.) Yet even if he succeeds, many of us who are children of the Reagan revolution will not go gently into the good night. We will not vote for Trump under any circumstances, even if he is the nominee; whats more, we will do everything in our power to reclaim the Republican Party from this demagogic and authoritarian figure.

This does not mean the mechanical imposition of Reagan-era policies, but it does mean being guided by conservative principles that seek to limit the size and reach of the state, that take into account human nature, defend human dignity and promote human flourishing. It means articulating an enduring vision of a limited government sustaining the space for society to thrive in an age of social fragmentation and weakening institutions, in the words of Yuval Levin, whose forthcoming book The Fractured Republic grapples with these issues. And just as important, it means recapturing the spirit of Reaganmaking our Republican Party a welcoming party once again, inclusive and open, united in its commitment to American ideals, hopeful about the future and attractive to working-class Americans. The kind of party, in other words, that Ronald and Nancy Reagan would be proud of.

Hillary Clinton may have been facing Bernie Sanders at Wednesdays debate, but in reality she was shadowboxing Donald Trump.

The Republican frontrunner, who was the only GOP candidate who had supporters rallying in front of the Democratic debate, was the 800-pound gorilla in the room. He was named outright more than a dozen times, and referenced in the answers that didnt refer to him directly.

In responding to questions about billionaire businessman, Clinton gave hints of what her general election strategy might look like. She mocked Trumps beautiful tall wall and derided his divisiveness. She drew clear differences in their trade and climate strategies. And Clinton portrayed herself as earnest and wonky and positive, running an inclusive campaign, versus the real estate mogul she said profits from promoting divisiveness.

The debate, the last one scheduled for now on the Democratic side, comes as Clinton and Trump seek to cement their leads and secure their parties nominations.

The Clinton campaign said in a call with reporters earlier Wednesday that they believed that after voting in states next week, including Florida, Ohio and Illinois, that its delegate lead over Sanders would become insurmountabledespite evidence that the Vermont Senator has shown his populism is resounding, particularly amongst blue collar workers in the Rust Belt who are also attracted to Trump.

Clintons top message was one of inclusiveness. She noted that she was the first person in the field to call Trump out for his outrageous language and pledged she would continue to do so. When he was engaging in rhetoric that I found deeply offensive. I said basta, she said. (Basta is Spanish for enough.) Others are also joining in making clear that his rhetoric, his demagoguery, his trafficking in prejudice and paranoia has no place in our political system. Especially from somebody running for president who couldnt decide whether or not to disavow the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke.

And she drew the sharpest contrast yet with Trump by directly pledging to not deport children or their families. You dont make America great by getting rid of everything that made America great, Clinton said.  Its un-American. What [Trump] has promoted isnt at all in keeping with American values.

Perhaps most significantly, Clinton made her case for a very nuanced trade policy. Both Sanders and Trump are more stridently anti-trade than Clinton, whose husband authored the North American Free Trade Agreement. And many attribute Clintons surprise loss in Michigan this week to voter unhappiness in that economically challenged state over trade and outsourcing.

She has laid down the foundation for the argument shell make in the fall, which is that she voted against [the Central American Free Trade Act] because it didnt meet her standard, she said that once she had the chance to finally look at and review the final text of the [Trans Pacific Partnership] that it didnt meet the standard, John Podesta, Clintons campaign chair, told reporters in the spin room afterwards. But its not enough just to be just be against things. You have to be for the policies that are actually going to work for the American people, to create jobs and to enforce existing trade agreements and I think thats a place where her experience, due respect to both Sen. Sanders and Mr. Trump, is one of being able to be tough, stand up and go toe-to-toe with the Chinese, and thats the one that the American people need in the Oval Office.

The ghost of Trump haunted the debate on almost every issue, with both Clinton and Sanders going after Trumps policies from his denial of climate change to his foreign policy to his treatment of women. Clinton hinted that the race to stop Trump was all the more heightened by the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death on Antonin Scalia. And she reiterated her response to Sanders call for her to release the transcripts of speeches she gave to big banks, saying she would only do so when Trump and the Republican field also released their speeches.

The Clinton campaign pushed back on the idea, though, that Clinton was already pivoting to the general election.

We are absolutely focused on our Democratic opponent and we are fighting for every vote, said Joel Benenson, Clintons pollster. Clinton lost her first presidential bid in 2008 in part because she took the primaries for granted and focused too much on a general election that never came to pass. Still, Benenson noted that running against Sanders was helping Clinton build the most diverse coalition of voters for a general election.

Both Clinton and Trump have seen their disapproval ratings rise as the nomination have come within their reach, in part fueled by millions of dollars in negative advertising.

When asked about why only 37 percent of Americans believe she is honest and trustworthy in a recent Washington Post poll, Clinton responded frankly: I am not a natural politician in case you havent noticed, like my husband or President Obama, she said. I just have to do the best I can, get the results I can, make a difference in peoples lives, and hope that people see that Im fighting for them.

time.com,2016-03-10 04:14:28,Denver Broncos Find Themselves Scrambling for a Quarterback,['Arnie Stapleton'],"



(ENGLEWOOD, Colo.)  John Elway is scrambling again.

The general manager of the Super Bowl champions has a huge hole to fill with Brock Osweiler bolting to the Houston Texans 48 hours after Peyton Mannings retirement.

That leaves Trevor Siemian as the only quarterback on the Denver Broncos roster. The second-year pro from Northwestern has taken just one NFL snap, a kneel-down at that.

If Elways sweating it, hes certainly not showing it.

Weve stayed true to our philosophy of building a team with players who want to be Denver Broncos and want to be here. Thats been a successful approach for us, Elway said. While we did offer a very competitive and fair long-term contract to Brock, we ultimately had to remain disciplined while continuing to assemble a roster that can compete for championships.



So, now the man who famously declared there was no Plan B when he lured Manning to Denver four years ago must find a passer who will defend Denvers title in 2016.

Weve now turned our attention to other options at quarterback and we are confident that well find the right player and person for our team, Elway said. Our organization thanks Brock for his contributions and wishes him all the best.

Elway could turn to free agents such as Robert Griffin III or Ryan Fitzpatrick  whose agent, Jimmy Sexton, also represents Osweiler. Or he could pursue a trade  Colin Kaepernick, anyone? Hell almost certainly select a quarterback in the early rounds of next months draft, too.

Osweiler made $660,000 last year and Denver offered him about $16 million a year. ESPN reported Osweilers four-year deal with the Texans is worth $18 million annually with $37 million guaranteed.

Shocked, tweeted Broncos cornerback Chris Harris Jr. I thought Brock wanted to play with us lol

Instead, hell play against them  the Texans are among the teams thatll visit Denver next season when the Broncos become the sixth team to open defense of its Super Bowl championship with a new QB under center.

Theyre the first to lose their top two quarterbacks and face this level of uncertainty.

The Broncos also will have to replace defensive end Malik Jackson, who went to Jacksonville for six years and $90 million, and linebacker Danny Trevathan, the leading tackler on the leagues No. 1 defense, who rejoined John Fox in Chicago on a four-year deal worth $28 million.

They have in-house candidates for those vacancies.

In the midst of the big Broncos breakup Wednesday, Denver did agree to a three-year deal with versatile tackle Donald Stephenson, who spent his first four seasons with the Chiefs, to bolster its offensive line.

The Broncos knew theyd lose several key members of their team after beating the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50, although Osweilers price tag took may by surprise.

Elways main offseason priority was keeping Von Miller, so he placed the exclusive franchise tag on his star linebacker. That bought him more time to work out a long-term deal with the Super Bowl MVP  and paved the way for Osweilers big payday.

Osweilers value skyrocketed when Kirk Cousins and Sam Bradford re-signed with their respective teams in recent days, leaving Osweiler as the top QB available, and then the Texans decided he was their man.

Osweiler served as Mannings apprentice for 3 1/2 years, then went 5-2 when Manning was sidelined with a torn ligament in his left foot last season.

Manning worked his way back into shape with the help of an orthotics guru who set up shop in his garage and stealthy workouts with practice squad receiver Jordan Taylor and sidelined tight end Jeff Heuerman. Finally, Manning was summoned from the bench in the third quarter of the season finale against San Diego when Denvers offense sputtered under Osweiler. Manning led a comeback that secured the AFCs top playoff seed and coach Gary Kubiak named him the starter for the playoffs.

Although he was disappointed at being demoted, Osweiler pledged his full support for Manning and Kubiak. At the Super Bowl, Osweiler provided encouragement on the sideline as Manning struggled, completing just 13 passes for 141 yards.

Thanks to Denvers dominant defense, it was enough.

And in the aftermath of Denvers win, Elway said he wanted Osweiler back, proclaiming: We wouldnt have been world champs without Brock.

Denvers recent offer sat for several days without a reply, however, and another ominous sign came Monday when Osweiler was a no-show at Mannings farewell news conference.

Osweiler was the only quarterback ever drafted with the explicit intent of one day succeeding the icon the late Broncos cornerback Darrent Williams dubbed the Great Peyton Manning.

Instead, hes replacing Brian Hoyer.",[]

Facing off in Miami Wednesday night, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders debated the merits of trade policies and ties to Wall Street in the most bitter debate of the cycle. Sanders, fresh off a narrow victory in Michigan, sought to build momentum for his struggling campaign and Clinton aimed to get her race back on trace. But as significant the divides between the two candidates were, what was most striking was how the group of two compare to the group of four Republicans debating Thursday night across town. Take immigration, as Sanders and Clinton debated how they would seek to halt deportations, while Republicans debate whether to forcibly remove those in the U.S. illegally, the divide between the two parties may be greater than evera contrast that will turn into a heated debate come the general election.

For weeks the effort to stop Donald Trump has hinged on depriving him of 1,237 convention delegates, with a Marco Rubio victory in Florida seen as a key stepping stone for making that happen. But Ted Cruz didnt get the memo. As Rubios campaign flails, Cruz is greasing the exit ramp by campaigning in Florida and rolling out the endorsement of Carly Fiorina there, in an effort to force Rubio from the race. By doing so, hes ceding the states 99 delegates to Trump, but Cruz believes by forcing an I win, or you lose choice, he can defeat Trump in the end. Meanwhile, Ohio Gov. John Kasich is struggling with his own do-or-die moment in Ohio, trotting out the endorsement of Ohio State football coach Urban Meyer.

In a general election, Trump could make inroads with Democrats, TIMEs Philip Elliott reports, with Clintons troubles in Michigan portending potential November worries for her and her party. Meanwhile, Trump escalates his rhetoric against the Muslim world. And Rubio expresses regret for going into the gutter to attack Trump.

Americans were pretty stressed out in 2015, according to a survey released Thursday.

The study, conducted by the American Psychological Association, found that average stress levels in the U.S. rose since 2014, from 4.9 to 5.1 on a 10-point stress scale. There was a particular increase among adults reporting extreme stress, with 24% saying they were highly stressed in 2015 compared to 18% a year earlier.

Since 2007 ,the APA has conducted its annual stress survey, finding that money and work are consistently the top two sources of stress (67% and 65%, respectively).

This most recent survey also tracked the impact of discrimination on stress. Some 61% of adults surveyed reported that they have experienced unfair treatment or discrimination on a day-to-day basis, and many of them experienced stress in connection to that. Hispanic and black adults reported being stressed by even the anticipation of discrimination, with 3 in 10 who reported experiencing day-to-day discrimination saying they changed their behavior or appearance to avoid harassment or get good service.



Stress is also linked with health problems, according to the survey. Those who reported their health as only fair or poor have higher stress levels on average than those who identified as very good or excellent.

Many actors have donned the Batsuit, from Adam West to George Clooney to Val Kilmer. But with the release of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice on March 25, Ben Affleck takes the baton from Christian Bale, who played the character in director Christopher Nolans Dark Knight trilogy. And in a new interview with Australian website FilmInk, director Zack Snyder explains the thought process behind his casting decisions.

This is a total and opposite reality from the Chris Nolan movies, he says. Its another universe, so we couldnt hire Christian Bale if we wanted to, because he doesnt exist in our world. Snyder said he briefly considered hiring Bale to play another part, joking that he could have played Alfred with age makeup, in part to drive home the point that the world of Batman v Superman is so totally different. In the Batman universe that Chris Nolan created, Superman would have a hard time existing, he continues. Thats why we did a reboot on the universe, so we could allow these characters to exist together.

Snyder also explained how Affleck fit his vision of the new Batman. I really wanted an old Batmannot, like, decrepit! I wanted a world weary Batman... someone who has had experiences, and Ben has really hit that. Not only did Affleck have the gravitas Snyder was looking for, he also had the height. Hes a big person. Hes 64, and in the boots, hes 66. I dont like a small Batman...I like my Batmen bigger!

A Donald Trump supporter punched a protester in the face at a rally in Fayetteville, N.C., on Wednesday, according to multiple videos that have surfaced from the event.

Rakeem Jones, 26, was being led out of the rally when he was punched by a man in the stands and then tackled to the ground by law enforcement officers, the Washington Post reported.

My eye still hurts. Its just shocking. The shock of it all is starting to set in. Its like this dude really hit me and they let him get away with it. I was basically in police custody and got hit, Jones said in an interview with the Post.

Its happening at all these rallies now and theyre letting it ride, he said.

Violence has broken out at several Trump rallies recently. A black activist was reportedly punched and choked in November, and Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields was forcibly grabbed by Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski after a press conference on Tuesday, Politico reported.

At a rally in Las Vegas last month, Trump strongly rebuked a man who had disrupted the rally and was escorted out. Id like to punch him in the face, Trump said, adding protesters in the old days would be carried out on stretchers.

Jones, who is black, said he attended the rally as a social experiment with a group that included a Muslim, a white woman and a gay man. He said the woman started shouting once Trumps speech started but no one in the group attempted to get physical.

Ronnie Rouse, who attended the rally with Jones and filmed the incident, told the Post that people in the crowd shouted racial epithets at them as they left.

time.com,2016-03-10 11:00:37,Most Voters Favor Defense Cuts. Most Politicians Don't.,['Center For Public Integrity Lauren Chadwick'],"



Both the Obama administration and Congress are pushing for higher spending on the military next year, as are most of the presidential candidates. But most American voters have a different opinion, preferring military spending cuts instead.

The nonpartisan organization Voice Of the People recently gave registered voters around the country the task of forming their own defense budgets, after hearing vetted pro and con arguments, and it found that 61 percent favored cutting defense spending an average of $12 billion.

President Barack Obama, in contrast, has proposed to add $2.4 billion in 2017 to the current defense budget, reflecting core spending of $523.9 billion plus another $58.8 billion ostensibly meant for overseas contingency operations.



The major presidential candidates positions on defense spending are not all clear-cut, but analysts credit the top four Republican presidential candidates as supporting increased defense spending, while Hillary Clinton hasnt staked out a clear position, and Bernie Sanders has said he would cut it substantially.

The survey, released in Washington on March 9 by VOIP, which is affiliated with the University of Maryland, is not the first such comprehensive study to show majority voter preference for a defense spending cut.

A similar 2012 survey by three nonprofit groups, including the University of Maryland group and the Center for Public Integrity, found most of the public then backed deep spending cuts in most categories of military spending, including air power, sea power, ground forces, nuclear weapons and missile defense.

In the new 2016 survey, most voters proposed bringing the core budget down to the same level they preferred in 2012, around $497 billion. Since core defense spending has indeed declined over the past four years, this represents a smaller proportional cut than majorities favored in the earlier poll.

A majority of voters surveyed between December 2015 and February 2016 nonetheless said they wanted defense cuts in almost every area of the military, including cutting ground forces by $4 million, nuclear weapons by $3 billion, air power by $2 billion, naval forces by $2 billion and missile defense by $1 billion. Respondents wanted to keep the budgets for special operations forces and the Marines at the same level but sought no increase in any specific military area.

Voter opposition to increased military spending was once again mostly bipartisan. In the 2012 survey, two-thirds of Republicans and nine in 10 Democrats supported making immediate cuts. This time, a majority of Democrats wanted to cut the budget by $36 billion, and a majority of independents favored a $20 billion cut, while 50 percent of Republicans favored decreasing spending or keeping it the same, and 48 percent favored increasing it.

Given all the talk about increasing the defense budget, we were surprised to find how much Americans are not sold on increases, including a majority of Republicans nationwide, Steven Kull, director of the University of Marylands Program for Public Consultation (PPC) and president of Voice Of the People, said in a prepared statement.

The sample consisted of 7,126 registered voters across the country, giving it an unusually small margin of error: 1.4 percent. The survey was administered through an online program developed by the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland. Respondents were given arguments for and against defense spending, as they were in 2012, to more comprehensively assess their preferences and to simulate policymaking. Staff members of the House and Senate appropriations subcommittees on defense vetted the arguments for accuracy.

In both surveys, respondents repeatedly labeled the arguments for and against spending as convincing. Majorities, however, found the arguments in favor of defense spending cuts more convincing.

The most convincing argument in favor of trimming the budget, for example, asserted that Congress often approves unnecessary spending and that the military branches do a poor job of tracking where money goes.

The survey also assessed how much most voters think the federal government is presently spending on the military. Respondents were given information about the size of the national defense budget in five different contexts, and as in 2012, their responses were influenced by these contexts.

When voters looked at the defense budget as a proportion of the U.S. annual discretionary budget, for instance, a majority found defense spending to be more than they expected. Similarly, when voters were presented the defense budget in comparison with potential enemies and allies budgets or in conjunction with a list of previous U.S. defense spending levels, substantially more respondents found the budget to exceed what they expected. Only when presented as a percentage of the U.S. GDP on a graph showing a decrease over time from 1960-2015, did a majority find the defense budget was less than expected.

When given the opportunity to evaluate specific weapons systems, majorities this time favored downsizing two notoriously costly weapon systems, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. In fact, a majority endorsed cancelling the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program altogether, something that would save $6 billion quickly and nearly $100 billion through 2037.

But not all programs were given the boot. Majorities endorsed building the Air Forces Next Generation Bomber, recently named the B21, for example. A majority of respondents also supported building the Navys new nuclear strike submarines, and opposed reducing the number of planned new submarines from 12 to 8.

On the topic of Afghanistan, most voters favored a continued presence of 5,500 troops  the current plan for U.S. presence in the country, a rare instance where the administrations military spending proposals were in sync with voter preferences.

Defense spending is still above $500 billion, and the budget appears likely to rise. But the overall message from voters is clear  cut defense spending. Its just not being heeded.

The U.S. and Canada will introduce new measures to reduce methane emissions, a significant move in the fight against climate change, the White House announced Thursday.

Methane, the second most common greenhouse gas, traps more significantly more heat in the Earths atmosphere pound for pound than carbon dioxide. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently found that much more of the gas is released into the atmosphere than previously realized.

The EPA will begin a rule-making process to draft new regulations on methane emissions from existing sources. The agency introduced rules last year to stem methane emissions in the energy sector, but those rules only apply to new facilities.



Environment and Climate Change Canada, the Canadian agency tasked with environmental policy, will work with authorities in provinces and territories to develop new regulations by 2017.

The joint announcement, which comes during Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeaus state visit to the U.S., signals a new era of collaboration between the two countries on efforts to combat climate change. The U.S. and Canada had previously been at odds on the issue before the election of Trudeau last fall.",[]
time.com,2016-03-10 11:19:10,Travel Costs Frugal People Don't Pay,"['Jim Wang', 'Credit Com']","



Most people shy away from the idea of traveling because they think itll be expensive.

In reality, traveling doesnt have to be. If you make it a priority, if you are smart with where and how you spend your money, even the most extravagant-looking trip is within the realm of possibility. It can be even cheaper if you know what upsells and traps to avoid.

Here are five travel expenses frugal people dont pay so you can make your next vacation more affordable.

1. Luggage Fees

Frugal people are typically practical people and as such, they tend to pack accordingly. Bring only what you need and no more.



This helps you avoid any extra luggage fees, whether its spending extra to bring two cases instead of one, or over-packing one to the point of paying extra for each pound over the limit.

Be sure to check the restrictions beforehand so youre not hit with any surprises. Some airlines are very strict about carry-on dimensions!

Also, when you price flights, remember the luggage rules because one bag fee can turn the cheapest flight into the most expensive one.

2. Convenience Food

We all need to eat! One of the biggest expenses on any trip is food. You can save a lot by living like a local and going to the grocery store instead of restaurants every meal.

Get lodging that has a full kitchen, or at least a microwave or toaster oven, and a fridge. This can save you a ton if youre staying at a place for a week or more. Bonus points if youre staying with a group of people and can split the grocery bill and cooking duties.

If a kitchen isnt possible, look for lodging that offers complimentary breakfast, or at least a cocktail hour.

Additionally, whether youre traveling by air or by car, packing snacks is always a good idea. Airlines charge a pretty penny for food outside of whats complimentary on the plane and buying food at the airport comes at a high premium.

3. Full-Price Airline Tickets & Hotel Stays

The ultimate way to be frugal with travel is by not paying for airline tickets or hotel stays. Seasoned travel hackers take advantage of travel credit cards and their big sign-up bonuses to travel the world for free. These points and miles translate into free flights and hotel stays.

Look into the various rewards programs out there, especially with your favorite airline or hotel chain. You can potentially save hundreds of dollars on the two biggest expenses associated with travel by signing up. Many loyalty cards and programs come with additional perks like free luggage and priority boarding, too.

Taking advantage of these types of rewards can offer big savings on any vacation. It could even get you to Disney World for free if you coordinate it properly.

4. Small Incidentals

How many times have you gone on vacation, only to realize you forgot a phone charger, toothpaste, razor or even worse, clothing or shoes?

What if the hotel is out of toiletries? Then youre running to the nearest store to find what you forgot. Thats an extra expense you didnt account for, plus possibly having to pay for transportation.

The best solution to this is to create a checklist of everything you need to take with you on trips. Review the list as youre packing and you wont forget anything.

If you do, ask if the hotel provides any complimentary items for forgetful travelers. Ive often forgotten a razor and most hotels will provide one free of charge. Itll be a single blade disposable razor, but its better than nothing.

5. Upsells & Upgrades

Unless rewards points can cover an upgrade, most frugal travelers opt for the cheapest seats. They avoid all the upsells as theyre booking their flight and select only what they need.

Beware of airlines that sell cheaper tickets but make up for it with fees on everything from bags to peanuts. You could end up tacking another $50 to $75 worth of charges on top of your ticket price.

The Rule of Thumb for Traveling Frugally

Being frugal involves practicality and focusing on the big picture. Whats the purpose of your travel? Is what youre considering buying adding to the overall value of your trip? Is it a make it or break it situation?

If the answer is no, consider skipping it. The best thing you can do to ensure your travels are frugal is to prepare beforehand. Youre already halfway there!",[]

J.K. Rowlings third update to The History of Magic in North America  a collection of short stories meant to provide background for the Harry Potter prequel film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them  focuses on the divide between the magical and non-magical communities in the United States.

Set in the late 18th century, Rappaports Law is about an unfortunate episode that occurred while Emily Rappaport was president of the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA), the American equivalent to the Ministry of Magic. The incident in question involved Dorcus Twelvetrees, the daughter of Rappaports Keeper of Treasure and Dragots (American wizarding currency), who fell in love with a No-Maj named Bartholomew Barebone and caused a historic breach in wizarding world secrecy.

After a series of horrible events  including the persecution of many witches and wizards  resulted from Dorcuss leak of magical information, the President was forced to institute Rappaports Law, an edict implementing complete segregation between those with magical powers and those without. The mandate ended up becoming a defining difference between the American and European wizarding communities, as no laws governing relations with No-Majs to that degree existed in the Old World.

The fourth part of the series will go live at 2 p.m. GMT on Friday.",[]

[





The U.S. and Canada will introduce new measures to reduce methane emissions, the most significant move in a series of announcements aimed at fighting climate change, the White House announced Thursday.

The climate announcements, which came during Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeaus state visit to Washington, included commitments to do everything from helping developing countries implement the Paris Agreement to addressing emissions of hydrofluorocarbons.

The most substantive announcement came on the question of methane. The countries will aim to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40-45% below 2012 levels by 2025, the White House said.

Methane, the second most common greenhouse gas, traps more significantly more heat in the Earths atmosphere pound for pound than carbon dioxide. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently found that much more of the gas is released into the atmosphere than previously realized.

The EPA will begin a rule-making process to draft new regulations on methane emissions from existing sources. The agency introduced rules last year to stem methane emissions in the energy sector, but those rules only apply to new facilities. The rulemaking process will likely outlast the current administration leaving the next president with the responsibility of implementingor rejectingnew rules on methane.

Environment and Climate Change Canada, the Canadian agency tasked with environmental policy, will work with authorities in provinces and territories to develop new regulations by 2017.

The countries also committed to supporting common goals in the Arctic region, including following scientific guidance on oil and gas drilling and a binding agreement to protect fish in the area.

The joint announcement signals a new era of collaboration between the two countries on efforts to combat climate change. The U.S. and Canada had previously been at odds on the issue before the election of Trudeau last fall.",[]
time.com,2016-03-10 11:54:58,A 1964 Ad Could Predict the Democrats' Plan to Fight Trump,['Katie Reilly'],"



A 1964 campaign ad for Democratic President Lyndon Johnson against Republican nominee Barry Goldwater, which recently resurfaced online, might foreshadow how Democrats would campaign against current Republican frontrunner Donald Trump in a general election.

Goldwater, who ultimately lost to Johnson in the 64 election, has often been compared to Trump because his positions at the time were well outside of the Republican mainstream.

In an ad titled Confessions of a Republican, the Johnson campaign takes advantage of establishment discomfort around Goldwater by depicting a Republican voter struggling with his party identity in light of the GOP candidates extreme positions.

I certainly dont feel guilty about being a Republican. Ive always been a Republican. My father is, his father was, the whole familys a Republican family, the voter in the ad says.

However, he cautions, When we come to Senator Goldwater, now it seems to me were up against a very different kind of a man. This man scares me.

The voter goes on to question whether Goldwater is responsible, honest and surrounded by good advisers.

Johnson, at least, is talking about facts, he adds.

The voter in the ad concludes that he would rather vote for Johnson, a Democrat, than a Republican he disagrees with so strongly.

When the head of the Ku Klux Klan, when all these weird groups, come out in favor of the candidate of my party, either theyre not Republicans or Im not, he says, before talking about the 1964 Republican convention in San Francisco. I think my party made a bad mistake in San Francisco, and Im going to have to vote against that mistake on the third of November.

Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke has endorsed Trump, who has been widely criticized for, at one point, failing to rebuke Dukes support.

Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has already started using a similar argument to the one expressed in the Johnson ad against Trump, even before the general election has started. At Wednesdays Democratic primary debate, she denounced Trump over Dukes endorsement and criticized Trumps divisive rhetoric and un-American deportation plans.

Republican leaders have also begun to sound like the man in the ad, potentially boosting such a message. In a March 3rd speech, 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney unleashed a broadside against Donald Trump, saying the businessman lacks the temperament of be president. Sen. John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, agreed. I share the concerns about Donald Trump that my friend and former Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, described in his speech today, McCain said in a statement.",[]

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau arrived at the White House for his first official state visit on Thursdaythe first such visit by a Canadian Prime Minister in nearly 20 years. In addition to holding meetings and a press conference, hell attend a state dinner with his wife, Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau.

Though the visits of state leaders to Washington often draw attention, this visit has drawn particular interest given the Trudeaus youth, progressiveness and, quite frankly, the ever-important cool factor. The Trudeaus celebrity-like appeal has been compared to that of the Kennedys and the early days of the Obama administration. Over the past week, Trudeau has garnered attention for subtly rebuffing leading Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, cuddling with baby pandas and taking jabs from President Obama in his backyard.

Wheres the Stanley Cup right now? Im sorry. Is it in my hometown with the Chicago Blackhawks? Obama joked. In case you Canadians were wondering, where is it?

As Trudeau spends the day with Obama talking policy at the White House, here are give quick facts to know about him:

His father was a Prime Minister

Trudeaus father was Pierre Trudeau, Canadas 15th Prime Minister. He was a formidable force in Canadian politics, and played a pivotal role in decriminalizing homosexuality and keeping Quebec from separating from Canada. Pierre married Justins mother Margaret while he was in officeshe was 30 years younger than him.

He took a winding road to politics

Trudeau started his career as a schoolteacher, and transitioned to politics in 2008 when he was first elected to the Canadian Parliament. In 2013, he became the leader of the Liberal Party.

Hes Canadas second youngest Prime Minister in history

Hes 43 years old. The youngest ever was Joe Clark, who was 39 when he assumed office in 1979. Hes also the father of 3 young kids. He and his wife Sophie, who had a career in television and radio, wed in 2005.

Hes very progressive

Especially compared to his predecessor, Stephen Harper, which could explain the coziness with Obamathe two share a common interest in combating climate change. While in Washington, Trudeau and Obama released a joint statement on new commitments to fight global warming, including steps to reduce methane gas emissions by 40 to 45% over the next 10 years. Trudeau also announced in February that Canada would be pulling out of airstrikes against ISIS terrorists, though the country would increase commitments to ground troops involved in the training of Iraqi forces.

He does adorable things (and people notice)

Trudeau gets a lot of attention for his appearance. While attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit last November, the Twitterverse referred to Trudeau as the #APEChottie. Internet users went wild again this week when Trudeau cuddled with baby pandas at a Canadian zoo. On Thursday, Obama and Trudeau joined forces to cuddle with babies whod come out to greet them on the White Houses South Lawn.",[]

President Obama laid out the qualities hes looking for in a Supreme Court nominee on Thursday, reiterating his belief that whoever he chooses will be immensely qualified for the position.

The President, who addressed the topic during a joint press conference with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, said he will choose an outstanding jurist who has impeccable leadership credentials to fill seat left vacant by Antonin Scalias death.

Obviously its somebody who I want to make sure follows the constitution, cares about things like stare decisis, Obama said of the potential nominee, referring to the practice of following legal precedent. But Obama also said he is interested in selecting someone who can bring real-life experience to the Supreme Court and understands what takes to protect minorities and other groups.



Im going to do my job, Obama said, and my expectation is going to be that the Senate do its job.

The Presidents comments come days after Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced she had asked the White House not to consider her for the position. Lynch joined a growing list of lawmakers and jurists whove asked to be taken out of the running.

Republican leaders in the U.S. Senate have insisted they will not hold hearings for any nominee Obama puts forward, preferring to allow the next President to fill the seat. Obama nominees have already filled two previous Supreme Court vacancies.",[]

President Obama and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rebuffed suggestion that either leader had worry that the strong relationship the two leaders are building between the nations could be threatened should Donald Trump or Ted Cruz succeed Obama.

[Our] Relationship transcends party in terms of the interests that we share, Obama said in response to a question at a joint press conference between the two leaders in the Rose garden.

The Leading republican presidential candidates stances on climate change, immigration, and welcoming refugees from Syria stand in contrast to the progressive leanings of Obama and the new Prime Minister. Yet Trudeau denied that the relationship would at all be perturbed by a change in leadership.

One of the things that is abundantly clear, the young Prime Minister said Thursday, is that the relationship, friendship between our two countries extends far beyond any two people.

Trudeau said he has tremendous faith in the American people and that he looks forward to working with whoever they chose to serve as President.

Though their conversations and reason for meeting ranged from security concerns and immigration, to the economy and climate changeall important topics for the two neighbor countries, the bulk of the questions at the mid-morning press conference focused on the presidential race. Obama was asked to comment on whether or not he feels responsible for being such a polarizing figure and paving the way for a presidential candidate like Trump. Obama acknowledged that he had been blamed for a lot during his time as president, but said the notion that he was somehow responsible for the Republican primary was novel.

What Im not going to do is validate some notion that the Republican crackup... is a consequence of actions that Ive taken, Obama said.

The President closed the press conference on a note of optimism, once again affirming that the American-Canadian relationship will remain strong.

Its my hope that the incoming president agrees with me on everything, Obama said. But if that doesnt happen, the U.S.-Canadian relationship will be fine.",[]

time.com,2016-03-10 13:19:17,"California Bill Would Let Uber, Lyft Drivers Negotiate",['Katy Steinmetz'],"



A San Diego-area lawmaker wants to boost workplace rights for independent contractors that make a living through platforms such as Uber, Lyft and Postmates.

California Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez, a Democrat, announced Wednesday that she has authored legislation to give new rights to those workers, including negotiating as a group and boycotting or critiquing a hosting platforms business practices. As few as 10 workers could join together to claim those rights. Gonzalez, who has previously served as a labor leader, argued that our laws must catch up to that innovation in order to do right by the workers in this state.



Uber and Lyft have lobbied hard against other measures that would have a big effect on their business, though they have not yet spoken out directly on the details of Gonzalez bill. California Gov. Jerry Brown has not commented. But an industry trade group associated with Uber has critiqued the measure.

For millions of Americans, the sharing economy is an important safety net that offers flexible earning opportunities, a spokesperson for the Internet Association told the San Francisco Chronicle, adding that this proposal unfairly targets the Internet sector in a way that could hurt the very people it purports to help.

A Lyft spokeswoman told the Chronicle that the company agrees with Gonzalez that Lyfts workers are independent contractors, but did not comment further.

There are many types of independent contractorsfrom plumbers to taxi drivers to music teachers to consultantsand the California measure would not solely target those workers who get gigs through smartphone apps. According to the Chronicle, the central requirement is that the hosting platform directly profits from the workers labor.

Gonzalezs legislation follows the Seattle City councils unanimous vote last December to become the first city to allow Lyft and Uber drivers to unionize, though the mayor has neither signed nor vetoed the measure. The primary sponsor of the bill, council member Mike OBrien, argued that such a change was necessary to give drivers a voice on the job, given that the platforms control factors such as the rate that drivers earn per mile. This bill was only introduced out of necessity after witnessing how little power drivers themselves had in working for a living wage, he said. Uber and Lyft testified against the measure.

Read More: EXCLUSIVE: See How Big the Gig Economy Really Is

Currently there are two classes of workers in America: employees and independent contractors. Though the law determining who is which is notoriously complicated, one crucial element is control: Because employees are typically subject to much greater control (being told when and how to work), they are considered more vulnerable and afforded more protections through labor laws.

Several lawsuits have been filed over the status of workers who have made income through ride-app and tasking platforms, alleging that they have been controlled like employees and are therefore owed associated benefits. In California, one example is gas money: If Uber drivers are employees, theyre owed reimbursements. If they are freelancers, they are not. Such costs can have a significant impact on both the workers and companys bottom lines.

Proposals like Gonzalez and OBriens seek a kind of middle ground, giving more power to what they see as vulnerable workers without arguing that they need to be reclassified. In court, Uber has argued that if it were forced to treat drivers as employees, the companys entire business model would have to change. Drivers would lose their flexibility and have to be organized in set shifts, the companys lawyers have argued, and would be banned from multi-apping, a common practice of drivers being available for jobs on multiple platforms at the same time.

Part of the reason that such companies have grown so fastand that its so easy for new workers to sign up and start working on themis that these billion-dollar startups have been able to sidestep the logistics and costs associated with employees, like remitting payroll taxes. In her statement, Gonzalez acknowledged the complexity of the situation, echoing the tone of Seattles OBrien. The intent of this legislation is to create an environment where innovation can continue to happen, he said after the city council bill passed, but not at the expense of the workers.",[]

Republican Florida Gov. Rick Scott declined to directly answer questions about whether he thinks Muslims in Florida hate America, leading MSNBC to end an interview early on Thursday.

Scott skirted several questions about Islamic attitudes toward the U.S. during the interview on MSNBCs Morning Joe, choosing instead to describe Florida as a melting pot where various demographics get along.

The questions followed comments made Wednesday by Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, who accused Islam of hating the western world. I think Islam hates us, Trump said, supporting his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. There is a tremendous hatred there. We have to get to the bottom of it.



In the Thursday interview, Joe Scarborough asked Scott if he would tell Trump to walk back the comments. In response, Scott said he opposes the immigration of Syrian refugees who havent been fully vetted.

Do you personally think that Islam is a religion that hates America? Scarborough said.

We have a lot of Muslims that live in our state. Weve got a lot of Latin Americans that live in our state, Scott said. We all get along. We love people moving to our state and coming here as tourists. Were a great melting pot. Thats what I can tell you about our state.

Earlier in the segment, Scott declined to endorse a candidate for the Republican nomination, saying he trusted voters to make the best decision.

Donald Trump accused Islam of hating the western world in an interview Wednesday, the latest in the GOP Presidential candidates attacks on the religion.

I think Islam hates us, Trump told Anderson Cooper on CNN, after the host asked him whether Islam was at war with the West. There is a tremendous hatred there. We have to get to the bottom of it.

Cooper then asked whether Trump believed the hatred was in the Islamic religion itself.

Youre going to have to figure that out, Trump replied. Youll get another Pulitzer.

We cant allow people who have this hatred coming into the United States and of people who are not Muslim.



Trump argued that its very hard to separate radical Islam from the mainstream practice of the religion. Its very hard to define, he said. Because you dont know whos who.

time.com,2016-03-10 14:23:43,Don't Blame Me For Trump's Rise,['Maya Rhodan'],"



President Obama, who has faced criticism in recent days for his role in the emergence of Donald Trump as a viable Presidential candidate, said Thursday that he is not to blame for the Republican crackup.

Conservative lawmakers and columnists have recently taken to blaming Obama for the rise of leading Republican presidential candidate, arguing that the Presidents partisanship has provoked an extreme response. In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal last week, former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said Obama created the very rancor he now rails against.

Mr. Obama likes to bemoan the increasing partisan divides across the country, as if he were merely a passive observer at best and a victim at worst. Uncharacteristically, the president is being too modest, Jindal wrote. There would be no Donald Trump, dominating the political scene today if it were not for President Obama.



The left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America is keeping a running tally of all of the conservative voices holding Obama responsible for Trumps success.

On Thursday, during a joint press conference with the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President Obama fired back on such claims.

I have been blamed by Republicans for many things, but being blamed for their primaries and who theyre selecting for their party, uh, is novel, Obama said.

President Obama admitted, as he did in the 2016 State of the Union, that one of his regrets as president was his inability to bridge the partisan divide in politics, which has only grown during his two terms in office. I do all kinds of soul searching in terms ofare there things I can do better to make sure that were unifying the country, Obama said.

What Im not going to do is validate some notion that the Republican crackup thats been taking place is a consequence of actions that Ive taken, he added.

Instead, the President blamed the Republican political elite and partisan media for stoking the flames of anger and discontent.

Objectively, its fair to say that the Republican political elites and many of the information outlets...have been feeding the Republican base for the last 7 years a notion that everything I do is to be opposed. That cooperation or compromise somehow is a betrayal, Obama said.

The tone of that politics, which I certainly have not contributed toI dont think I was the one to prompt questions about my birth certificate, for example, he continued. What youre seeing within the Republican party is to some degree all those efforts over a course of time creating an environment where someone like a Donald Trump can thrive.

The President also called on Republicans who are troubled by Trump to think more on their own role in his candidacy.

I think its very important for them to reflect on what it is about the politics theyve engaged in that allows the circus weve been seeing to transpire and to do some introspection because ultimately I want an effective Republican party, Obama said.",[]

Did you file your 2012 income tax return with the IRS? If not, you could be in for a windfall.

According to the IRS, around one million taxpayers did not file tax returns in 2012 and as a result, theres around $950 million in unclaimed refunds waiting to be collected. But to get the money, you need to file by April 18, 2016. After that, it becomes everybodys moneythe IRS isnt obligated to hold onto it after three years.

IRS Commissioner John Koskinen noted that students and other low-earners are likely to be the rightful owners of these refunds and encouraged them to file a return. Dont forget, theres no penalty for filing a late return if youre due a refund, he said in a press release.



If youre one of these people and are wondering whether its worth it to try your hand at a Form 1040 or buy TurboTax, the IRS says the median refund for 2012 is around $718. However, the refund will be withheld to those who owe taxes or backed child support.

Failing to file would not only mean missing out on potential refunds, but for longer-income filers, missing out on the Earned Income Tax Credit that can be worth up to $5,891, according to the IRS.

BERLIN (AP)  Germanys federal criminal police said Thursday they are in possession of files containing personal data on members of ISIS and believe them to be authentic.

The announcement came after Britains Sky News reported it had obtained 22,000 ISIS files on the border with Turkey and Syria, files that detail ISIS fighters real names, where they were from, telephone numbers, and even names of those who sponsored and recruited the militants.

Though the significance of these files is yet to be gauged, they could be the largest yet treasure trove of documents found on ISIS and the most significant leak on its past and present fighters and operations across the Mideast.



They could also shape the campaign against the extremist group, which emerged from al-Qaida in Iraq. The cache, exposing its members and their families, could undermine its future ability to recruit and inspire would-be members.

US Army Col. Steve Warren, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS, said the information could help the coalition fight ISIS by aiding in a crack-down on ISISs foreign fighter networks.

He said that while he was not able to verify the documents, he hoped that if there is a media outlet that has these names and numbers, I hope they publish them. This would help bring attention to the problem of foreign fighters joining ISIS, and would help law enforcement crack down on the problem, he said.

This would allow the law enforcement apparatus across the world to become much more engaged and begin to help do what we can to stem this flow of foreign fighters  so were hopeful that its accurate and if so we certainly plan to do everything we can to help, he said.

Sky said the files were passed on to them on a memory stick stolen from the head of ISISs internal security police by a former fighter who had grown disillusioned with the group.

Germanys Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported it had also obtained dozens of similar files on the Turkey-Syria border, where it said ISIS files and videos were widely available from anti-IS Kurdish fighters and also members of ISIS itself.

Both Sky and the Sueddeutsche reported that the documents were forms with 23 questions filled out by recruits when they were inducted into ISIS. Sky said they included nationals from at least 51 countries.

Markus Koths, a spokesman for Germanys Federal Criminal Police Office, the Bundeskriminalamt, told The Associated Press that it had ISIS personnel file documents such as those obtained by the Sueddeutsche Zeitung. He would not comment on specifics about either the Sky or Sueddeutsche reports amid an ongoing investigation, and also would not say how German intelligence obtained the documents or how long they have been in its possession, for tactical reasons.

He did say, however, we believe there is a high probability that these documents are genuine.

These documents are of significance for us for prosecutorial reasons and for threat prevention, he said.

Similar documents, which have not yet been independently verified, were posted by Zaman al-Wasl, a pro-Syrian opposition website.

The documents that Zaman al-Wasl published had the word secret at the bottom while on the top it had the name Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) on one corner and the General Directorate of Borders on the left corner on top.

The documents posted by the website stated that the fighters entered areas under ISIL control in 2013, except for one of a Turkish citizen born in 1989 who entered on May 12, 2014.

The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant was the official name of the group before al-Baghdadi declared the Islamic State caliphate in June 2014 after the group captured wide areas of Iraq including the northern city of Mosul, the countrys second largest.

ISIL was formed in 2013 when al-Qaidas branches in Iraq and Syria known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Nusra Front briefly merged. After they split in early 2013, those under al-Baghdadis comment kept using the name ISIL until the caliphate was declared.

The date of the documents suggest they may not provide information on ISISs current membership, but will offer insight into fighters recruited in 2013 as well as ISISs bureaucratic systems.

Germanys Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told the dpa news agency that the material would give authorities a better chance to track down and prosecute people who had fought with IS.

There are no clear estimates of how many ISIS fighters there are in Iraq and Syria, but the numbers range between 30,000 and 100,000. A CIA assessment in late 2014 put the number of ISIS fighters at around 31,500.",[]

The President also called on Republicans who are troubled by Trump to think more on their own role in his candidacy.

I think its very important for them to reflect on what it is about the politics theyve engaged in that allows the circus weve been seeing to transpire and to do some introspection because ultimately I want an effective Republican party, Obama said.",[]

Yum Brands YUM BRANDS YUM 0.16% owned Taco Bell upped the ante in the breakfast wars, launching a nationwide $1 breakfast menu in a bid to compete with other fast-food chains that are cashing in on the trend.

The $1 morning value menu will feature new items such as the mini skillet bowl, breakfast soft taco along with the grilled breakfast burrito, which it already offers.

Taco Bell is the latest fast-food chain to jump on the wagon of offering breakfast items, encouraged by a shift in eating habits away from traditional cereals and a preference for breakfast items throughout the day.



Taco Bells dollar meal also adds heat to the value price war which was sparked off by the all-day breakfast offered by McDonalds MCDONALD'S CORP. forcing competitors Wendys THE WENDY'S COMPANY to introduce the 4 for $4 and Burger Kings 5 for $4 meals.

McDonalds introduced its all-day breakfast in the United States in October last, year a move that buoyed its latest quarterly results.",[]

time.com,2016-03-10 15:14:44,Justin Trudeau and Barack Obama,['Karl Vick Washington D C'],"+ READ ARTICLE





It was easy to imagine a torch being passed as Barack Obama welcomed Justin Trudeau on Thursday morning, throwing wide open a White House that seven-odd years ago brimmed with the same energya handsome new leader, and his enchanting young familythat Ottawa now beams out to the world. In case the point eluded anyone, the Canadian premier opened his remarks in the Rose Garden by quoting JFK: President Kennedys wise words on our friendship, that what unites us is far greater than what divides us.

Trudeau was talking about Canada and the U.S., of course, but the observation was no less true of the leaders, who have hit it off famously since he took office in November. What unites Obama and Trudeau is a shared progressive agenda, a world view that embraces the diversity so unsettling to many others, and an insistence on staying positive. He campaigned on a message of hope and of change, Obama observed, without needing to add why that might sound familiar. We see ourselves in each other, guided by the same values, the president added, again referring nominally to nations, though it was clear enough the two men like each other. A lot. After only two meetings, Obama calls Trudeau Justin and Trudeau calls Obama Barack. The State Dinner the U.S. President is throwing the Canadian Thursday night is just the tenth of his two termsand the first honoring a Canadian leader in two decades.

But there was also a bittersweet quality to the visit. On the sidewalk beside Pennsylvania Avenue on Thursday morning, Trudeaus children gave each other piggy back rides down the steps of Blair House, then, having reached the sidewalk, twirled in circles from the iron supports of the canvas awning, while their glamorous mother, the former TV personality Sophie Gergoire, chatted amid the waiting black SUVs. At Andrews, where the Canadians landed Wednesday afternoon, the younger boy, Hadrian, stole the show by seeing how far he could dig his hands into the front pockets of his cargo pants as his parents stood at attention for the Star Spangled Banner. These arent the Kennedys. Theyre Canadas versionTrudeaus; Justin and his siblings were the ones frolicking during the 15 years their father, Pierre, led Canada, without stinting on glamour.

But the comparisons today are with the Obamas, who seven years ago brought their extraordinary vitality to the executive mansion, and are no longer so new or brimming with quite so much youthful hope. Obama, who at 54 is 10 years Trudeaus senior, made jokes about the need to dye graying hair before anyone notices, and a reporters question that implied Im old and creaky. But while planning the celebrated visit, the two leaders had talked about what is indeed fleeting. What Barack pointed out to me about how fast his daughters grew in the seven years since that first night of his electoral victory really struck home to me, Trudeau said. The reminders are everywhere. As Obama ushered him to his limousine after their joint news conference, the curving walkway passed the playground the president had put in just outside the Oval Office in 2009, when his girls were 7 and 10. It doesnt get much use any more.",[]
