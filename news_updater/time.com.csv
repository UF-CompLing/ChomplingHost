Microsofts new ad campaign poses one simple question: Can you name any female inventors?

The young science-loving girls featured in the spot can rattle off a list of male inventors like Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison, but are completely stumped when asked to name a single female creator. In school it was always a male inventor, I just realized, said one girl. The ad points out that not everything in this world was man-made and proceeds to list some of the many, many female inventors who often go unrecognized for their contributions to the science and tech world. Women like Mary Anderson, who invented windshield wipers; Ada Lovelace, who wrote the first-ever computer algorithm; and Gertrude Belle Elion, who created important drugs that battle HIV, malaria and leukemia.

The ad, pegged to International Womens Day, encourages the next generation of young women to get out there and invent and #makewhatsnext.",[]

time.com,2016-03-09 14:51:31,How the Death of CDs Is Changing How We Listen to Music,['Victor Luckerson'],"



Kanye West has, at various times in his career, attacked the prison-industrial complex, Wiz Khalifa, homophobia in hip-hop, water bottles on airplanes and late night televisions Jimmy Kimmel.

Next up on his wide-ranging hit list: compact discs.

I was thinking about not making CDs ever again... Only streaming, West tweeted March 7. No more CDs from me. The outspoken rapper said that his 2013 album Yeezus, which was released in a clear jewel case with no album artwork, was an open casket for the dying music format.

Make no mistake: Kanye is going to release more albums. Hes already hyping another project slated for this summer. And other artists will continue to release compact discs for years to come. Americans bought 125 million CDs last year, after all.



But the albums role as the structural spine of the industry is over. This shift is fundamentally changing how music is created, distributed and interpreted.

Popular music has been beholden to technology for decades. The seven-inch vinyl records known as 45s could only hold about 4.5 minutes of music on either side, so artists like Elvis focused on short, individual songs that could stand on their own. That changed in the 1960s, when acts like The Beatles and The Beach Boys helped make the LPa 12-inch vinyl record that plays around 44 minutes of musicthe primary mode of recorded musical expression.

The advent of CDs brought yet another change. Record labels tried to justify CDs higher prices by filling up as much of their available 74 minutes as possible. The extra bloat was in turn upended by the rise of MP3s, which let listeners easily buy (or steal) single songs from the comfort of their computer. In the words of Sum 41, customers were freed up to get all killer, no filler.

Through all these changes, the one constant was the nature of the monetary relationship between fan and artist. Until recently, listeners paid a certain amount of money for a certain amount of music and owned it forever. But streaming services like Spotify have changed all that. Now listeners pay for access, forking over $10 a month to effectively rent millions of songs. (Or they pay with their attention by watching or listening to ads.)

The result is that fans can now choose to utterly disregard the album as a single, creative work. YouTube, the most popular source of online music, places little emphasis on albums. On Spotify, a majority of songs are accessed by playlists  the companys app didnt even offer an easy way to save albums for later listening until 2014. The main pitch of Apple Music is curated playlists that pluck from a variety of different works.

The song is the unit, says Catherine Moore, a music business professor at New York University. The whole concept of the album as an umbrella under which several songs fit doesnt really matter anymore.

Kanyes latest release, The Life of Pablo, feels like its purposefully playing with listeners fast-shifting expectations. Kanye erratically live-tweeted the final days of the albums development, which included multiple title changes, complete rearrangements of the tracklist and memes galore. He has said the album, currently an exclusive on streaming service Tidal, will never go on sale. A single cryptic tweet promising to fix one of the albums songs led fans to assume a remixed version of the album will arrivefor purchase?in the future.

Combined, these factors have led many facts to view the Tidal-released album as a kind of beta version. The Internet is home to plenty of fan-made reorderings of the tracklist that include alternate takes on the Pablo songs or leaked, unofficial music from the albums recording sessions. And why not? Pablos existence is entirely abstract. The version floating in Tidals cloud could change or disappear at any moment, according to Kanyes whims. (Hundreds of thousands of pirates will be able to hold onto the album forever, though.)

Other big artists are also finding success outside the traditional album release structure. Canadian rapper Drake released two feature-length mixtapes last year. But his biggest recent release was the music video for Hotline Bling, a song that originated on SoundCloud and hasnt yet found its way to an album. Beyonce, the reigning queen of surprise releases, dropped a politically-charged song and video the day before the Super Bowl. But theyve been used to promote her upcoming tour, not an LP.

Instead of album sales, these artists are vying for your attention. They want to be top of mind when listeners are deciding who to place in their Spotify playlists or which tours they want to attend this year. Releasing an album is no longer the only way  or even the best way  to do that.

What can [artists] put in front of fans that theyre going to want to keep? Moore asks. Keep can mean play repeatedly and send to your friends. It doesnt mean keep in the sense of having something physical.

Artists may not have much of a choice but to adapt. CD sales continued a decade-plus decline in 2015, falling more than 10%, according to Nielsen. Digital album sales, a short-term bright spot for the industry, fell about 3% in a decline thats likely to continue. At the same time, the number of streams across platforms such as Spotify, YouTube and Google Play doubled during 2015. (Thats without counting Apple Music, which is now the second-most-popular subscription streaming service.)

These streams pay a pittance compared to albums. A mainstream artist can earn between $2 and about $3.40 for a CD sale depending on the terms of his or her contract, according to The Root. Spotify pays rights holders between $0.006 to $0.0084 per stream, with only a portion going to the artist. YouTube offers even less. Its no surprise to see artists focusing on efforts that can help them stay consistently relevant instead of popping up every two to three years with a set of 15 carefully manicured songs.

Expect to see more experimentation as album sales continue to decline. Artists may officially release the B-sides from a prestigious album right after the fact, instead of waiting for a tenth-anniversary remaster, as Kendrick Lamar just did with the release of his untitled unmastered EP. Instead of releasing an album all at once, a band might release songs slowly over the course of a year, like the indie band White Violet is doing right now. Major artistic statements arent going to disappear from music, but in the world of streaming, theyll look very different.

The money will come, says Moore, but not in a predictable way.",[]

The issue is at the heart of the dispute in Oregon

A group of armed men in Oregon seized an empty federal building over the weekend in protest of Dwight and Steven Hammonds prison sentences for arson on federal land, drawing new focus to the millions of acres of land the U.S. government owns across the country.

Tensions have long simmered over the fact that the federal government owns 28% of all U.S. landespecially in the West, where federal agencies often own far more than that. The federal building occupied by militia members in Oregon sits in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, which represents just a small fraction of the 53% of Oregon land owned by the government, including vast national forests. And that pales in comparison to Nevada, where Uncle Sam claims 85% of land. (Sons of Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher who clashed with the federal government over grazing rights, are helping to lead the new Oregon protest.)

All 10 states where the government owns the most land, shown in the list below, fall in the West. Many treaties required states to surrender any claim to federal lands within their border as a prerequisite for admission to the Union, according to a 2014 Congressional Research Service report. Competing and conflicting use of the land remains an issue in places where the federal government is a large landholder, the report found.

Interracial couples have become increasingly common in the past decade

NBC recently debuted a Friday-night sitcom, Truth Be Told, that features an interracial couple and promises that no topic is off-limits. While the reception was generally cold, some critics were at least sympathetic to the attempt to feature the changing face of American marriages.

If TV shows want to stay abreast of the times, however, theyre going to have to start including a lot more interracial couples, even if the plot lines dont read like college diversity seminars. Mixed-race marriages are growing at rapid rates, according to a TIME analysis of Census data. The above interactive chart shows marriage rates for any combination of race or ethnicity and gender of each spouse.

While the number of white men wedding white women has dropped almost 7 percent since 2000, marriages between white men and non-white womeneither Hispanic, Black, Asian, American Indian, or Multiracialis up 36 percent. (The reverseWhite women and non-White menis up 33 percent.)

In some cases, the disparity between genders is more pronounced. In 2013, there were over 130,000 marriages between White men and Black women, while there were nearly 320,000 marriages between White women and Black men. Both combinations are trending heavily upward.

time.com,,How Valuable Is Your Primary Vote?,[],"How Valuable Is Your Primary Vote?

Use this calculator to find out how much your vote influences the outcome of your party's presidential primary.

Its a quadrennial complaint across 48 states: Why do Iowa and New Hampshire seem to play such an oversized role in picking the next president? The process for selecting presidential nominees is not remotely democratic. First, not everyone votes at once, making earlier votes more consequential in narrowing the field. Second, while some states invite tens of thousands of people to weigh in on the allegiance of a few delegates, others hold Byzantine caucuses in which a few thousand people determine a swath of representatives to the convention.

Which got us wondering: Is there a way to figure out how influential any particular votestretching from Maine to Californiais in the primary process? Candidates are nominated at the conventions this summer not based on the share of the vote theyve won but on the number of delegates allotted to them through voting. We devised a simple formula to measure the impact of each states ballot. Try it out below.

The reasoning behind the ranking is simple. First, we estimate the ratio of pledged delegates to voters using historical turnout data from a variety of sources. (Many states also send unpledged delegates to the convention, but these delegates are not bound by the voters wishes.) States with higher delegate-to-voter ratios are considered more influential, since any one voter has a bigger impact on the outcome. Turnout is estimated by the higher turnout figure of the last two contested primaries in each party: 2008 or 2012 for Republicans and 2004 or 2008 for Democrats.

Since the calendar is staggered, we also consider when in the process a state votes. Those that hold primaries or caucuses late in the process are less likely to be influential since theres a greater chance that the race will already be decided. This factor is determined by looking at the percentage of delegates that remain to be allocated on the day a given state votes.

time.com,,See the Entire History of the Oscars Diversity Problem in One Chart,[],"See the Entire History of the Oscars Diversity Problem in One Chart

Last weeks Oscar nominations have sparked outrage for their lack of diversity with zero non-white nominees in the acting categories for the second year in a row. An analysis of the full 92-year history of the Academy Awards shows that Hollywoods highest honors have lagged the population on issues of race and representation.

In all, as the graphic below shows, 6.4% of acting nominations of the total 1,668 since the awards began in 1929 have gone to non-white actors. Isolating for the past 25 years, only 56 actors11.2% of the totalwere non-white.

This years lack of diversity has led Oscar-nominated director Spike Lee and actress Jada Pinkett Smith to promise to boycott the ceremony. On Monday, the president of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, issued a statement declaring that the effects of recent efforts to diversify the Academys ranks are not coming as fast as we would like. She added that the organization will soon conduct a review of its recruitment practices to ensure much-needed diversity in our 2016 class and beyond.

In the Oscars first several decades, the nomination of even one non-white actor was an exception to the rule, few and far between. In some ways, this tracks with the homogeneity of the country that produced these films. Between 1940 and 1950, according to the U.S. Census, America remained 89 percent white. (During that period, there were 3 non-white nominees out of 200 chosen, or 1.5%.) In past 25 years, the number of non-white actors earning nominations has steadily increasedpeaking at 7 in 2006. Since 2010, 7.5% of acting nominees have been non-white.

The dominant reaction to this years crop of Oscar nominees, announced on Jan. 14, has been dismay at the groups homogeneity coming during a year that saw a number of worthy performances from actors of color, including Will Smith in Concussion, Idris Elba in Beasts of No Nation, Michael B. Jordan and Tessa Thompson in Creed, Teyonah Parris in Chi-Raq, Samuel L. Jackson in The Hateful Eight and Benicio Del Toro in Sicario. Their names did not receive enough of the Academys votes to make the cut. Not since 1979-1980 has the Academy gone two years without nominating a non-white actor in any of the top 4 categories.

As of 2012, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences was, according to a Los Angeles Times study, 94% white. Many attribute the paucity of nominations for non-white actors to this lack of diversity. Others point to a film industry in which people of color have historically had less access to financing, fewer opportunities to direct and a continuous need to contend with studios fearssometimes explicitthat movies with non-white leading actors wont make enough money.

Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders arrive in Miami on Wednesday for the last Democratic debate in March, one day after splitting victories and delegates in Mississippi and Michigan.

Wednesday nights debate will likely be intense: with Sanders showing new signs of life, Clinton will hope to quickly dispatch him. But as she looks ahead to a general election, shell need to make sure she doesnt alienate Sanders supporters either. Sanders, meanwhile, will drive home his message against political corruption and income inequality with the ferocity of an insurgent who may not have a national platform for much longer.

While Sanders staged a morale-boosting upset in Michigan, Clintons lopsided victory in Mississippi won her most of the delegates up for grabs on Tuesday. She is well on her way toward the nomination with a large lead in pledged delegates.



Sunday nights debate in Flint, as most of the contests, appeared to end in a wash. But even with Sanders hewing close to his core platform and Clinton again demonstrating her nimble grasp of policy, the tone was feistier and more urgent than in previous debates.

Sanders was sometimes dismissive of Clinton on Sunday night, adopting a pitch that some critics said was patronizing of the former Secretary of State. His hyperactively wagging finger and bass protestationsExcuse me, Im talking, he said to Clinton on Sundaywere supposed to turn off Michigan voters.

But Sanders still beat expectations by winning Michigan, with some speculating that Clintons attacks against Sanders and claims that he opposed the auto bailout backfired.

On Wednesday, Clinton will likely talk about her economic plans to create manufacturing jobs and paint Sanders as a backward-looking candidate, as she did on Sundays debate. You know, if were going to argue about the 1990s instead of talking about the future Clinton said several times.

Clintons aides say she has the advantage in looking ahead and explaining drawn-out policy proposals. I think Senator Sanders has continued to look backwards and talk about the past in terms of economic policy, said Robby Mook, Clintons campaign manager. What voters are looking is for candidates to look forward to the future.

Clinton heads into contests after the debate that should be favorable to her, including Florida, Illinois and North Carolina, while Sanders sees opportunities in states like Ohio and Washington.",[]

Here's how roles are opening up for women

The Army permanently opened Ranger School to all women this month, just weeks after two female soldiers graduated from the school for the first time. That decision is part of a series of efforts that will expand where and how women serve in the U.S. armed forces.

On Jan. 1, 2016, with the repeal of a 1994 rule that excluded women from direct combat assignments, all positions in the U.S. military will be open to women unless the services can convince Defense Secretary Ashton Carter that some should remain closed. Currently, women account for 15.3% of active-duty personnel in the U.S. military. The Marines have the lowest percentage of women, at 7.6%. Twenty of 336 Marine jobs are closed to women. The Air Force and Navy have the highest percentage of women serving: 17.8% for the Navy, and 18.7% for the Air Force.

According to a report by Women In International Security, 255,000 additional positions will open to female service members in 2016.

Women have been involved in the U.S. military since the Revolutionary War, but were only made a permanent fixture with the Womens Armed Service Integration Act of 1948, which prohibited women from combat positions.

A growing demand for equality combined with reduced male enlistments led the Department of Defense to steadily ease bans on how closely women could get to the front lines. And as the lines between combat and noncombat roles became increasingly blurred in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the 1994 rule barring women from direct ground combat has become increasingly contested.

In 2003, enemy forces in Iraq captured three Army women assigned to a noncombat unit providing logistic support to ground unitshighlighting the threat to women, often without the recognition or promotion that comes with combat positions. As of April 2015, 161 women had lost their lives and 1,1015 were wounded since President George W. Bush declared the Global War on Terror on Sept. 20, 2011.

The military services have until next month to explain to Carter why women should continue to be barred from any military assignments beginning next year.",[]

Online food delivery company GrubHub, which now serves more than 20 million meals each quarter, analyzed delivery orders sent to more than 100 colleges in 47 states during the 2014-2015 academic year to see which students are making healthy choices at meal time. (The company used e-mail addresses ending in .edu to determine which orders came from people associated with college and universities.)

The University of Buffalo, home to 30,000, students, leads the competition when it comes to making healthy choices when students log online for food delivery. To determine the most health conscious schools, GrubHub analyze deliveries, looking for the highest percentage of orders at schools that contained any of 31 options which suggested students had made healthy food choices, like substituting a salad for another side dish or telling restaurants to go light on dressing.

What schools are most often ordering vegetables? The University of North Carolina tops the list, according to GrubHubs analysis, followed by University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University, Harvard University and the University of Virginia.

Take this interactive quiz to find out

President Barack Obama is now revisiting an issue that marked the very beginning of his presidency: Equal pay for men and women. On Jan. 29, seven years to the day after Obama signed into effect the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, he acknowledged that the wage gap still persists to an alarming degreeand introduced several new measures to help address the problem.

One of these efforts is a proposal to increase the amount of data the federal government receives about employee pay. But a great deal of this information already exists in detailed data collected by the Census in their annual American Community Survey. According to a new analysis by TIME and Motto, women earn less than men at every age range, from 15% less between ages 22 and 25 to a staggering 38% less between ages 51 and 64.

We analyzed the wages earned by more than 15 million Americans surveyed by the Census Bureau between 2008 and 2012, who were classified into 460 different occupational categories. We found that 372 of those occupations contained enough information to determine that there was a statistically significant gender pay gap in at least one of the seven age ranges we examined.

In all, we found 1,490 combinations of age and occupation in which there existed a statistically significant difference in how much men and women make. Only 22 of those 1,490 involved women making more money than men. All 22 situations where women out-earned men occurred among the youngest cohorts in an occupation. (The gaps are statistically significant to at least a 90% level of confidence, the same threshold the Census uses).

There was not a single occupation where women age 30 and above took home significantly higher average salaries than their male colleagues, even if they start out making as much or more.

Looking at the earning patterns for secondary-school teachers helps tell this story. From ages 22-25, women actually earn 10% more than their male colleagues. By the time those teachers turn 30, there is no statistical difference between them and their male peers. By 35, the men make more. Its a pattern we see repeated with librarians, social workers, secretaries and preschool teachers. Notably, these are all female-dominated professions. In male-dominated professions like engineering and finance, women typically make less from the very start.

Some occupations stand out as particularly egregious in our research. For example, the tax-preparation industry, where we had a sample of over 5,000 people, has one of the worst records of pay disparity of any job in the country. From ages 26-30, female tax preparers, on average, earn around half as much as their male counterparts. It gets worse from there. Among those between 41-50, women in the tax-preparation business bring home only a third as much as their male colleagues.

One explanation for pay disparity is that many occupations offer higher- and lower-paying tracks. We could hypothesize, for instance, that more female lawyers choose public service and more male lawyers choose high-paying firms, perhaps explaining why male lawyers in their 40s earn 51% more than their female counterparts. But the sheer breadth of occupations in which men make more than women suggests something other than self-selection into tracks. For instance, male dishwashers in their 50s are paid 20% more than female dishwashers. Male janitors in their 40s are paid 63% more.

Joining a profession where women make up the majority of workers may not give women a pay advantage eitheror even parity. There is research to show that in female-dominated professions, men get promoted more quickly than women do in their field, an effect that has been termed the glass escalator. Male and female registered nurses, our research shows, make roughly the same pay in the youngest cohorts, only to have a significant wage gap open up in their 30s and beyond.

The survey does confirm that there are more men than women in certain high-paying professions (financial analysts, dentists) and more women in certain low-paying professions (teaching assistants, telemarketers). But within all of those professions, men still make significantly more. Having more women in higher-paying professions, in other words, would not eliminate the overall gap.

Some point to the fact that women remain primary caregivers in many families as the cause for their wages lagging behind those of men. A woman might leave the work force to raise a child and when she returns enter at a lower wage and never catch up. While this may happen in some places, childcare alone cannot account for the vast inequality we measured across almost every profession and age group.

The calculations in our analysis exclude anyone who did not earn an income, but do include part-time workers. While men who work part-time still tend to earn more than women who work part-time, there are some occupations and age cohorts where female part-timers outnumber male part-timers. This could explain some of the gap in those groups, but it cannot explain it all. Researchers found that among full-time workers only there is still an intractable gap, even after controlling for things like occupational segregation and employment gaps due to maternity and childcare.

Alarmingly, the discrimination happens not just during promotion season but when a job candidate first shows up at a company. In a variety of professions, male-dominated or female-dominated, experiments have shown that employers are biased toward male job candidates. In a 2012 double-blind study, science faculty at research universities were asked to rate identical resumes for a lab tech position, one with a male name and one with a female name. When the name on the resume was John, faculty suggested a higher starting salary than when the name on the resume was Jennifer.

A school district in Newark, N.J. is shutting off its water fountains after testing found lead in building drinking water, according to state health officials.

Drinking water at 30 schools in Newark tested positive for levels of lead higher than the federal standard, according to a joint announcement from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the Newark Public Schools. The Environmental Protection Agencys action level for lead, the threshold requiring additional action, is 15 parts per billion and drinking water in Newarks schools ranged from 16-558 ppb.

Of the some 300 water samples taken from the Newark school buildings, 59 were above the EPAs action levels for testing and no building had more than four samples above the action level. The water in Newarks schools is nowhere near some of the high levels of lead in Flint, Michiganone home there tested as high as 13,200 ppb.

time.com,,Hollywoods Glaring Gender Gap,[],"Hollywoods Glaring Gender Gap

How much harder is it to make in Hollywood as a woman? While male actors see their careers peak at the age of 46, female actors reach their professional pinnacles at age 30, according to a TIME analysis of the careers of over 6,000 actors and actresses. And things arent getting better in the film industry: Women today who are under the age of 60 are seeing the number of roles they are cast in decline faster than their older peers once did. At the same time, younger men are seeing their careers peak even later than their older peers.

The plight of sexism in Hollywood recently reached the forefront when it was revealed that 51-year-old Sandra Bullock is playing the lead in Our Brand is Crisis, a role originally intended for George Clooney. And as Vulture noted recently, Hollywood is fond of pairing young actresses like Emma Stone with considerably older male leads.

The problem is not a new phenomenon in the workplace, where men reach their peak earning potential much later than women. Hollywood is not only guilty of this same sexism, but displays an even greater disparity than most industries.

Methodology

To collect a sample of actors and actresses, we compiled the top five leading actors and actresses from the top 5,000 grossing movies in the Internet Movie Database, which stretches back to the 19th century . (While some movies choose to list the cast alphabetically, our spot checks suggest IMDB is good about listing the most prominent roles first in the cast list.) The gender of each actor was imputed from the pronouns in his or her mini-biography, a method that appears to have very high accuracy.

After parsing out those with incomplete information on their pages, we were left with a list of 6,000 actors and actresses who have appeared in a lead role in at least one major movie. For each of those individuals, we then looked at every movie he or she has appeared in and his or her age at the time. The graphs above show a moving total of roles over a five year period. For example, the value at age 40 represents the total roles a person received between ages 38 and 42 while the value at age 45 represents the total roles a person received between ages 43 and 47.",[]

Over the past 115 years, the global Catholic population has more than quadrupled, from 266 million in 1900 to 1.2 billion in 2015, according to the World Christian Database. This growth mirrors the worlds soaring population in the same period, with Catholics hovering around 17% of the total population throughout. Despite unchanged global representation, Catholic geographic distribution has altered dramatically, with massive growth sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia and waning numbers in Europe.

As of 2015, Europe had 267 million total Catholics, second only to South Americahome to the most populous Catholic country, Brazilwith 335 million faithful. But Europe is the only continent that will see a shrinking Catholic population in the coming years, according to projections by the World Christian Database. By 2030, Catholics in North America and Africa will soar past European estimates. African Catholics will even pass their peers in South America, with 450 million followers by 2050.

Declining numbers in Europe largely reflect low birth rates. Take Spain for example, where 1.43 children are born per woman in 2014, compared with 4.8 children per woman in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Growth in Southeast Asia follows a similar trend, like in the Philippines where 3 woman are born on average to each women.

In the United States, about a quarter of the population has remained Catholic for several decades, shows a 2013 Pew Research Center report. In 2015, 73.6 million U.S. Catholics made up 6% of those faithful to Francis worldwide.",[]

See when it actually feels like autumn where you live

Autumn may officially begin on September 22 or 23 each year, but it often feels like the weather takes a few weeks to get the memo.

Here at TIME Labs, we were curious when it begins to actually feel like fall around the country. To do so, we looked at 21 years of data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, defining autumn as the first five consecutive days in which the high was lower than 70 percent of a regions yearly range in temperatures. (For example, a place with yearly lows of 10 and yearly highs of 90 would have a fall line of 66 degrees, which is 70 percent of the distance between those extremes.) Enter your city or county below to see when you can expect cooler weather in your neighborhood.

This sort of analysis is more Farmers Almanac than fine meteorology, but in most cases summer does overstay its welcome for at least a few days. In playing around with our own interactive, we found many instances of fake outs in which there would be a few fall-like days in August or early September followed by a resurgence of sweltering weather.

Methodology

Weather data can be as finicky as the weather itself as measuring stations go on and offline. For this interactive, we looked at the five closest weather stations to the center of a city or county, limiting the search to stations that have been active since 1995. We then averaged the high temperature for each of those stations for each day from Jan. 1, 1995 to the present. In limited cases in rural areas, there were not five stations within a 50-miles radius.",[]

One of the most frustrating aspects of data journalism is that, even when data is publicly available and easy to download, it is often in a format thats nearly impossible to work with.

(WASHINGTON)  Volkswagens top U.S. executive is stepping down amid the companys ongoing emissions cheating scandal, the company announced Wednesday.

U.S. President and CEO Michael Horn is leaving to pursue other opportunities effective immediately, the automaker said in a statement. He had been with the German auto maker for 25 years, assuming his most recent post in 2014.

Horns sudden departure comes as the company continues to grapple with the fallout from its admission last year that nearly 600,000 cars were sold in the U.S. with software that regulators say was designed to cheat on required emissions tests.

The company potentially faces more than $20 billion in fines from state and federal regulators, as well as hundreds of class-action lawsuits filed on behalf of angry vehicle owners. The Justice Department is also conducting a criminal investigation.

It was Horn who was sent to apologize to consumers at a congressional hearing in October. But at the same time, he told lawmakers that top corporate officials had no knowledge of the cheating software installed in 11 million diesel cars worldwide.

To my understanding this was not a corporate decision, this was something individuals did, Horn said, adding that he felt personally deceived.

A federal judge has given the company until March 24 to reach an agreement with the government on recalling the affected vehicles. U.S. District Court Judge Charles R. Breyer wants to know about available technical solutions to fix the cars and the status of negotiations on a potential settlement with affected owners. Volkswagen has not indicated whether it will be able to meet the deadline.

Volkswagen in September admitted to U.S. regulators that it had used illegal software installed in its so-called Clean Diesel engines. The cheating allowed cars to pass laboratory emissions tests while spewing levels of harmful nitrogen oxide at up to 40 times the level allowed when operating on real roads.

The company is negotiating with lawyers for the owners of the defective cars, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board. Both state and federal regulators will have to sign off on any planned recall.",[]

Titled The History of Magic in North America, the online tales will detail the evolution of the previously unexplored North American wizarding world.

The first installment of the series, Fourteenth Century  Seventeenth Century, was published on Rowlings interactive website Pottermore Tuesday and explores the origins of the magical community in the New World. Rowling begins by clarifying that European and African witches and wizards were in contact with their North American brethren long before the country was colonized by European No-Majs (the American term for Muggles) in the 1600s. She goes on to discuss Native American magic, explaining that many witches and wizards were revered by their tribes for their healing and hunting abilities. Some Native American legends  such as that of skin walkers  were even borne from wizarding lore.

Rowling ends by stating that the biggest difference between new and old world magic was that Native Americans were masters of wandless magic. The magic wand originated in Europe. Wands channel magic so as to make its effects both more precise and more powerful, although it is generally held to be a mark of the very greatest witches and wizards that they have also been able to produce wandless magic of a very high quality, she writes. As the Native American Animagi and potion-makers demonstrated, wandless magic can attain great complexity, but Charms and Transfiguration are very difficult without one.

President Obama has made his share of foreign policy mistakes, particularly in the Middle East. But its ironic that Republican critics now hammer him hardest over his nuclear deal with Iran, a bet that has already paid out for those who want to undermine Irans hard-liners. Elections for Irans parliament and its Assembly of Expertswhich picks the nations Supreme Leaderwere hardly free and fair. Conservatives managed to block the candidacy of almost every well-known pragmatist and reformeryet the few who were allowed to run made stunning gains in both elections.

Its the Iranian people, not Obama, who produced this outcome. But without the nuclear deal that Obama pushed forand the sanctions relief and economic surge its about to deliver in Iranits unlikely that voters would have cast ballots to endorse change in such big numbers. A hard-line approach from the West would have surely provoked a hard-line response from Irans clerics, with support, or at best apathy, from the vast majority of Iranians. Instead, the nuclear deal and the accompanying optimism have driven a wedge between those in Iran who want to protect the cleric-controlled status quo and those who want a more open and dynamic society.

This is not a revolution. Hard-line conservatives held their own with voters outside Tehran. They still control the army, the courts, state-run media and the Revolutionary Guards, the dominant force in Irans foreign policy. When the current Supreme Leader, Ayatullah Ali Khamenei, dies, conservatives will work hard to ensure their candidate replaces him by any means necessary. A thaw in relations between Iran and the U.S. wont come soonif it comes at all.

But after the popular unrest that followed a rigged presidential election in 2009, the first-round landslide that lifted reformer Hassan Rouhani to the presidency in 2013 and this latest expression of the popular will, no one can deny that a large segment of Irans nearly 80 million people want a more open society and a more pragmatic approach to the outside world. This election was shaped in part by activists who took to social mediaincluding Telegram, a messaging app popular with millions of Iraniansto organize and inspire like-minded people. Prominent conservatives were left to weave laughable conspiracy theories about foreign plots, undermining their already limited credibility with Iranians too young to remember the revolution.

Iran is one of the only countries in the Middle East where popular will matters. There is not yet a crucial shift in the balance of power within Iran, but for the moment reformers, including the countrys popular President, are emboldened. Hard-liners are on the defensive. Thats in part because Obama and other outsiders gambled on ending Irans isolation and giving its people a reason to invest in the promise of change.

time.com,2016-03-09 08:00:01,Game of Thrones: San Francisco Chefs Throw Pop-Up Feasts,"['San Francisco', 'Katy Steinmetz']","



Their sigil is an armored hand clutching cutlery. Their house motto is as tantalizing as it is obvious: Dinner is coming.

These are the flourishes two young chefs have given their Guild of Cookery, an outfit dedicated to throwing medieval pop-up feasts that are literally inspired by George R.R. Martins book series A Song of Ice and Fire, which inspired the HBO series Game of Thrones. On Monday night in the Castro neighborhood, Graham Bellefeuille, 30, and Ty Cox, 29, recreated an eight-course meal that Tyrion Lannister eats while across the narrow sea in the free city of Pentosfrom the cold egg lime soup to the goose livers drowned in wine and suckling pig with plum sauce, finishing with the traditional cup of sweet wine. (Theres a full menu embedded at the bottom of this page.)



Each of the guests at the small, sold-out, $65 dinner was led to a seat where the menu, sealed with red-wax crown, bore their name in Game of Thrones style (e.g. Lady Katy of House Steinmetz). Bellefeuille then began by setting the scene from the books in a room that had chopped wood piled up halfway to the ceiling, like it might be in quarters at the Wall.

To avoid spoilers, suffice it to say Tyrion wasnt in a super mood in a place far off from Kings Landing, but was finding some solace in his cups and some exquisite, butter-kissed mushrooms. Bellefeuille also explained that the dishes the guests were about to eat, like the quail drenched in honey, arent modern interpretations; both chefs are devout students of historical cookery and, as much as they can, they base their dishes on recipes handed down from medieval times. (These are recipes that have instructions like Spice to your masters taste, written in Old English, which both of them can now sight read.)

The Guild of Cookery decorates banners and menus with their sigil and house motto.

The idea was we wanted to eat the food, says Bellefeuille. We wanted to experience what George R.R. Martin was describing. Cox doubles down on their promise to be faithful. Our goal is to be 100% accurate to the books, he says. This is not an expression of our inner creativity. Though there is an official Game of Thrones cookbook, for this feast the chefs mostly drew on recipes from Maestro Martino da Como, a famed Italian culinary expert from the 1400s.

The series of books about kings and queens that inspired the chefs to form their guildbefore the wildly popular TV series existedis a natural for pop-up feasts. Amid the intrigue and political machinations, back room dealings and beheadings, is relentless food porn. Lemon cakes. Black tar rum. Capons upon capons. Relishes made of bits of lime and orange, pushed aside so that characters can suck meat off of bones. Much like in true medieval timesand even, you might argue, among wealthy classes todayprivilege is embodied and displayed in the elaborate dishes the elite have laid in front of them by people who are going to go home and eat soup out of a pot.

To date, the duo has done eight menus two or three times each, like the Feast of Winterfell and the Red Vipers Feast. And Bellefeuille and Cox have gone to great lengths to procure the necessary foodstuffs. When whipping up a Dornish feast, for instance, they imported python from Vietnam for a fiery hot snake stew. But they have strayed a little from the script. The duo has slimmed down Martins menus when there were too many dishes for them to make, or feed people in a single night. And they admit that there are some things that are beyond their means to recreate. Lamprey, a favorite for pies in Westeros, isnt commercially fished, they say. Or something like a whole roast aurochs on a spit, says Bellefeuille. Thats just not going to happen. Still they do their best, in that case subbing in a steamship round of beef roasted whole and then sliced.

Despite the fact that these dinners have been going on and selling out for years, the Guild of Cookery has remained fairly under the radar. Part of that is because the chefs were using borderline medieval means of advertising in the beginning, like posting paper flyers. Neither of them had a Facebook page or Twitter account. If youre hanging out in a kitchen all day every day and youre reading books from 600 years ago, marketing is probably not your strong suit, Cox says. We went into it thinking if we just put this stuff forward, its a good enough thing. Theres a lot of interest in Game of Thrones. We want this. Other people want this. So if we build it, they will come.

And it is good, and people do come, as well as come back. At the dinner in the Castro, people who were otherwise strangers recognized each other from previous feastssome dressed in costumes, for which they received a free glass of Myrish Cider (Poma Aurea) or Arbor Gold (Verdejo wine). A teenage boy, complete with earbuds in, ate with his parents and had goose liver for the first time. Nearby, blue-haired, beanie-clad hipsters were using words like intellectual to describe the broth of crab and monkfish, for which the chefs had to substitute lobster. And the saddle of lamb was juicy, just like Tyrions storyline.

People make friends here, says Bellefeuille of why so many there are return feasters. Part of it is also novelty. There is a thing about people trying something theyve never had before, and thats a harder and harder thing to do. Obviously there are exotics meats, there are exotic techniques. We had capon at our last dinner. How many people have had that?

The next feast is on March 21 in San Francisco, and tickets are available here.

Today we are thrilled to introduce you to a new site called TIME Labs, the home base for interactive data journalism at TIME. We have gathered some old favorites and added some new ones, and well be continually updating the site with new projects and posts.

What can you expect from TIME Labs? The ever-blossoming technologies in Web browsers and smart phones give us tremendous potential to make things that youve never seen before on a news Web site. In the past few months, weve published apps that let you draw logos from memory, declared Makati City, Philippines, to be the selfie capital of the world, and even attempted to turn Census data into a dating app. The ever-blossoming technologies in Web browsers and smart phones give us tremendous potential to make things that surprise, entertain and inform all at once.

Were calling articles on Labs stories, because thats just what they are: Narratives built from data where you control the plot. But TIME Labs is more than just a clearinghouse for stuff we think is cool. Its also a place where you can explore the data that powers our projects. In addition to stories, weve also created pages called data sheets that take you behind the scenes to see the whole story of how a bunch of numbers can become a map, a chart, a game or anything else you see here.

A data sheet might not sound tremendously exciting, but one goal of TIME Labs is to push the boundaries of what we mean when we say data. The word tends to conjure up spreadsheets, scientific papers and debates over government surveillance. To us, it means any sort of human artifact that can be represented quantitatively and analyzed by a computer. A Census record of the number Iranian-Americans living in each state is data, but so are the transcripts of The Big Bang Theory, the color values of each pixel in the Mona Lisa, and the chord changes in every Neil Young song.

Theres no mathematical or computing expertise necessary to understand these pages. The purpose is to be transparent about the strengths and limitations of the data we use in our projects. If you do happen to like to write your own code and do your own analysis, well also be giving readers access to as much of our code as possible. You can find links to our Github repositories on the data pages. We think this is an important piece of transparency too.

We hope you are delighted by the projects here. Were grateful to the millions of people who have calculated how much time theyve spent on Facebook, discovered what state best matches their personality, lost a half hour to the latest in baby names and participated in many other stories that now live here. Your enthusiasm for these stories has helped make Time.coms interactive articles some of the most popular journalism created at TIME.

We want to hear from you. Send us any ideas you have for ways to make numbers come alive. You can reach me any time at chris.wilson@time.com, on Twitter or on GitHub.",[]

Chipotle announced Monday that the chain will no longer serve food containing genetically modified organisms (GMO), raising the bar for transparency in the United States, where theres no requirement to indicate the presence of GMO ingredients on food labels or in restaurants. Likewise, biotechnology companies arent required to report which genetically modified seeds are used in production.

Yet the use of GMOs is undoubtedly widespread. Since GMOs were approved for commercial use, and then first planted into U.S. soil in 1996, their production has increased dramatically. More than 90% of all soybean cotton and corn acreage in the U.S. is used to grow genetically engineered crops. Other popular and approved food crops include sugar beets, alfalfa, canola, papaya and summer squash. More recently, apples that dont brown and bruise-free potatoes were also approved by the FDA.

time.com,,See Who 2012 Political Donors Support Today,[],"See Who 2012 Political Donors Support Today

This interactive chart let's you follow the political money from 2012 donors who have giving to candidates in 2016

A TIME analysis of Federal Election Commission records indicates that, while donors to Barack Obama in 2012 have largely transferred their support to Hillary Clinton, Mitt Romneys donors are divided in their support of the 2016 hopefuls.

While those donors favor Jeb Bush, having given the former Florida governor more than $5.4 million since through Sept. 30, they are also giving Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson significant financial support.

Perhaps most surprising, more Romney money has flowed into Democrat Hillary Clintons coffers (more than $640,000 so far) than has been given to Republicans Rand Paul, Carly Fiorina or Chris Christie. Meanwhile Jeb Bush has collected nearly $125,000 so far from 2012 donors to Obama.

The chart above gives the clearest view of where party donors of old are placing their newest bets. While Obama donors overwhelmingly favor Hillary Clinton (no surprise), Newt Gingrich donors are giving the most to Ted Cruz this time around. Rick Perry bowed out of the 2016 race in September. During the 2016 cycle, his 2012 supporters gave more to fellow Texan Ted Cruz than they did to Perry himself.

The money above represents that given to the campaign committees of candidates for president. It excludes money giving to political action committees and so-called super PACs, which are legally separate from the campaigns, but increasingly count for a vast proportion of campaign spending. Campaigns are only required to disclose donations of $200 or more, so small donors to 2012 candidates are not represented in these figures.

With open fields in both parties, donations to candidates in 2011 far outpaces the equivalent period from four years ago. Donors have shelled out $166,000,000 to presidential campaign committees so far this cycle, compared to $106,000,000 during the equivalent period in the previous cycle.",[]

Not all states are equal when it comes to getting rest. New York, home to the city that never sleeps, does in fact turn in the latest on average, at 11:54 PM. But the state doesnt rise until 7:36 AM  sleeping in past every state except North Dakota, according to new sleep data provided by Withings exclusively to TIME. Colorado is the first to rise, at 7:07AM, followed closely by Rhode Island and South Dakota. As a region, midwestern states likewise goes to bed the earliest, with South Dakota turning the lights out first.

So which state is getting the least sleep? Residents of Delaware, on average, are sleeping less than the rest of the country, at 7 hours and 36 minutes each night. Rhode Island, New York, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C. all follow closely behind. Which Americans are getting the most rest? Montanans, with 8 hours and 20 minutes each night. Other places with heavy sleepers include: South Dakota, Wyoming and Maine. The chart below shows where all states plus Washington, D.C., rank.

Those users are sleeping on average 7 hours and 50 minutes each night. While thats nearly an hour less than findings from 2013 American Time Use Survey undertaken by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), wearable technology could provide a more accurate picture of whats happening in Americas beds. The BLS survey asks respondents when they sleep and rise, without taking into account the time it takes to fall asleep or other activities in bed. Sleep-tracking devices detect body movement and heart rate, producing what may be a more accurate measure of time slept.

Caution, sleep-seekers! Note that Withings users, according to the company, are often men aged between 35 and 40 years old who are interested in technology.

time.com,2016-03-09 10:59:21,Hillary Clinton Super PAC to Spend $4.5M in March Primaries,['Sam Frizell'],"



Priorities USA Action, the main super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton, is spending heavily over the coming weeks in the March primary states, part of an effort to boost the former Secretary of State in her race against Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination.

Radio ads and direct mail funded by Priorities will go on the air and into mailboxes in Ohio, Illinois, Arizona and Florida, focusing in particular on turning out Latino and African-American voters in support of Clinton. Priorities plans to spend a total $4.5 million to boost voter turnout in the March states, building on spending that began in February.

The expenditures are a tacit recognition of Bernie Sanders enduring strength in the primary; Sanders has posed a greater challenge to Clinton in the nomination than her allies expected. The super PAC bought radio time supporting Clinton ahead of Michigans hard-fought primary on Tuesday, which Clinton narrowly lost.

But beyond the primary, Priorities spending also could position Clinton better in a general election against a Republican, assuming she wins the nomination, by energizing Democrats and countering Republican spending against her.

This allows us to continue making investments in primary states to ensure Hillary Clinton enters the general election in the strongest possible position, said Guy Cecil, co-chairman of Priorities, in an open memo published March 2. The coming onslaught from Republican outside groups makes our work crucial to a Hillary Clinton victory.

The super PACs increased involvement in the Democratic primary began shortly after Sanders landslide victory in New Hampshire. Priorities has already spent $4.2 million since the beginning of February, according to FEC filings, going through $1.3 million on direct mail and more than $2.9 million on radio ads in states like South Carolina, Georgia and Texas.

Tad Devine, top strategist for the Sanders campaign, warned last week that the spending would hurt Clintons image in primary states. Some Sanders staffers have discussed pushing at the Democratic convention for a commitment from Democrats not to spend money super PAC money in any future presidential or congressional primaries. Priorities is spending millions, Devine said last week. As this starts coming more into focus, people are going to get very motivated to come out for Sanders.

Priorities, however, is not the only super PAC spending money in the Democratic primary. National Nurses United for Patient Protection, a super PAC affiliated with a nurses union that has endorsed Sanders, has spent $1.9 million supporting the Vermont senator, including with billboards, canvassing and radio buys.

As the campaign has ramped up, fundraising for Priorities has steadily increased since last year. The super PAC raised $10 million in January, compared with $16 million in the first six months of last year.",[]

For all the talk of American exceptionalism, there is at least one thing that is unexceptional about the United States: its flag. The Star-Spangled Banners particular shade of red shows up in 14.3 percent of all national flags, making it the second most common color after white. And the dark blue of the American flags canton is also shared by 13 other nations.

In fact, the worlds 196 countries stick to a surprisingly small palette when it comes to picking their flags. The most popular shade of yellow, for example, shows up in the flags of Lithuania, Columbia, Ghana, St. Lucia and Vietnam, among many others, giving it a foothold on five continents and making it third most popular individual shade. (Overall, blues and greens are more popular than yellows.)

Sometimes, its not just the colors that seem familiar. In perhaps the most famous example of two countries showing up somewhere wearing the same outfit, Liechtenstein and Haiti both arrived at the 1936 Olympics flying identical banners.

Methodology

The complete code used to generate this data, which uses Mathematica 10, is available on the Wolfram Cloud.

After downloading the 196 flag images from Flagpedia.net, we added up the total number of pixels of each color. This yielded 527 different shades across 36.6 million pixels. Because digital images are only approximations of the colors in the physical flags, we decided it was safe to further simplify these colors down to the traditional web safe palette of 216 possible colors. That reduced the number of distinct shades from 527 to 63.

These 63 colors were then grouped into parent categories of white, black, red, blue, green and yellow using a simple algorithm to determine which parent color each shade most resembled. This process required a small about of manual tweaking for colors on the border between green and blue.",[]

J.K. Rowlings latest story on North American witchcraft and wizardry dives deep into American history, specifically the Salem Witch Trials.

Seventeenth Century and Beyond is the second installment in The History of Magic in North America, Rowlings collection of four new stories about the previously unexplored American wizarding world. The author is using these pieces to set the scene for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a Harry Potter prequel film set in 1920s New York City.

The tale explains why witches and wizards who emigrated to America from Europe struggled to adjust to their new home. First, there were fewer resources for potions and no established wandmakers. Secondly, the Puritans, a group that instigated conflict with the Native American population, made witches and wizards extremely wary of their magic.

And lastly, the Salem Witch Trails of 1692-93 were a tragedy for the wizarding community, Rowling writes due to a group called Scourers, an unscrupulous band of wizarding mercenaries of many foreign nationalities, who formed a much-feared and brutal taskforce committed to hunting down not only known criminals, but anyone who might be worth some gold. The Scourers sound similar to the Death Eaters, as the group also indulged a love of authority and enjoyed bloodshed and torture.

Rowling clarifies that during the Salem Witch Trials among the so-called Puritan judges were at least two known Scourers, and that a number of the dead were indeed witches, though utterly innocent of the crimes for which they had been arrested. Others were merely No-Majs who had the misfortune to be caught up in the general hysteria and bloodlust.

The events at Salem led to the creation of the Magical Congress of the United State of Americas in 1693.

The demographics of the United States will look radically different in the next several decades. But you dont have to wait 45 years to see a picture of that America. Just go to Texas.

The racial and ethnic makeup of the Lone Star State today closely resembles what the entire country is expected to look like half-a-century from now. Roughly a third of population is Hispanic and less than half the population is white.

Its possible, using projections the Census Bureau has released for every year through 2060, to match each states current demographics to the year it most resembles on a national levelpast, present or future. For example, the Florida of today very closely resembles where the nation is expected to be in 2029. Meanwhile, Connecticut is frozen in the demographic amber of 2001, and neighboring Massachusetts looks like the America of 1993. North Dakota is like the America of 1930.

To produce a year for each state, TIME compared the current percentage of white, black, Hispanic and Asian residents to the same percentages on a national level for every year from 1900 through 2060.

Some matches are closer than others. States with small black populations, like Iowa, are typically matched to the year 1930, the year with the lowest percentage of black residents nationally. States with large Hispanic populations typically match to future projections.",[]

An 8-year-old Rhode Island boy with terminal cancer, whose last wish to become famous in China sparked a viral social media campaign, has died.

Dorian Murray passed away in his parents arms late Tuesday after a four-year battle with rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare soft tissue cancer, his family told TIME on Wednesday. He went quite peacefully, his father Chris Murray said. It was something we knew was coming. We were both holding him.

The world granted the little Westerly boys dying wish to become famous just hours after his father sent out a call on social media in January. The inspired #DStrong campaign reverberated around the world, gaining attention from celebrities and sports stars like New England Patriots Rob Gronkowski, Justin Bieber, Morgan Freeman and Olivia Wilde.



The response to a simple conversation with my son that I posted up was incredible, Chris Murray said, adding that hes still stumped as to why his son chose China. The fact that he got his wish and he became so famous is a blessing.

Dorians dad said he knew the request was a tall order, but felt he had to try since his son rarely ever asked for things or complained about his disease since being diagnosed at age 4. The family had just learned the cancer was no longer treatable. It was just one of those things, knowing what was happening, to try to make everything I could happen for him, the 36-year-old said. That was my biggest thing. So, I started asking around.

Dorian remained defiant even as the disease worsened in the last few months, his father said. He would always tell us, Dont worry. Ill kick cancers ass. I beat it once, Ill beat it again. He was always positive, Chris Murray said. No matter what came his way, he took it in stride and kept fighting even to his last breath.

Dorians family said they hope the little boys courageous journey continues to touch thousands of more lives after his death. They have launched the Dorian J. Murray Foundation to spread awareness of pediatric cancer and raise money to support research and affected families.

From everything that hes gone through, we hope that everybody can take note of his strength and courage and hopefully his sacrifice will lead to a better world, Chris Murray said. If Dorians legacy is to bring everyone together and bring awareness to pediatric cancer, if he helps save the life of even one kid, it was all worth helping him get his wish.",[]

Homework dominates after-school time in many households and has been dubbed the 21st centurys new family dinner. Overtired children complain and collapse. Exasperated parents cajole and nag. These family fights often ends in tears, threats, and parents secretly finishing their kids homework.

Parents put up with these nightly battles because they want whats best for their kids. But, surprise, the opposite is more likely to be true. A comprehensive review of 180 research studies by Duke University psychologist and neuroscientist Harris Cooper shows homeworks benefits are highly age dependent: high schoolers benefit if the work is under two hours a night, middle schoolers receive a tiny academic boost, and elementary-aged kids? Its better to wait.

If you examine the researchnot one study, but the full sweep of homework researchits clear that homework does have an impact, but its not always a good one. Homework given too young increases negative attitudes toward school. Thats bad news, especially for a kindergartener facing 12 more years of assignments.

Children rebel against homework because they have other things they need to do. Holler and run. Relax and reboot. Do family chores. Go to bed early. Play, following their own ideas. Children have been told what to do all day long at schoolwhich is mostly sitting still and focusing on the academic side. Academic learning is only one side of a child. When school is out, kids need time for other things.

Some schools are already realizing this. New York Citys P.S. 116 elementary school made news last year when its principal Jane Hsu abolished homework and asked families to read instead. Individual schools and teachers from Maryland to Michigan have done the same, either eliminating homework in the elementary years or making it optional. But schools also report that if teachers dont give it, some parents will demand it.

Believers in homework say it teaches soft skills like responsibility and good study habits. Thats another problem with homework in elementary school. Young kids can rarely cope with complex time management skills or the strong emotions that accompany assignments, so the responsibility falls on parents. Adults assume the highly undesirable role of Homework Patrol Cop, nagging kids about doing it, and children become experts in procrastination and the habit of complaining until forced to work. Homework overtakes the parents evening as well as the childs. These roles arent easy to shake.

Read More: How Hard Is Too Hard to Push Kids?

When homework comes at a stage when it can academically benefit students, it can also be a students responsibility. That means a high school student should be expected to do her homework without being reminded. It may take a year or two of practice in middle school, but it doesnt require years of practice. Before age 11, responsibility can be taught in other ways. For a 6-year-old, that means remembering to feed the cat and bring home her lunchbox.

If we want students to improve memory, focus, creative thinking, test performance and even school behavior, the answer is not more homework, the answer is more sleep. The National Sleep Foundation reports that our children are suffering sleep deprivation, partly from homework. If we pride ourselves on a rational, research-based approach to education, we must look at the right facts.

Parents often feel stuck with homework because they dont realize they have a choice. But they do. Schooling may be mandatory, but homework isnt. Families can opt out. Parents can approach the teacher either about homework load or the simple fact of doing homework at all, especially in elementary school. Many teachers will be more than happy with the change. Opting out, or changing the homework culture of a school brings education control back down to the local level.

Thats another thing the new Education Secretary has promised: to turn more control for education decisions over to states and local school districts. That could spell good news for students  if local teachers and principals do their own homework and read up on what the research says about making kids do school work after school is done.",[]

Emma Watson kicked off HeForShes inaugural Arts Week in New York City Tuesday on International Womens Day with a discussion about challenging gender norms.

Chirlane McCray, the First Lady of New York and Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the Executive Director of UN Women, introduced the Harry Potter star alongside actor and director Forest Whitaker, who runs the Whitaker Peace & Development Initiative.

I think about the performing arts and how we perceive masculinity and have rigid definitions and ideas of a leading man and what a leading man can or cant do or how he should or shouldnt act, Watson said. Challenging these perceptions make the roles that each of us get to play more complex, more real, more authentic, they make our jobs more interesting and truthful.



In Watsons eyes, being an active bystander can help mitigate the difference between recognizing the problem and making a tangible change.

Empowering people to know and think that its their role when they see something that isnt right to say something about it, thats how to be an active bystander, she said. Most men and women can name a moment in their lives when they were a witness to a man or a woman being treated unfairly because of gender and it just takes someone calling it out.

Watson, who delivered a much-praised speech on gender equality at the U.N. in 2014, recently said she is taking a year off from acting to focus on gender studies and her feminist book club.",[]

Few candidates arriving at tonights GOP debate have the option of doing so in their very own Boeing 757. But then again there are few candidates like Donald Trump.

According to data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration via a Freedom of Information request, Trumps two planesthe 757 and his Cessna Citation Xhave flown a total of 504,316 miles over the course of 538 trips between Jan. 2011 and April 2015.

Trumps favorite destination, outside of his hometown of New York City is West Palm Beach, the airport closest to the Trump resort Mar-a-Lago. Trumps planes have landed in the Florida city 53 times during the period. The second most popular destination for Trumps flights are Washington, D.C., followed closely by Oxford, Connecticut.

Trumps travels in 2015 reflect his recent presidential bid, with three flights to Manchester, N.H., where he leads in the polls by over 10 points according to Real Clear Politics.

The 757 has touched down in Iowa three times in 2015, in January, April, and most recently in June after announcing his presidential bid.

Trumps Boeing 757, purchased in 2011, reportedly comes with 24k gold-plated seat belts and flies at speeds over 500 miles per hour.

time.com,2015-09-28 00:00:00,How Rare is a Perfect Game Through Four Innings?,[],"How Rare is a Perfect Game Through Four Innings?

Ive seen the Phillies face Stephen Strasburg in Washington twice this season. The first time, on July 19, the fireballer retired the first 14 batters he faced. The second time, this past Saturday, he retired the first 12.

This says as much about the poor Phillies as it does about Strasburg, but it got me wondering how long a pitcher has to have a perfect game going before one should start to get excited.

Using data from Retrosheet, I attempted to calculate, for every game between 2000 and 2014, the number of consecutive outs each of the two starting pitchers has recorded before allowing his first man on base. (Data isnt yet available for 2015.) The code, which is open-source on Github, correctly identifies the seven perfect games of the 21st century and the four games spoiled by the last batter. It turns out that even a perfect game through four innings is fairly rare, having happened 215 times since 2000, not including the current season. Between 2000 and 2014, 0.29% of games featured a pitcher whose thrown four or more perfect innings.

Heres a graph showing the frequency of incomplete perfect games (plus seven complete ones) starting with the fourth inning, charted by the last batter faced before the perfect game was broken up. The data its cumulative; the games broken up after 12 batters dont include those broken up after 15, etc.

Its curious that there are fewer 25-out and 26-out near-perfect games than there are actual perfect games. This may be statistical randomness. Even with 71,982 starts between 2000 and 2014, its so uncommon to make it deep into a game without allowing a man on base that one is left with a fairly small sample. Or it may be adrenaline on the pitchers part. Or perhaps its just that you cant play the Phillies all the time.",[]

The latest government data show some encouraging declines in death rates from major diseases, but the good news comes with some caveats

In the latest analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association of a massive amount of government-collected health data from 1969 to 2013, theres good news. The death rate among Americans, at any given age, from all causes decreased by 43% from 1969 to 2013. In fact, of the six leading causes of death, five showed declines during that period, with only mortality from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increasing.

Death rates per 100,000 people for all causes

The good news hides some potentially less welcome trends.

The death rates from three major causesheart disease, stroke and diabetesare starting to flatten after continuous declines. The researchers speculate the death rates didnt continue their steady decline because the obesity epidemic started to emerge around that time. As Americans became heavier, their risk of these diseases increased, blunting some of the improvements that new drugs, better education and lifestyle changes have made in the morality from these conditions.

Declines in leading causes of death, by sex Age-adjusted death rates shown



The other less rosy news comes from a closer look at the breakdown of mortality trends by race. A TIME analysis of the Centers for Disease Controls mortality database, used in the JAMA study, provided age-adjusted death rates by race and ethnicity. The graph below shows data back to 1999, when CDC updated disease classifications. While death rates declined among African Americans, they were still higher than those for whites in 5 out of 6 leading causes of death.

Death rate per 100,000 people, by race

Analyzing death rates in this way, say the study authors, is critical to better understanding where our health system is improving the health of Americans, and, perhaps more importantly, where it is not. The fact that declines in mortality for some diseases is beginning to slow down highlights the need to address obesity and its effect on our health more aggressively, while gaps among different racial and ethnic groups stresses the importance of improving access, quality and education about health care to all groups.",[]
time.com,,This Map Shows Where Immigrants Send the Most Money Home,[],"This Map Shows Where Immigrants Send the Most Money Home

As politicians turn an eye to remittance payments that immigrants send home, some countries rely heavily on the cash flow.

In his proposal for stricter security at the U.S-Mexico border, Donald Trump seized on an issue that could make him very unpopular among immigrants: remittances.

Remittance paymentsmoney that immigrants send back to their home countriesare one of the latest targets for Trump, who proposed that unless Mexico funds a wall at its northern border, the U.S. should impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages of Mexicans working in the U.S.

Mexico currently receives nearly $24.4 billion in remittances each year from immigrants in the U.S., accounting for about 2 percent of the Mexican GDP, according to the World Bank. Across the globe, immigrants sent $583 billion back to their home countries in 2014, with $440 billion of that going to developing countries. Remittances usually form just a small fraction of a countrys national GDP, but they still accounted for almost four times the $135 billion in global foreign aid that was disbursed last year. In the following map, you can click on any country to see where it immigrants living there send money home.

And Trump isnt the only one with his eye on remittance payments. World leaders who recognize the importance of the remittance industry in their economies include Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose recent visit to the United Arab Emirates put the issue in the spotlight as he worked to attract greater foreign investment in India. This is for good reason, since remittances tend to increase in times of recession while other forms of investment decrease, as tougher times at home can elicity more money from friends and family abroad. India receives about $12 billion in remittances from the UAE, and remittances from the broader Gulf region play a significant part in the economy of South Indian states like Kerala.

While Trumps plan to confiscate the remittances of undocumented workers may be impracticalnot to mention controversialglobal remittances provide an interesting look at how immigrants in the U.S. and beyond are lifting people from their own countries out of poverty by sending money home. The practice is most prevalent in Tajikistan, which receives about 40 percent of its national GDP in the form of remittances.

Methodology

Remittances and migration unit data are provided by the World Bank Group. The estimates of total migrant population were obtained from the World Banks Bilateral-Remittance matrix. The estimates in this data set are compiled from various primary and secondary sources for international migrant population and remittance outflows, and may in some cases fail to capture the complete volumes of remittances.

For those who dont believe that Donald Trump or Ben Carson can win the Republican nominationneither have any governing experiencethe most important question is who their masses of supporters would pick as a second choice.

We can find one clue to these tangled allegiances in which candidates a person follows on Twitter. TIME Labs examined the 6.2 million people who follow at least one of the 16 candidates and looked at the overlaps for anyone who followed more than one.

Whats striking here is that, while Florida Senator Marco Rubio is only polling at around 5 percent, he is the most jointly followed candidate among 10 of his 15 competitors.

While all the usual caveats about Twitter data applythe demographics are considerably younger than GOP primary voters, and a follower does not a voter makeits significant that so many people who follow any of the other candidates also follow him. This suggests that he may very well be the second choice of many people who support another candidate.

Half of English majors move home after graduating college

Its an old joke among humanities majors: You may be nourishing the soul, but when you graduate, its back to living with your parents while you look for a job with that degree.

To test the truth of this assertion, TIME examined five years of Census data on those with Bachelors degrees, accounting for both their field of study and whether they are listed as living with at least one parent. Of course, this could mean a person is in a graduate program and still using his or her home address. And living at home doesnt mean a person is unemployed. Census data suggests most such individuals do have jobs.

Like which school you attend, what you major in seems to have the most bearing on the years just after school. While half of English majors live at home right out of collegeincluding this reporter, for several monthsonly about a third of Engineering majors do. By age 29, however, the difference has dropped to 5 points (12 percent of English majors and 7 percent of Engineering majors.) This is generally true across the board.

So major in what you like. The worst that can happen is youll be living at home for an extra year or two. See below for the rates for every major.

Major Percent living at home at age... 22 25 29

Methodology

Using Census microdata from 2009-2013, individuals were considered to be living at home if either of the variables MOMLOC or POPLOC were equal to 1, meaning a parent was the head of the household. Only those with completed bachelors degrees between ages 22 and 29 were examined.

Take clearer low-light photos without using flash

One of the Galaxy S7s biggest improvements compared to its predecessors is the ability to take better images in dim conditions. Samsung has increased the size of the pixels in its camera sensor, which lets it take in more light.

I found this to be true. A picture shot in a dark bar looked brighter and less grainy when taken on the Galaxy S7 versus the iPhone 6s Plus. That being said, Apple also has its own methods of improving photography in poorly lit situations. The iPhone 6s is capable of using the phones screen as a flash when taking photos with the front-facing camera, for instance.

Make a payment using your phone without NFC

Most mobile payment systems, including Apple Pay, rely on a technology called Near Field Communication (NFC) to connect your smartphone to a payment terminal. While NFC support is becoming more common in the retail world, its still not everywhere.

Samsung Pay, however, can be used with almost any payment terminal. That means it works just about anywhere credit cards are accepted regardless of whether or not the cash register supports NFC.

Charge your phone without plugging it in

Like many Android smartphones, Samsungs Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 can be charged wirelessly. Rather than plugging the phone into an outlet, users can rest the device on a charging pad to replenish its battery.

The type of wireless technology built in to Samsungs newest phones (and the Galaxy S6) is made to work with just about any charging mat available. Although some tinkerers have developed workarounds that allow wireless charging on the iPhone, the feature is not officially supported.

Add extra storage space

Users who store hours worth of movies, TV shows, and music on their mobile devices will appreciate this feature. Galaxy S7 owners can add more storage space to their device by popping in a new microSD card. Both phones support up to 200GB in extra storage space.",[]

And being the wonderful female supporter she is, Harry Potters J.K. Rowling chimed in to back her on-screen Hermione.

Watson spent the morning in New York kicking of HeForShes Inaugural Arts Week, saying that the best way to affect change in the inequality landscape is by acting as an active bystander.

time.com,2016-02-22 00:00:00,How We Made the Candidates Speak 30 Times Slower,[],"How We Made the Candidates Speak 30 Times Slower

Earlier this month, TIME published a series of slow motion videos of 2016 presidential campaign events in Iowa, overlaid with audio of the candidates speaking against a haunting background noise. As one of the technicians who worked on the series, Ive had several people ask me about that underlying audio. What is it? Is that music? How did you do that?

While we were discussing the approach to audio in The Candidates, filmmaker Christopher Morris described his vision of how it should sound. He wanted audio of each candidates event: the sound of the crowd and of the candidate speaking. But because the camera would slow down the action, he wanted to slow down the audio as well.

The camera would be filming at 720 frames per second (fps), while typical playback speed is 24 fps. This means that 1 second of action captured in real-time will be 30 seconds of footage when played back. There would be some use of standard-speed audio of the candidates speaking, but to complement the cameras visual aesthetic, we wanted background audio that was slowed to the same degree that the camera was slowing the visual action. So we needed to slow down the audio by 30 times.

There are two main approaches to lengthening audio. First, you can simply slow down the playback, much like playing a record player or cassette tape at a slower speed. But this also lowers the pitch of the sound, in our case by five octavesfar too low to be practical. The other way is to repeat tiny chunks of the audio to lengthen its playback time without altering the pitch. This is the method used in most editing programs like Final Cut Pro. However, this introduces noticeable artifacts after a speed change of around 20  50 percent, and we needed 3000 percent. So neither of these traditional methods would work for The Candidates. What would?

A few years ago, the WNYC show RadioLab aired an episode on the subject of time. One segment was about a 24-hour version of Beethovens 9th Symphony. Stretching the music creates a striking and ethereal sonic landscape. It allows the listener to fully saturate in the moment-to-moment complexity of the piece. A quick online search will reveal many works of music transformed in this way, including several familiar pop songs. Most are unrecognizable and eerily detached from their original versions, but are endlessly meditative and remarkable.

It turns out this type of audio time-stretching is accomplished with an open-source software application called PaulStretch. It can lengthen any sound, not just music, and lengthened human speech often takes on an intensified musical quality. This seemed ideal for The Candidates, where the slowed-down audio of the candidates speeches would provide us with an abstracted sense of place, but also serve as a soundtrack for each film.

For the first few events we only had enough time between shots to record perhaps 10-15 minutes of ambient audio  more than enough for a 5-10 minute film  but we wanted longer amounts so we would have more variety to best match the visual content. So at later events, we recorded the entire time we were there, with a separate track set aside for the feed from the public address system. This was much more effective at bringing out the inner musicality of the speakers voice.

At this point, you might be wondering how PaulStretch works. Basically, it looks at individual portions of the sound one at a time. For convenience, well refer to this portion of sound as a window. For each window, we get an impression of the frequency spectrum of that sound. For example: are there a lot of high-pitched sounds or low-pitched sounds? The longer the window, the more the sound will smear, much like a long camera exposure might cause an image to smear from motion blur. In The Candidates, we used a window that was around one second in length. To create the sense of smearing, we have to detach the frequency information further from where it exists in time. So we take that component of the information and randomize it. Now that we have a smeared sonic impression of the window, we play it back. So far we have one second of input audio and one second of output audio.

But this doesnt seem like it would stretch the sense of time, does it? Heres how the sound is lengthened: For the next window, rather than moving forward in the audio file by one second, we move forward by only a fraction of a second. Were actually looking at much of the same information again, having lost a small amount at the beginning of the window and gained a little at the end. Even though we only moved forward by a fraction of a second in the original input audio, weve generated another full second of output audio. This process is repeated over and over as we move incrementally though the file  and consequently the audio coming out is much longer than the audio going in.

If youve made it this far and youre curious to look at the Python version of the app, its astonishingly simple: both a testament to the brevity of the Python programming language, and the clarity of the algorithm itself.

A few tech specs: we used the Zoom H6 recorder with an XY microphone, and recorded everything at 24-bit 96KHz for maximum flexibility. We ended up converting all the files to 16-bit 48KHz for consistency with Final Cut Pro. For the PaulStretch conversions, we used the same settings for all the films and stretching them by 30 timesexactly the same as the camera is doing with the images. So for a 15 minute recording, we would have almost 8 hours of stretched audio. Plenty (if not too much) for the filmmaker, Chris, to select from.

To choose the slowed-down audio we wanted, I left it playing on my laptop while he was editing. Every once in a while, hed ask me to make a note of where the playback was, or to find another section to try out. Then he put these in Final Cut and we made selections of the real-time audio of the candidate that would layer briefly above the stretched audio during the first few moments of each film.

We were immediately moved by the effect: a slow, reverberant echo of the candidates voices. It was both jarring and oddly familiar  a striking compliment to the powerful images Chris had filmed  and a bridge between the known and the unseen.

In all, he traveled approximately 721,000 miles, an equivalent of 31 times around the earth, according to an estimate by John Trigilio. Paul VI visited 15 countries before ceasing travel after being stabbed in the Manila airport in 1970. He expanded the popes international presence as the first to leave Europe in over a century, and the first to fly.

Since the start of his papacy in 2013, Francis has visited 16 countries, with a focus on his native continent of South America and Asia.

time.com,2016-03-07 04:00:46,Fugitives in Their Own Lands: Meet Kenya's LGBT Refugees,['Rachel Lowry'],"Last summer marked a landmark moment for the gay rights movement in the U.S.: the legalization of same sex marriage. Crowds celebrated on the White House steps, rainbow-tinted profiles exploded across Facebook and thousands of marriage ceremonies in the following months lauded the cultural victory for LGBTs in America. But nearly 9,000 miles away, acceptance remains a mere ideal.

Photographer Jake Naughton, who worked last year with Kenya-based journalist Jacob Kushner, has documented LGBT refugees from East Africa, where leaders are imposing harsher laws on gays and lesbians. They have experienced beatings, torture, public humiliation, extortion, family disownment and sexual abuse. Some have been outed in their high schools, others labeled as terrorists and even put behind bars. Hundreds of them seek a new life in the west, fleeing to Kenya to wait in a refugee camp, Kakuma, for asylum or resettlement abroadin Europe, Canada, or the U.S. That is, after a long and dangerous wait.

It can take years, sometimes decades, to be granted asylum to leave Africa, Naughton tells TIME. They flee to Kenya, expecting some sense of safety, or at least the ability to securely wait out their processing time when in fact, they walked into the same nightmare.

Gay equality has a long way to go in Africa. Nearly 90% of the Kenyan population believe homosexuality should not be accepted, according to a 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center. Of the continents 54 countries, only one, South Africa, has legalized same-sex marriage. While Kenya is known to be more liberal to gays and lesbians, homophobia remains rampant throughout the country, amid a rising Evangelical movement. In 2011, President Barack Obama called for expedited resettlement of LGBT refugees, but as Congress allocated little funding for the new legislation, agencies, churches, charities and NGOs that wish to help lack the resources to do so.

Naughtons pictures depict the living conditions in Kakuma. While the UNHCR covers lodging and offers healthcare access to refugees, living conditions are destitute. Its extremely hot, very dusty, with 182,000 people packed into the camp, Naughton says. Its huge, its sprawling and it was never designed to hold that many people.

The photos, taken with a strobe flash, cast an intense light on each refugee. The light is so bright and so direct, it mimics the intense scrutiny that all these people are under, he says. But then by its nature, it casts these deep shadows, which is kind of where the refugees find themselves confined to.

The refugees scars are physical reminders that a new life abroad is worth waiting for: One man poses, a smile thrown off-kilter by a jagged scar from a seven-man machete attack in his apartment after seen with his boyfriend; a woman holds her arm out, showing a deep scar from shoulder to elbow, the fallout of an attack after giving an interview a few years ago on BBC radio.

As a gay person who came of age after the worst of the experience of the LGBT community here in the U.S., I always felt disconnected from the stories that my mom told me about what my gay uncle experienced, Naughton says. But in Kenya, I witnessed that. [It was] amazing to see the way the community came together and supported each other in the face of horrifying violence and hardship and abuse.

The images are the first part of what Naughton and Kushner envision as a three-part project that follows refugees from beginning to end: from Uganda, where they came from; to Kenya, where they fled to; to the U.S., where two have resettled. It is our hope to create a record of the experience of the LGBTs that is underreported and unsung, Naughton says.

Jake Naughton is a photographer with is interested in the intersection of LGBT and immigration issues. He is a frequent contributor to The New York Times, and his work has appeared in Al Jazeera America, Newsweek and the Atlantic.

A lawyer for music producer Dr. Luke is responding to a report that Sony Music Entertainment will cut ties with him amid his legal battle with pop star Kesha, who has accused him of verbal and sexual abuse. The allegations are part of an ongoing lawsuit that has consumed the music industry in recent weeks.

Earlier Wednesday The Wrap reported that Sony will end its working relationship with Dr. Luke (real name: Lukasz Gottwald) a year before his contract is set to expire.

Jim Bates of Sitrick and Company issued a statement to TIME from Christine Lepera, an attorney for Luke:



This is not true. Luke has an excellent relationship with Sony. His representatives are in regular contact with executives at the highest levels at Sony and this has never come up.

A representative for Sony declined to comment to TIME. Representatives for Kesha did not return TIMEs request for comment.

Kesha (real name: Kesha Sebert) first accused Gottwald of sexual assault in a 2014 lawsuit. Gottwald, who produced many of Keshas hits in addition to songs for Katy Perry, Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus, has repeatedly denied the allegations. (He also filed a countersuit in 2014.) At a hearing last month, a judge ruled that Kesha could not be let out of her recording contracts while her lawsuit plays out in court. Since then, artists such as Lady Gaga and Adele have voiced their support for the singer. Taylor Swift also donated $250,000 to the singer.

Lawyers for Sony suggested at the hearing that the company was open to having Kesha record new music without Dr. Lukes involvement, but Keshas lawyer, Mark Geragos, called this an illusory promise and said such an arrangement would set Kesha up for failure. The companys ties to Gottwald, he argued, would keep Sony from properly promoting Keshas music.

Kesha is signed to Gottwalds Kemosabe Records, a Sony subsidiary, through a deal with Gottwalds Kasz Money production company. Last month, an attorney for Sony told the New York Times that the company did not have the power to terminate Keshas recording contract: Sony has made it possible for Kesha to record without any connection, involvement or interaction with Luke whatsoever, but Sony is not in a position to terminate the contractual relationship between Luke and Kesha.

Fans of the singer announced Wednesday that they are planning a Friday march on Sony Music Entertainments New York City headquarters, where they plan to present petitions with more than 400,000 signatures calling for Kesha to be released from her contracts.",[]

Schools back in session and for U.S. business schools, many eager to advertise their worldliness, that means welcoming droves of students who dont call America home. Stanford Graduate School of Business boasts a recent class that is 42 percent foreign. Harvard Business Schools Class of 2014 was 34 percent international. More than one out of three students at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business now calls somewhere else home.

So which country outside the United States is home to students most interested in studying there? The best measure may be the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), administered by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), which is typically required by M.B.A. programs in the United States.

In China, where the number of college and universities has doubled in the last decade, the number of GMAT exams taken has boomed from 8,779 in 2000 to 62,740 in 2015. And while China and India, where 29,055 tests were taken in 2015, now represent the vast majority of GMAT tests taken aboard, the rate of increase in test takers has grown far faster in other countries, according new numbers released by GMAC to TIME.

The number of tests taken in Saudi Arabia has gone up 952 percent from 252 in 2000 to 2,400 in 2015. The number of tests taken in Vietnam has increased 921 percent from 163 in 2000 to 1,501 in 2015. In Kuwait, the number has jumped from 95 to 647 during that period. While in Nepal, 506 tests were taken in 2015 compared to 75 tests in 2000.

U.S. test-takers now make up a little more than a third of all test-takers when they once represented a majority.

The recent shooting at Oregons Umpqua Community College, which claimed 10 lives in one of the nations deadliest mass shootings in recent years, has brought new scrutiny to the ease with which anyone can purchase a gun in America.

Authorities say that the 26-year-old gunman Christopher Harper-Mercer purchased the 14 weapons he owned legally. This has contributed to calls from politicians such as Hillary Clinton for expanded background checks, along with an end to the Charleston loophole, which allows for thousands of guns  55,887 between 1998 and 2014  to be sold to people with criminal records and mental illness, such as Dylan Roof.

How does that happen? Individuals attempting to purchase a gun through a licensed dealer  rather than at a private show or unlicensed online  are subject to a criminal background check conducted by the FBIs National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). In spite of its name, however, the system does not always return an instant verdict on whether the purchaser can buy the firearm. Since 1998, according to data from the FBI, federal and state governments have run 202 million background checks on prospective gun owners. Nine percent of these checks delay the sale. If three business days pass without a verdict from the FBI, licensed dealers can sell the gun anyway  a provision known as a default proceed.

Scroll through the interactive below to see how the background check loophole has put an average of 3,490 guns in the wrong hands every year since 1998.

The ATF said it could not provide information on how many of these weapons were recovered.

ATF spokeswoman Dannette Seward said that so far, theres been no uniform method by which agents are entering firearm retrievals into a database, so we have no meaningful way to pull that data.

It was this three-day NICS loophole that allowed Dylan Roof to legally purchase the gun he used to kill nine churchgoers during a Bible study in Charleston, S.C. on June 17, 2015. Roofs background check returned a recent arrest in Columbia, S.C., delaying the transaction. An FBI examiner contacted the Lexington County Sheriffs Office, who told her to check with Columbia Police. The examiner couldnt find a Columbia police department in Lexington County, not knowing a small part of the city of Columbia  where Roof was arrested  lies in neighboring Columbia County. Meanwhile, three days passed, allowing Roof to return and purchase the gun as a default proceed. We are all sick this happened, FBI Director James Comey said, we wish we could turn back time. From this vantage point, everything seems obvious.

The default proceed loophole was made possible by a last minute amendment added to the 1993 Brady Act by Congressman George Gekas, a Republican from Pennsylvania. The FBI has since suggested that more time be allotted to investigate delayed transactions, but the law remains unchanged. In response to questions about how NICS accommodates the three-day delay, FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer wrote in an email that the FBI continues the ongoing hiring initiative to increase the staff for the NICS section.

Following the shooting in South Carolina, Democratic Congressmen James Clyburn introduced the Background Check Completion Act, proposing the elimination of the three-day loophole. And Hillary Clinton went a step further Monday, discussing the possibility of exercising executive action to close the loophole if elected president.

While there has been no change at the federal level, several states and the District of Columbia have extended the three-day rule. In Tennessee, for instance, examiners are given 15 calendar days to examine the buyers background before a default proceed.

Some vendors have gone even further to close this loophole. Two years after a 2000 FBI report found that delayed background checks are 20 times more likely to be denied, Walmart refused to sell any firearm without a completed background check. But few other chains have adopted a dont know, dont sell policy.

Almost exactly a year ago, John Elfrank-Dana, a 58-year-old father of three, slipped on the steps of a New York subway, slammed his skull on the metal and concrete, and was launched into what can only be understood as the seventh circle of modern medical billing hell.

As a public school teacher in New York City, Elfrank-Dana gets his medical insurance through the districts Emblem plan. He pays a small premium each month and, like the rest of us, thought that meant he was covered in the event of an emergency. He would pay his deductibleand the insurance would pick the rest, right?

But that, Elfrank-Dana quickly discovered, is not how it actually works.

Five weeks after sustaining that head injury, Elfrank-Dana started feeling dizzy, checked into the nearest emergency room in Bergen County, New Jersey, and was rushed in for a craniotomy, a surgical procedure that removes part of the skull. After that, the hospital visits started piling up. He was treated for a fistula, then another surgery to drain the blood from his head again, then a series of appointments to address a brain infection related to the original craniotomy. It just never ended.

At one point in that nightmare, the medical bills started rolling in. A few thousand here. Ten thousand there. Twenty-two thousand more. By end of the year, Elfrank-Dana was staring down roughly $106,000 in medical bills. And none of it was covered by his insurance.

My insurance had made payments to the hospital and anesthesiologist but it was a fraction of what they were asking, Elfrank-Dana told TIME recently. So they started going after me for the balance.

While Elfrank-Dana didnt know it at the time, he had become the latest victim of what is known, aptly, as surprise medical bills. They arise when what an insurer pays a provider doesnt match up with what a doctor, physicians group or out-of-network hospital actually charges. It happens all the time.

According to a 2015 survey by Consumer Reports, surprise medical bills are extremely common. An estimated 1 in 3 American adults with private health insurance fell victim to a surprise medical bill in the past two years.

This weeks TIME magazine has a feature, The Hidden Cost of Surprise Medical Bills, describing the problem, its causes, and solutions, an includes more stories from people like Elfrank-Dana. Heres the Cliffs Notes version.

Surprise medical bills happen most often when a hospital contracts with medical providersincluding doctors, surgeons, anesthesiologists, lab techniciansthat do not accept the same insurance plans that the hospital does. That means that patients, like Elfrank-Dana, can walk into an in-network hospital, see an in-network doctor, and suddenly find himself on the hook for thousands of dollars anyway, just because he inadvertently received care from a provider, such as a lab technician or physician, who was out-of-network.

Surprise medical bill are especially common in emergency rooms and surgical theaters. Often, a patient will go in for a procedure with an in-network surgeon at in-network hospital, but then wake up from anesthesia to discover that, at some point, an out-of-network physician had popped into the room to provide a consultation or help with the surgery. And when that happens? Boom: the patient receives an out-of-network bill.

The whole problem of surprise medical bills arises from the convoluted way that medical billing works in this country. As it is, an insurance company, like Emblem or Blue Cross Blue Shield, negotiates a set of repayment rates with hospitals and medical providers, which they then list as in network. If a hospital or physicians group refuses to accept the insurance companys repayment ratesoften because theyre too lowthen those providers are listed as out-of-network.

But heres where it gets complicated. Often times, an insurance company will successfully negotiate with a hospital, but the hospital will then turn around and sign a sole contract with a group of, say, anesthesiologists or surgeons, who do not accept that same type of insurance.

That puts the patient in the awkward middle. A patients insurance covers all in-network costs after the patient reaches his deductible, but meanwhile, the patient himself is receiving bills from any and every out-of-network provider that contributed to his care. In many cases, insurance plans pay just a small percentage of such out-of-network bills, or nothing at all.

Obamacare was supposed to fix these sorts of problems, and the 2010 law does go part of the way there. But it leaves open two big loopholes.

The first has to do with emergency medical care. Under Obamacare, Americans dont have to worry about whether the nearest hospital is in-network or out-of-network. During medical emergencies, insurance companies are required to bill patients as if the hospital where they end up is in-network, even if its not. That means that if a patient usually pays a 20% co-pay for care at an in-network facility and 80% for care at an out-of-network facility, the insurers must abide by the 20% in-network co-pay.

Thats a huge step in the right direction, but it still leaves patients wide open to surprise bills. After all, theres nothing stopping any out-of-network medical provider at that hospital, including emergency room doctors, from sending patients a separate bill later, charging them for whatever their insurance company didnt cover. Thats what happened to Elfrank-Dana.

The second issue has to do with the total amount that patients can be charged out-of-pocket. Under Obamacare, insurers are required to cap out-of-pocket payments at $6,850 (and $13,700 for families). Again, thats progress. But those caps only include in-network care. If a patient like Elfrank-Dana reaches the $6,850 cap, but then receives $80,000 in surprise, out-of-network bills, after leaving the hospital, then, well, hes out of luck.

The big question on most peoples mind is whos to blame. And the answer is a political hot potato: if you pass a law that prohibits saddling patients with surprise bills, then someone else is going to be on the hook. And that someone else will be one of the three most powerful players in the American medical industry: insurance companies, hospitals and the physicians lobby. None of them want to be left holding the bag.

Jay Kaplan, the president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, says his heart goes out to patients, who he and his association work with on a person-to-person basis. We want patients out of the middle as much as everybody does, he told TIME recently. He puts the onus on insurers to offer higher reimbursement rates, in order to include more providers in-network. Insurance companies use their own black box database to determine how much theyre going to repay physicians, he says, and often times, those reimbursement rates are just not enough for doctors to accept them.

Tom Nickels, an executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, agrees: it should be the insurance companies that pay more, expand their networks, and eliminate the problem.

Insurance companies, meanwhile, say thats not realistic. Insurers already offer medical providers reimbursement rates that are as high as possible, while keeping costs for consumersyou, me, our employersare low as possible, said Clare Krusing, who represents Americas Health Insurance Plans. If insurers began paying doctors and hospitals as much as they asked for, insurance premiums would spike.

Providers that choose not to participate in a network plan have a variety of reasons, the main one being that they want to charge higher rates for their services, Krusing told TIME. When you have a pricing structure like that that, patients are being asked to write a blank check.

According to the 2015 Medscape survey, the average compensation for $284,000 for specialists and $195,000 for primacy care doctors. Average salaries have increased modestly but consistently since the passage of Obamacare in 2010. Emergency room physicians made a mean salary of $306,000 in 2015, up from $270,000 in 2013.

A year after his accident, Elfrank-Dana says his billing saga continues. His insurance company and the surgeon at the New Jersey hospital eventually reached a settlement totaling about $56,000, but hes still on the hook for roughly $50,000 more for both the hospital bill and the anesthesiologist. He recently got help from a consumer rights advocate and a billing secretary at a New York-based hospital, both of whom are coaching him, he says, on how to fight the charges. Despite two brain surgeries, Elfrank-Dana said that by last September, he started firing off one letter a day.

Its so hard figuring out whos the bad guy, he added. I know some people who take out a second mortgage to pay for these kinds of bills. For me, if I paid these bills, it would deplete my college savings for my kids. And I was saving for half of state school tuition for three kids. Thats the opportunity cost here. It makes me all the more indignant.",[]

A school district in Newark, N.J. is shutting off its water fountains after testing found lead in building drinking water, according to state health officials.

Drinking water at 30 schools in Newark tested positive for levels of lead higher than the federal standard, according to a joint announcement from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the Newark Public Schools. The Environmental Protection Agencys action level for lead, the threshold requiring additional action, is 15 parts per billion and drinking water in Newarks schools ranged from 16-558 ppb.

Of the some 300 water samples taken from the Newark school buildings, 59 were above the EPAs action levels for testing and no building had more than four samples above the action level. The water in Newarks schools is nowhere near some of the high levels of lead in Flint, Michiganone home there tested as high as 13,200 ppb.



Schools remains in session and New Jersey officials are urging parents not to worry, adding in the release: Parents should have no concerns about students water and food consumption at the school while the situation is addressed.",[]
