In the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, Congress in 1978 passed the Inspector General Act, establishing independent watchdogs whose job it is to uncover waste, fraud or abuse across scores of federal departments and agencies.









These public servants are our eyes and ears within the executive branch, as Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa described them in December.

Under the 1978 law, inspectors general, who are based in the agencies, have access to all records needed to do their job. But since the early days of the Obama administration, many agencies have systematically thwarted that access for whole categories of information  including, most notably, grand jury testimony, personal credit data and information from wiretaps.

The effect has been to slow down investigations into, among other things, the shooting of civilians during Drug Enforcement Administration raids in Honduras, sexual assaults in the Peace Corps and the F.B.I.s antiterrorism powers. Inspectors general have spent time and taxpayer dollars arguing for access to documents they should, by law, have in hand  denying the American people the robust scrutiny of their federal government.

Last July, the Office of Legal Counsel, which provides legal opinions to the president, issued a 68-page memo defending this obstructive behavior. Because certain documents are protected by statute from being disclosed publicly, the memo reasoned, agency officials must determine whether to hand them over to inspectors general.

This makes no sense. The whole point of an independent monitor is to counteract the self-interest of the agency it monitors. Giving inspectors general access to critical information is not the same as making that information public. Congress understood this back in 1978, and it has since reiterated the need for total, unmediated access  most recently in 2014, when it barred federal agencies from spending any money to deny inspectors general timely access to all records.

Equally important, for nearly three decades no one questioned the authority of inspectors general to obtain sensitive or protected information, and no one accused them of mishandling it. The problems began in 2010, when lawyers for the Federal Bureau of Investigation started to claim that they were barred by law from handing over certain documents.

As it is, inspectors general already operate under significant constraints. They cannot tell agencies what to do; they can only issue reports and urge the agencies, or Congress, to take corrective action. And even those reports are vetted by the agencies themselves before release, which erects another barrier to transparency.

Still, the inspectors work has managed to expose thousands of cases of wrongdoing by government officials, including the F.B.I.s violation of its wiretapping and other intelligence-gathering procedures, the Justice Departments roundup of hundreds of illegal immigrants after the Sept. 11 attacks, and many more.

On Tuesday, the Justice Departments inspector general, Michael Horowitz, announced an investigation into the actions of the F.B.I.s Hostage Rescue Team during the late-January shooting in Oregon that led to the death of an anti-government activist.

The Justice Department, where the pushback against the inspectors generals work began in 2010, now supports giving its own inspector general full access to documents. But meaningful legislation must cover all 72 inspectors general.

Congress is currently considering a bipartisan bill, sponsored by Mr. Grassley, to make clear once again that inspectors general may not be hindered in performing basic, critical review. The bill has been held up in the Senate since last year for unexplained reasons.

It is no surprise that government officials dont want their wrongdoing or incompetence made public. Inspectors general are on the front lines of ensuring the transparency needed if government is to be held accountable. They should have unfettered access to the materials they need to do their job.",[]

For all I know, as I write these words, Nathan Lane is lying dead on a chaise longue on the stage of the Westside Theater.









Probably not. You would have read the obituary by now. But Mr. Lane, who gave the first New York performance of White Rabbit Red Rabbit, a playful, enigmatic and haunting solo show by the Iranian writer Nassim Soleimanpour, was lying supine on that chaise when I left the theater as strictly instructed Monday night, the only night of the week the show is being presented. The play concludes with the ominous suggestion that  well, perhaps I shouldnt say any more.

The novelty  or gimmick, or both  of White Rabbit is that the actor performing the show does not have a chance to read it before arriving at the theater. He (or she) is handed the script onstage, before us, with no prior knowledge of its contents (unless, of course, he or she has already Googled it and got a general sense of what is in store). Every week, a different actor will perform the 75-minute piece. The list of upcoming performers, a diverse and distinguished lot, includes Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Wilson, Brian Dennehy and Cynthia Nixon. (Check the shows website to see who is performing when.)

Mr. Lane, I am tempted to say, could hardly be bettered. Mr. Soleimanpours play allows for interpolations and ad-libs from the actor performing it (Mr. Lane raised his hand when he was departing from the text) and nobody but nobody has a quicker wit and a more deft ability to joust merrily with the audience than he does. When handed a mysterious vial of powder at the start, he quipped, Its the 80s again!

After a reference to audience participation  a not insignificant element  he joked that this was, for him, a blight on the world somewhere between incest and folk-dancing. And perhaps the only tedious passage of the show comes up front, when the audience is counted, or rather counts itself, one by one; thank God, I cracked to myself, aping Mr. Lane, we were not in the voluminous Gershwin Theater. (A tip for those who share Mr. Lanes aversion: Most of the people conscripted for larger roles came from the first couple of rows, or participated voluntarily.)

I thought for a few minutes that Mr. Lane might hijack Mr. Soleimanpours play entirely and treat us to a Nathan Lane show, and who would complain? But Mr. Lane is also a dedicated and serious actor, great funnyman though he is, and he honored the playwrights words dutifully (if, yes, continuing to add his own marvelous asides here and there).

Reviewers have been admonished not to give away much about what transpires during these 75 minutes, so my hands are tied, to a certain degree. Maybe this is appropriate, since the play comments implicitly on the strictures that all artists  indeed, all citizens  in Iran and other authoritarian states must confront and negotiate on a daily basis.

Authoritarian regimes do not allow for freedom of artistic expression, of course. So among the shivery aspects of the play is the ghostly presence of the writer  absent and present, simultaneously  and ever in danger of being silenced, whether by the oppression of the countrys rulers or, more darkly, the anguish and despair that this can induce. (The program notes that by the time Mr. Soleimanpour was allowed to travel outside Iran, in 2013, White Rabbit, his first play, had been performed more than 200 times in 15 languages.)

The play also addresses obliquely  and you soon become aware that writers living in repressive cultures must cloak their ideas in symbols  the oppression of women in some Muslim nations; the alienation that living in such cultures can engender; and the universal human tendency to obey authority, whether its the laws under which people must live, or the text and directions an actor (or an audience member) has just been handed and told to perform.

Among the things I will say is that the actor performing the play is required to portray one animal playing another (no, not a rabbit), and that the play is a conversation among playwright, performer and audience, a conversation that, for all its diverting humor, takes on a gravity that prickles your skin when we are reminded that the author might not have the freedom to even see the performance we are watching. Exhortations to send him an email (we are given the address) enhance the sense of his disconnection from the wider world.

The title in fact refers to an experiment supposedly performed by the writers uncle, in which hungry rabbits had to compete for a lone carrot. This was another metaphor, to be read in any number of ways, for the brutality and divisiveness that living under an authoritarian regime may induce, but more broadly a general comment on human behavior.

Ill admit that I got a bit perplexed during the extensive discussion of the white rabbits and the red rabbits. Some other passages slide perilously close to pretentiousness, and much is shrouded in obscurity and frisky quirkiness. But Mr. Soleimanpours elliptical play keeps taking odd, unexpected turns that often lead us back to the relief of laughter.

Any worthy theatrical experience is, on some level, a dive down into a rabbit hole, where the destination is unknown, even if we know the play well. The distinction of White Rabbit Red Rabbit is that the performer moves right alongside us on the journey.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,The Cosby Case: Where Things Stand,['Graham Bowley'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Bill Cosby had once been due in a Pennsylvania court on Tuesday for a hearing in the only criminal case that has been brought out of the many sexual assault accusations leveled at the once-beloved entertainer. A judicial ruling last week, though, suspended those proceedings, perhaps for many months. Below are questions and answers to help untangle the complexities of that case and five civil suits in which Mr. Cosby is also embroiled.









What is the criminal case about?

Dogged by allegations of sexual misconduct for years, Mr. Cosby, 78, was charged in December with sexual assault in the case of a woman, Andrea Constand, who said he drugged and sexually abused her in 2004 at his home in a Philadelphia suburb. Until then, Mr. Cosby, who denies all wrongdoing, had never been charged with a crime.

Why did it take more than 11 years to bring charges?

An initial investigation in 2005 ended when prosecutors in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, concluded there was not enough credible evidence to bring the case to trial. But prosecutors reinvestigated last year. They say that the new inquiry was sparked by the dozens of women who came forward, starting in the fall of 2014, to say they, too, had been drugged or assaulted by Mr. Cosby.

In addition, parts of a deposition Mr. Cosby later gave in a 2005 civil case brought by Ms. Constand were revealed last year. In them, Mr. Cosby acknowledged obtaining quaaludes as part of his effort to have sex with women. Prosecutors say the recent accusations and the deposition testimony are included in the new evidence prompting them to bring charges.

Why was the criminal case suspended this month?

Mr. Cosby is trying to have the criminal charges dismissed, arguing that the Montgomery County district attorney at the time of the initial investigation made a binding commitment that he would not be prosecuted in the Constand case. The former district attorney, Bruce L. Castor Jr., says he made the pledge so that Mr. Cosby would testify in Ms. Constands subsequent civil suit without fear of prosecution based on what he said. Mr. Cosby testified and the suit ended in 2006 with him paying Ms. Constand a financial settlement.

Last month, Judge Steven T. ONeill of the state Court of Common Pleas rejected Mr. Cosbys bid to dismiss the charges; his lawyers appealed to the states Superior Court. The sitting district attorney, Kevin R. Steele, has moved to quash Mr. Cosbys appeal and the Superior Court suspended the criminal case while it considers Mr. Steeles arguments.

Whats next?

The Superior Court review of Mr. Steeles motion to quash the appeal could last several weeks, if not months. If the court agrees with the prosecution, then criminal proceedings would resume. If the Superior Court chooses to hear Mr. Cosbys appeal, a new round of deliberations would start.

The court could then dismiss the case entirely or rule that it should go forward. Either way, deliberations could take several more months, possibly pushing a criminal trial to late this year or even into 2017.

Even if the case proceeds, Mr. Cosbys lawyers may still try to suppress his testimony in Ms. Constands civil suit, arguing that he would never have sat for the deposition had he known it could be used against him.

What are the civil suits about?

Mr. Cosby faces four defamation suits  three in Massachusetts and one in California  filed by 10 women who say that he sexually assaulted them, typically decades ago. They came forward after it was no longer possible to file a lawsuit charging sexual assault because the statute of limitations had expired. So they have sued him for defamation, claiming they were branded as liars when Mr. Cosbys lawyers and other representatives dismissed their allegations as fabrications.

In one of the civil cases, lawyers have successfully fought to depose Mr. Cosbys wife, Camille, who was also his business manager. They are also fighting to avoid any delay caused by the criminal deliberations, arguing that their clients should be able to proceed with depositions regardless of the criminal case.

A fifth defamation suit, by a woman in Pittsburgh, was thrown out in January by a judge who said that statements by Mr. Cosby, his wife and his lawyer amounted to opinions protected by the First Amendment.

Are there any other civil cases against Mr. Cosby?

One woman, Judy Huth, is suing Mr. Cosby in California, asserting that he forced her to perform a sex act on him at the Playboy Mansion in 1974, when she was 15. Californias statute of limitations is extended for adults who contend they were victims of sexual abuse as children, her lawyers say.

A sixth suit was withdrawn by Chloe Goins, who said Mr. Cosby assaulted her in 2008. The suit was dropped after prosecutors in California said they would not bring sexual assault charges.

What does Mr. Cosby say?

Mr. Cosby has said that any sexual relations were consensual. He has responded to the seven women suing him in federal court in Massachusetts by, in turn, suing them for defamation. He is also suing Ms. Constand, her mother and her lawyers, seeking the return of money from the 2006 confidential financial settlement. He says they broke the agreement by, among other things, voluntarily cooperating with the Montgomery County prosecutors.

But he recently dropped a lawsuit against another woman he was suing for defamation, the former supermodel Beverly Johnson. His lawyers said that it was too difficult to pursue both the civil case and his criminal case in Pennsylvania but that they intended to refile.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Balkan Nations Shut Down March of Migrants,['Sewell Chan'],"LONDON  The route that more than one million migrants have used to traverse southeastern Europe was effectively shut down Wednesday, when four Balkan nations stopped waving the migrants through on their journey northward.









The four countries  Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia and Macedonia  have closed their borders to new migrants with the implicit backing of the European Union, which announced an agreement with Turkey on Tuesday to slow the flow of migrants.

The deal has not been completed  that is supposed to happen at a summit meeting next week. But within hours of the announcement from Brussels, Slovenia and Serbia announced new restrictions on the entry of migrants.

From midnight, there will be no more migration on the Western Balkan route as it took place so far, the interior minister of Slovenia, Vesna Gyorkos Znidar, said on Tuesday evening.

Serbia quickly followed suit on Wednesday. Serbia cannot allow itself to become a collective center for refugees, so it will harmonize all its measures with those of the E.U. member states, the countrys Interior Ministry said in a statement.

Prime Minister Tihomir Oreskovic of Croatia said at a news conference on Wednesday: The message is clear. Illegal migrants will no longer pass along this route.

Mr. Oreskovic said the agreement with Turkey had reduced the incentive for migrants to head to Europe. Like other leaders, he attributed the problem to traffickers who lure migrants into taking dangerous voyages across the Aegean Sea. In what way can we destroy this business model? he asked. Thats what it is, a business model.

The decision by the four Balkan countries does not affect regular vistors, like tourists or business travelers, but it is an effort to stop undocumented migrants from passing through the countries to seek asylum elsewhere. Very few migrants have applied for asylum in the Balkan countries.

The shutdown of the migrant corridor is consistent with an effort by Brussels to restore order after the asylum system broke down last year.

Under the new agreement with Turkey, any unauthorized migrant arriving in Greece will be automatically sent back to Turkey, and for each Syrian sent back, the European Union will resettle a Syrian refugee from Turkey.

The European Union has also pledged to expand humanitarian aid to help Turkey deal with the 2.7 million Syrian migrants living there; to expedite visa-free travel for Turks; and to reopen long-stalled negotiations over Turkeys application to join the 28-nation bloc.

Human rights groups, however, have objected to the European Unions proposed deal with Turkey, saying that returning asylum-seeking migrants en masse without first assessing their legal applications for refuge violate international law. About 2,000 migrants a day are entering Greece, observers have reported.

Lots of misery here at Idomeni border as 13K are trapped, 2 days of rains forecast, Peter Bouckaert, the emergencies director at Human Rights Watch, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday morning, referring to the Greek village near the Macedonian border, where people have been pouring through in recent months, under increasingly miserable conditions.

As of Wednesday night, Mr. Bouckaert said, migrants appeared to be leaving Idomeni for other points within Greece  as word of the blocked route through the Balkans rippled through the encampments.

The situation in much of the region seemed wretched, though not nearly as bad as the scenes of migrants stranded at the Budapest train station and at a camp in Calais, France, that became known as the Jungle.

In Slovenia, about 460 of the nearly 478,000 migrants who have entered the country since last October have applied for asylum there; the rest moved northward, with ambitions of reaching Germany and Sweden and other countries viewed as friendlier to asylum seekers.

In Croatia, 408 migrants are stuck in a camp in a small northern town of Slavonski Brod. Were in the process of defining the terms of their return to Greece, Croatias interior minister, Vlaho Orepic, said on Wednesday, without further explanation.

United Nations officials say there are around 1,000 migrants in Serbia and 1,500 in Macedonia.

In northern Macedonia, 437 people were stranded, unable to enter Serbia but unwilling to return to the squalid conditions of the reception center in the northern village of Tabanovce, where some 1,000 people were stuck. Many were women and children. As many as 2,000 people were stranded in Serbia, the United Nations refugee agency reported.

Greece remains the largest bottleneck; around 34,000 migrants are scattered around the country, on islands close to the Turkish coast; in the capital, Athens; and in the countrys second-largest city, Thessaloniki.

The European Union has given tacit approval to the actions of these countries, as it strives to restore order to the asylum-seeking process and to restore the integrity of the Schengen area, the 26-nation passport-free travel zone that is one of the blocs most tangible accomplishments.

Slovenia and Croatia are members of the European Union, and Serbia and Macedonia hope to join. Of the four countries, only Slovenia is part of the Schengen area. (Greece is also part of Schengen.)

Natasha Bertaud, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, the European Unions executive body, said that Slovenias decision to block refugees was part of the effort to restore order.

What this means is that third-country nationals who do not satisfy the entry conditions into the Schengen area, or who have not made an asylum request despite having had the opportunity to do so, will not be given entry into Slovenia, Ms. Bertaud said at a news conference.

The Slovenian policy was step toward ending the wave-through approach, she added.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-04 00:00:00,More Support for Early Exposure to Peanuts to Prevent Allergies,['Andrew Pollack'],"Photo

LOS ANGELES  Evidence is accumulating that food allergies in children might be prevented by feeding peanuts and other allergenic food to infants in their first year of life, researchers reported here Friday.

That finding would challenge the recommendation of the World Health Organization that babies be fed exclusively breast milk for the first six months of life.

At least as far as peanut is concerned, I would recommend parting from that, Dr. Gideon Lack, professor of pediatric allergy at Kings College London, said in an interview.

Dr. Lack was the senior author of a study last year that found feeding peanuts to young children starting when they are 4 to 11 months old sharply reduced the risk of their developing peanut allergies.

That upended the conventional wisdom that it is best to avoid introducing peanuts until children are older.

On Friday, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which helped pay for that study, issued proposed new guidelines recommending that children at risk of peanut allergies be fed peanuts starting at 4 to 6 months of age, though they should be tested first to make sure they do not already have an allergy.

But that initial study also left several unanswered questions. Some of those questions were answered by two additional studies that were set to be published online in The New England Journal of Medicine and were presented here at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology on Friday.

One question was whether children who consume peanuts from an early age will still remain free of allergies if they stop consuming them. The researchers followed the children from the original study for another year, from the time they turned 5 until they turned 6. For that year, they were not supposed to eat peanuts at all. The results found no big increase in allergies. It tells you the protective effect is stable, Dr. Lack said.

Another question was whether the early feeding technique could be applied to other types of foods and to children at normal risk of allergies. (The original study involved children deemed to have a high risk of peanut allergy.)

The researchers conducted a second study at Kings College London involving 1,300 infants who were 3 months old and being fed only breast milk. Half were randomly assigned to continue on only breast milk until 6 months of age, which is the recommended practice in Britain by the United Kingdom Department of Health.The other half were to be regularly fed small amounts of peanut butter and five other allergenic foods: eggs, yogurt, sesame, white fish and wheat. The children were assessed for allergies when they turned 3.

Over all, 5.6 percent of the infants who were fed the allergenic foods early on developed an allergy to at least one of the six foods, a modest improvement from the 7.1 percent in the breast-milk-only group. However, the difference was not statistically significant, meaning it could have occurred by chance.

One problem was that fewer than half of the parents in the early-introduction group actually fed their children the required six foods on a regular basis. But when researchers looked only at those children whose parents adhered to the feeding regimen, there was a statistically significant reduction in allergies. Only 2.4 percent of those children developed a food allergy, compared with 7.3 percent of those whose parents faithfully stuck to only breast milk for six months. There were also significant reductions in peanut and egg allergies alone.

One conclusion could be that feeding allergenic foods to infants early really does work to prevent allergies, providing that parents consistently follow the feeding regimen.

But researchers cautioned that there could be another explanation. One reason parents stopped feeding the foods is that they thought their children were having a possible allergic reaction to them. In that case, looking only at the children who were actually fed the food would overstate the effectiveness of the technique.

Dr. Lack said he did not think that was an explanation because the children in the early-introduction group whose parents did not adhere to the feeding protocol did not have an unusually high rate of allergies at age 3.

Dr. James R. Baker Jr., chief executive of Food Allergy Research & Education, a patient advocacy group, said that even if the benefits of early introduction were not totally clear for all the foods, there appeared to be little harm from that practice.

I think for a very long time here weve vilified these foods, he said at a news conference here. Theres no reason not to do this. Theres no harm that comes from early introduction.

In a commentary in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Gary W.K. Wong, a pediatrician at Chinese University of Hong Kong, cautioned against unproven conclusions. He said the fact that so many parents did not stick to the regimen suggested that it was too demanding to be practical and that less-burdensome ways must be found to introduce allergenic foods early.

In the meantime, he said, evidence is building that early consumption rather than delayed introduction of foods is likely to be more beneficial as a strategy for the primary prevention of food allergy.",[]

THURSDAY PUZZLE  Heres what can happen when your mother eagerly signs you up for music lessons when youre a child and you dont pay attention: You grow up to be a crossword puzzle blogger, responsible for explaining the puzzle to a large number of people, and then you wind up solving  or rather, not solving  a crossword that incorporates music notation theory as part of the theme. Its like one of those stress dreams we all have, but this is for real.

Somewhere in Florida, my mother is laughing her behind off.

This is as good a time as any to admit to you that I had to look at the answers to crack the theme. That is not as bad as it sounds; who amongst us has not revealed an answer here or there? No one, thats who, and that is a good lesson for all you beginning solvers out there. Dont feel that you cant take a peek if you think youll learn something from it. That knowledge is stored away for the next time you will see it in a puzzle. Streaks be damned. [Cleans off the remains of the tomatoes thrown at me.]

Sidenote: I originally thought this puzzle was going to be a commentary about footballs DEFLATEGATE and that the black squares in the lower center of the grid represented goalposts. You see how misdirected you can get on a Thursday?

Anyway, if, unlike me, you did not fall asleep in music theory class, you will recognize that there are supposed to be two musical notes in three of the squares of Andrew Zhous mirror symmetry puzzle. Each note is used once: one note for the Across entry and one note for the Down entry. For example, at 16 Across and 6 Down, we have the respective entries MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY and THE SHARPER IMAGE. Where the two entries cross, we have the two rebus elements: F NATURAL going across and E SHARP going down.

And because you havent had enough agita for the day, all of the notes are different. If you are solving this on the web or in our app, please note that the accepted entries are supposed to be either the entire entry (either Across or Down) or the first letter. So, for 16 Across and 6 Down, the accepted answers should be F NATURAL, F, E SHARP or E.

As a public service, I would like to present you with the six theme entries:

16A/6D: MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY / THE SHARPER IMAGE

65A/53D: LOOKING SHARP / GET A FLAT

66A/55D: DEFLATEGATE / CARD SHARP

In addition, Mr. Zhou has thrown in some long Downs that highlight the theme, MUSICAL NOTE and TWO TONE CARS (sort of). For my money, One added to the staff? also wins Clue of the Day.

Constructors Notes:

A couple of months back, Evan Birnholz espoused his theory that music and crossing words have much to do with one another. Ive always thought that a good crossword works like a piece of Bachian counterpoint, in which both the vertical (harmony) and the horizontal (melody) are required to maintain absolute integrity. In that spirit, todays puzzle puns in the form of ENHARMONIC spellings, wherein the same sounded pitch (in equal temperament) is notated in two different ways. I hope it offers a significant contribution to the canon of musical puns, which includes beloved classics like, If you dont C-sharp, youll B-flat. Heres to a music-filled Thursday!

And that is why I failed to solve todays crossword puzzle, Officer. Please dont tell my mother.

We just have to move on to the Friday puzzle with this song:

Many people take a daily low-dose aspirin to lower the risk of heart disease, and several studies have shown that regular aspirin use reduces the risk for some cancers. Now a long-term analysis has found that its population-wide benefits against cancer may be even greater than previously believed.

Researchers studied aspirin use in 135,965 health care professionals, men and women, tracking their health for as long as 32 years. Over the course of the study, published in JAMA Oncology, there were 27,985 cases of cancer.

Regular aspirin use reduced the risk for all cancers by about 3 percent, though it had no impact on the risk for breast, lung or prostate cancer.

But regular aspirin use reduced the risk for all gastrointestinal cancers by 15 percent, and for cancers of the colon and rectum by 19 percent.

The senior author, Dr. Andrew T. Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard, pointed out that even people who undergo regular colorectal screening can develop cancers, and aspirin could help prevent some of those cancers as well.

Based on our estimates, Dr. Chan said, we think that regular aspirin use could prevent almost 30,000 cases of gastrointestinal cancers a year, which account for almost 25 percent of all cancer deaths. So I think thats pretty substantial.",[]

I dont need to introduce him to you, but if I did, I would say that Mr. Reiner transformed the landscape of comedy through his work on Your Show of Shows, The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Jerk, Oceans 11 and oh, my, how could I forget his partnership with Mel Brooks in The 2,000 Year-Old Man? He is a winner of multiple Emmys and exactly one Grammy. The third volume of his memoirs, What I Forgot To Remember, comes out on April 10, 2015.

To celebrate the publication of his book and his guest appearance here on Wordplay, Mr. Reiner was also kind enough to provide us with some relevant bonus content which I highly encourage you to read by clicking here.

Before you do that, however, please enjoy Mr. Reiners take on Finn Vigelands Monday puzzle:

Carl Reiners Notes:

I am an avid crossword puzzle player. I am a whiz at completing a Monday puzzle in the L.A. Times, almost a whiz at doing the Monday New York Times and am fairly confident that I will complete or almost complete their Tuesday puzzles. The possibility of success for the rest of the week diminishes each day and rarely do I ever attempt the weekend offerings. In those Monday puzzles I so appreciate the clues that ask Giants right fielder, Mel or Early German film director and star, Von Stroheim or Man of a thousand faces, Chaney, or early silent film stars, Lillian and Dorothy, or film Tarzan. It was a pleasure, without hesitation, to write in, Ott, Eric, Gish, Lon, or Ron and once Ely, the first and second names of the man who played Tarzan. At times I was thrilled and delighted to read clues such as  Fritz, Carl or Rob, or Robs filmmaker father. Or Carls filmmaker son. In approaching the challenge of filling in some of the tougher boxes of these easy puzzles, I resorted to writing in (with a pen, I am that confident) a few ss and ds, the last letters of words that were obviously either plural or past tense. Actually, I also filled in an e before the s or the d. Today, being Monday, I am proud to say that, in the loo, I was able to fill in all but one letter of The New York Timess puzzle. The clue for the last missing letter was, ___ My Ride, (old MTV series). That letter was a p as in Pimp. I added that p a few seconds after leaving the loo. To be honest, I did not know of that old MTV series but, Aaron Davis, one of my publishers, did and he coached me as I wrote it in.

Thank you, Mr. Reiner. Its an honor to have you here.

And lets also check in with Mr. Vigeland, todays constructor:

Constructors Notes:

When I first started constructing, I gravitated toward the thrill of constructing complicated themes or adventurous themelesses, thinking it was a better test of my constructing skills. But Id also always heard from veteran puzzlers how difficult it is to make a good Monday puzzle: find a simple theme, but not an overdone one, then fill it with interesting words, but dont make it too hard. Today is my first foray into easy puzzle territory. At first, Will thought it was almost too easy, since you can write in the whole theme once you get one of the sets of circled letters. Im glad we agreed that the lively fill made it worth your time. Heres hoping that my non-puzzle friends are able to solve this one!

Lets move on to the Tuesday puzzle with some wisdom from the 2,000 Year-Old Man:

IT might seem like a good time to be a long-haul trucker: More than ever, the American economy relies on hundreds of thousands of 18-wheelers to move goods across the country. But the industry is in crisis, with drivers leaving in droves because of low pay and poor working conditions.









A big part of the problem is that when it comes to long-haul trucking, the governments focus has been almost entirely on road safety. Thats not a misplaced concern; highway accidents involving semis kill about 5,000 people per year. But it overlooks a critical concern: the well-being of the drivers themselves.

We have inside knowledge of the trucking industry and the kinds of working conditions that truckers endure every day. One of us  Professor Balay  is a former long-haul trucker who does ethnographic research on blue-collar workers. The other, Professor Shattell, is a researcher and registered nurse who has studied the mental, physical and sexual health of truckers.

We know better than most why the allure of long-haul trucking is so strong: Behind the wheel of a semi, drivers feel connected to  almost one with  all that power. The job involves a high degree of skill and focus; floating the gears takes coordination and timing, maneuvering that bulk takes visual perceptiveness and courage, and surviving against the odds of weather, mountains, construction zones, cultural scorn and boredom takes a certain kind of toughness. Truckers take pride in their work, especially given that there are precious few other meaningful blue-collar jobs out there these days.

And yet when it comes to the operation of those big machines, the federal government seems to have forgotten that there are actual people behind the wheel. Drivers are largely regulated by the Department of Transportation, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, not the Department of Labor. That allows the government to address highway safety through things like maximum driving hours, mandatory rest times and annual physicals.

Such steps are meant to keep our roads safe, and they indirectly help drivers. But it also leaves them exposed to inhumane and demeaning work conditions, including abusive amounts of surveillance and micromanaging. Truckers are told what route to take, where to buy gas and for how much, when and where to sleep. They work 14-hour days routinely and continuously, often without weekends, sick pay or holiday pay. They drive 11 of those hours, and perform other work for the remaining three: loading, vehicle maintenance and a lot of waiting.

This mistreatment doesnt just harm the drivers. By forcing experienced workers to leave the industry, it leads employers to hire younger and less capable drivers. Under pressure from the industry, last month the Senate approved a pilot program that will allow 18-year-olds to drive semis across state lines, even though the 18- to 21-year-old demographic has one of the highest accident rates.

It also undermines truck-safety rules themselves: As long as drivers arent behind the wheel, the Department of Transportation lets employers do what they want with their drivers  which usually means they get back on the road unrested and irritated, hardly the person you want driving an 18-wheeler.

None of this is a secret; drivers have been raising concerns for years. But rather than improving working conditions and increasing requirements for rest, or regulating the companies themselves, legislators typically respond to truck-accident rates by amping up surveillance of truck drivers. Often speed is governed, with the truck unable to go over a specific speed; in other cases a sensor measures the distance from the front of the truck to the vehicle ahead, automatically braking if the space is deemed insufficient. Some companies even have two-way cameras trained on truck drivers 24/7. (Meanwhile, a new rule limiting a truckers workweek to 70 hours, down from 82, has been suspended since 2014.)

Its not that Congress hasnt tried; its that the few labor laws that do exist have been passed piecemeal, so they do more harm than good.

Take a recent rule requiring that truckers with sleep apnea use a continuous positive airway pressure machine when theyre asleep in their trucks. The machines are supposed to help truckers sleep better, which is great. But they also need power to run, more power than a truck battery can provide, so truckers have to run their engines. But many states forbid drivers to idle their trucks. So truckers often cant win  they must break one of these laws. No wonder they leave.

The solution isnt easy, but it is straightforward. Congress needs to give the Department of Labor the power to regulate truck drivers working conditions, and mandate that it coordinate its policies with the Department of Transportation. The upshot should be to extend the variety of workplace protections available to almost all American workers to the millions of men and women driving the nations commercial trucking fleet.

After all, the best way to protect the people driving alongside Americas long-haul trucks is to protect the people behind the wheel of those trucks, too.",[]

SUNDAY PUZZLE  April of this year marks the 400th anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare, and David J. Kahn is back with a puzzle about some of the Bards characters.

But hark, as the Bard no doubt would have said: What hath happened to our clues? All of the theme entry clues say See blurb. In case you missed it, the blurb is a Notepad that says The answers to 23-, 31-, 45-, 62-, 69-, 90-, 103- and 115-Across are themselves clues to the names spelled by their circled letters. That means that you will have to first solve the puzzle to get the clues, and then you will find the answers to the clue/answers inside the shaded/circled squares. Got that?

Not really? O.K., lets spell it out (sorry). Did you note the puzzles title, In Character? Thats a big hint to the theme. If you can solve 23 Across using the crossings, you get COMRADE OF MERCUTIO, and the shaded/circled letters inside that phrase spell out ROMEO, who was, in fact a COMRADE OF MERCUTIO. The character is in the clue, which is also the answer. Forget it, you guys; its Stratford-upon-Avon.

Here are the rest of them:

31A: BANQUET GHOST / BANQUO

45A: ELDERLY MONARCH / LEAR

62A: SCHEMER AGAINST CAESAR / CASCA

69A: LOVE INTEREST OF OLIVIA / VIOLA

90A: EVIL ANTAGONIST / IAGO

103A: MACABRE THANE / MACBETH

115A: UNHAPPY MALCONTENT / HAMLET

Clue of the Day for me was Italian fine? for BENE, followed by One carrying a toon? for CEL. I thought that 118 Downs answer was N.F.L. for Packers org., and was unpleasantly surprised when it turned out to be N.R.A. Oh well.

Lets hear from Mr. Kahn:

Constructors Notes:

I had just seen Something Rotten!, a very funny Broadway musical, and I was looking to do something to commemorate the upcoming 400th anniversary of Shakespeares death. The theme came to me when I realized that FRIEND OF MERCUTIO (where FRIEND later became COMRADE) included the name ROMEO. Coming up with other answers and getting this puzzle accepted was a struggle. My original submission had a few themed answers Will and Joel felt were either contrived (OPHELIAS COMPLEX SUITOR, anyone?) or hid characters with only four letters in 21-letter answers (e.g., VILLAIN UNDOING OTHELLO). They liked the concept, though, so I focused on shortening the answers and adding some 5-, 6- and 7-letter characters. I stuck to Shakespeares more popular plays and Will/Joel offered a lot of feedback along the way. Finally, deleting SHAKESPEARE as an answer, which I did at the very end, makes for more of an aha moment.

If you would like to join the observance, which is being called Shakespeare400 online, you can start here.

And while were talking iambic pentameter, lets watch Robin Williamss brilliant take on the playwright:

The surprisingly dangerous Caitlin Lovinger will be sitting in for me while Im on vacation. Happy solving, and Ill see you all when I get back.

LONDON  They have been called the Diamond Geezers and the Bad Grandpas: four thieves in their 60s and 70s who used diamond-tipped drills to break into a safe deposit company in London and make off with plastic garbage bins stuffed with $20 million in gems, gold and cash.









In a case that prosecutors have called the largest burglary in English history, three of the ringleaders  Daniel Jones, 61; Terrence Perkins, 67; and John Collins, 75  were each sentenced to seven years in prison on Wednesday at a court in southeast London.

Brian Reader, 77, another ringleader, whom the others called The Master, is in a prison hospital after having had a stroke and is expected to be sentenced at a later date. All four had pleaded guilty.

Three other men  Hugh Doyle, 48; William Lincoln, 50; and Carl Wood, 58  played lesser roles, including helping to either store, transfer or conceal the stolen valuables. On Wednesday, Mr. Lincoln was sentenced to seven years in jail, and Mr. Wood to six years, while Mr. Doyle received a suspended sentence.

Around Easter last year, members of the white-haired gang slid down an elevator shaft at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. in Londons diamond district. Once inside, they disabled the alarm system and bored three large holes through about 20 inches of reinforced concrete. Over four days  including a two-day break to buy a hydraulic pump  they ransacked 73 safe deposit boxes.

As the judge read out their sentences, the three ringleaders, several of them using electronic hearing aids, were individually asked to stand up in a glass enclosure at the back of the court.

Mr. Jones, wearing a plum-colored sweater, stared ahead blankly. Thank you, judge, he said, after the sentence was read out.

The men appeared resigned but shuffled uncomfortably in their seats. As he was led out of court, Mr. Jones blew a kiss to relatives in the gallery.

Judge Christopher Kinch said the burglary had stood out for the scale of its ambition and the value of the property stolen. This must rank among the worst offenses of its type, he said.

The case, which captivated Britain and made headlines around the world, presented two contrasting narratives. The defense sought to portray the gang as pill-popping, doddering old men, with ailments such as diabetes and bladder-control problems, who had engaged in a nonviolent folly. They were so inept, defense lawyers argued, that they had used the book Forensics for Dummies to help prepare for their crime.

But the prosecution depicted the men as ruthless and selfish criminals who, the police said, had wanted to sweeten their pension pots and were robust enough to wield heavy power tools. Mr. Reader, prosecutors said, had been a close associate of Kenneth Noye, one of Britains most dangerous gangsters who is serving a life sentence for a 1996 murder. Prosecutors said Mr. Reader had teamed up with Mr. Noye to help launder $40 million in stolen gold after a theft at Heathrow Airport in 1983, known as the Brinks-Mat robbery.

Mr. Perkins also has a long criminal record. He participated in a notorious robbery, also in 1983, in which a hooded gang with sawed-off shotguns stole about $8.6 million in cash from a London security company.

The police also emphasized on Wednesday that the gang had ruined the lives of dozens of victims who had kept their life savings in the safe deposit company. Craig Turner, head of the police unit that investigated the case, warned the public not to feel sorry for the perpetrators. They are all callous career criminals, he said.

The defense, however, maintained that the thieves were being unfairly treated as dangerous criminals, held in a high-security prison with only about 30 minutes a day to exercise. It is a comedy, Mr. Doyle, a plumber who has been out on bail, said in an interview outside the courtroom before the sentencing, referring to the fact that he had spent six months in a prison that is also used to hold terrorists.

Members of the gang were plucky and eccentric, the jury heard during the trial. Mr. Jones wore a fez and sometimes slept in his mothers dressing gown, alongside his dog, Rocket. Mr. Lincoln was known by the others as Billy the Fish, after a character in a comic strip, because he made extra cash by supplying seafood to his friends.

While the gang members had long criminal records, during their trial they often came across as bumbling and ill prepared. The crew learned to use their high-tech drills by watching YouTube. Mr. Reader took a bus to the robbery, using his free pass for seniors. The men also continued to use their cellphones and cars weeks after the crime, making it easy for the police to track them. And they hid some of the stolen goods under a gravestone in a Victorian cemetery in North London.

This was a 1980s team taking on 21st-century law enforcement, Peter Rowlands, Mr. Perkinss defense attorney, said in court.

The gang also made one big and amateurish mistake: They bragged about what they had done  often in expletive-laced Cockney rhyming slang. Their boasts were picked up by bugs that the police had installed in their cars, which officers had tracked after security cameras near the safe deposit company had recorded their license plates. Lip readers working for Scotland Yard also recorded their boasts at a pub.

Prosecutors said that about two-thirds of the valuables had not yet been recovered and that the sentences of the thieves could be extended at a hearing next year if they did not pay back what they had stolen.

Also casting a shadow over the case is the mystery of a fifth ringleader, called Basil, who the police suspect disabled the alarm and who is still at large. Basils lanky frame and distinctive red hair were captured by a security camera during the burglary, though the red hair may have been a wig.

In February, Mr. Jones wrote a letter to Sky News saying Basil was the brains of the operation and describing him as a former police officer who was involved in private security. Mr. Jones said that he did not know Basils true identity, and that he would not reveal it even if he did.

The police are concerned that Basil may have fled the country with millions of dollars in stolen valuables, and Scotland Yard on Wednesday renewed its offer of 20,000 pounds, or about $28,500, for information leading to his arrest.

Philip Evans, the leading prosecutor, noted in an interview that the case had sometimes seemed like a cross between Dads Army, a BBC comedy series about aging Home Guard soldiers during World War II, and the movie Oceans Eleven.

The audacity of the crime, Mr. Evans said, was exceptional.",[]

In political circles, it was the equivalent of Dylan goes electric  or at least Rose McGowan goes bald.









When Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, the clean-cut new Speaker of the House, showed an out-of-character beard on Instagram following the Thanksgiving break, the press corps greeted it as one of the most politically potent sets of whiskers since Benjamin Harrison, with his Socrates chin fuzz, stalked the White House in the 1890s.

Journalists and pundits mused about whether Mr. Ryans neatly cropped stubble, which suggested vintage George Michael as much as urban woodsman, signaled a significant political statement.

In a country riven by factionalism, it was little surprise that opinions were sharply divided.

What is Paul Ryan thinking? the National Review asked. Grow the economy, not facial hair. Cut taxes, as well as whiskers.

GQ was also skeptical, calling it the eye-roll-inducing style move equivalent to your father showing up to dinner on a skateboard.

Photo

The New York Post gave the beard a thumbs up: In our opinion, he now looks less like the frat boy youd pick a fight with in government class and more like a top dog.

In ditching his razor, the speaker may be proving that he is in tune with cultural currents that run deeper than the prevailing Brooklyn street styles.

After all, politics these days seems to be about running as an anti-establishment outsider. The tsunami in the Republican Party, as displayed with abandon by the support of Trump and Carson, is that the outsider is in, said Tammy Haddad, a Washington media consultant and former political director of MSNBC.

Even though Mr. Ryans job is the center of the entire political system, she said, the beard shows that hes not of Washington, hes not part of the system.

The speaker himself seemed to acknowledge this, sounding both proud and self-conscious on Instagram, writing: Waiting on confirmation from the House Historian, but apparently, Im the first Speaker to sport a beard in about 100 years.

A fact check by Alan Rappeport on The New York Timess First Draft politics blog showed that he was pretty close; the last bearded house speaker was named (irony alert) Frederick H. Gillett, who held the post until 1925.

There was a time when beards were the political mainstream. Starting with Abraham Lincoln in 1861, beards were popular with presidents for a half-century. But no president since William Howard Taft (1909-1913), with his extravagant handlebar, has padded through the White House garden with visible whiskers (unless you count Richard Nixons Flintstone-esque five oclock shadow).

According to the book Of Beards and Men, by Christopher Oldstone-Moore, Thomas A. Dewey, a two-time presidential loser, addressed the facial-hair issue in 1950. Dewey, whose cookie-duster mustache made him look like the priggish Higgins from Magnum P.I., told a Boy Scout troop: Any boy can become president  unless hes got a mustache.

Indeed, for much of the 20th century, beards were the stuff mostly of Marxist guerrillas (Fidel Castro, Ho Chi Minh), campus radicals and, later, sensitive 70s types.

In recent years, growing a beard in American politics was often interpreted as a sign of dropping out, like when Al Gore donned whiskers following his 2000 presidential loss.

Sure, there have been exceptions. The Former New Jersey Senator Jon Corzine wore a beard in the 2000s, but as a onetime Goldman Sachs chief executive, his Washington image always read more slumming rich guy than political lifer.

And Jay Carney, the former Obama spokesman, drew gasps when he strode to the podium last January with a new set of whiskers.

Given these politically sensitive times, its safe to assume that Mr. Ryan considered the implications of his style experiment.

Indeed, the official explanation seemed carefully crafted: This was a hunting beard, the product of weekend at a deer camp, said a spokeswoman for the speaker. (Subtext: I hunt. I am an alpha male).

That message is politically expedient, said Mr. Oldstone-Moore, the beard book author. As leader of a fractious party, a lot of people would like a piece of him, he said. He is signaling with his face what he has been saying in so many words: I will lead on my own terms, I am my own man, and will not take guff from anyone.

During a conversation on Tuesday with Mike Allen of Politico, Mr. Ryan said he had kept his beard thus far because both I havent gotten my bow kill yet and his wife, Janna, is tolerant, allowing him to keep this for a little while.(Subtext: Im not that kind of alpha male; Im sensitive to women voters).

That message has populist appeal, according to Bernard Whitman, a pollster who has worked for Bill Clinton and Michael R. Bloomberg. The beard makes him look cool and contemporary, Mr. Whitman said, which makes him more appealing to women, gays and millennials.

The debate echoes one in the social sciences, between Darwins ornament theory (the beard as plumage, to attract mates) and weapon theory (the beard as symbol of power, to intimidate rivals).

Both could be useful for the speaker. Or perhaps, neither.

He is experimenting, Mr. Oldstone-Moore said. He is seeing what the reaction is. If people are impressed, he may stick with it. If not, he can say it was a hunting beard, and away it goes.

If nothing else, it gives us something to talk about other than Donald Trumps hair.",[]

A Hedwig and the Angry Inch reunion of sorts will arrive at Cafe Carlyle this month, set to the music of ... Radiohead.

Lena Hall and Michael C. Hall, who appeared opposite each other in Hedwig in 2014-5, will perform a tribute titled Radiohead: Obsessed, on March 19.

The duo (who are not related) will perform songs from the bands early days, when it originated with the 1992 single Creep, to its last album, The King of Limbs, which was released in 2011. Radiohead will play several festival dates this summer, and a new album is expected this year.

Ms. Hall, a Tony winner, performed at the Carlyle last spring, and has made Radioheads Karma Police part of her recent repertoire. (Last month, she wrote on Twitter that she had recorded the song.) Mr. Hall recently played in the lead role in the musical Lazarus, one of David Bowies last projects.

After serving as a judge for the Northern Short Courses photo contest, the National Press Photographers Association and the City University of New Yorks journalism school invited Michelle V. Agins to attend their three-day conference the last weekend of February in Iselin, N.J. I wanted to go, because you get to learn new things, said Ms. Agins, 62, a New York Times staff photographer. I wanted to be up-to-date on what was going on in the profession.

The judging and the conference energized her, she said. Young photographers sought her out for advice. But perhaps the biggest lesson they could have learned came from what she did in her down time.

When they asked me to be a judge for the contest, it lifted my spirits. You get to be a certain age in your profession and you think its almost time to turn the corner. This got me excited.

In January, I judged thousands of photos, and that revived me, made me hungry again and excited about what I was doing. After that, they invited me to the conference, which I wanted to attend to catch up on the latest information, gear and tricks. I really just went to enjoy the conference.

That was short-lived, because one of the kids there asked me to look at her portfolio. O.K., I did. Then she told about somebody elses. Before you knew it, I was looking at portfolios until three in the morning!

In a lot of portfolios, they were just putting stuff in there. I knew what they were doing: They were letting me know they can do this. I told them theyre in the neighborhood, but theyre not there yet. Why? Dont show me your stuff until youre ready.

That Saturday, I was in the midst of going from workshop to workshop, taking the hotel elevator, when I saw this lady with this cute little girl and boy. The lady had a fancy dress and shoes, as if she were going to a wedding.

Are you the flower girl? I asked the one child, Milan Hutchinson.

No, she told me. Im in the pageant.

Her mother, Sade Bell, told me that Milan, who is 7, was in the Miss Celebrity Spotlight Pageant and that they were going to get her hair done. I asked her, Can I follow you for a minute?

Sure, Ms. Bell replied.

You dont mind me photographing? I asked.

No, she said. I want her to get used to being photographed, I want her to get used to dealing with it and not think about it.

She was my kind of girl, so we hung out for two hours.

What really attracted me was not so much the little girl, but the whole thing. This was an outside activity that was earned: If she didnt do well in school or clean her room, she wouldnt be participating in the pageant.

Her mother got Milan an outfit a size larger, so she could use it for a while, because these dresses are very expensive. She had to pin it to make sure it fit properly. At one point Milan was fidgeting, so I decided to step back and let her mother take care of those pins. I took a little break, then came back. By then, her 4-year-old brother, Tristen, wanted some me time. You wouldnt believe the patience Milan had dealing with her brother right before the pageant.

All of this was going on, and I was so honored to be able to be there and disappear.

We all went down to the lobby for her final makeup. After that, they called her number and we went up. There was a big guy at the door who asked me Do you have a stamp? I told him Im her photographer! and walked in real fast with the mother so they wouldnt have a chance to check me. I did the best I could to get close without getting kicked out.

The weekend had energized me. It was that energy inside me that led me to make those pictures. In a spiritual way, this is my calling; this is what Im about. Im not going to ignore a moment. I might be told, No, go away. But Ill find a way to get into the next door.

If that little girl had said No, there was hotel full of them and I was going to find one. She was my calling.

As told to David Gonzalez.

nytimes.com,2016-03-01 00:00:00,Testing for Joy and Grit? Schools Nationwide Push to Measure Students Emotional Skills,['Kate Zernike'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

SAN FRANCISCO  The fifth graders in Jade Cooneys classroom compete against a kitchen timer during lessons to see how long they can sustain good behavior  raising hands, disagreeing respectfully and looking one another in the eye  without losing time to insults or side conversations.









As reward for minutes without misconduct, they win prizes like 20 seconds to kick their feet up on their desks or to play rock-paper-scissors. And starting this year, their school and schools in eight other California districts will test students on how well they have learned the kind of skills like self-control and conscientiousness that the games aim to cultivate  ones that might be described as everything you should have learned in kindergarten but are still reading self-help books to master in middle age.

A recent update to federal education law requires states to include at least one nonacademic measure in judging school performance. So other states are watching these districts as a potential model. But the race to test for so-called social-emotional skills has raised alarms even among the biggest proponents of teaching them, who warn that the definitions are unclear and the tests faulty.

I do not think we should be doing this; it is a bad idea, said Angela Duckworth, the MacArthur fellow who has done more than anyone to popularize social-emotional learning, making grit  the title of her book to be released in May  a buzzword in schools.

She resigned from the board of the group overseeing the California project, saying she could not support using the tests to evaluate school performance. Last spring, after attending a White House meeting on measuring social-emotional skills, she and a colleague wrote a paper warning that there were no reliable ways to do so. Our working title was all measures suck, and they all suck in their own way, she said.

And there is little agreement on what skills matter: Self-control? Empathy? Perseverance? Joy?

There are so many ways to do this wrong, said Camille A. Farrington, a researcher at the University of Chicago who is working with a network of schools across the country to measure the development of social-emotional skills. In education, we have a great track record of finding the wrong way to do stuff.

Schools began emphasizing social-emotional learning around 2011, after an analysis of 213 school-based programs teaching such skills found that they improved academic achievement by 11 percentile points. A book extolling efforts to teach social-emotional skills in schools such as the KIPP charter network and Riverdale Country School in New York, How Children Succeed by Paul Tough, appeared the next year.

Argument still rages about whether schools can or should emphasize these skills. Critics say the approach risks blaming the victim  if only students had more resilience, they could rise above generational poverty and neglected schools  and excuses uninspired teaching by telling students it is on them to develop zest, or enthusiasm. Groups that spent decades urging the country toward higher academic standards worry about returning to empty talk of self-esteem, accepting low achievement as long as students feel good.

But teaching social-emotional skills is often seen as a way to move away from a narrow focus on test scores, and to consider instead the whole child. It may seem contradictory, then, to test for those skills. In education, however, the adage is whats measured gets treasured; states give schools money to teach the subjects on which they will be judged.

Next year, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a test of students in grades four, eight and 12 that is often referred to as the nations report card, will include questions about students social-emotional skills. A well-known international test, PISA, is moving toward the same.

The biggest concern about testing for social-emotional skills is that it typically relies on surveys asking students to evaluate recent behaviors or mind-sets, like how many days they remembered their homework, or if they consider themselves hard workers. This makes the testing highly susceptible to fakery and subjectivity. In their paper published in May, Dr. Duckworth and David Yeager argued that even if students do not fake their answers, the tests provide incentive for superficial parroting rather than real changes in mind-set.

You think test scores are easy to game? said Martin West, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, who is working with the districts in California. Theyre relatively hard to game when you compare them to a self-report survey.

Students might be tested on performance, as in the marshmallow test, in which children were told they could have a sweeter reward if they waited. Those who waited scored higher in self-control. But those tests are too time-consuming to use on a large group of students.

Other researchers have proposed calling or texting students at regular intervals to check their behavior and frame of mind, or monitoring Facebook or Twitter to observe patterns of behavior. But privacy concerns would almost certainly disqualify those.

Transforming Education, a Boston-based group that is among the biggest proponents of teaching social-emotional skills, argues that they are so important that schools have to begin testing for them, even if perfect measures do not exist.

The group worked with the school districts here  which count one million students, or 20 percent of the state total, in cities including Los Angeles and Oakland  to choose four measures to evaluate: growth mind-set, social awareness, self-efficacy and self-management.

The districts tested 10,000 students in 2014, and nearly 500,000 students last year, surveying things like how many days the students had come to school prepared (self-management), and whether they believed it was more important to be talented or to work hard (growth mind-set).

Just two years ago in her classroom in a trailer here at Visitacion Valley Elementary School, Ms. Cooney struggled with the kind of management problems that often confront young teachers.

Her students, mostly poor and living in a nearby housing project, were bouncing around the classroom, playing with their phones instead of paying attention, fighting out interfamily beefs. Even if they wanted to learn, they were not.

Ms. Cooney, 27, took a two-hour training session in a student-behavior program and began playing good-behavior games. They look like regular lessons, except that they begin with students identifying goals for good behavior, and end with her assessing what went right and wrong.

On a recent day, students took notes on their reading as Ms. Cooney moved with a kind of Zen bustle around the classroom, grading papers and consulting one-on-one while she watched for things she would compliment the class on later  keeping bodies still, focusing on the task  and quietly noted bad behavior.

For every 1,000 minutes of good behavior earned, the children win 15 extra minutes of recess.

Im really saving minutes that would be lost to transitions, settling disputes and behavior problems, Ms. Cooney said. It can be exhausting, but not nearly as much as teaching before. As she said, Would you rather put out fires, or prevent them?

Social-emotional learning will count for 8 percent of a schools overall performance score; no teacher will lose a job for failing to instill a growth mind-set.

Noah Bookman, the chief accountability officer for the districts, said he understood the concerns about testing. But, he said, This work is so phenomenally important to the success of our kids in school and life. In some ways, we worry as much if not more about the possibility that these indicators remain on the back burner.",[]

A new, modern steel-and-glass entrance on Madison Avenue took the place of the smaller, more old-fashioned entrance to the museums original Gilded Age building around the corner on East 36th Street. Until then, the institution had been known simply as the Morgan Library.

nytimes.com,1999-03-30 00:00:00,New Breed of Fox as Tame as a Pussycat,[],"Ordinarily the silver fox is a canny, elusive creature, quick to bite when cornered, and well nigh impossible to tame.

This is hardly surprising, considering that foxes over the eons have been hunted for sport, trapped for fur, and generally maligned by human beings, especially those with hen houses.

But because of selective pressure imposed by experimenters over a 40-year period, a new and once undreamed of breed of fox has evolved -- one that whines for attention from human beings without any prior conditioning, licks its masters' faces, and has even begun to look something like a domestic dog.

It is as if by an act of will human beings had transformed an innately hostile creature into a friend.

In a long-term experiment at a Siberian fur farm, geneticists have created this new version of Vulpes vulpes, the silver fox, by allowing only the friendliest animals from each generation to breed. Having selected only the most ''tamable'' of some 45,000 foxes over 35 generations, the scientists have compressed into a mere 40 years an evolutionary process that took thousands of years to transform ancestral wolves into domestic dogs.

The original purpose of the breeding was to create a friendly breed less likely than wild animals to fight when put to death. But in time, geneticists saw that far-reaching changes they observed in the foxes' physical and neurological makeup merited scientific study. The scientists apparently underwent some changes, too. Close bonds developed between the tame foxes and their human wardens, and the staff at the fur farm is trying to find ways of saving the animals from slaughter.

To keep environmental influences to a minimum, none of the foxes in the Siberian experiment received any training, and their contacts with human beings were limited to brief behavioral tests.

The director of the experiment is Dr. Lyudmila N. Trut of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics of the Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences at Novosibirsk. She reported in a paper that selective breeding to create genetically docile animals had resulted in a breed of ultra-tame foxes that make good house pets ''as devoted as dogs but as independent as cats, capable of forming deep-rooted pair bonds with human beings.''

Selective breeding of farm animals to enhance commercially useful traits is as old as human history. But a striking consequence of the Russian program was that breeding foxes to strengthen a single behavioral trait, ''tamability,'' brought about a wide variety of seemingly unrelated physical changes.

A paper by Dr. Trut discussing these changes, translated from Russian, was published in the current issue of American Scientist, the magazine of Sigma Xi, a scientific research society. Dr. Trut wrote that by breeding the tamest animals from each of about 35 successive generations, the final offspring were not only tame from early puppyhood but also looked different from their wild forebears.

The normal pattern of coat color that evolved in wild foxes as camouflage changed markedly in the genetically tamed fox population, with irregular piebald splotches of white fur appearing in some animals. The tame foxes sometimes developed floppy ears in place of the straight ones of wild foxes. The domesticated foxes generally had shorter legs and tails than ordinary foxes, and often had curly tails instead of straight, horizontal tails.

Moreover, the faces of adult tame foxes came to look more juvenile than the faces of wild adults, and many of the experimental animals developed dog-like features, Dr. Trut reported. Although no selective pressures relating to size or shape were used in breeding the animals, the skulls of tamable foxes tended to be narrower with shorter snouts than those of wild foxes.

Even reproductive cycles changed in foxes bred to be docile; wild vixens are receptive to sex only once a year, but some of the docile females become receptive more often.

Domestication also apparently affects genes controlling the timing of physiological development. For example, the genetically tamable fox puppies open their eyes sooner after birth than do ordinary silver foxes, and they show a fear response to unfamiliar stimuli about three weeks later than their wild counterparts.

Over successive generations and increasing congenital tameness, Dr. Trut wrote, the Russian team measured a steady decline in the hormone-producing ability of the foxes' adrenal glands. Adrenal hormones prepare an animal for fight or flight.

Even the brain chemistry of the tame animals differed from that of their wild ancestors; after 12 generations of selective breeding, Dr. Trut reported, test animals' brains contained significantly higher levels of serotonin than did their forbears. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter, is intimately involved in an animal's psychological state.

Dr. Darcy F. Morey, an anthropologist at the University of Kansas who has studied the physical changes that ancestral wolves underwent as they evolved into domesticated dogs, said that Dr. Trut's report underscores the complexity of seemingly simple genetic traits.

''Clearly,'' he said in an interview, ''the link between modifying the neurology of an animal and its biochemical balance is all intertwined with other aspects of physiology.''

Domestication, with all the physiological changes it brings, has not been limited to the the dog family, he said. ''Human beings more or less domesticated themselves,'' Dr. Morey said. ''Of course, we're not as docile as we'd like to think.''

The Russian breeding experiment began in 1959 under the direction of a geneticist, Dr. Dmitry K. Belyaev, who started with a population of 30 male foxes and 100 vixens from a commercial fur farm in Estonia. From the offspring of these animals and from each successive generation, Dr. Belyaev's team would winnow out about 5 percent of the tamest animals for further breeding. Dr. Belyaev died 14 years ago, but his experiment has continued.

In nature, the process of domestication is long and complex.

''Behavioral responses,'' Dr. Trut wrote, ''are regulated by a fine balance between neurotransmitters and hormones at the level of the whole organism. Even slight alterations in those regulatory genes can give rise to a wide network of changes in the developmental processes they govern.'' Changing a complex system of genes (or a ''polygene'') by selectively breeding for some trait like docility is not necessarily beneficial, she said. Even a slight alteration of a polygene like that presumed to lead to docility ''might upset the genetic balance in some animals, causing them to show unusual new traits, most of them harmful to the fox,'' Dr. Trut wrote.

Through selective breeding to enhance the docility of 45,000 foxes over the last 40 years, Dr. Trut said, ''we have compressed into a few decades an ancient process that originally unfolded over thousands of years.''

''Before our eyes, the 'Beast' has turned into 'Beauty,' as the aggressive behavior of our herd's wild progenitors entirely disappeared,'' she said.

Dr. Trut concluded her paper with a prediction that the experiment in tamability breeding would probably have to end soon; last year there was no money in Russia's budget to pay the scientists or even feed the foxes, most of which were destroyed.

''Recently we have sold some of our foxes to Scandinavian fur breeders who have been pressured by animal-rights groups to develop animals that do not suffer stress in captivity,'' she wrote. ''We also plan to market pups as house pets, a commercial venture that should lead to some interesting, if informal, experiments in its own right.''

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Small Gains for the Market as Energy Prices Rebound,['The Associated Press'],"Stocks rose Wednesday on the seventh anniversary of the bull market as crude oil resumed its climb from a 13-year low.









The gains were modest as investors await key policy decisions from Europes central bank on Thursday and from the Federal Reserve next week.

Energy companies rebounded from big drops the day before, gaining 1.5 percent.

The stock market has been climbing for three weeks as reports on hiring, retail spending and manufacturing suggest the U.S. economy is strengthening. The Standard and Poors 500-stock index is up 9 percent from its mid-February low.

People are becoming more optimistic and markets are recovering, said Seth Masters, chief investment officer at AB Bernstein. The hope is that monetary authorities are committed to doing what it takes and not derail it.

The Nasdaq composite increased 25.55 points, or 0.6 percent, to 4,674.38. The S.&P. 500 climbed 10 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,989.26.

The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 36.26 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,000.36.

The gains were broad, with nine of 10 industry sectors of the S.&P. 500 rising. The jump in crude sent several energy companies soaring. Chesapeake Energy climbed 8 percent, Devon Energy rose 7 percent and Newfield Exploration rose 6 percent.

The S.&P. 500 has tripled since bottoming out at 676.53 seven years ago during the financial crisis. The bull market is the third-longest of the 11 since World War II, according to research firm S&P Capital IQ.

Krishna Memani, chief investment officer of Oppenheimer Funds, said he was optimistic that the bull market would extend its run because modest economic growth means little inflation and no need for the Federal Reserve to move too quickly to reverse its stimulus policies.

We believe this will be one of the longest economic expansions, and thus one the longest bull markets, we have experienced, he said. Easy money still rules.

The Federal Reserve meets next week, but most investors do not think it will raise short-term interest rates it controls from near zero. It raised them for the first time in nine years in December.

At the end of its policy meeting on Thursday, the European Central Bank is widely expected to announce more efforts to stimulate the 19-country eurozone. Possible moves include another cut in the deposit rate for funds from commercial banks to even further below zero. The hope is that will get banks to stop holding onto their money and lend more.

The European Central Bank also could increase its bond-buying program to pump more money into the regions economy.

Among U.S. stocks making big moves Wednesday, Air Transport Services jumped $1.96, or 17 percent, to $13.73 after turning in solid results and saying it will operate an air transport network for Amazon. Pet-food company Blue Buffalo Pet Products rose $4.19, or 23 percent, $22.75 after posting strong earnings.

Chipotle Mexican Grill fell $18.06, or 3 percent, to $506.63. The restaurant chain closed a Massachusetts store after a local health board said an employee there tested positive for norovirus. The agency also found two other suspected cases.

The closure follows a series of food scares that sickened customers at its restaurants around the country. Chipotle stock is down 23 percent in the past 12 months.

In Europe, Germanys DAX and Britains FTSE 100 were each up 0.3 percent. The CAC-40 in France rose 0.5 percent. The three indexes each fell nearly 1 percent the day before.

Japans benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.8 percent while South Koreas Kospi rose 0.3 percent. Hong Kongs Hang Seng dipped 0.1 percent.

Prices for industrial and precious metals ended mostly lower. Gold slipped $5.50 to $1,257.40 an ounce, silver fell two cents to $15.37 an ounce and copper gained one cent to $2.23 a pound.

In energy trading, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.79, or 5 percent, to $38.29. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, gained $1.42, or 3.6 percent, to $41.07 a barrel.

Wholesale gasoline rose 8.3 cents to $1.471 a gallon, heating oil rose 3.3 cents to $1.233 a gallon and natural gas rose four cents to $1.752 per 1,000 cubic feet.

U.S. government bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.88 percent from 1.83 percent.

The euro was flat at $1.1002. The dollar edged up to 113.36 yen from 112.61 yen.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-02-26 00:00:00,Unearthing Bogota's Past on the Carrera Septima,"['Annie Correal', 'Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Reference Timestopics People C Annie_correal Index Html']","Leer en Espanol.

A century ago, the Carrera Septima, Bogotas main thoroughfare, was bordered by the stately homes of the well-to-do. Like a European promenade, it led to the city center: grand municipal buildings, a towering cathedral, the expansive Plaza de Bolivar. Its electric streetcars were a symbol of progress, high in the Andes.

Now, little remains of the Septimas grandeur. The old city was nearly reduced to rubble after a political assassination in 1948 sparked riots that left buildings ransacked and burned, the streetcars tipped over and torched. Those who could moved north, leaving the city center to fill with soulless office buildings and the indigent.

Its dirty, its ugly, it smells, and its full of thieves, said the photographer Juan Cristobal Cobo, summarizing the popular attitude toward the old center, also known as the Candelaria, which has been partly restored and attracts international tourism.

But for eight months last year, Mr. Cobo visited a still-rough part of the area weekly, concentrating on four blocks of the Septima that were closed to vehicular traffic not long ago. There, he mined for visible signs of a past often forgotten by Colombians in their eagerness to move forward. Historic centers interest me, he said. In Colombia, they are centers of forgetting.

Mr. Cobo, 52, was born in Cali, Colombia, and studied film at New York University. Since the early 1990s, he has lived in Bogota and worked as a cinematographer and commercial director. A few years ago, I reached a point where I couldnt stand to do any more advertising, he said. As we say in Spanish, I kicked my lunch pail.

He embarked on a number of personal photography projects, including this one.

Remnants of the past abounded on the Septima, where the streetcar tracks were embedded like scars in the street. In one image, a man smoked on a bench in the spot where the populist leader Jorge Eliecer Gaitan was killed in 1948  arguably the most important spot in Bogota, for were it not for that event, the city wouldnt have been destroyed, Mr. Cobo said.

Photo

Mr. Cobo also spotted living relics of the past: older gentlemen in suits and ties crossing the street. Retired public servants and office workers, they lingered in the city center, walking alone or sitting in cafes discussing events from long ago. These men are the last of a type known as el cachaco, the quintessential Bogotano of the last century.

They come from the early 20th century when the British and European influence was strong, Mr. Cobo said. They have a certain formality, a certain courtesy. They probably dont have a place to sleep, or live in rented rooms, but they wont go out without fixing their tie and putting on their sweater and overcoat.

He also found plenty of what he called rebusque, buskers and swindlers of all stripes: fortune-tellers, men selling emeralds, or offering to let him in on a deal. By the Plaza de Bolivar, vendors sold bags of corn to working-class Colombian tourists to feed the pigeons. A one-armed man did push-ups for change, his knuckles leaving a groove in the concrete from his 1,000 daily repetitions (Slide 18). A handful of Michael Jackson impersonators took turns dancing for coins, among them a 14-year-old who had fled Uraba, one of the flashpoints in Colombias decades-long civil conflict.

Its like a very, very, very sad Times Square in a third world country, Mr. Cobo said.

Photo

Despite the details in his work that speak to daily life and the passage of time and history, Mr. Cobo said he did not consider himself a photojournalist. He wanted to stir feelings in the viewer. As often as he saw brokenness, Mr. Cobo said he sensed strength in his subjects. And he wanted to convey this.

Colombia is a complex country, but very resilient, he said. There is a spirit of resilience. The Septima is a mirror of that.

Google wants to make it easy for travelers to decide where and when to go on vacation, and to see at a glance what a trip is likely to cost, right from their mobile phones.









The company on Wednesday announced a search feature, Destinations on Google, that touches on almost every aspect of a vacation, from research to flight selection, hotel booking and itinerary planning. Destinations does not offer off-the-beaten-path guides or exclusive information that cant be found elsewhere on the web. Rather, its meant to make researching and planning a trip on a mobile phone (typically a clumsy experience) more intuitive and productive for the occasional traveler by delivering good-quality basic information.

This is the first time Google has introduced a travel tool on mobile (where people are increasingly spending their time) before desktop; its available through your mobile browser or the Google app on iOS and Android. Everything on Destinations begins with a single search screen; theres no drilling down through multiple websites and hopping among them, no entering your desired number of nights or travel companions again and again. Heres how it works.

Continue reading the main story Travel Dispatch Newsletter Every Saturday, get travel tips, destination coverage, photos from all over the world and more.

Where to Go

On your smartphone, open your browser or the Google app and search for, say, Europe vacation. A grid of multiple destination tiles will appear  Paris, London, Rome, Barcelona, Madrid, Prague, Amsterdam, to name a few  each with an appealing photo. These are the most popular European destinations according to Google. Each photo has a bit of information beneath it, including the cheapest week to go within the next six months (based on your origin and the destination), the cost of the cheapest flight for that week, as well as the average price of a hotel (three-star or the next available class).

Its Europe at-a-glance, an easy-to-scroll, elegant reminder of some of whats out there  emphasis on some of. If youre looking for less frequented and up-and-coming places such as Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina, you have to make your initial search more specific: Instead of searching for Europe vacation, search instead for southern Europe vacation and youll find it. Or, if you have a particular destination in mind, like Split in Croatia, you can type Split, Croatia vacation into the search box and it will turn up. In other words, you can search at the city, state (California destinations), country or continent level. If you just search for Greece, for instance, youll see a carousel of destinations (Athens, Santorini, Rhodes) that you can scroll through and click into for more details.

A word of caution: When you begin a search, Google uses your current location to determine the origin city (and therefore the price) for flights. Thats a problem since I might be in Miami when I want to research a trip from New York to Latin America. Google did not confirm whether in the future users will be able to set their starting point, but it seems a logical next step.

Narrow the Options

You can filter those Europe vacation search results by travel dates, price and interests such as architecture, beach, camping, culture, golf, hiking, nature, sailing, skiing. Just tap the appropriate heading on the top of the screen and adjust the filters. Your search results will update accordingly. When I filtered Europe for skiing, for instance, my screen was instantly repopulated with images of mountains and vacation options for Bansko, Bulgaria; Chamonix, France; Zermatt, Switzerland; St. Anton am Arlberg, Austria; Sierra Nevada Ski Station, Spain; and more.

Delve Deeper

See that lovely photo of Venice? Tap it, or the photo of any city on your screen that captures your imagination, to learn more. Background information about each place is culled from Wikipedia as well as from a New York content team that also writes the descriptions for Google Maps. On each destination page, on a tab that says Explore, you can check out its top sights (in Amsterdam, for example, the Rijksmuseum, Anne Frank House, Vondelpark), see popular travel months for tourists, find out about the climate and watch related videos (more users are turning to mobile video for travel research, Google said).

The top sights are just that: the obvious must-see attractions, not lesser-known gems or nascent activities. And sorry, foodies, you wont find a guide to restaurants and bars, either. Think of Destinations as your basic Crayola crayon box; it is not aimed at those who want Magic Mint.

Build an Itinerary

On that same destination page that you reached by tapping a photo is a Plan a Trip tab that allows you to select how many people are traveling, the number of stops youre willing to make when you fly, the number of nights you plan to stay and your desired hotel class (up to five stars). Once you add those details you can use an interactive price bar graph. With a swipe right or left it slides through the months, showing you the changing price of your trip over time.

Photo

One of the niftiest features of Destinations is Popular Itineraries: trips through a country in a logical order with details about how far apart each site or activity is so you can maximize your time. But unlike most itineraries you find in travel publications, Popular Itineraries are not created by editors or writers. They are based on anonymous and aggregated data across a large pool of travelers who have opted into sharing their mobile location data with Google. Its the same technology Google uses to create its Popular Times graphs; i.e. people using mobile phones in a restaurant help Google determine the busiest and slowest times. As a result, you can see, for example, that on a Thursday night Bar Boulud in New York is most popular between 5:30 and 7:30 p.m. and that getting a seat at 10 p.m. would be easier.

To find Popular Itineraries, search for a country and add vacation or travel. Google will then turn up a guide; to get it, click on the blue button under the basic information for the country. When I searched for France vacation, there were several Popular Itineraries in the travel guide, including seven days in Nice, Avignon, Montpellier, Toulouse and Bordeaux; four days in Paris, Burgundy and Lyon; and five days in Paris, Strasbourg and Colmar.

A different feature, Suggested Itineraries, is not currently based on aggregate phone data; it offers sample itineraries for cities, not entire countries, by the content team at Google.

Book Your Trip

While some Destinations features call to mind online travel agencies like Expedia and Travelocity, Destinations is not meant to emphasize shopping for flights and hotels. Its primary purpose, a Google product manager told me, is to help users figure out where to go. The technology of Google Flights, my go-to comparison tool, and hotel search are baked into Destinations. Google Flights shows options across multiple airlines, but to book you go to an airlines own website. Choosing a hotel through Destinations takes you to a Google search page with information about the hotel, its location, reviews and the option to book through a partner site such as Hotels.com, Booking.com or Venere.com.

Bottom Line

Google says Destinations is designed for the leisure traveler who takes a trip or two a year and is concerned about making the right choices for that big getaway. He or she is interested in popular places and wants to see the major sites.

Destinations is not for those looking for obscure art galleries, or for foodies seeking the next great restaurant or food truck. Experienced travelers who have a short list of where they want to go, who fly frequently, who use particular airlines because they have elite status and who seek off-the-beaten path itineraries wont be surprised by the cities or points of interest they see on Destinations.

That said, chances are theyll like the planning tools. The price bar graph is a quick way to narrow down when to go. And a flexible dates feature allows you to say that you want to go in June, for instance, and then see your travel options for the entire month, rather than for specific dates. Details about rainfall and temperature mean you dont have to run a separate search to see if you were planning to visit during hurricane season. And Points of Interest and Suggested Itineraries could be handy for business travelers parachuting into a place for a night or two but hoping to get to a must-see spot between meetings.

Is Destinations regularly unearthing hidden treasures? No. Does Destinations make it easier to spark ideas and to start plotting? Absolutely. You can type Caribbean vacation in the search box and instantly begin finding the island thats right for you. You can do that on some vacation-idea apps, but most are haphazard and, more important, divorced from useful information about flights and hotels. Destinations on Google integrates the puzzle pieces.",[]

She joined the papers staff in January of last year after graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she was named College Photographer of the Year in a separate national competition associated with POYi.

Todd Heisler of The New York Times placed second in the Newspaper Photographer of the Year category and Alon Skuy of The Times in Johannesburg took third.

Paolo Marchetti, an Italian freelance photographer represented by Getty Images, was named Photographer of the Year, with Espen Rasmussen of the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang taking second and Chip Somodevilla of Getty images third.

The New York Times was named Best Publication by POYi, which is a program of the University of Missouri School of Journalism. The Times also won first place in the Newspaper Visual Editing category as well as 14 other awards. Mr. Heisler took first place for Sports Picture Story for Hardwood, a look at a New York City high school basketball team. Joshua Z. Weinstein received the top award in Multimedia Feature Story for a Times Op-Doc video, Holocaust Survivor Band.

In news photography contests, the top-prize winners are most often entrants who travel far from their homes to cover dramatic events. Those doing strong work in their own communities, unless they live in a war zone, are more likely to be passed by.

This year, the Pictures of the Year International competition tried to alter that dynamic by tweaking its two divisions. The open category, which Mr. Marchetti, 41, won, continues to be for all photographers working anywhere in the world. But the newspaper categories are now focused on those working in their local areas. This does not prohibit newspaper photographers from entering the open categories if they traveled outside their region.

There are so many important local stories and issues that often get overshadowed in competitions by the big global news events, said Rick Shaw, director of POYi. We wanted to recognize great photo stories produced in photographers own backyards.

Ms. Van Houten, 25, said that there are stories everywhere, though they may sometimes be more subtle or harder to find.

National Geographic won the Angus MacDougall Overall Excellence in Editing Award as well as the Documentary Project of the Year for its environmental issue Cool It.

The Timess sports photo editors Becky Lebowitz Hanger and Jeffrey Furticella received first and second places as well as an award of excellence in the Print Feature Story Editing.

Andrew Ellis of MediaStorm was named the Multimedia Photographer of the Year. Second place went to Katie Falkenberg of The Los Angeles Times and third to Jonah M. Kessel, a video journalist for The New York Times who was also was cited in two other categories.

Al Bello of Getty Images was named Sports Photographer of the Year. Hossein Fatemi took the World Understanding Award for An Iranian Journey, which was first published on Lens. Casper Dalhoff received the Community Awareness Award for A Commitment to Life. The Environmental Vision Award went to Brent Stirton of Getty Images for Ivory Wars, while Stephen Dupont received the Best Photography Book Award for Generation AK.

Yunghi Kim took first place in the General News category for a photo of the funeral of Freddie Gray, a black man from Baltimore whose death from an injury suffered in police custody set off nationwide protests.

Robin Hammond took first place in Portrait Series for his images of L.G.B.T. people living in countries where homosexuality is illegal. The series was featured on Lens last September. Mark Peterson took first for his political photos in the News Picture Story category and Gabriella Demczuk took third for work made on assignment for The Times. Ms. Demczuk also received special recognition from the judges in the Community Awareness category. Bryan Denton, a freelancer for The New York Times, received third place in the Feature category.

The Times also took first in the Online News and Issues Story Editing category for Walking in Wars Path, with photographs by Tomas Munita, text by Jodi Rudoren and Isabel Kershner and produced by David Furst, Jon Huang and Sergio Pecanha. The Times also placed third in the category with Josh Haners Greenland Is Melting Away, produced with Coral Davenport, Larry Buchanan and Derek Watkins.

Mr. Furst, The Timess international photo editor, was also part of a team that placed second in the Online Feature Story Editing category for David Guttenfelders Illuminating North Korea. It was produced by Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Douglas Schorzman, Rumsey Taylor and Mr. Furst.

In Multimedia News Story, Francesco Zizola of Noor placed first and Samantha Stark of The Times took second for How a Love Story Triumphed in Court. Is Nadia Sussman received an honorable mention for The Times for In Rio, Pacification Without Peace.

A Syrian freelance photographer covering his countrys conflict for Agence France-Presse won first place for Spot News and an award of excellence for News Picture Story. The same photographer took second in the World Press Photo contests General News category this year. Although AFP sends out the photographs under the name Abd Doumany, it is a pseudonym.

When asked about the use of pseudonyms last week, Francis Kohn, AFPs photo director, confirmed that Abd Doumany was not the photographers real name. He said that local Syrian photographers and their families might be in danger if their actual names were published.

We thought it was fine for these guys, he said. They chose their own names. And we agreed to that. We have a policy that we use real names, but in some really extraordinary circumstances we agree to use other names. The alternative would be to just use stringer, which we do sometimes.

Photo

The New York Times does not use pseudonyms in credits to avoid the risk of misleading readers, but will omit photographers real name if they might be in danger. The Times has previously published AFP photos using the credit Abd Doumany both online and in print without knowing it was a pseudonym. The Times has also published AFP photographs credited to Sameer Al-Doumy, another name that Mr. Kohn confirmed was a pseudonym.

Until he was contacted by Lens today, Mr. Shaw, of POYi, said he was not aware that Abd Doumany was a pseudonym.

We understand that there are situations that we would not want to put somebody in jeopardy, Mr. Shaw said. I think its acceptable under certain circumstances that Anonymous or a pseudonym can be used as a credit, as long as we can be transparent and divulge that to our audiences.

Mr. Shaw also said that he would contact AFP and ask for a clarification, which would be added to the list of winners.

My heart is with the photographers in the trenches working in conflict, he said. I want to do the right thing so they can continue to bring the images of conflict that we need to see.

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Meldonium Ban Hits Russian Athletes Particularly Hard,['Patrick Reevell'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

MOSCOW  The fallout from the tennis star Maria Sharapovas suspension over a failed drug test has ensnared her native Russia, as it becomes clear that the drug behind it is poised to create wider problems for Russian sports.









Sharapova, a five-time Grand Slam winner, announced Monday that she had tested positive for the banned drug meldonium during the Australian Open in January, shocking the tennis world and prompting the swift flight of a number of her sponsors.

Meldonium had been a common treatment for Russian athletes before it was added to the World Anti-Doping Agencys prohibited list in January. Its appearance in the headlines is another headache for Russias sports establishment, which is already under an international ban in track and field over accusations that the country conducted a massive doping program.

On Wednesday, the Kremlin responded to the outcry around Sharapovas suspension, with a spokesman saying her failed drug test should not be projected onto Russian sports generally.

But even as the Kremlin sought to play down Sharapovas lapse as an individual case, more Russian athletes were drawn into the controversy.

In the two days since Sharapovas announcement, seven Russian athletes have confirmed testing positive for meldonium. Among those provisionally suspended are an Olympic gold medalist short-track skater, Semion Elistratov, and his teammate, the world champion Pavel Kulizhnikov.

The doping positives have led to confusion and anger among top Russian athletes and sports physicians who said that they did not understand why the drug, legal for decades but monitored by WADA for at least a year, was outlawed.

Created as a treatment for heart condition in 1975, meldonium  under the name Mildronate  is widely available from Russian pharmacies without a prescription, selling for $3 to $10 for about 40 capsules. It can also be purchased online. Meldonium is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for sale in the United States, where Sharapova has been based since she was 7.

In January, WADA included meldonium on its list of hormone and metabolic modulators But until last fall, Russian teams had used the drug regularly and openly, viewing it as a remedy for fending off exhaustion and heart problems.

Meldonium helps increase blood flow and therefore boosts the amount of oxygen taken into the body, which would allow athletes to recover faster while training. The drugs inventor, Ivars Kalvins, a professor at Latvias Institute of Organic Synthesis, said in a 2009 newspaper interview that the drug was once used by Soviet soldiers lugging heavy equipment at high altitudes during the Russian invasion of Afghanistan.

Ive been working for 20 years; we could never imagine that it would be included as a doping substance, said Sergei Sheremetiev, a physician with Russias ski-jumping team. Its a good drug. Until they banned it, we used it in many types of sport: hockey, skiing  in those where theres pretty serious strain.

Sheremetiev said that until the ban, he had administered the drug to his own athletes about twice a year.

Sharapova and her lawyers said she was prescribed meldonium by her family doctor in 2006 for a variety of health problems, including signs of diabetes, irregular EKG readings, magnesium deficiency and frequent cases of the flu. She said she had failed to read an email sent by WADA that confirmed the medication had been added to the banned list for 2016.

The Russian trainers and officials said they were obeying the WADA ban on meldonium, but they insisted the medication  despite its benefits  should not be considered a performance-enhancer. Sheremetiev and other team physicians said it was for restoring physical fitness, not performance.

But WADA has disagreed. The bodys president, Craig Reedie, in an open letter to The Independent, wrote that the drug was a big concern because its clear that people are abusing the drug.

Several studies in the past year have bolstered WADAs case. A 2015 study, funded in part by the Partnership for Clean Competition, analyzed 8,300 urine samples collected at doping control sessions and found that 182 (2.2 percent) contained the substance. A study of last years European Games in Baku, Azerbaijan, published Wednesday in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, found an alarmingly high prevalence of meldonium use by athletes. According to the study, 13 winners or medalists were taking meldonium and 66 athletes tested positive for it.

While the Russian physicians said they were baffled at why the drug, after decades of use, was now banned, they nonetheless acknowledged that they had received plenty of warning of the need to stop their athletes from using meldonium.

It was unclear why Russian athletes  including some of the countrys most prominent sports figures  had been found to still have traces of the drug in their bloodstream. (Athletes from Sweden, Ethiopia and Ukraine have also reportedly tested positive for meldonium this year.)

Russian national teams stopped treating their athletes with the drug in September, officials said, after WADA warned it would be banned beginning in January. Some federations said they destroyed their supplies of the drug then.

Sheremetiev and a number of different federation officials and trainers said, given the warnings, it was incomprehensible that top athletes had continued to take meldonium.

Russias national speedskating team appeared to have been particularly badly hit by the new ban. Three of its athletes tested positive, including Elistratov, a world-record holder.

The speedskating federations president, Aleksei Kravtsov, insisted that none of the athletes had taken the drug knowingly and that the teams trainers had been told not to administer it. Still, the federation said it was conducting lie detector tests on its athletes as well as the teams trainers and medical officials.",[]

LASHKAR GAH, Afghanistan  The banks of the placid Helmand River have always been the social center of Lashkar Gah, the southern Afghan provincial capital sometimes called Little America during the decades of modernization efforts here.









The appeal of the river stands aside from worldly concerns, and there are many of those lately. The water is calm this time of year, the sunset gorgeous. To unwind at the end of the day, people come to the riverbank for bandaar  easy chat over a cup of tea or, if in season, the delicious pomegranates this region is known for. Other visitors have slowed their worlds with hashish, lying on their backs in the water, away from the crowds, fascinated with the clear sky above.

On a recent reporting trip, I was particularly keen to talk to a friend here, a young university lecturer with helpful insights about this place. Even by its own standard, the surrounding region of Helmand Province has suffered a rough, bloody year. The Taliban, making major inroads, are now holed up in one of Lashkar Gahs suburbs across the river. Was he worried that the city might fall, that the lifestyle he had grown used to  a vibrant educational environment, multiple private TV and radio channels  could be in danger?

After a conversation over milk tea on a worn-out couch at a little cafe facing the river, he suggested dinner with a couple of his friends, also university lecturers, at a fish restaurant that had opened just outside the city. The suburb, Karez, is considered one of the safest, he said. Even when the Taliban entered Lashkar Gah a few years ago, they met fierce resistance in Karez.

Before leaving for the restaurant, the professors spread their shawls by the river for the evening prayer. Everyone savored the beauty of the sunset in its last moments.

The rivers course is a reminder that life goes on despite violent upheaval, flowing through Taliban and opium country, slowing down in this city, and then running on to Nimruz Province, the smuggling hub on the border with Iran.

Its calm waters have sustained agriculture and towns in the middle of the desert, and would-be conquerors have been drawn along its path for eons. It is that role that informs a Pashto poem by Abdul Bari Jahani, who is now Afghanistans minister of information and culture, which reads in part:

Helmand,

I ask you in the language of the heart:

Do you recall the cruelties of your time?

You know well whats happened at your edges.

You listened as angry skies grumbled

and death rained down with bullets.

You watched blood flow with your waves

as hangmen discarded martyred bodies.

And you witnessed those who looted

the nomad girls nose-rings:

all in the name of the great lord.

Helmand,

how did you learn to flow with such calm?

For much of the day, I had tried to gauge the mood of the city.

We are very sad because our numbers are skyrocketing, said Dejan Panic, who runs the 91-bed Emergency Hospital here. The number of admitted trauma patients has increased by 20 percent this year, and so has the severity of the injuries, Mr. Panic said. The hospital recently built an underground bunker for staff and patients, in case the violence brings the sort of bombings that happened in Kunduz.

Jamila Niazi, Helmand Provinces director of womens affairs, said she had lost touch with the womens councils in the districts overrun by the Taliban. Girls schools have also been closed there. But Ms. Niazi expressed confidence that the security forces would be able to hold the city.

For years, theres been fighting here, and the city hasnt fallen, she said.

Ghulam Rabbani, who sells CDs and DVDs in downtown Lashkar Gah, was more concerned. He had not sold anything all day. His retailers from districts overrun by the Taliban, who oppose music and television as un-Islamic, no longer come to buy.

When the Taliban came close to the city a few years ago, we werent as concerned because the foreign troops were still here, and we knew they would be pushed back again, Mr. Rabbani said. This time, they are no longer here.

Trying to find the fish restaurant, we drove through the desert in a small Toyota Vitz, many times asking for directions. Still, we kept hitting dead ends, prompting questions about how much business the place could expect if even local customers struggled to get there.

The restaurant, found after almost an hour of searching, was beautiful, down a slope of cobblestone and facing the river. The lights on the first floor were dim, the doors locked.

A small window on the second floor opened, and a man looked out. Are you the fish guys? he asked with a smile.

The normalcy, in a place surrounded by war, recalled a lost Helmand that is still so present in the Afghan imagination.

Earlier in the day, a nostalgic politician who is now in charge of the battle here, Abdul Jabar Qahraman, had talked about that lost Helmand as he described a conversation with a NATO general.

If someone sat somewhere in the world and thought of Afghanistan, Helmand would definitely come to his mind, he recounted saying. Then he thought of the beauty of Lashkar Gah, and he would say, This is little New York, little Washington.

Today, when someone in the world thinks of Afghanistan, he thinks of evil, and he thinks of Helmand  that it is the center of it, Mr. Qahraman continued, lamenting.

Forty years ago, we had such a life here  we had a disco, he said. But then we fell into the ditch of misfortune. I just want to see that Helmand again in my lifetime.",[]

Handcrafted small-batch ceramics are everywhere these days.









You see them in trendsetting boutiques like the Primary Essentials in Brooklyn and Still House in Manhattan, artfully arranged in window displays and on shelves like totems of good taste.

They can be spotted in the stylized pages of Kinfolk, Apartamento and other cult magazines, often paired with organically shaped cutting boards and sun-dappled potted succulents. Vogue even devoted two pages in this years September issue to a new wave of independent ceramists.

And among certain creative-minded millennials, ceramics have replaced jewelry and furniture made from salvaged lumber as the craft du jour, with access to choice kilns as a status symbol to be flaunted on Pinterest and Instagram.

There is beauty in imperfection and having items that are really handmade, said the fashion designer Steven Alan, who populates his boutiques with textural American and Japanese ceramics in neutral hues.

While terrariums, Edison bulb light fixtures and fixed-gear bicycles have all enjoyed moments of demarcating cool, handcrafted small-batch ceramics are suddenly the accessory of the moment.

Just as those earlier trends represented a tactile, down-to-earth counterbalance to our sped-up, technology-centered world, the rejection of factory-produced sameness in dinnerware and vases reflects a desire to get back to something more essential.

We want to know where our free-range eggs come from, and where our coffee beans are grown and roasted. We also want the vessels we use to consume those things to embody a deeper story about craftsmanship and creativity.

People are looking to have their humanity reflected back at them, said the veteran potter David Reid, a co-founder of KleinReid, a ceramics company in New York. People are moving back from slick and stainless steel to something warmer.

For the interior designer Kelly Wearstler, who recently teamed up with the ceramist Ben Medansky on a line of tableware bedecked with golden cubes, ceramics imbue a room with a sense of purpose. Something made of the hand is so special, it inherently adds soul and dimension within a space, she said.

Robert Sullivan, the contributing editor at Vogue who wrote the magazines ceramics article, said that ceramics are popular now because they are among the most obviously and literally handmade things.

Its an antidote to all the electronics, he added.

Julie Carlson, editor in chief of the design website Remodelista, has chronicled the rise. Its entwined with the farm-to-table movement, she said. Its this desire to know the origin of whats in your kitchen.

Its hard to keep track of them, she added of new ceramists. In the beginning, it seemed like there were just a few, but now there are more than we can cover, and more than we can invite to our markets.

Perhaps nowhere is this more notable than in Brooklyn and Queens, where there are no shortage of makeshift pottery studios, clay-throwing classes and boutiques that resemble the home page of Etsy.

Natalie Weinberger, 29, made the jump from the nonprofit world to being a full-time ceramist a year ago, and she shares a basement studio near McCarren Park in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with nine other upstart ceramists.

Demand for learning ceramics is crazy right now, and its hard to get your hands on studio space, said Ms. Weinberger, who makes vessels with striking sculptural forms, often with textured clay speckled with black volcanic sand.

The launchpad for many New York potters has been Choplet, a ceramics studio and teaching space that the French-born Nadeige Choplet opened with her husband, John Lego, in Williamsburg in 2005. When I started, I had four wheels and I was only giving two or three classes a week, Ms. Choplet said. But the space grew into a buzzing claymaking hub with more than 30 wheels, along with a separate studio called the Williamsburg Ceramic Center.

Photo

Despite all the extra space and expanded schedule, she said, We have wait lists, every time, for our night classes.

The demand for ceramics classes also extends to colleges such as Rhode Island School of Design, where the number of graduate students majoring in ceramics jumped about 50 percent this year.

In addition, Weve had a huge influx of students from other departments wanting to take ceramics, especially from architecture, industrial design and furniture, said Katy Schimert, an associate professor and department head of ceramics. All our nonmajor classes have long wait lists.

There is growing evidence that ceramics is moving beyond mere hobby to budding creative career, along the lines of artisanal chocolate.

I have a lot of people who happened to start a little Etsy account, and then got wholesale orders, Ms. Choplet said. They get their own space, and quit their jobs. Its happened a lot.

One of the success stories is Forrest Lewinger, 31, whose studio, Workaday Handmade, produces cups with marbleized glazes, earthy bowls with hand-carved geometric patterns, and ivory-colored vases with a confetti-like spatter of blue.

Photo

His career began with a small shared booth at the Williamsburg Renegade Craft Fair in 2012, which blossomed into a string of wholesale orders. Soon, Barneys New York and Anthropologie came calling.

Now, he has two part-time employees in a shared studio in Ridgewood, Queens. Its gotten to the point where I have to have someone else in here to help me, just to keep up, Mr. Lewinger said.

The giant of the new ceramics movement is Heath Ceramics in Sausalito, Calif., which to the world of clay is what Stumptown is to coffee or Brooklyn Brewery is to craft beer. In 2003, the husband-and-wife designers Robin Petravic and Catherine Bailey bought and restarted the company, which was originally founded in 1948 to produce midcentury modern housewares.

The couple edited the collections of dinnerware, decorative objects and tile, and introduced new pieces and artist collaborations while maintaining a focus on handcrafted production.

Along the way, they transformed Heath from a niche company, which did about $1 million in sales in 2003, to a globally known outfit with 200 employees that sells about $20 million in products a year. This October, it received a National Design Award from the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.

But like a lot of emerging potters, the couple says one of the original reasons they were attracted to ceramics was that it allowed them to oversee the design process from start to finish.

The nice thing about clay is that you can do it all, and it doesnt take a lot of resources to build it up, Mr. Petravic said. You cant buy a forge to make metal things. But clay and a wheel, or a mold, and a kiln, is pretty straightforward.

And as anyone who made a wonky ceramic ashtray as a child can tell you, theres a certain thrill to seeing malleable clay, formed by your own hands, become a vitrified, functional product.

This weeks puzzle was suggested by Kenneth Kong, a television host in Singapore. The challenge is a follow-up to the Cheryls Birthday Problem, which Kenneth sent viral several weeks ago after posting it to Facebook.

Before getting to Cheryl, I asked Kenneth what it was like to kick off such an online phenomenon (the puzzle was briefly the most-shared item for many news sources around the world, including The New York Times). He replied by email:

This astonishing response really went beyond my imagination. I think the post first caught attention because it fulfilled gossiping and criticizing factors. Some followers wonder what me and my wife were debating about, while the rest thought that its outrageous for kids nowadays to face such difficult test questions.

Photo After I seriously looked into the comments and saw how the story went around the world, Im glad that it took the limelight. This is the first time Ive seen so many people trying so hard to solve a math problem. Many people have a phobia towards maths, but the way the question was set makes it interesting, changing mindsets makes it worth trying. This little red dot in South East Asia may not be well-known for academic achievements, but educators are trying hard to keep us as competitive as possible. Well, I must say I enjoyed my one week of fame. People came to me to tell me how frustrated they were, not able to solve the infamous Cheryls Birthday quiz. Now, back to my normal island life.

Thank you, Kenneth. Lets now return to Cheryl with 

How Old Is Cheryl? Albert and Bernard now want to know how old Cheryl is. Cheryl: I have two brothers. The product of all our ages (i.e. my age and the ages of my two brothers) is 144, assuming that we use whole numbers as our ages. Albert: We still dont know your age. What other hints can you give us? Cheryl: The sum of all our ages is the number of this bus that we are on. Bernard: Of course, we know the bus number, but we still dont know your age. Cheryl: Oh, I forgot to tell you that my brothers are the same age. Albert and Bernard: Oh, now we know your age. So what is Cheryls age?

Thats it for this week. As always, once youre able to read comments for this post, use Gary Hewitts Enhancer to correctly view formulas and graphics. (Click here for an intro.) Do you have a favorite puzzle similar to this logic challenge? Email to gary.antonick@NYTimes.com.

Solution

Heres Kenneth Kong:

The solution is:

1st hint: Since the product of Cheryls and her bros age is 144, and all in whole numbers, breaking down all the fractions of multipliers, we will have a list of possible combinations.

2nd hint: The sum of Cheryls and her bros age is equal to the bus service number they were on. Therefore we add up the numbers in brackets. Albert and Bernard knew the bus service number, but still unsure about Cheryls age, indicating, the possible SUM is repeating.

1 x 1 x 144 (146)

1 x 2 x 72 (75)

1 x 3 x 48 (52)

1 x 4 x 36 (41)

1 x 6 x 24 (31)

1 x 8 x 18 (27)

1 x 9 x 16 (26)

1 x 12 x 12 (25)

2 x 2 x 36 (40)

2 x 3 x 24 (29)

2 x 4 x 18 (24)

2 x 6 x 12 (20)

2 x 8 x 9 (19)

3 x 3 x 16 (22)

3 x 4 x 12 (19)

3 x 6 x 8 (17)

4 x 4 x 9 (17)

4 x 6 x 6 (16)

Hence, the options left with SUM 19 and 17.

A) 2 x 8 x 9 (19)

B) 3 x 4 x 12 (19)

C) 3 x 6 x 8 (17)

D) 4 x 4 x 9 (17)

3rd hint: Cheryls bros are of same age, and the only option with repeating fractions is D.

Therefore Cheryl is 9 years old.

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Primary Night Takeaways: Hillary Clinton Is Shaken and Donald Trump Roars Back,['Alexander Burns'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The story is getting familiar: Donald J. Trump won the biggest contests of the night, as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas captured the most conservative state up for grabs. Hillary Clinton kept a clear upper hand in the Democratic race, but Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont proved he would not be driven away anytime soon.









Tuesdays elections could have brought new clarity to the presidential primaries. Instead, they only seemed to confirm that both parties would probably settle their nominations by battling for delegates well into the spring.

For Republicans, Trump is in control

Nothing silences criticism like victory, and Mr. Trump racked up several on Tuesday. His successes in Hawaii, Michigan and Mississippi dealt a painful psychological blow to Republicans who had convinced themselves that his campaign was losing steam.

But Mr. Trump won, and he won big, with no obvious cracks in his support from disaffected, lower-income whites.

Still, Mr. Trump has a lot to prove in the race: He is only now being subjected to withering, well-funded attack ads, and Mr. Cruz notched another small-state win in Idaho, again proving the tenacity of his support with hard-core conservatives.

Photo

The Democratic race is stalled

If Mrs. Clinton had crushed Mr. Sanders in Michigan, their contest might have been over in all but name. But his narrow win there ensures the fight will go on.

Yet in the bigger picture, the basic battle lines of the Democratic race have barely moved in weeks. In Michigan, Mr. Sanders dominated with young voters, independents and white liberals  his core constituencies all along.

Mrs. Clinton handily won partisan Democrats, low-income voters and black voters in Michigan, and routed Mr. Sanders in Mississippi with overpowering black support.

The outcome in Michigan showed how difficult it could be for Mrs. Clinton to knock Mr. Sanders cleanly out of the race, but Mr. Sanders has still not attracted the kind of coalition that would make him a genuine threat to win the nomination.

Rubio has been sidelined

It was a miserable, even disastrous night for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. He finished fourth in Michigan and Mississippi, languishing in single digits and collecting no delegates from those states. He must fight for survival in his home state next week, where even an upset win might not rescue his campaign.

Mr. Rubios core problem is that he has claimed no distinctive space in the race. Exit polls showed that Mr. Cruz and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio have seized big pieces of the partys right and left wings. Mr. Rubio has claimed no particular constituency at all.

Photo

Cruz and Kasich are in parallel universes

Mr. Kasich wins college towns. Mr. Cruz wins ultraconservative outer suburbs. Mr. Kasich wins liberal Republicans. Mr. Cruz overperforms with evangelicals.

For most of the 2016 campaign, the Republicans vying to overtake Mr. Trump have squabbled bitterly. But Mr. Kasich and Mr. Cruz have so far avoided direct conflict, and Tuesdays results show why: They are just not competing for the same voters. In theory, they could keep hassling Mr. Trump from opposite sides of the Republican Party for weeks or months to come.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The Midwest matters

The results in Michigan gave Mr. Sanders a big lifeline  and they may be somewhat encouraging to Mr. Trumps principal challengers, too. Despite Mr. Trumps double-digit win, he collected less than two-fifths of the vote, with about half of voters opting for either Mr. Cruz or Mr. Kasich.

For the underdogs in both parties, those results point the way toward a hard fight for delegates in the Midwest, where Mr. Trumps appeal is limited among Republicans and Mr. Sanderss hard-left message plainly appeals to liberal whites.

The political calendar is teed up for just such a battle in the Rust Belt. For all the focus on Floridas primary on March 15, three Midwestern states vote on the same day: Illinois, Missouri and Ohio. Wisconsin follows soon after, on April 5.

Open primaries matter

If Tuesdays Democratic primaries had been restricted to Democrats, Mrs. Clinton would have won landslides in Michigan and Mississippi. Had only Republicans voted, Mr. Trump would have won narrower victories over Mr. Cruz, and Mr. Kasich would have been relegated to a distant third place.

While Mrs. Clinton won Democrats by 16 points, Mr. Sanders won independents, who made up less than a third of the electorate, by 42 points, according to exit polls.

There is nothing illicit about winning primaries with support from independents. But the collection of states that allow crossover voting have become a frustrating obstacle to Mrs. Clinton as she works to lock down the Democratic nomination, and a potentially crippling problem for Mr. Cruz as he tries to build a winning coalition against Mr. Trump.

Since my husband and I began dating, deciding whose family to visit for holidays has caused strife. (They live too far to visit both.) This year, our first as a married couple, we settled on Thanksgiving with his and Christmas with mine. We will alternate next year. But now my husband says he cant miss his fathers familys Christmas party  to be held the day after Christmas this year. He proposes spending Christmas Eve and Christmas night together, then visiting his family for the weekend, leaving me with mine. But that wasnt our agreement, and I want us together. Ideas?









Anonymous, Ipswich, Mass.

It never hurts to remind folks on the verge of breaking promises that a deal is a deal  eggnog or no. But it rarely helps. Whats more, you and your husband probably still agree (in theory, anyway) that one harried trip per holiday beats two. Alternating the big ones was also a smart touch. Now, what is it they say about the best-laid plans of mice and men?

The unforeseen wrinkle, I take it, is the pesky party, which Hubby loves and which may be the only time he gets to see his cousins and uncles and aunts on that side of the family. It sounds as if he counted on its being held sufficiently before Christmas so that he could attend it and still hold up his side of your holiday bargain.

For the future, start lobbying now for the party to be given earlier in December to allow for his attendance (even when Christmas belongs to your clan). This year, decide how tough you want to be about pressing your claim. You are clearly right and may insist on his staying with your family through the weekend, as your grand bargain contemplated. But they dont call it the season of giving for nothing. Could you let him go (one last time) and accompany him? Think of it as an annoying Christmas gift.

Not for Consumption

Last night, my girlfriend and I gave a holiday party. It was a roaring success  with one exception. My girlfriend spent hours baking, constructing and decorating a gingerbread house, which we placed at a distance from the food and drinks table. (It was not meant for eating; it was a decoration for the holidays.) Still, someone broke off a piece of the roof and presumably ate it. We dont know who. My girlfriend is livid and wants me to call around to find the culprit. Should I?

Paul, Boston

You should not. And with any luck, your girlfriend will agree as the gingerbread debacle recedes in time. It sounds like an honest mistake. Even you required an entire parenthetical statement to describe the existential plane on which an edible house exists. Ties go to the eaters. (Personally, I cant see myself breaking off a chunk of virgin masonry. But it wasnt outrageous behavior.) Perhaps in lieu of phone calls, you can offer to be her gingerbread roofer and make a patch.

Too Haute to Handle

I have a lovely housekeeper who has worked for me, full time, for years. Lately, she has been giving me Hermes scarves for Christmas and my birthday. Of course I appreciate her generosity. But I know from other conversations I have with her that she cant afford these gifts. I dont want to insult her, but please help me steer her toward less expensive gifts.

Two choices, Lady Crawley: If money is no object (and I hear good help is hard to find), simply top up your housekeepers salary to cover the cost of the scarves. Otherwise, write in your thank-you note: I am touched by your generosity. But you work too hard to give me such extravagant gifts. Next year, please treat yourself instead.

This is somewhat in line with my philosophy of simply thanking people for gifts, not trying to control them. But $800 annually in silken ware seems steep. Still, if your housekeeper doesnt take the bait, leave it alone.

Pushing Back

We were informed recently that our company holiday party, normally a luncheon on the last working day before Christmas, will become a year-end celebration during the week between Christmas and New Years. The memo said that the days leading up to Christmas are hectic, and management decided we would enjoy the party more after the holiday. This seems wrong to me. Not to mention that some co-workers take that week as vacation. Is there anything you can do to help?

J.L.

Sadly, the jurisdiction of Social Qs is limited to ... well, nowhere. I see no harm in speaking (respectfully) to your supervisor, conveying your concern about vacationing co-workers. But in fairness, many people dont celebrate Christmas, and the days leading up to the holiday are pretty frantic. A leisurely year-end lunch sounds like a treat. Why not try it this year, and see how it goes? If the party is a bummer or a ghost town, you and your colleagues can mention it to the powers that be in January. Otherwise, Happy Year End!",[]
nytimes.com,2011-04-14 00:00:00,Sleep No More Is a Macbeth in a Hotel,['Ben Brantley'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Those pushy Macbeths may be backstabbing social climbers, but you must admit that their new digs are to die for. The Thane of Cawdor and his wife have moved into a deserted hotel in the hinterlands of the West 20s, and my dear, what theyve done with the place. Dont be surprised if it shows up soon on the cover of Architectural Digest, bloodstains and all.









Punchdrunk, a British site-specific theater company, has taken over three abandoned warehouses on West 27th Street to enact the sorry sights of the murderous Macbeths career in a movable orgy titled Sleep No More. And the resulting adventure in decor  a 1930s pleasure palace called the McKittrick  suggests what might have happened had Stanley Kubrick (of Eyes Wide Shut and The Shining) been asked to design the Haunted Mansion at Disney World, with that little old box maker Joseph Cornell as a consultant.

New Yorkers with fond memories of nights out in the era of theme-park clubs like Area and MK have the chance to relive their salad days with this production (if they can score tickets). But they should know that sentimentally partaking of any mood-altering substances is inadvisable.

An unimpaired sense of balance and depth perception is crucial to attending Sleep No More, which leads its audience on a merry, macabre chase up and down stairs, and through minimally illuminated, furniture-cluttered rooms and corridors. The creative team here has taken on the duties of messing with your head, which they do just as thoroughly as any artificial stimulant.

Youll notice that so far I have not mentioned the name of the writer who immortalized Macbeth. Though the title of Sleep No More and much of its shadow of a plot do come from the compact tragedy that is a favorite of high school English classes, this is not the place to look for insights into Shakespeare. (For those, you would be better off checking out the current Cheek by Jowl or Theater for a New Audience productions of Macbeth, in which the emphasis is on interior worlds instead of the World of Interiors.)

But this largely wordless production, directed by Felix Barrett and Maxine Doyle (and designed by Mr. Barrett, Livi Vaughan and Beatrice Minns), is not without thought-churning apercus. These have less to do with the comely dancers who act out the doomed paths of Macbeth and company than with those clumsy, anonymous lugs in white face masks who keep elbowing one another out of the way to get a better view of the sex and violence. Thats you and me, my fellow theatergoers.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

You see, everyone who attends Sleep No More is required to wear (and keep on) a Venetian carnival-style mask. You are also asked not to utter a word during the two and a half hours you are given to follow the characters of your choice from room to room. But you are encouraged to poke around in corners and trunks and bookcases, and allowed to get as close as (in)decency permits to the lithe-bodied denizens of this chic spook house. (Just dont touch them, though they may well reach out and touch you.)

Sleep No More is, in short, a voyeurs delight, with all the creepy, shameful pleasures that entails. As conceived by Punchdrunk (which took a similar approach to an operatic version of The Duchess of Malfi in London last summer), this tale of regicide taps the same impulses that draw us to Agatha Christie mysteries and sensational tabloids, flavored with the snob appeal of biographies of self-destructive aristocrats.

The idea is once youre let loose on one of the floors of the hotel, you pick out a single character and pursue him or her (though you can switch any time you want), as the performer runs, dances and vaults all over the place. Dressed in drop-dead, Deco-era evening clothes, scanty lingerie or nothing at all, these characters include the Macbeths (of course), Macduff and his wife (who is conspicuously pregnant), Duncan (the king) and various witches and hotel employees. (Because the roles are mostly double-cast, I am not mentioning individual performers, but they are all lissome enough to make the audience look slow and dumpy.)

These jaded figures can be found in bedrooms, bathrooms, ballrooms, hospital rooms and nurseries getting dressed and undressed, doing the foxtrot, making every kind of love, killing one another and washing off blood. (The Macbeth mansion has many bathtubs.) Choreographed by Ms. Doyle, these activities are executed with tense balletic virtuosity by neurotic, anguished and gymnastic creatures, who climb the walls (I mean literally) in moments of high stress.

The knockout set pieces (and the detail in every room is remarkable) include a painterly banquet scene and an unnerving black mass sequence led by three ambisexual witches. The lighting is ravishingly crepuscular. The mood-matching sound design includes period pop recordings (Goodnight Children, Everywhere, A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square), techno music (but only for the witches) and swoony, suspenseful Bernard Herrmann scores for Hitchcock movies.

References to Hitchcock  the McKittrick is a nod to Vertigo  abound. (A character named Mrs. Danvers, an allusion to the Hitchcock film Rebecca, was in an earlier and slightly less spectacular incarnation of Sleep No More, which I saw last year in Brookline, Mass.) That director was the ultimate master of making us feel complicit in films invasion of private lives and ugly deaths. And it seems to me that sense of guilty enjoyment, translated into theatrical terms, is a large part of what Punchdrunk is trying to elicit here.

It can make you feel kind of shabby, watching other audience members rifling through a suitcase that Lady Macduff has left on a bed or reading a letter on the desk in Duncans sitting room. (Its a thank-you note from the socially correct Lady Macbeth.) That doesnt mean that you wont follow their leads once theyve moved on. As an advertising slogan for a tabloid newspaper used to say, enquiring minds want to know.

KENT, Wash.  The headquarters of Blue Origin, the secretive rocket company in an industrial park here, is anonymous, with not even a sign at the road to announce the occupants.









On Tuesday, for the first time, Blue Origin, started by Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, opened its doors to reporters.

Welcome to Blue, Mr. Bezos said. Thank you for coming.

Blue Origin is part of a shift of the space business from NASA and aerospace behemoths like Lockheed Martin toward private industry, especially smaller entrepreneurial companies. Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, founded by another Internet entrepreneur, Elon Musk, has been the most visible and most successful of the new generation of rocket companies. Last Friday, it launched another satellite to orbit, but an attempt to land the booster on a floating platform again ended in an explosion.

Much more quietly, Blue Origin has also had big space dreams, but until now did not give outsiders a look at what it was doing.

Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Science Times Newsletter Every week, we'll bring you stories that capture the wonders of the human body, nature and the cosmos.

For almost four hours, Mr. Bezos, who only occasionally talks to the press, led 11 reporters on a tour of the factory and answered a litany of questions over lunch. He talked garrulously, his speech punctured by loud laughs. Its my total pleasure. I hope you can sense that I like this, he said.

He described an image on a wall in the companys central area, which showed two tortoises holding an hourglass and gazing upward at a stylized image of the planets and cosmos. Below is Blue Origins motto: Gradatim ferociter, Latin for step by step, ferociously  no cutting of corners, but no dillydallying, either. You can do the steps quickly, but you cant skip any steps, Mr. Bezos said.

He also offered updates on progress for his space tourism plans. The reusable New Shepard spacecraft that launched to the outskirts of space in November and then made a return trip in January will launch again soon. Depending on how well the testing goes, paying tourists, six at a time, might start making the short trips, experiencing a few minutes of weightlessness in space as soon as 2018, he said.

At times, he told himself to stop talking, and let his engineers make their presentations about a new engine, the BE-4, which is under development with tests of a full version beginning by the end of the year.

Mr. Bezos started Blue Origin in 2000, although few people knew about it then. For the next few years, about half a dozen people explored whether there might be a better way to get to space than rockets powered by loud, inefficient chemical combustion. The conclusion: there is not.

Mr. Bezos said he had studied and thought about rockets since he was 5 years old. I never expected to have the resources to start a space company, he said. I won a lottery ticket called Amazon.com.

Mr. Bezos declined to say how much money he had poured into his dream. Lets just say its a lot, he said.

Around 2005, Mr. Bezos said he began rocket development in earnest. Still, almost no one knew what he was doing. For years, what went on here was mysterious and unknown, like Willy Wonkas chocolate factory in Roald Dahls childrens book.

Occasionally news would be tossed out to the outside world  an award by NASA, a blog post by Mr. Bezos, a video of a successful launch. Last year, the company made a splashy public announcement at Cape Canaveral, Fla., when Blue Origin announced it would launch rockets into orbit from there.

Like Mr. Musk, Mr. Bezos talks about Blue Origin less as a business than as part of a glorious future for humanity, with millions of people living and working off the planet. It is also a path, he asserted, that humanity must pursue if it is to continue to prosper.

His argument was simple: Energy consumption has been rising at 2 or 3 percent a year. Even at that modest rate, within a few centuries, the energy usage would be equal to the energy produced by high-efficiency solar cells covering the entire surface of the planet. Well be using all of the solar energy that impacts the Earth, he said. Thats an actual limit.

But there is much energy and raw materials to use elsewhere in the solar system, and eventually, he prophesies, there will be the great inversion. Instead of factories on Earth manufacturing sophisticated components that go into tiny machines that go into space, the heavy manufacturing will all be done elsewhere, and Earth, he joked, would be zoned for residential and light industrial use, allowing much of Earth to return to a more natural state. Itll be universities and houses and so on, he said.

That is still far in the future. For now, Blue Origins business plans fall in three categories. The first is space tourism, with short hops launching from West Texas on the New Shepard, a competitor to Virgin Galactic, Richard Bransons space start-up. Space tourism is not just a frivolity for the rich, but a necessary steppingstone to develop the expertise in a new technology, Mr. Bezos said, much like the early days of airplanes or how video games spurred the development of more powerful computer chips.

Currently, most rocket companies launch, at most, about a dozen times a year. You never get really great at something you do 10, 12 times a year, Mr. Bezos said. With a small fleet of reusable New Shepard rockets, Blue Origin could be launching dozens of times a year.

The other business plans are for selling its rocket engines to other companies like United Launch Alliance, which is planning to use them for the Vulcan, a next-generation rocket to replace the Atlas 5 and Delta 4, and for its own larger rocket to lift payloads to orbit.

Mr. Bezos said Blue Origin was quiet not necessarily to be secretive, but to avoid overpromising itself. Space is really easy to overhype, he said.

The tour would not be the last time the doors are open.

Later this year, Blue Origin will give more details about its designs for the larger rocket that will launch from Cape Canaveral, and Mr. Bezos said there would be an opportunity to watch a test flight of New Shepard in Texas.

We will not be strangers, Mr. Bezos said at the end.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Latinos Slow-Burn Anger,['H Ctor Tobar'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Los Angeles  IN this great season of seething American rage, showmen and rabble-rousers have the floor.









Round up the field hands and the busboys and deport them southward, they say. Build a wall! they chant at rallies and basketball games. Dip bullets in pigs blood for our Muslim enemies.

By comparison, we Latino citizens of the United States suffer from a rage deficit.

Consider our victimized brothers and sisters, the handcuffed and hunted of Mesoamerica: the Oaxacans and the Guatemalans, and the Hondurans and the many others who cross the sands of the Sonoran Desert to reach the Promised Land. They die in hundreds every year.

When was the last time we annoyed you with our outrage about their preventable deaths? The last time one of our leaders unleashed a viral television rant about the failure to enact immigration reform?

Our cries of protest and complaint might as well be whispers. And yet ... I figured two recent pieces of news might finally raise the volume of Latino anger.

The first was a plan by the Obama administration to conduct raids against hundreds of immigrants who are among the recent wave of refugees from Central American violence. The second was the scandalous treatment of some of those refugees, including minors who were released into the custody of sex traffickers.

How could this happen? Do we count for so little?

Last century, I was a student who marched and chanted the slogans of the day: U.S. out of El Salvador! Free Nelson Mandela! Maybe what we need now is a hashtag that summarizes our sense of worth and how weve been wronged. Say, #brownlivesmatter.

I went to the campus of California State University, Los Angeles, where the student body is more than half Latino, to try out my idea. Think of the undocumented roundups, I told the students I met. Think of our second-class status, even in Los Angeles, where Mexican and Guatemalan are often synonymous with laborer. Isnt it time for a Brown Lives Matter movement? I asked.

Almost all the Latino students objected on the ground of cultural appropriation. Black people have suffered enough, they said. Lets not take their slogan, too.

Theres nothing in American history as bad as slavery, a criminal justice major told me. No argument there.

And a graphic-design major pointed out, Well, you know, a lot of Latino people can pass for white.

True, I conceded. Like Marco Rubio.

Sure, these students were angry about the marginalized status of people of Mexican and Central American descent in the United States. One Latina told me how much she resented the othering she encountered because of her appearance and Spanish surname: People ask me all the time, Where are you from? And they dont mean, Are you from the Valley or Long Beach? 

Yet, she didnt see the need to make a stink about it. Why embarrass herself getting angry just because of some idiot?

Herein lies the reason for our anger deficit: We hear the voice of our mothers saying, Mijos, you only demean yourself if you lash back at an insult.

Please dont confuse this forbearance with passivity. And dont call Latinos the sleeping giant of American civic life. (That cliche will make me scream.)

The Latino students I met resist oppression in a low-key, goal-oriented way. By working full time while getting a degree. By studying to become breadwinners who give back to their communities. And by voting for a candidate likely to support immigration reform.

Only a handful, right now, feel the need to take to the streets, like the group arrested after blocking downtown traffic in a protest against deportations  a brave action that was barely a blip on the nations radar. One young woman at Cal State told me she felt guilty for not going, given that her own mother is still trying to sort out her immigration papers after more than two decades in the United States.

Thats all right, I told her. Getting good grades is also a way of resisting racism  though studiousness alone may not get us to the Promised Land.

For that, wed need an eloquent voice of leadership (think Barack Obama, Philadelphia, 2008). Or a book that changes the national conversation, as The Grapes of Wrath or The Jungle did. Another half-million people protesting on the streets (as we did here in 2006) wouldnt hurt.

Until then, Ill supply my rage needs by following a group of writers and comedians known as the Latino Rebels who tweeted sarcastically about how endorsements from anti-immigrant figures like the controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio would help Donald J. Trump do really well with the Hispanics.

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Recep Tayyip Erdogans Despotic Zeal,['Sevgi Akarcesme'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Istanbul  THE virtual control he already has of a majority of Turkeys newspapers and TV stations apparently isnt enough for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. On Friday, with the zeal of its despotic leader, his government seized my paper, Todays Zaman, and its parent, the Turkish-language Zaman, which is the highest-circulating daily in the country. Together, these titles were two of the few remaining independent voices inside Turkey  and Todays Zaman, in particular, was a reliable English-language news source for diplomats, academics and expatriates.









On Friday, a government-controlled court appointed trustees to take over the newspapers in what amounts to a politically motivated assault. At midnight, protesters faced tear gas and water cannons as riot police stormed our Istanbul headquarters.

The authorities used power tools to force open the iron gate to the building. The following day, our Internet connection was cut off to stop staff members from working on a special edition about the takeover. Since then, the authorities have been unplugging the newspapers servers, destroying our digital archive.

Some hours after the raid, I told the police officer smoking a cigarette outside the main gate, This is a nonsmoking area. He replied: Not anymore. That response underscores a broader shift in Turkey: a dangerous trajectory toward an end of the rule of law.

Its bad enough that more than 20 Turkish journalists are behind bars. But Friday will be remembered as the day when media freedoms were even more severely curtailed, in flagrant violation of the Constitution.

In November, two prominent Turkish journalists, Can Dundar and Erdem Gul, senior editors of the daily newspaper Cumhuriyet, were arrested on charges of aiding an armed terrorist organization and publishing material that threatened state security. They were released last month, after the constitutional court ruled that their rights had been violated, but still face trial and, if convicted, possible life sentences. Mr. Erdogan said he had no respect for the court decision that led to their release.

This pressure is not a recent thing. In December 2014, state authorities detained Zamans editor in chief at the time, Ekrem Dumanli, as part of a systematic crackdown on government critics. My predecessor as editor in chief of Todays Zaman, Bulent Kenes, was imprisoned last October for critical Twitter comments. I myself received a suspended jail sentence late last year for somebody elses response to one of my tweets.

Why have we been targeted by the president? According to the court order, these newspapers are accused of disseminating terrorist propaganda and aiding terrorist organizations. This has become a convenient catchall accusation for clamping down on government critics.

In the past, Zaman and Todays Zaman supported the Erdogan-led Justice and Development Partys pro-Western and democracy-oriented policies, as well as its efforts to introduce reforms that would pave the way toward Turkish membership in the European Union. Since the beginning of this decade, however, Mr. Erdogan and his party have become increasingly authoritarian.

Take, for example, the polices brutal response to the 2013 Gezi Park protests in Istanbul that arose after the uprooting of trees and the construction of a shopping mall. The protests attracted worldwide news coverage and elicited criticism from Turkeys most steadfast Western allies.

In March 2014, Mr. Erdogan, who was then Turkeys prime minister (he was elected president later that year), seemed to announce the nature of the new rule  one that involves silencing all forms of dissent  when he called for social media sites such as Facebook and YouTube to be shut down. He went on to describe Twitter as the worst menace to society.

The true oppression began in 2013 after two damning corruption inquiries resulted in several cabinet ministers being forced out. Trying to turn attention away from the graft allegations, Mr. Erdogan accused critics of being part of a parallel structure organized by the Turkish preacher Fethullah Gulen and his Hizmet movement that was seeking to overthrow him. A witch hunt followed against bureaucrats, businesses, journalists, teachers, philanthropists and ordinary citizens with perceived sympathies for Mr. Gulen, who has been living in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999.

Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

His sermons were published in Zaman, but Mr. Gulen has no official ties with the media group that owns the newspapers. Yet the court order that enabled the seizure of Zaman and Todays Zaman argued, without providing any evidence, that Mr. Gulen controlled the newspapers. Many of my colleagues are inspired by his peaceful, moderate teaching  as are millions of people around the world  but it is an insult to their intelligence and integrity to suggest they are under his control.

This may be the last article I write as the editor in chief of Todays Zaman, as I objected to the new administrations censorship on the day they turned Zaman into an official mouthpiece with a pro-government cover article. The world must tell the Erdogan regime that enough is enough.

As we saw in the court ruling on Mr. Dundar and Mr. Gul, which came after the American vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., expressed support for the two journalists, the international community still has leverage over Turkey. Merely showing concern for press freedom and civil liberties in Turkey while turning a blind eye to violations for the sake of business and regional deals may pay off for now, but unless the West takes firm action to check Mr. Erdogans slide into authoritarian rule, it risks losing a stable ally and rare democracy in a Muslim-majority nation.",[]

A la suite de larticle  Au Musee dOrsay, un bilan en trompe-lil  paru dans Le Monde du 2 fevrier, nous avons recu de Guy Cogeval, president du Musee, la lettre suivante :

 Si vous faites etat des succes du Musee dOrsay, de bons chiffres, dexpositions prometteuses, dexposition qui ont massivement attire les visiteurs, si vous annoncez des dons exceptionnels qui enrichissent de maniere significative les collections, il ny aurait cependant plus de pilote dans lavion et ce pilote absent, ce serait moi, evidemment.

La contradiction est piquante : il est difficile dimaginer que ce Musee a la derive puisse rencontrer tant de succes artistiques et commerciaux, si plus personne ne preside a ses destinees.

De meme, presente comme impotent tout en etant qualifie de genie, vous nexpliquez pas comment je ferais pour presider et etre commissaire dexposition dans cet etat daffaiblissement generalise.

Ce qui semble troublant, cest que les elements utilises pour qualifier mon bilan de trompe-lil seraient des dysfonctionnements datant de 2013 et des declarations enervees et acrimonieuses de chefs de service et de conservateurs cachees derriere le confort de lanonymat, qui, en cette periode propice, auraient decide, evidemment par interet pour le Musee dOrsay qui pourtant se porte bien, de donner libre cours a leur volonte de denonciation.

Je souhaite retablir les faits : le rapport remis en mars 2013 par linspection generale a rendu des conclusions positives sagissant de ma gestion du Musee dOrsay et de ses collaborateurs ; je regrette que vous ne le disiez pas.

De meme, mon accident vasculaire cerebral date de juillet 2014 et jen suis remis. Rien ne justifie des attaques sans reserve sur mon pretendu etat de sante.

Enfin, en cette periode de renouvellement, qui explique mon silence a la suite de vos demandes (je suis candidat a ma succession et je nentendais pas mexprimer pendant cette periode), vous apportez du credit et faites de la publicite a des declarations anonymes de personnes non identifiees, qui pourraient etre soit des candidats, soit des soutiens des candidats devoiles ou non, de ces nombreux noms qui circuleraient, prets a prendre ma succession...

Kate McDermott was just a week shy of giving birth to her first child when she and her husband, Steve, moved from Hoboken, N.J., to Westwood, N.J., in 2008. Six years, three more children and another house later, the McDermotts still find Westwood delivering on the qualities they originally sought.









Coming from an urban setting, we wanted somewhere we could walk to town, and didnt necessarily have to get in the car, Ms. McDermott, 34, said. We still do that now, she added, for outings like getting ice cream at Conrads Confectionery. My kids love going there in the summer and walking up to the open window at night.

Like many young families who have moved to Westwood, the McDermotts were attracted first by the boroughs bustling commercial district and convenient commuter access to New York City, and later discovered the areas community spirit and natural beauty.

Known as the hub of the Pascack Valley, Westwood is the largest by population of eight Bergen County municipalities that make up the valley, defined by the Pascack Brook, a tributary of the Hackensack River. In addition to its expansive downtown and residential neighborhoods, Westwoods 2.3 square miles contains ponds, brooks and parks that give it a more rural feel.

Many of the towns nearly 11,000 residents have long been aware of Westwoods advantages.

We have a number of attractive neighborhoods with a variety of houses at not terribly expensive prices, said Joan Sobeck, an agent with Re/Max Elite Associates who has lived here for 50 years. You have people who dont want to leave the area, or cant afford to leave, so they just add on.

In 2014, the McDermotts, with twins on the way, saw themselves quickly outgrowing their three-bedroom one-and-a-half-bath side hall colonial. Rather than expanding, they began looking for another house in Westwood. They wanted to stay in their neighborhood, a historic section known as Goodwin Park, which allows Mr. McDermott, 38, who commutes to his job in advertising sales at Google in Manhattan, to walk to the train station. When they found out a five-bedroom three-bath center hall colonial around the corner was going on the market, they jumped on it, paying $659,000 and moving in that June.

Their original house sold quickly to another young couple, Tom and Jennifer Fredeman, who had been living with their 2-month-old baby in a one-bedroom apartment in White Plains, and were looking for something bigger. Mr. Fredeman, 30, said his wife was driving around the area one day and happened on an open house at the McDermotts home, a 1926 colonial. They immediately put in an offer and bought it for $425,000.

It had everything on our wish list  a fireplace, a foyer, a separate garage  and it was slightly older so it had a little more character, said Mr. Fredeman, a field engineer who works in New York City and enjoys running around Westwood with his daughter in her jogging stroller.

For Ms. McDermott, who grew up in the neighboring town of Hillsdale and whose parents own a business in Westwood, coming back to the area was the right choice.

The town has changed a lot, for the better, she said. There are so many more restaurants and businesses. On Saturdays its become a real destination spot. And from a family perspective, were part of a community. Were all happy here.

What Youll Find

Westwood has a more middle-class feel than some of its neighboring Bergen County towns. It is often compared to Ridgewood, since both towns have thriving downtowns, but Westwood is a little more down to earth, said Margaret Hanna, an agent with Keller Williams Valley Realty.

The borough has a variety of housing styles, from the elegant historic homes in the Goodwin Park area toabundant ranches, split-levels, Cape Cods and smaller colonials. Rental and condominium options include older, midsizeapartment complexes and newer garden-style townhouses.

Besides the busy commercial district, which runs along Broadway, Westwood Avenue and Center Avenue, theres also Westwood Plaza, an outdoor shopping mall that has a Kmart and a T.J. Maxx, plus a small shopping plaza near the train station with a Trader Joes. Westwood is home to the Hackensack University Medical Center at Pascack Valley.

The borough has a volunteer ambulance corps and a volunteer fire department, which includes the former fire chief Jaymee Hodges, whose family has been in Westwood for almost 100 years. Mr. Hodges, who lives in the house he grew up in, runs Hodges & Sons Plumbing and Heating with his two sons, both of whom live in Westwood, as does one of his two daughters. He is also a member of the boroughs planning board.

Its a nice, affordable community, Mr. Hodges said. Someone can find a house that needs a lot of work for $250,000 to $300,000, or a place that needs a decent amount of work for $300,000 to $350,000.

What Youll Pay

On March 2, there were 26 single-family houses on the market, according to the New Jersey Multiple Listing Service, plus two two-family houses, four condominiums and one townhouse. A total of 104 houses sold in 2015, for an average price of $448,993, compared with 74 homes in 2014 for an average of $446,266.

The highest-priced house on the market on March 2 was a six-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath 1920s Georgian colonial in the Goodwin Park area listed at $1.249 million. The lowest-priced home not in foreclosure or in a short sale was a three-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath colonial listed at $329,000. The available condominiums included a one-bedroom one-bath unit listed at $193,000, and a two-bedroom two-bath listed at $209,900.

What to Do

Restaurants and shops downtown are mostly of the mom-and-pop variety, like the Rolling Pin Cafe, the L.N. Grand 5 & 10 store, and Conrads Confectionery, an institution since 1928 for candy and ice cream. Also dating to 1928 is Westwood Cinemas, an Art Deco-style movie house that shows first-run films. Residents can catch open-air movies in the summer at VeteransMemorial Park, where the borough also hosts summer concerts at the parks bandstand.

The Westwood Recreation Department offers a variety of summer camp options for children. Westvale Park has a playground, baseball and softball fields, and an enclosed area for dogs. The 79-acre Pascack Brook County Park has a fishing pond, tennis courts, ball fields and walking trails, among other features.

The Schools

Part of the Westwood Regional School District, Westwood shares a middle school and a junior/senior high school with neighboring Washington Township. The borough has two elementary schools, Berkeley and Brookside, serving a total of 680 students from kindergarten to fifth grade. The Westwood Regional Middle School, in Westwood, serves 430 students in sixth and seventh grades. The regional high school, with 1,032 students, is in Washington Township, and consistently ranks in the top 100 public high schools in the state. The schools music program is highly regarded. The high schools average SAT scores for 2013-14 were 514 in reading, 537 in math and 512 in writing, compared with state averages of 496, 521 and 497.

The Commute

Westwood is about 10 miles northwest of the George Washington Bridge. New Jersey Transit trains run from Westwood to Penn Station in New York, with atransfer in Secaucus, taking about 55 to 65 minutes and costing $9.75, or $298 for a monthly pass. New Jersey Transit bus No. 165 runs to New Yorks Port Authority, which takes 95 minutes and costs $7 one way, or $199 for a monthly pass.

The History

Originally the site of grist and saw mills along the Musquapsink Brook, Westwood boomed after the Erie Railroad extended New York rail service west to neighboring Hillsdale in 1870. After that, small hotels, factories, distilleries, churches and shops sprang up, according to Westwoods 2007 master plan. The borough was officially incorporated in 1894.",[]

AMSTERDAM  Paul Gauguin and many of his contemporaries were so much more than just post-Impressionists  a term largely used to define almost every artist in France in the last decade of the 19th century.









Indeed, they were all grappling with the profound impact of Impressionism. But Gauguin, for example, painted bold colors straight from the paint tube, without mixing, on flat surfaces, lacking linear perspective, with thick outlines around the figures and textured surfaces. A small group of painters at the Academie Julian in Paris felt this approach should be the future of art  a true heralding of artistic life after Impressionism. They followed his example, naming themselves Les Nabis, or The Prophets, because they wanted to usher in a new era of painting.

Maurice Denis, a theoretician, was the intellectual leader of the group, and in a manifesto of 1890 he reminded his compatriots that painting is essentially a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order. Other painters who supported this notion were Paul Serusier, Edouard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard, whose intense use of color made him perhaps the most famous in the group.

That is what unites the painters of Gauguin, Bonnard, Denis: A Russian Taste for French Art, an exhibition at the Hermitage Amsterdam that explores the work and legacy of Les Nabis. The show brings together works from two key collections amassed by the Russian collectors Ivan Morozov and Sergei Shchukin, who were scooping up art in Paris while Les Nabis were in vogue.

About 70 paintings and a handful of sculptures tell the story of this short-lived klatch of artists who may have, in fact, ushered in the next era of art. In addition to three major works by Gauguin, the show includes important paintings from the era, including Bonnards monumental triptych Mediterranee (1911), an interior from a room in a mansion by Denis, as well as work by other acolytes like Felix Vallotton, Aristide Maillol and Theophile Steinlen.

Its often said that Les Nabis were the announcement of Art Deco and Art Nouveau, said Paul Mosterd, the deputy director of the Hermitage Amsterdam, who helped curate the exhibition. They were rebellious, totally fed up with the success of Impressionism and getting bored. They believed in trusting your own senses, being individual, being arrogant, saying we can do better.

Calling themselves prophets was something of an inside joke, Mr. Mosterd explained, because these artists did not take themselves quite so seriously. But the Hermitages curator of exhibitions, Vincent Boele, says they did, in fact, usher in a new era of painting.

You could see them as the prophets of modern art, Mr. Boele said. They were some of the first modern painters who tried to paint according to a theory  that painting is a flat surface covered by colors. That was one step below abstract painting, which was later developed by people like Picasso and Braque.

Les Nabis, according to Mr. Mosterd, were the most influential artists of the beginning of the 20th century. What do you do after Impressionism if you want to find a new way? Thats an unbelievable task, but they managed, he said. They found this very colorful and decorative style, painting on very flat surfaces and using color, color, color.

The group of young painters attracted the attention of Morozov, a Russian textile millionaire who spent a great deal of time in Paris and bought art there throughout the Impressionist and post-Impressionist period and imported them to his palaces in Russia.

Morozov was particularly fascinated by Denis and in 1908 he commissioned the painter to decorate the concert hall in his Moscow mansion. The resulting work, The Story of Cupid and Psyche, depicting scenes from the Latin love story by Apuleius in bold pastel colors, includes seven paintings and six decorative panels. The entire interior has been reassembled and installed in the Hermitage Amsterdam as it was in Morozovs home. After the October Revolution of 1917, Morozov fled Russia with his family and his collection was confiscated; Deniss paintings were removed from the mansion in 1948, and rolled up and stored until the 1990s, when they were exhibited in the State Hermitage. This is the first time since they were in Morozovs mansion that they are being presented exactly as Denis designed them for the room, in a fully reconstructed setting.

Morozov was also an avid collector of Bonnards works, buying some of his finest paintings, including Landscape in Dauphine and Train and Barges, and commissioning the triptych Mediterranee, a view of a bucolic garden on a warm day, which is considered to be one of the great decorative paintings of the early 20th century.

For his part, Shchukin was also a fan of Denis, but he paid little attention to Bonnard. His purchases included works by Nabis artists who had more of a Symbolist bent, like Firmin Maglin, Alfred Guillou, Gaston La Touche, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and Eugene Carriere.

Gauguin never counted himself among Les Nabis, but he is often thought of as their inspirational leader. The exhibition includes three of his most famous canvasses, including the iconic image of two women in Tahiti seated on the ground eating fruit, Sacred Spring: Sweet Dreams (Nave Nave Moe) (1894).

The artworks from Morozov and Shchukin are on loan to Amsterdam from the State Hermitage in St. Petersburg.

Works from both collections will be presented as part of a permanent exhibition of paintings from the late 19th century until the present, in a new wing being built opposite the Winter Palace. Its quite exceptional that we got this collection right now, Mr. Boele said. Many of these painting will go into that new wing and they wont leave Russia for at least the next 10 years.",[]

LONDON  Less than a year after his unexpected general election victory, Prime Minister David Cameron has undertaken an even greater challenge. Staking his future on the outcome, he is holding a referendum on June 23 to decide whether Britain should stay in the European Union, or leave.









Mr. Cameron is said to be a lucky politician, good in a crisis. But is this a gamble too far?

Not since 1975 have Britains voters been given a specific say on their countrys participation in the union, which has undergone a transformation in the intervening years, evolving from a free-trade pact into an integrated political and economic alliance with many of the features of a superstate. Those who favor Britains departure, or Brexit, claim that too much control has been lost to the European Commission in Brussels and the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

Like a majority of Conservatives of his generation, Mr. Cameron himself is a euroskeptic, firmly opposed to European federalism. Yet he believes with no less vigor that Britain can have the best of both worlds, and would suffer economically, diplomatically and strategically outside the union.

Photo

As evidence of his determination to strike a sensible balance, the prime minister promised to renegotiate Britains terms of membership before putting the matter before the electorate. This deal, struck in Brussels on Feb. 19 after more than 30 hours of talks, is considerably better than most of the critics will admit. On a range of issues  Britains exemption from the goal of ever closer union, the benefits it must pay to European Union migrants, the position of the City of London, the ability of national parliaments to resist European law  Mr. Cameron won significant concessions.

The Leave camp claims that this so-called special status is flimsy and will lack the status of law until enshrined in a European Union treaty. But as those around Mr. Cameron admit, the fine print of the agreement was never going to be the deciding factor in the referendum.

Inasmuch as such surveys can be relied on after failing to predict the wide margin of Mr. Camerons victory in last years general election, opinion polls suggest that 15 to 20 percent of voters are undecided. It is their support that both campaigns must now chase. And that battle became all the more dramatic when Boris Johnson, the charismatic Conservative mayor of London, declared himself a supporter of a Brexit.

Like Mr. Cameron, Mr. Johnson is an upper-middle-class product of Englands most famous private school, Eton. But their styles could scarcely be more different.

In his statement to members of Parliament about the deal and referendum, Mr. Cameron made scathing references to Mr. Johnsons position and ambitions. These were ill received by the mayor. Neither man looks in any mood to back down. Whichever side prevails at the ballot box, this particular breach may be irreparable.

Mr. Johnson was only a political friend. But Michael Gove, the highly regarded justice secretary, has been close to Mr. Cameron for years. On the night of the 2010 election, Mr. Goves wife looked after the Cameron children. Mr. Gove also helped to write most of Mr. Camerons key speeches. So his decision to champion Britains exit from the union is a blow to Mr. Cameron personally as well as politically.

Another longtime ally, Michael Howard, a former party leader and now a Conservative peer, has also abandoned the prime ministers camp. On Feb. 25, he wrote in The Daily Telegraph that Mr. Camerons quest for a better deal for Britain had met with failure. The only step that might shake Europes leaders out of their complacency, he went on, was the shock of a vote by the British people to leave.

So much has been imperiled by this referendum. Membership in the European Union is not the essence of the countrys nationhood, but it gives Britain global punch and secures its economic prosperity. If Britons vote to leave, they will also be voting, in effect, for Mr. Cameron to quit Downing Street, his home of six years. After the distraction of the long referendum campaign, the Conservative Party would then be embroiled in a monthslong leadership contest. This would probably involve a runoff between George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. Johnson, his prospects enhanced by backing the winning side in the referendum.

This would be merely the local consequence. As Britain formalized its withdrawal, it would find its status in the world dropping like a bad stock. Britains special relationship with the United States would doubtless endure in rhetoric and sentiment. But America would need a new best friend for its negotiations with the European bloc.

Within Britains borders, most Scottish voters would be deeply aggrieved at exiting the European Union. One of the first tasks confronting the new prime minister could well be to grant a further referendum on the union of England and Scotland. The last such vote, in September 2014, resulted in a defeat for Scottish independence (by 55 percent to 45 percent), but the Scottish National Party has tightened its political grip since then. A Brexit could then be enough to drive Scotland and England apart  if only to allow the Scots to negotiate continued membership as a distinct nation.

A leadership crisis, the breakup of Britain and a shrinking role on the global stage as a commercial, diplomatic and strategic force: The stakes could hardly be higher. When Mr. Cameron won last years general election, he called it the sweetest victory. Doubtless it was. But losing the referendum would be the most bitter defeat imaginable.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,19 Shabab Fighters Die in Somalia in Strike Aided by U.S.,['Mohammed Ibrahim'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

MOGADISHU, Somalia  Only days after American aircraft struck a Shabab training camp in Somalia, American Special Operations forces and Somali troops carried out a raid against Shabab fighters, officials said Wednesday, in a sign of heightened pressure against the militant group.









Somali government officials said that commandos in helicopters raided a militant base in the village of Awdhegle in the lower Shabelle region, nearly 40 miles west of Mogadishu. The commandos landed a few miles outside the village before advancing on the base, killing 19 militants in the operation, officials said.

Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said that American attack helicopters were used in the operation, and that American military personnel had accompanied Somali troops but that they did not go all the way to the objective.

He would not say whether the Americans stayed on the helicopters throughout the operation.

I can tell you that U.S. military personnel served in an advisory role to enable the Somali operation, he said, but insisted that it was their mission. We were acting in an advisory role.

It seems that the United States is changing its strategy and upping the tempo of strikes against the Shabab. The reasons may be that the Shabab have taken over several towns in recent months; Somalia is looking shakier than it has in years; and the Shabab have shown a greater interest in somewhat sophisticated terrorism, like using a laptop bomb, which nearly brought down a jetliner flown by Daallo Airlines, an airline based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in February.

In the past, there was a list of targeted people that gets approved by the White House, said a former American official who worked in Somalia and insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive American policy. Now theres still approval from Washington, but the rules have loosened, and we can strike faster.

He said the American military planners had upped their game because these guys are out there in greater numbers than we thought.

Military officials say there are about 50 members of American Special Operations forces in Somalia working with Somali and African Union forces. But private contractors in Somalia said they had seen at least 150 American personnel recently on one Somali base.

One American defense official denied that there had been a policy change on attacking the Shabab.

We routinely maintain U.S. forces in the region to monitor terrorist activities, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss American strategy.

But a second official, also speaking anonymously for the same reason, said that there was increased worry about a resurgent Shabab, adding that We will act swiftly to address any threat to our own national security and that of our regional allies.

The raid in Awdhegle came after a major assault by American aircraft on a Shabab training camp on Saturday. That attack, which American officials said was carried out by American drones and warplanes, killed about 150 Shabab fighters assembled for what officials believe to have been a graduation ceremony.

The former American official said that American military planners probably arrived at that death toll by looking at aerial photos taken of the graduation right before the strike.

It was the deadliest assault on the Shabab in the more than decade-long American campaign against the group, and a sharp departure from previous American strikes, which have focused more on the groups leaders, not on its foot soldiers.

The Shabab have denied that 150 of their fighters were killed at the camp over the weekend, saying that the death toll cited by Americans was exaggerated. But the group confirmed that the attack took place.

In the raid overnight on Tuesday, the Shabab confirmed that one of their fighters was killed, but asserted that the assault against it had been unsuccessful. Residents in Awdhegle village reported hearing intense gun battles around midnight on Tuesday, causing confusion, shock and fear.

Abdulaziz Abu Muscab, a Shabab spokesman, said that two helicopters had dropped foreign soldiers outside the village. But he said Shabab fighters had repelled the attack, which he said lasted for about 30 minutes.

The Shabab have recently intensified their attacks against the government and in public places. On Wednesday morning, a car bomb exploded at a restaurant in Mogadishu, killing three police officers and the restaurants owner, according to Gen. Ali Hersi Barre, a police commander.

The Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that had targeted government officials at the restaurant.",[]
nytimes.com,2015-03-14 00:00:00,Cabaret and Hedwig Get Tougher Onstage,['Ben Brantley'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The things a girl has to endure to get ahead in show business. The humiliation, the rejection, the objectification, the manhandling and  worst of all  the being treated as if you didnt even exist. Its enough to make even the sunniest chorine feel burned out by the end of a working night.









If you dont believe me, ask one of those jaded ladies from Berlin who are currently plying their trade on Broadway: Sally Bowles and her sister in showbiz suffering, Hedwig. They know the score so well they can sing it in their sleep (or on their backs, anyway). While you may think youve heard quite enough of what they have to say, you might want to take another listen.

Thats because Sally, the coked-up, ginned-up heroine of Cabaret, at Studio 54, and Hedwig, the German-born wig wearer and rock singer from Hedwig and the Angry Inch, at the Belasco Theater, have been given new lives in their respective hit shows. And while theyve never looked wearier, theyve also rarely seemed more fully alive.

The movie actress Sienna Miller (Factory Girl, American Sniper) has shrugged on Sallys hard-won fur coat in Cabaret, while Hedwig, the transgender rock demi-semi-star of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, has been reincarnated by the man who created her back in 1998, the writer and actor John Cameron Mitchell. Each is the latest in a succession of starry names to have inhabited the parts.

But while youre watching them, Ms. Miller and Mr. Mitchell make you believe that they have exclusive rights to their roles. They have both brought additional grit to shows set in seedy environments, a sense of souls who have lived hard, fast and self-destructively. But these are tough gals, too. You just know that theyre going to survive the next car crash, the next failure, the next runaway lover.

That this should be the case with Mr. Mitchell is hardly a surprise. After all, he originated Hedwig, the East Berlin boy who became (almost) a woman and (almost) a rock idol, in the Off Broadway show he created with the songwriter Stephen Trask. And he committed the part to eternity in the 2001 movie version he directed.

For the Broadway Hedwig, which opened last spring under Michael Mayers direction, the show was scaled up and glammed up, to become an appropriate frame for its big-name star, Neil Patrick Harris, who deservedly won a Tony. Mr. Harris brought a master crowd-pleasers smoothness, flamboyance and comic timing to the role, as well as an energy that left the audience feeling highly caffeinated.

Mr. Mitchells Hedwig appears more bruised and battered by life, and on the verge of all-out exhaustion. This is partly because, at 51, this actor is 16 years older than the first time he played Hedwig. And, oh yes, last month he injured his knee, which forced him to leave the show for some performances. (Michael C. Hall, one of Mr. Harriss replacements, took over.)

Now hes back, with a leg brace and a crutch (which glitters like Hedwigs eye shadow) and a crate on which to prop his leg. The inventive uses to which Mr. Mitchell and his Tony-winning co-star, the fabulous Lena Hall (who plays Hedwigs put-upon boyfriend, Yitzhak), put said crate make this production worth revisiting all by themselves.

But theres a deeper sense of mortal shadows and ruefulness about this hobbling Hedwig, now transplanted to America. Shes still a sublime zinger of one-liners. But as Mr. Mitchell plays her, she seems to care a little less about what we think of her than when Mr. Harris had the role. Take me or leave me, she seems to say, with a Dietrich-worthy languor, her voice dropping into a gutter of bitterness.

She can be roused, too, to rage and to competitive rock-star fire power. And when Mr. Mitchell  whose appearance and song stylings often bring to mind a dilapidated David Bowie  turns on the anger, Hedwig stirs and scathes everyone around her. Theres no way this ones staying down for the count.

Nor is Ms. Millers Sally Bowles, who is on view only through March 29, when this revival of the Roundabout Theater Companys 1998 revival of Cabaret closes. I hate to keep telling people to go back to the cabaret, old chum, but Ms. Miller is a revelation here, the most realistic Sally since Natasha Richardson won a Tony for the part 17 years ago.

Yes, Emma Stone, Ms. Millers immediate predecessor in the role, was sensational, an immolating fireball of neurosis and vanity. But Ms. Miller brings something more subtle and pathetic to Sally. She looks gorgeous, but in the tense, artificial way of someone trying too hard to be attractive.

Shes more sexually predatory than most Sallys Ive seen, and more easily deflated when the erotic charm doesnt work. And in Ms. Millers body language, you can read an entire history of abuse, self-inflicted and otherwise. Watch how she reflexively cowers whenever a man raises a hand. Shes been hit before; she expects it.

Theres anger in her as well, which Ms. Miller channels most effectively in the man-stomping Mein Herr. And though you dont doubt that she loves her American boyfriend (Bill Heck) as much as she is able to, she knows that men are not to be relied on.

This Sally is a pragmatist, with a calloused core. When she sings the climactic title song, shortly after having an abortion, she makes it clear that while she may be shaken, shes going to soldier on.

Ive seen Ms. Miller onstage before twice, as Celia in As You Like It (in London) and in the Roundabouts production After Miss Julie, Patrick Marbers riff on Strindberg, and both times she seemed rather ill at ease. Any anxiety she displays here is strictly Sallys. Whod have thought shed find her comfort zone in Weimar Berlin on the eve of destruction?

Ms. Miller and Mr. Mitchell might want to swap war stories at some point. After catching Ms. Miller at last Saturdays matinee of Cabaret (which still stars the unquenchable Alan Cumming as the happily creepy M.C.), I learned that she injured herself that very night during the performance, sustaining a black eye and a wound that required stitches. Such are the dangers of life in the theater.",[]

Throughout the country, the arts are pumping new life into the bodies and minds of the elderly.

Two summers ago, a remarkable documentary called Alive Inside showed how much music can do for the most vulnerable older Americans, especially those whose memories and personalities are dimmed by dementia.

The film opens with a 90-year-old African-American woman living in a nursing home being asked about her life growing up in the South. All she could say in response to specific questions was, Im sorry, I dont remember.

But once she was fitted with an iPod that played the music she had enjoyed in her youth, her smile grew wide and her eyes sparkled as vivid memories flooded her consciousness. She was now able to describe in detail the music and dances she had relished with her young friends.

At another nursing home, a man named George with advanced dementia refused to speak or even raise his head when asked his name. He too was outfitted with an iPod, and suddenly George came back to life, talking freely, wiggling to the music in his wheelchair and singing along with the songs he once loved.

The Music and Memory project that provided the iPods was the inspiration of a volunteer music lover named Dan Cohen, and has since spread to many nursing homes and facilities for the aged around the country. Alas, not nearly enough of them. Medicaid, which fully covers the cost of potent drugs that can turn old people into virtual zombies, has no policy that would pay for far less expensive music players. So the vast majority of nursing home residents who might benefit are deprived of this joyous experience.

Nonetheless, across the country, the arts in their myriad forms are enhancing the lives and health of older people  and not just those with dementia helping to keep many men and women out of nursing homes and living independently. With grants from organizations like the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Institute on Aging, incredibly dedicated individuals with backgrounds in the arts have established programs that utilize activities as diverse as music, dance, painting, quilting, singing, poetry writing and storytelling to add meaning, joy and a vibrant sense of well-being to the lives of older people.

Through a program called EngAGE in Southern California, 90-year-old Walter Hurlburt, who once made a living as a sign painter, now decorates rooms at the Burbank Senior Artists Colony, a retirement facility where he lives, with lovely oil paintings he creates from pictures he finds in magazines and books. Mr. Hurlburt regularly attends classes on various art forms at the residence where, he told me, Im always learning something new.

His buddy at the residence, Sally Connors, an 82-year-old former schoolteacher, surprised herself by writing and directing a screenplay that was performed by fellow residents. Then, with Dolly Brittan, 79, a former early childhood educator, they both surprised themselves by writing their life stories in rap and performing their rap memoirs on a stage for at-risk teenagers they were mentoring.

Both she and Ms. Connors said their newfound involvement with the arts has made them feel decades younger.

Tim Carpenter, the executive director of EngAGE, is now working to expand this approach to senior living in other cities, including Minneapolis, Portland, Ore., and Raleigh, N.C. His goal is to create a nationwide network of programs for seniors that keep them healthy, happy and active through lifelong learning in every conceivable art form, enabling them to live independently as long as possible.

As in Burbank, Mr. Carpenter is promoting the development of arts colonies in senior residences where residents can study and create art in all its forms and where they can see their artistic creations come to life on a stage.

Dr. Gene D. Cohen, a gerontologist at George Washington University who died in 2009, was a staunch advocate for the mental and physical benefits of creativity for the elderly. He directed the Creativity and Aging Study, a controlled study sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts at three sites, including Elders Share the Arts in Brooklyn, N.Y., that showed after only a year that the health of elders in the cultural groups stabilized or improved in contrast to a decline among those in the control groups.

In a film called Do Not Go Gently, Dr. Cohen, who founded the Creativity Discovery Corps, featured an architect who, at age 96, submitted a plan for redeveloping the World Trade Center site. Dr. Cohen pointed out that creativity challenges the mind and results in the formation of new dendrites, the brains communication channels.

At 26 different facilities in the Washington, D.C., area, 15 teaching artists work with seniors in centers where they live or visit regularly. Janine Tursini, director of Arts for the Aging in Rockville, Md., seeks to get at what best jazzes up older adults. Groups of about 20 older adults get involved in what she calls art making  music, dance, painting or storytelling.

Ms. Tursini said the N.E.A.-sponsored study showed that when older people become involved in culturally enriching programs, they experience a decline in depression, are less likely to fall and pay fewer visits to the doctor. In another study among people with Alzheimers disease, a sculpting program improved the participants mood and decreased their agitation even after the program ended.

The arts open people up, giving them new vehicles for self-expression, a chance to tell their stories, Ms. Tursini said. The programs capitalize on assets that remain, not on whats been lost.

Naomi Goldberg Haas created the Dances for a Variable Population program to get older adults dancing. People who havent moved in years, even those who can no longer stand, can participate. Young professionals and older dancers go to various sites  libraries, churches, senior centers  where elders gather and encourage them to move more.

Social engagement, which nearly all these programs provide, has been repeatedly found in major population studies to prolong life and enhance healthy aging. Clinically, the programs have been linked to lowered blood pressure, reduced levels of stress hormones, and increased levels of the happiness hormones that are responsible for a runners high.

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,An Espresso Maker That Hums Along With Cecile McLorin Salvant,['Ligaya Mishan'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

To some, the Moka pot is a fetish and design icon as likely to be found at a museum (one is in the Museum of Modern Arts permanent collection) as in a young jazz singers galley kitchen in Harlem.

Invented in Italy during the Great Depression, the stovetop coffee maker liberated espresso from the caffe bar and made it something that Italians could brew easily and affordably at home. When Renato Bialetti, who sold millions of the little machines (his father, Alfonso, was the first to manufacture them), died last month, his ashes were interred in a giant Moka pot.

To Cecile McLorin Salvant, who won this years Grammy Award for jazz vocal album (For One to Love), the coffee maker is at once more mundane and magical: a quick means to what she calls a wonderful drug, and a reminder of her childhood home in Miami, where she grew up with the scent of coffee always at the ready, bubbling in any one of her parents three battered and beloved Moka pots.

Note that her pot is not the Art Deco original from Bialetti, with gleaming octagonal slopes of aluminum. (When Bialetti introduced the Moka Express, the fascist leader Benito Mussolini had imposed an embargo on stainless steel in favor of Italian bauxite ore.) Hers comes from Ikea and is stainless steel, which some coffee obsessives prefer, to prevent a metallic aftertaste.

But Ms. Salvant, 26, isnt so fussy. The pot was a gift from her mother, and it does the job. Water in the bottom chamber is heated slowly until steam pressure forces it through loose grounds in the basket above; coffee collects at the top.

It kind of settles me, Ms. Salvant said. She pours the coffee into a thermos and nurses it while she works at the piano.

She didnt start singing jazz until she was 18, while studying political science in Aix-en-Provence, France, after years of classical voice lessons. (She still fondly recalls Bachs Coffee Cantata, in which a worried father threatens to block his daughters marriage unless she stops drinking coffee.)

Photo

Three years later, she won the prestigious Thelonious Monk competition, which honors up-and-coming jazz artists. Nate Chinen, writing in The Times, has called her the finest jazz singer to emerge in the last decade.

In France, she started cooking, too, drawing on recipes from her mother, who is of French-Guadeloupean descent and spent her youth in Tunisia, Senegal, Bolivia and Cuba. Mafe, yassa, ragout de porc, Guadeloupe poisson, chicken with 40 cloves of garlic, boeuf bourgignon, Ms. Salvant recited, almost in incantation.

She owes her birth in part to her mothers cooking skills. Her father, a doctor from Haiti, tasted a batch of nem (Senegalese spring rolls) that her mother had made for a friend. I want to meet her, he said.

In season, her parents ship her mangoes from their backyard in Miami, and she hasnt had the heart to buy the fruit in New York. Instead, shes been eking out a jar of mango compote that her mother made last summer, scooping spoonfuls between sips of coffee.

Recently, her mother started experimenting with mango tarte Tatin. She posts it online, with pictures, Ms. Salvant said, half-offended, half-yearning. Thats just rude.",[]

Strategically skipping bread, pasta and other carbohydrates at dinner might improve subsequent athletic performance, provided those low-carb meals are combined with the right types of workouts, according to a new sports nutrition study. Its findings undercut some entrenched ideas about how athletes should eat in preparation for spring marathons and other endurance races.

As those of us who are athletes or spend time around them know, diets are a topic of consuming interest for the group, since an athletes diet affects how well he or she can train, recover, progress, chisel a physique and compete.

But the ideal sports diet remains elusive. Many dietitians and coaches advocate for heaps of carbohydrates at the training table. Carbohydrates, which break down during digestion into sugar, are the bodys first choice as fuel during exercise. But the bodys reservoir of stored carbohydrates is small, and even if athletes supplement their supply during exercise with sugary drinks or food, prolonged or intense exertion generally incinerates much of the bodys available carbohydrates.

Consequently, some experts suggest that athletic success may depend in part on making the body better able to use fat as a fuel. Even the leanest athletes body is girded with the stuff, theoretically providing enough energy for even the longest, hardest workouts. Low-carbohydrate diets will force the body to turn to fat. But working muscles must become used to burning fat, a process that can make exercising on a low-carb diet difficult in the short term. Indeed, athletes on extremely low-carbohydrate diets tend to struggle to finish hard workouts.

So researchers at the French National Institute of Sport, Expertise and Performance in Paris and other institutions began to wonder about the possibilities of modified forms of low-carb diets, and specifically about what they and other scientists call sleeping low.

With a sleep-low sports diet, an athlete skips carbohydrates at dinner. In the morning, his or her body should have low reserves of the macronutrient, and any ensuing workouts would force the body to turn to fat, its most abundant fuel. In past studies of the technique, however, it has produced mixed results in terms of whether it improves competitive performance.

The authors of the new study, which was published in January in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, suspected that the sleep-low diet needed to be integrated into a broader training plan in order to show desirable results.

To test that possibility, they recruited 21 experienced, competitive triathletes who bravely agreed to have their diets manipulated. The scientists ran their volunteers through a simulated triathlon and other tests of their current fitness and pace.

Half of the athletes were then randomly assigned to eat a standard sports diet, with large helpings of carbohydrates at every meal and after workouts.

The others were put on a sleep-low regimen. With this program, the athletes consumed the same amount of carbohydrates over the course of the day as the other group, but in a different sequence. Virtually all of their carbohydrates were consumed at breakfast and lunch, with none at dinner.

At the same time, all of the athletes also began a new training program. In the afternoon, both groups completed a draining, intense interval-training session, designed to increase fitness and deplete the bodys carbohydrate stores. The members of the control group then replenished their carbohydrates at dinner; the sleep-low group did not.

Next morning, before breakfast, the volunteers pedaled for an hour at a moderate pace on stationary bicycles. By this time, the sleep-low group was running on carbohydrate fumes and body fat.

Afterward, all of the athletes sat down to large, carb-rich breakfasts and lunches, meaning that both groups were flush with carbohydrates for the afternoon interval training.

This program continued for four days per week for three weeks. (On the remaining days, the athletes ran, cycled or swam at an easy pace and ate as they chose.)

After three weeks, the athletes in the sleep-low group were grumbling about evening hunger.

But when the researchers now repeated the simulated triathlon, those athletes in the sleep-low group showed notable improvement. Their times on the 10-kilometer running leg at the end of the race were faster by about 75 seconds, or 3 percent, than at the start of the study. The control group had not improved.

The sleep-low volunteers also had lost body fat, while the other athletes had not.

These findings suggest, said Laurie-Anne Marquet, a graduate student at the French National Institute of Sport who led the study, that exercising strenuously in the afternoon, depriving yourself of carbohydrates afterward, training gently the next morning and then swallowing a mound of pancakes might be a useful way to improve endurance and performance. The regimen seemed to have increased the athletes ability to access fat as muscle fuel, she said, allowing them to exercise harder during the workouts than the control group and gain additional fitness and speed.

Such a rigorous routine is not for everyone, of course. Those of us not training for a marathon, triathlon or similar event probably would not enjoy or benefit from sleeping low. Even serious athletes should thread the approach into their training cautiously, Ms. Marquet said, beginning a few weeks before a race and easing off in the days just before the event, when they should down carbohydrates at will.

Encouragingly for those tempted by the diet, though, most of the athletes in the study, Ms. Marquet said, have now integrated this strategy into their training.

The Public Art Fund, which in recent years has looked far outside its New York City base for artists and projects, announced Tuesday that it had enlisted Adrian Cheng, a prominent Chinese collector and the scion of a multibillion-dollar retailing empire, to join its board.

Mr. Cheng, 36, has become more visible in the international art world in recent years through the development of an unusual business-meets-nonprofit model in China for promoting shopping and fine art at the same time. Mr. Chengs K11 Art Foundation, a nonprofit, works with his familys business to organize museumlike exhibitions (a sizable Monet show last year in Shanghai) and displays of contemporary art in the familys high-end malls. Such arrangements, which are becoming more popular among retailers in Asia, were once common in the West, though their history is now little remembered. (Michael Kimmelman, writing in The New York Times about that history in 1995, noted that the first Cubist art show in America took place at Gimbels in Pittsburgh in 1913, at a time when department stores sought to elevate the taste of their patrons and you were more likely to find high culture at A.T. Stewarts giant store on Broadway and 10th Street, along Ladies Mile than at New Yorks fledgling museums.)

In a telephone interview from Seoul, where he was traveling, Mr. Cheng said he was interested in joining the Public Art Funds board  his first presence as a trustee for an art institution in New York  because he sees his foundations mission as fostering greater awareness of contemporary art in China, where public art institutions have often lagged. Its all about art for the masses, said Mr. Cheng, who was educated at Harvard and owns an apartment in Manhattan. So the Public Art Fund actually matches our mission.

Nicholas Baume, the Public Art Funds director and chief curator, said that as the fund became more globally engaged it was interested in a patron with a really key position in Asia.

A lot of the artists weve worked with he shares a passion for, Mr. Baume said of Mr. Cheng. I think the dialogue with Adrian could enrich both of our institutions.",[]

Recently, university researchers asked children and parents to describe the rules they thought families should follow related to technology.

In most cases, parents and children agreed  dont text and drive; dont be online when someone wants to talk to you. But there was one surprising rule that the children wanted that their parents mentioned far less often: Dont post anything about me on social media without asking me.

As in, no pictures of them asleep in the back of the car. No posts about their frustration with their homework. That victory picture after the soccer game? Maybe. The frustrated rant about the fight you just had over laundry? No way.

The answers revealed a really interesting disconnect, said Alexis Hiniker, a graduate student in human-centered design and engineering at the University of Washington who led the research. She, along with researchers at the University of Michigan, studied 249 parent-child pairs distributed across 40 states and found that while children ages 10 to 17 were really concerned about the ways parents shared their childrens lives online, their parents were far less worried. About three times more children than parents thought there should be rules about what parents shared on social media.

Sites like Facebook and Instagram are now baked into the world of todays families. Many, if not most, new parents post images of their newborn online within an hour of birth, and some parents create social media accounts for the children themselves  often to share photos and news with family, although occasionally in the pursuit of Instafame for their fashionably clad, beautifully photographed sons and daughters.

With the first babies of Facebook (which started in 2004) not yet in their teens and the stylish kids of Instagram (which started in 2010) barely in elementary school, families are just beginning to explore the question of how children feel about the digital record of their earliest years. But as this study, although small, suggests, its increasingly clear that our children will grow into teenagers and adults who want to control their digital identities.

As these children come of age, theyre going to be seeing the digital footprint left in their childhoods wake, said Stacey Steinberg, a legal skills professor and associate director of the Center on Children and Families at the University of Florida Levin College of Law. While most of them will be fine, some might take issue with it.

Some children and teenagers question both past and present sharing. I really dont like it when my parents post pictures of me on their social media accounts, especially after finding out that some of my friends follow them, said Maisy Hoffman, 14, an eighth grader who lives in Manhattan. I worry more about my dad. He doesnt always ask if he can post things, so I immediately turn away and ask if hes going to post it. Or Ill find out later because my friend saw something of me on his Instagram and Ill have to ask him to take it down.

Other parents can also present a problem for the child who prefers to control how she appears online. Wendy Bradford, a mother of three elementary-school aged children in Manhattan, said that when parent chaperones took pictures during a third-grade field trip to the zoo, her daughter hid when she saw the phones because she didnt want the pictures to be posted on Facebook with her in them.

Isabella Aijo, 15, a high school sophomore in Natick, Mass., said, I definitely know people who have parents who post things they wish werent out there. There was a girl in my eighth grade class whose mom opened a YouTube account for her in the fourth grade to show off her singing, she wrote to me in an email. Finally, on one of the last months of middle school, a peer played the song in class and almost the entire class laughed hysterically over it.

Those early posts from parents linger, not just online, but in our childrens memories  and the topics may be things we dont see as potentially embarrassing. The son of a friend (who asked that I not use her name) still brings up things she wrote about his picky eating when he was younger  years ago, she says.

But that kind of sharing  about food issues, potty training and tantrums  is exactly the kind of sharing that can be valuable. Children benefit from the community created when parents have the ability to share their stories, said Ms. Steinberg. Those posts about picky eating might have helped my friend find solutions, or a fresh wellspring of patience for a behavior her child would eventually outgrow.

When parents share those early frustrations, they dont see themselves as exposing something personal about their childrens lives, but about their own. As a society, says Ms. Steinberg, were going to have to find ways to balance a parents right to share their story and a parents right to control the upbringing of their child with a childs right to privacy.

Parents often intrude on a childs digital identity, not because they are malicious, but because they havent considered the potential reach and the longevity of the digital information that theyre sharing, said Ms. Steinberg.

In general, said Sarita Schoenebeck, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, who co-authored the research, both children and parents considered positive images, events and news more appropriate to share than negative ones. Parents can consider, too, the searchability and reach of the format (although those are always evolving). A frustrated tweet about a child who wont eat her cereal because its not in a red bowl is a lot less likely to resurface than a YouTube video of the resulting tantrum. Looking for advice or sympathy about a behavioral problem? Skip both the image, and your childs name, in a post to limit later searches.

At our house, I sometimes see the hesitation in my oldest son, who is 14, when I bring out the camera at a goofy moment, but we have a whole house rule: no sharing images of anyone else without their consent, ever. That trust means I get my candid shots, and he keeps his digital identity, whatever he eventually wants it to be, intact.

PARIS  A long, strange season it has been. One filled with ambiguity, rumor and infighting (Show now, sell now! Over my dead body!), that aside from some discernible trends  an elongated silhouette; leopard; the continuing popularity of lingerie dresses; the haute puffa jacket  has left most questions as yet unresolved.









Who will run Dior? Dont know. What about Lanvin? The latest name whispered in the wings is Bouchra Jarrar. Is Hedi Slimane staying at Saint Laurent? Your guess is as good as mine. Do shows matter, or is it all about Instagram now?

Ah, for that we have a response. Social media makes people think everything is accessible said Maria Grazia Chiuri, a creative director of Valentino, backstage before the show. She was standing next to Pierpaolo Piccioli, her co-creative director, both wearing black trouser suits and white shirts (Mr. Piccioli also had on a black tie; Ms. Chiuri, a handful of rings) and talking about performance art. Which for them is a synonym for a show.

But what social media cannot provide is a sense of the emotion of a group experience, she continued. We think our job is not just to do things you can consume, because you can see and love beauty without buying it. It is to give that shared happening. So they did.

Against piano music by John Cage and Philip Glass played live on a baby grand set amid the runway came an ode to dancers past: Merce Cunningham and Martha Graham, Pina Bausch and Diaghilev. Some of it was wearable (pristine white shirts wrapped like a warm-up sweater, with a dark ribbon at the waist and ribs; pleated schoolgirl skirts and exacting navy coats), and some of it less so (a nude suede dress with draped spaghetti-strap bodice, the skirt sliced into studded ribbons to play with, and expose, the legs; a crinoline tutu). Though that was not the point. The effect  material doing fouettes and chasses around the body  was.

The theme gave the designers leave to express their penchant for couture-level ornamentation via floating layers of tulle embroidered with clouds, or folkloric runes, or feathered wings. Its beautiful, no question, but its also beginning to seem almost rote. (Oh, look: another amazing bit of beading; uh-huh; whats next?) The best pieces had the strict perfection of silk jersey, shirred at the shoulders and prepped for an arabesque. Subconsciously, they made you point your toes.

But for that, you had, as they say, to be there. In the end, Paris was replete with these grace notes; felicitous, if occasionally head-spinning, reminders of why this circus exists.

They started with the surreal  Giambattista Vallis spun-sugar ode to the Swiss Alps in a fluffy fur, flowers and lederhosen fantasy at Moncler Gamme Rouge, complete with pretend snow and real cow bells. They moved to social commentary: Miuccia Pradas high/low melange of the bourgeois and the bohemian at Miu Miu with denim jackets done up like evening wear, cotton boxers, tapestry maxi skirts, tweed jodhpurs, little velvet dresses and bombshell brocades (and shorts). And they ultimately reached the sublime: Iris van Herpens 18 stations of the future.

Eighteen women faced 18 olfactory light screens, rectangular panels that refracted the light and reflected and distorted the woman (and dress) behind, doubling her image and transforming the audience into both voyeur and backstage visitor, and allowing the woman to dance, as it were, with herself. Thats not to mention the dress she might be wearing: a familiar neat little sheath, rendered extraordinary by technology and imagination.

One lacy spider web was laser-cut from wool; another knitted in micro-pleats from steel and wool to create a dense, swirling exoskeleton; another composed of glistening 3-D printed, transparent laser-cut hexagons (5,000 of them) as airy and alluring as soap bubbles. Yet another was made from intensely light tulle fused with iridescent strips so the fabric looked like liquid mercury. Why Ms. van Herpens name is not often mentioned in contention for one of the myriad creative director jobs available is one of fashions great mysteries.

If her clothes were singular, however, it was at Louis Vuitton that things got, literally, monumental. The artistic director Nicolas Ghesquiere constructed three enormous geometric shapes  a sphere, a square, a pyramid  and filled them with the ruins of a glittering Atlantis. The better to excavate not just his own aesthetic history (and that of his house), but that of the collections thus far.

Columns covered in shattered mirrors reflected a story of motor sports and the military told in patent leather and wool. The rise of the machines was woven into graphic knit bodysuits and dresses, and ivory silk slip dresses came paired with leather breastplates or etched with sequined scratches, like lace or mud (it was hard to tell), a train suspended from the narrowest strap on one side. Road warriors were spliced with romance and a bit of the weird  a combination that also pretty much describes the underlying genome of the womens wear month.

Julie Kent, a beloved ballerina who danced her final performance with American Ballet Theater last June after spending nearly three decades with the company, will be the next artistic director of the Washington Ballet, the company announced on Monday.

When Ms. Kent, 46, succeeds Septime Webre as artistic director in July, it will be something of a homecoming for her: She grew up in Maryland and began her dance training in the region at the Academy of the Maryland Youth Ballet in Bethesda.

She said in a statement that she looked forward to the opportunity to share my experience to train and nurture dancers so that they can develop to their full potential.

When she takes over in Washington, Ms. Kent, who has danced in more than 100 ballets, and found a wider audience when she appeared in the 1987 film Dancers opposite Mikhail Baryshnikov, will be one of the few women running a major ballet company.

Sylvia de Leon, the chairwoman of the board in Washington, said in a statement that while Julie is an iconic American ballerina, it is her deep understanding of ballet, the individual dancer, the audience and the role of ballet in humanity that makes her an outstanding choice.

Her husband, Victor Barbee, who has been the associate artistic director of American Ballet Theater for 13 years and was a principal dancer there before that, will join the Washington Ballet as associate artistic director.

Last year, after she retired as a dancer, Ms. Kent was named the artistic director of Ballet Theaters summer intensive program. It was not immediately clear who would assume that role.

Kevin McKenzie, the artistic director of Ballet Theater, wished Ms. Kent and Mr. Barbee well. Together, they epitomize ballet artistry at its highest level, he said in a statement.",[]

FOR more than two hours, Nancy Reagan sat behind the artist Everett Raymond Kinstler as he painted her husbands portrait in his New York City studio shortly after the Reagans left the White House. Mr. Kinstler, who had done several portraits of President Gerald Ford, was unnerved by Mrs. Reagans intensity. It was terribly distracting, he recalled. When he asked if she would wait in the living room, Mrs. Reagan replied, unmoved, No, I really would like to stay here while you work.









That was classic Nancy Reagan. Since her death on Sunday, she has been remembered as a powerful and stylish first lady. But she was much more than that. Many ambitious women have filled the role of presidential spouse. Mrs. Reagan understood better than any of them how to use the position to control her husbands image and legacy.

The title of first lady comes with a thorny combination of intense scrutiny, an incredible platform and no official mandate. We have traditionally seen the first lady as the embodiment of American womanhood, but that view is on its way out; largely thanks to Hillary Clinton, were now more likely to see the first union as a political alliance between equals.

Many first ladies have been unhappy in the role. Martha Washington called herself a state prisoner. Jacqueline Kennedy proclaimed: The one thing I do not want to be called is first lady. It sounds like a saddle horse. And Michelle Obama says that living in the White House is like living in a really nice prison. Mrs. Reagan, however, was unabashedly proud of her hard-won position and even put first lady as her occupation on her income tax forms.

She was crucial to her husbands electoral success: cultivating wealthy California friends who could aid his first campaign for governor in the 1960s and eventually get him to the White House. She was the human resources department, says a Reagan political consultant, Stuart Spencer, because she helped decide who was in her husbands cabinet.

Mrs. Reagan was content because she defined the role in a uniquely ambitious  and covert  way. There was no West Wing office like the one Mrs. Clinton had, nor sitting in on cabinet meetings like Rosalynn Carter. Mrs. Reagan insisted that it would have been embarrassing to attend such high-level meetings. But in many ways she wielded as much power as either of these women. I talk to people, they tell me things. And if something is about to become a problem Im not above calling a staff person and asking about it, Mrs. Reagan said in a 1987 speech. Im a woman who loves her husband and I make no apologies for looking out for his personal and political welfare.

President Reagan was a ready recipient of her steady guidance, and she performed the tasks, including firing underlings, which he found distasteful. Her love and loyalty were returned. On their anniversary in 1981 the president left her a note, telling her that he scrooches down at his desk in the Oval Office so he could see her window.

Susan Porter Rose, who was Barbara Bushs chief of staff when George H. W. Bush was vice president, remembers seeing the Reagans after an event and watching as the elevator door opened to carry the first lady to the second-floor residence. He was going to go back to the Oval, and he just put his hand on top of hers and looked at her and said, I so wish I didnt have to go back to the office. 

Mrs. Reagans image as an imperial first lady  she was referred to contemptuously in the press as Queen Nancy  was amplified by her more than $200,000 purchase of a new set of china (through private donations) and not helped by revelations that she spent $25,000 on her inaugural wardrobe and $10,000 on a single gown.

But this wasnt mere vanity. Mrs. Reagan understood the physical power of the executive mansion better than any first lady before her, with the exception of Mrs. Kennedy. Before the historic visit of Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, in 1987, Mrs. Reagan and her social secretary made a visit to the flower shop in the White House basement. The first lady gave simple instructions to blow Mrs. Gorbachevs socks off.

So we did, recalled a florist, Ronn Payne. We changed every single flower in the house three times in one day: for the morning arrival, for the afternoon lunch, and for the state dinner. Every single flower, three times, every one.

Mrs. Reagan was a self-proclaimed worrier, and her concerns became all-consuming after the attempt on her husbands life months into his presidency. She referred to the period after the assassination attempt as the lost year. She insisted that her husband go to the residence to take an afternoon nap. If she found him at his desk working, she would tell him: Horizontal. I want you horizontal.

As first lady she built walls around herself so that she could get the job done. But she was heartbroken when her favorite White House doorman died, and she was deeply saddened when the actress Katharine Hepburn ended their friendship because of their political differences.

Few people could intimidate Nancy Reagan, a woman who reveled in the power of her position, but during the portrait sitting with Mr. Kinstler, Mrs. Reagan noticed several paintings of Hepburn on the walls of his studio and reminisced about her old friend. When Mr. Kinstler picked up the phone and got Hepburn on the line, Mrs. Reagan suddenly became shy and pushed the receiver away. No, you talk to her first, she said.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Review: Mayhem! Gambling! Disco! In Disaster! Its All There for the Spoofing,['Charles Isherwood'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Alert the authorities! Theres a wayward nun on the loose in New York City, committing grand larceny eight times a week.









I joke, of course  though that story would be a fun diversion from the onslaught of election coverage, no? The crimes are fictional, and are taking place at the Nederlander Theater on Broadway, where Jennifer Simard, playing a singing sister with an unquenchable yen for slot machines, is pilfering every scene she adorns in the delirious goof of a musical, Disaster!

Perhaps petty larceny is a more appropriate charge, since this self-consciously silly spoof of the cheesy 1970s films that subjected assorted B-list stars to assorted calamities will never rank among the great musicals of our era  or even the great jukebox musicals of our era, a rather small demographic. But for anyone with a moist, albeit mortifying, affection for the oeuvre of that great auteur Irwin Allen (guilty), and the K-Tel era of pop music (guilty), Disaster! will provide a rush of giddy nostalgia thats just as pleasurable, at times, as the more substantial rewards of the musical theaters higher-reaching shows.

True, if you have to Google either Allen, the producer of The Poseidon Adventure, which provides the basic template for the musical, or K-Tel, which churned out albums of soppy pop hits in collections relentlessly flogged in television ads, you might want to give this baby a skip. Try Hamilton  and good luck with that!

Even so, Disaster!, written by Seth Rudetsky and Jack Plotnick, and directed by Mr. Plotnick, has such a sensational cast that musical lovers incognizant of the guilty pleasures of the movies being lampooned, and ignorant of the shows soundtrack  a staggering stack of 45s you loved to hate, or hated to love, or a little of both (Torn Between Two Lovers, Feelings, I Am Woman)  may still have plenty to savor.

My spouse, whose ignorance of both the movies and the music in question is absolute (he was born in Turkey, after the brief vogue of disaster movies had waned), had a fine time, enjoying the daffiness of the performances and the willfully crackpot plotting.

In addition to the heaven-sent Ms. Simard, the musical, which has had two prior Off Broadway runs, features tasty turns from familiar names: Faith Prince, sending up the warmhearted Jewish matron memorably portrayed by Shelley Winters in The Poseidon Adventure; Roger Bart, playing the sleazy owner of the floating disco-cum-casino in which the musical takes place; Rachel York, spangled in faux Bob Mackie and flinging around a fabulous Farrah wig, as the clubs headliner; and Kerry Butler as an intrepid reporter seeking to uncover the shoddy workmanship that causes havoc when an earthquake strikes the Hudson River, where the party boat floats.

Lets briefly run through the ditsy plot. Mr. Rudetsky, perhaps the biggest and most famous Broadway fanboy in town, himself plays professor Ted Scheider, soi-disant noted disaster expert. He has reason to believe a geological event of mighty proportions may be about to occur, because hes been extracting some unusually heated sediment from, er, somewhere. (The opening number, introducing most of the characters, is performed to the throbbing Hot Stuff, originally made famous by Donna Summer.)

Ted is most worried about this casino-disco, which is celebrating its grand opening and is stuffed to capacity, a further danger detected by Marianne (Ms. Butler), that nosy reporter who buttonholes the proprietor, Tony (Mr. Bart). His flirtatious evasions dont give her much help, requiring her to take him up on his invitation to join the party.

Once aboard, shes surprised to meet an ex-fiance whom she dumped, Chad, a cater-waiter played by Adam Pascal, whose leather lungs are ripe for his big power ballad, the ghastly Without You. Lets all sing along: I cant live/If living is without you/I cant live/I cant give anymore. (Try getting that out of your head now. Apologies.)

Also on board: Ms. Princes Shirley, resplendent in lurid Pucci swirls (the delicious costumes are by William Ivey Long), and her husband, Maury (Kevin Chamberlin, mostly wasted, alas); the washed-up disco queen Levora, played with seen-it-all weariness by Lacretta Nicole; and Ms. Yorks Jackie, who hopes to entice Tony into becoming stepfather to her twin tykes  a boy and girl played with ingenuity by Baylee Littrell, swapping genders within seconds.

Mr. Rudetsky and Mr. Plotnick (along with Drew Geraci, who co-conceived the show and wrote additional material) take their time getting to the titular calamity, or rather series of calamities: after the earthquake comes a tidal wave that capsizes the casino. The first act tends toward waywardness, and while it runs just an hour, it feels longer. When youre camping it up, its best not to spend too much time vamping. (The quick-change bit with the twins, for instance, becomes a running gag thats running a marathon.)

But the performances provide sufficient distraction. I will not soon forget the loopy sight of Ms. Princes Shirley tap-dancing her heart out (almost literally) to transmit messages in Morse code to passengers trapped a floor below her. The antic Mr. Bart practically springs an oil leak as the corrupt Tony, and Ms. Yorks lush junior-varsity version of Cher is amusingly vapid, all bugle beads for brains.

But the breakout star is unquestionably Ms. Simard, playing Sister Mary Downy, a guitar-strumming nun who comes to the boat to convert the partygoers from lives of dissipation (Gambling is a sin, youre going to hell, have a nice day, she tells one), but ends up performing an orgasmic pas de deux with a Hawaii Five-O-themed slot machine, to the tune of the disco classic Never Can Say Goodbye. (Connoisseurs will recognize Sister Mary as a nod to Helen Reddys singing nun in Airport 1975.)

Ms. Simard mines the sisters pious nerdiness for delicious comedy, but really comes into her own when Sister Mary succumbs to her gambling addiction and makes mad love to that machine. No more proof needed that sinning is far more entertaining, and much funnier, than saintliness.",[]

Sign up to receive an email We will inform you when the next Times report on this attempt at a uterus transplant is published.

The first uterus transplant in the United States failed, and the organ was surgically removed on Tuesday, officials at the Cleveland Clinic said on Wednesday.

The recipient, a 26-year-old woman, suddenly developed a serious complication on Tuesday, according to Eileen Sheil, a spokeswoman for the clinic. She did not specify the nature of the complication but said the uterus was being analyzed by pathologists to determine what went wrong.

The transplant was the first of 10 planned by the clinic, in an experimental program meant to enable women without a uterus to become pregnant and give birth. In a statement released Wednesday afternoon, the clinic said it would continue with that effort.

The study, which has been planned to include 10 women, is still ongoing with a commitment to the advancement of medical research to provide an additional option for women and their families, the clinic said.

The failure occurred only a day after the clinic held a news conference to describe what had seemed to be a successful transplant, with remarks from members of the surgical team and a brief appearance by the patient, who asked to be identified only as Lindsey. The transplant, which used a uterus from a woman in her 30s who had died suddenly, was performed on Feb. 24.

In its statement announcing the failure, the clinic said: While this has been difficult for both the patient and the medical team, Lindsey is doing well and recovering.

Lindsey, who was born without a uterus, and her husband, Blake, also released a statement. I just wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude towards all of my doctors. They acted very quickly to ensure my health and safety. Unfortunately I did lose the uterus to complications. However, I am doing okay and appreciate all of your prayers and good thoughts.

Doctors in Sweden have performed nine uterus transplants, resulting in five births.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Why Donald Trump Has Done Worse in Mostly White States,['Toni Monkovic'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Donald Trump has tended to fare worst in states that are mostly white.









That doesnt mean he hasnt had great success in appealing to white Republican primary voters  theres no doubt of that  only that he generally does better in states that have higher percentages of nonwhites, particularly African-Americans.

Mr. Trumps stances on, say, trade and Social Security, can strike a chord with voters. But studies have shown that his bigger appeal is as an authoritarian voice of the voiceless. Part of that has been rallying people  particularly those who havent gone to college  who feel a resentment toward racial, ethnic and religious others.

As Michael Tesler and John Sides wrote for the Monkey Cage at The Washington Post last week: Fifty years of research backs this up. Ethnocentric suspicions of minority groups in general, and attitudes about blacks in particular, influence whites opinions about many issues.

Some social science research suggests that the simple fact that President Obama is black might have contributed to a sense of lost power and resentment among whites, and, of course, Mr. Trump first came to political prominence by questioning whether Mr. Obama was even a citizen.

Photo

An appeal to white identity tends to work better in areas where that identity is felt to be under threat. The South, where Mr. Trump has performed well, has long been known for racially polarized politics.

Race essentially predicts political affiliation there, with blacks lining up for Democrats and whites for Republicans. A state like Mississippi, whose population is around 37 percent black, is an obvious example. If even 25 percent of white Mississippians voted for Democrats, the state could tilt blue  and perhaps elect the states first black governor, or first black senator since Reconstruction.

Democratic strategists dream of a blue North Carolina and Florida, and further in the future, a blue Georgia or Arizona.

But few dream of a blue Mississippi. The numbers have long been locked in. For example, according to the 2012 Mississippi exit polls, 96 percent of blacks voted for President Obama, but 89 percent of whites voted for Mitt Romney, who won by 55 percent to 44 percent.

Political scientists have written about the importance of tipping points in ethnic strife or resentment around the globe. It occurs when one group grows big enough to potentially alter the power hierarchy. Mark Potok, senior fellow for the Southern Poverty Law Center, has said that demographic change in this country is the single most important driver in the growth of hate groups and extremist groups. He wrote last month, Donald Trumps demonizing statements about Latinos and Muslims have electrified the radical right, leading to glowing endorsements from white nationalist leaders such as Jared Taylor and former Klansman David Duke.

Mr. Trumps anti-immigration language lands with force for people who fear the browning of America. Within three or four decades, several reports have indicated, non-Hispanic whites will no longer make up a majority of the United States population. The social psychology researchers Maureen Craig and Jennifer Richeson, working at Northwestern, studied whether people could become more politically conservative if they felt a threat to their status in the racial pecking order.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In their paper, they wrote that their experiments provide striking evidence that perceived group-status threat, triggered by exposure to the majority-minority shift, increases whites endorsement of conservative political ideology and policy positions.

What could change this feeling of anxiety and resentment? In both experiments, they wrote, the addition of a simple paragraph stating that whites are likely to remain at the top of the future racial hierarchy in a majority-minority America eliminated the conservative shift.

Studies have pointed to other correlations:

 Robert Putnam, the Harvard political scientist and author, discovered a decade ago that increased diversity in communities is correlated with distrust between and within ethnic groups. (It was perhaps not what he had hoped to find.)

 Greater racial diversity predicts less of a willingness to build a stronger social safety net: In other words, America would probably have more social spending if it were a whiter nation.

 One of the bigger predictors of support for Mr. Trump is the belief that affirmative action is taking away jobs from whites and handing them to blacks.

 Research by the Vanderbilt political scientists Marc Hetherington and Drew Engelhardt has helped shed light on one of the bigger puzzles of this primary cycle: the success of Mr. Trump among evangelicals. Among white Southern Republicans, evangelicals exhibit higher levels of racial resentment than do Southern Republicans who are not evangelicals, they wrote for The Cook Political Report.

If you set aside Mr. Trumps defeat in Texas because it is Ted Cruzs home state, Mr. Trumps other losses in states have come in mostly white Iowa, Maine, Kansas, Alaska, Minnesota and Oklahoma. Oklahoma, which is also in Mr. Cruzs home region, has the highest percentage of African-Americans among those states, around 8 percent, according to the 2010 census. Blacks make up about 13 percent of the United States population over all. Support for Mr. Trump was also probably limited in some of these states because they held caucuses, which tend to favor Mr. Cruz.

My colleague Nate Cohn has also identified North Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota, Idaho and Hawaii as other unpromising states for Mr. Trump. He narrowly won in Vermont, but the total vote (50 percent) of the establishment candidates Marco Rubio and John Kasich was unusually strong. Also, Colorado would have set up as a perfect state for Mr. Rubio had a contest been held there. Of these states, Nebraska has the highest black population by percentage, at 4.5 percent.

An interesting variation is found in Appalachian states like West Virginia and Kentucky, which tend to have small black populations but are still fertile ground for Mr. Trump. Racial polarization in voting there is relatively high, and its also a region where racially charged web searches are more common. In a Gallup poll this week in which residents of every state were asked if their city or area was a good place to live for racial and ethnic minorities, West Virginia finished last.

A map of voting patterns based on racial polarization suggests that Mr. Trump will not be able to mine as much resentment in the West. The industrial Midwest and Northeast, where memories of strife and white flight in urban areas are not that distant, may offer more opportunities. Immigration concerns were a potent weapon in New Hampshire. Mr. Trumps giant victory in Massachusetts is still something of a mystery, but as one reader said, Dont forget the antibusing protests.

Marc Ambinder, writing for The Daily News, argued that part of the response to all this should be empathy  for working-class whites who have been left behind economically and whose resentment has been exploited politically. Consider the most chilling correlation: that Mr. Trump is faring very well where middle-aged whites are dying fastest.",[]
nytimes.com,2013-05-17 00:00:00,"Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812 at Kazino",['Charles Isherwood'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The clash of armies is not to be heard during Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812, the vibrant, transporting new musical adapted from a potent slice of Tolstoys War and Peace. True, Napoleon is nominally present, presiding with a stern semi-smile over the proceedings from within a copy of a Jacques-Louis David portrait. But the roiling sounds of battle do not intrude on the romantic drama unfolding before us in Dave Malloys freshly imagined pop opera, which opened on Thursday night at a custom-built cabaret called Kazino, in the meatpacking district.









The clash of cutlery, on the other hand, occasionally echoes as Tolstoys tale of love, corruption and fateful meetings swirls like a feverish dream before us, above us, around us. Following its acclaimed, sellout run last fall at Ars Nova, the production has been given a stylish and sumptuous upgrade, and now comes with a full meal attached.

The show is performed in an elaborately appointed salon, with claret-colored velvet draperies and period paintings adorning the walls. Spiky candelabras modeled on the starbursts at the Metropolitan Opera twinkle from above. (Mimi Liens set designs form a crucial part of the mise-en-scene.) The audience sits at tables and banquettes clustered tightly together. Dinner service begins an hour before the performance. (The Broadway-size price tag is $125, but on Broadway you dont get borscht.) For those who truly want to enter into the spirit of the drama, carafes of vodka can be purchased.

Photo

Yes, bottle service has come to Off Broadway. (Where more appropriately than in the meatpacking district?) I suspect it was inevitable: audiences are flocking to productions that dispense entirely with the theaters traditional fourth wall and provide nightclub-style amenities. Punchdrunks Sleep No More, which allows patrons to dawdle for a drink before, during and after the show, remains a hot ticket. (One of its producers is among the presenters of Natasha.) The interactive musical Here Lies Love, at the Public Theater, invites the audience to boogie on down with Imelda Marcos and friends.

But those with anxiety issues surrounding audience participation need not fear for their nerve endings at Mr. Malloys romp, directed with propulsive sweep by Rachel Chavkin. Although the characters may occasionally plop down at a table, and much of the drama unfolds in a narrow alley between the tables, no enforced folk dancing will be required, and no one will offer an arm to pull you into a polonaise.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The close quarters do, however, bring the show an extra charge of excitement, as we are brought into whispering intimacy with the characters as they pursue their fates, happy and otherwise, in the grand houses of 19th-century Moscow. At the center of the story is the blooming young Natasha (a luminous Phillipa Soo), betrothed to the absent Prince Andrey (Blake DeLong), who is away at war, having agreed to heed the wishes of his crotchety father (Mr. DeLong again, in a ludicrously powdered wig) to postpone the wedding for a year.

Bad idea, buddy! At the opera one night Natasha falls under the bewitching, sinister spell of the heedless womanizer Anatole (Lucas Steele, a spiky blade of blond hair lending a slight menace to his boyishly handsome features), brother of the equally amoral Helene (the voluptuous Amber Gray). Frantically working to thwart their cruel machinations are Helenes miserable mensch of a husband, Pierre, played by Mr. Malloy himself; and Natashas loving cousin Sonya (Brittain Ashford).

The relationships may seem complex when thus briskly sketched, but really theres no need to crack open Tolstoys magnum opus before you attend the show. (For those interested, the action involved takes up the last hundred pages or so of the novels second book.) A synopsis is provided, but even if you spill that borscht on the program, Mr. Malloy introduces all the characters and establishes their relationships with humor and economy in the opening number. His lyrical voice is blunt, funny and forthrightly contemporary, as this opening chorale quickly establishes in introducing the principal players:

Helene is a slut

Anatole is hot

Mary is old school

Sonya is good

Natasha is young

And Andrey isnt here.

While the band of eight includes mostly instruments that might be found in a classical ensemble (cello and viola, clarinet and oboe and piano), the music matches the boho-hip flavor of the sometimes slangy lyrics. Its a blend of contemporary styles only slightly inflected by Russian flavors. The numbers range from yearning ballads in the Broadway-beloved manner of the British invasion to folk-flavored songs redolent of early 1970s Joni Mitchell or Hair (of all unlikely musicals). Theres also a thumping rave presided over by Anatole and his henchman, Dolokhov (Ian Lassiter), in which the conductor, Or Matias, plops a big pair of headphones on his ears and starts headbanging away as strobe lights flicker.

Neither the music nor the unrhymed lyrics reach any great heights of intricacy or sophistication. But the score matches the dynamics of the story line precisely, pausing for reflection during the quiet interludes in which Natasha searches desperately to sort out the truths of her heart, then revving up again as Anatole and Dolokhov rouse themselves into a wicked lather as they plot the lovers elopement. And while the sung-through nature of the score often requires the characters to literally narrate their actions and feelings even as they are experiencing them, the actors pour themselves into these roles with an intensity that erases any distance such a device might suggest.

Natasha, played by Ms. Soo with a soft ardency thats continually affecting, serenades the winter moon as she sings of her love for the absent Andrey. Later the new affection convulsing her spirit is plainly legible in the rounded contours of Ms. Soos face as she sings with awed passion of her sudden attachment to Anatole. Another touching song, featuring one of Mr. Malloys most fetching melodies, finds Ms. Ashfords Sonya vowing to save her beloved cousin from her own folly, even if it means betraying her confidence.

The elusive nature of earthly happiness is a major theme in Tolstoys novel, and I wish wed been allowed to spend some more time exploring the spiritual quest of the troubled, bearish Pierre, one of the most richly moving characters in fiction. Mr. Malloy imbues him with a rumpled delicacy of feeling thats just right.

But when that comet streaks through the sky at the hushed climax of the show, Pierre experiences an epiphany that had my heart leaping into my throat, as he sang with humble joy of the mysterious workings of human affections. Having come to realize that his abiding love for Natasha has grown even richer, Pierre is wonder-struck at the discovery that compassion for anothers suffering can bring us a pleasure as profound as the fulfillment of our own greatest desires.",[]

nytimes.com,2014-12-31 00:00:00,The surfer dude who rebuilt the Harvard Art Museums,[],"Tom Lentz, the director of the Harvard Art Museums, is seen in a gallery at the institutions Arthur M. Sackler Museum featuring Buddhist sculptures. (Damian Strohmeyer/For The Washington Post)

When Tom Lentz interviewed for the top job at the Harvard Art Museums back in 2003, the hiring committee received a strange warning. The soft-spoken director of the Smithsonian Institutions international art museums division could come across as laid-back, almost too calm.

I was told he seemed like a cool surfer dude, says Steven Hyman, then Harvards provost. I dont actually know what a cool surfer dude really behaves like.

What Hyman cared about more was the task in front of that new director. The Harvard Art Museums were in desperate need of an overhaul. Ceilings leaked, the plumbing was dangerously outdated and curators, trying to protect artworks without proper climate control, found themselves shuffling floor fans through galleries.

Harvard hired Lentz, and this fall, after an extensive renovation and expansion project that cost more than $350 million, the Harvard Art Museums reopened to the public.

On a recent weekday, Lentz, sitting in a conference room outside his office, did not sound like he was in the midst of a victory lap. Instead, he offered a confession. After all the time and money, after sitting on countless committees and giving more than 100 tours, he wouldnt mind chatting about something else.

Were tired of talking about it because weve talked about it for such a long time, Lentz says. And part of the exhaustion is the fact that were doing this at Harvard. Which is a place full of a lot of bright, ambitious people. There is no shortage of ideas.

Thats a polite way of saying that at Harvard, not only does everybody have an idea, but those ideas usually are better than yours. Or, at least, thats what they think. Which leads to more studies and debates and estimates. And then the next idea comes along. The wheels keep spinning.

Add to this the construction challenges when your institution is three museums.

The Fogg Museum, at its current site since 1927, needed renovations, but its historic facade had to be preserved. The Busch-Reisinger Museum, relocated to the backside of the Fogg in 1991, was riddled with structural problems and had to come down. The Arthur M. Sackler Museum, which opened in 1985 to house largely Asian art, was across the street.

How complicated was the project? The first report stating that the Fogg needed to be renovated came out in 1956. Directors came, directors left. The project remained unrealized, until Lentz arrived.

That is not to say that everyone appreciated his focus, with some now-former curators grumbling about the emphasis on fundraising. But with its completion in November, Harvard finally has a proper place to display its prized collection of more than 250,000 objects, which range from Roman artifacts to Degas, Picasso and Kiki Smith.

The project did suck up a lot of resources that might have otherwise gone to curatorial projects, says William Robinson, the museums longtime and soon-to-retire curator of drawings. But it had to be done. We would not have been reaccredited had we not fixed that building.

The man who led the way is Lentz, 63, a wiry figure with gray hair and a sense of humor as dry as desert sand. He is no museum-world MacArthur, rejecting what he calls the heroic model of a museum leader and takes pride in noting that he organized dozens of study groups during the planning and construction process.

Lentz talks constantly about collaboration, mentioning how he has appreciated working with the directors of other Harvard museums during the project and is proud to have incorporated works from their collections into galleries. He also doesnt want to take credit for the project.

During a recent interview, Lentz walked a reporter to an office where deputy director Maureen Donovan and chief curator Debi Kao were meeting. They stood by, slightly awkwardly, as he talked about how this project could not have been done without them.

Donovan, in an interview later in the afternoon, disagreed.

He was the first director who stopped everybody in their tracks when he came here and said, We have a plan and really galvanized the staff behind that thinking, she says. Nobody else had really done that before.

Lentz, the second of seven children, grew up in Los Angeles, the son of an RCA executive and a homemaker. The Lentz family moved around, to Houston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Indianapolis and then back to Los Angeles.

That rambling didnt stop after high school. Lentz attended the University of Arizona for two years, then transferred to Claremont Mens College (now Claremont McKenna), where he earned his art history degree in 1976.

He took time off while studying, traveling around the Middle East and, after graduation, washing dishes at an Indian restaurant and painting houses.

Eventually, Lentz enrolled at the University of California at Berkeley, and earned a masters degree in Near Eastern studies. It was there that Katharina Otto-Dorn, the German-born art historian, told Lentz that if he wanted to seriously study Islamic art, he needed to head east. Lentz earned his doctoral degree from Harvard in 1985.

Though he would leave town  spending the next two decades in curatorial and administrative jobs at the Rhode Island School of Design, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Smithsonian  Lentzs experience in Cambridge would be a key factor in his ability to pull off the Harvard project.

You were getting somebody for whom the map of Harvard is not going to be a new one, but rather a refresher, says Glenn Lowry, the director of the Museum of Modern Art and a colleague of Lentzs at the Smithsonian during the 1980s. He understood the relationship of the museum to the faculty, the faculty to each other. He knew how to navigate that terrain because its the terrain he grew up with.

Thats not to say the path to this falls opening was always smooth.

After his arrival at Harvard, Lentz tried to build a museum several miles from the Harvard campus on land the university owned in neighboring Allston. That idea collapsed.

Next, he turned his attention to the museums campus on Quincy Street. There was the issue of how to bring three museums under one roof. There also were the personalities to deal with.

Hyman remembers a discussion with Jeremy Knowles, Harvards longtime dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, who died in 2008.

Steven, we should not be in the art museum business, he recalls Knowles telling him.

The small problem, Hyman says today, is that we had already collected 250,000 objects of priceless art. So we were already in the business.

Lentz also had to contend with his own staff. Some of the museums curators disagreed with his approach.

He was Ahab with the white whale, and the white whale was getting this building done and keeping it within budget and keeping the Harvard administration happy, says one of the curators, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because, he says, he wants to maintain a relationship with the art museums.

The final project would take all three museums  the Fogg, the Busch-Reisinger and the Sackler  and put them under a new glass roof designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano. The project also would incorporate massive study centers, meant to allow students access to the tens of thousands of works not on display and fulfill Harvards mission as the countrys leading teaching museum.

In the end, Hyman says, the cool surfer dude side of Lentz proved key to finishing the job.

He was naturally calm, and that served him well, Hyman says. There were so many ups and downs in this project, and the fundraising and the financial meltdown. Im sure that, on the side, he had to have been emotionally stressed. But he didnt show it. And in some ways, that allowed him to succeed in the face of what seemed like an endless strain of obstacles.

Earlier this month, Lentz offered yet another tour of the completed museum building. He showed off the 17th-century Dutch gallery and talked about how much he appreciated the way the works by Rubens, Rembrandt and van Dyck were hung, given space and not crammed frame-to-frame. He walked through the spacious, brightly lit central courtyard, now a gathering spot open to the public for free.

Then he entered the museums impressive collection of 20th-century German works. A stunning pear tree by Klimt. A group of Max Beckmanns. Franz von Stucks curvaceous Wounded Amazon.

Turning right, Lentz got to Room 1510.

It is the edge of the building  a glass-walled space that Piano calls a winter garden. There are five small bronze sculptures here, but the real treat is the view. The neighboring Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts is the only Le Corbusier building in the United States.

Its an overcast day, and rain gathers in beads on a beam on the edge of the building. Outside, on the concrete ramp twisting from the Carpenter Center to one of the museums new entrances, a man walks his dog.

It is here, in this tiny pocket gallery, that Lentz sits on a bench and mentions a recent visit to the Louvre.

I was utterly exhausted afterward, he says. It was literally like going to Grand Central station.

Thats all he says for a minute, as the rain drops onto the lawn below.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE  I found this one very difficult for the day of the week, possibly because I approached it nonchalantly and filled in several words incorrectly, including a theme answer, then had to right my wrongs to finish.

When I solve I almost always scan once for gimmes before settling in. Im not sure if this is the most efficient approach but its reflexive, and Im always pleased when I find some substantial words that seem to fit the bill. For this puzzle, three of these were BURNOUT for 20 across, fatigue; ABOUTFACE for 29 down, complete reversal; and JELLYFISH for 25 across, translucent sea creature that drifts with the current, which was a mighty specific clue  one that I would have looked sideways at on Friday or Saturday, but blithely took at face value here.

I then went up to the northeast corner (Im a lefty  maybe thats why  habit again) and got far enough to replace BURNOUT with TIRE OUT, and figured out BOISE, where you need an ID (for Idaho) to get your mail, one of a few clever wordplays in this puzzle. I even worked west and figured out NATURE PRESERVES, which was enough to give me the cute theme. But then I got stuck on that JELLYFISH for a long time. Maybe Im stubborn, maybe Ive never in my life heard of MOON JELLY; but I confess that I sent a few brain cells back to my long-term memory to see if there could possibly be any other chipmunks than Theodore, Simon and ALVIN, because I was trying to smush JUKE in for a Karaoke need and keep ABOUT FACE.

Soon enough, though, that straightened itself out. I thought that a lot of the clues and answers in this puzzle were solidly beyond beginner-level. VOLTEFACE obviously stopped me for a bit; UPBRAIDED, PILASTERS, IRATER and ABBESS are all classic, more challenging fill.

It was easy to find chipmunks singing slow jams but that just didnt seem fair.

nytimes.com,2015-12-08 00:00:00,Review: David Bowie Songs and a Familiar Alien in Lazarus,['Ben Brantley'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Ice-cold bolts of ecstasy shoot like novas through the glamorous muddle and murk of Lazarus, the great-sounding, great-looking and mind-numbing new musical built around songs by David Bowie. These transfixing moments occur when Mr. Bowie feels most palpably present  that is, when one of the shows carefully stylized performers delivers a distinctly Bowie number in a distinctly Bowie style.









Lest I create a stampede on New York Theater Workshop, where Lazarus (which is largely sold out) opened on Monday night, let me add quickly that Mr. Bowie himself does not appear in the flesh in this sci-fi pageant of extraterrestrial angst, which has been staged by Ivo van Hove, the incredibly (and justifiably) fashionable director. But then, much of Mr. Bowies extraordinary longevity as a rock god has to do with the feeling that he has never really been with us in the flesh.

More than any of his peers or imitators, Mr. Bowie, an international star since the early 1970s, has always come across as his own spectral avatar, in a series of beguilingly designed alter egos who are both there and not there. Even in the midst of white-hot stage spectacle, his affect has been one of cool disassociation, matched by songs that are rhapsodies of alienation; cries of solitary pain turn into our collective pleasure, and we citizens of an anomic world swoon and think, We are David Bowie.

Photo

Except that we arent as famous. Look up here, Im in heaven, go the lyrics to the title song, one of several new numbers for the show by Mr. Bowie. Ive got scars that cant be seen./Ive got drama cant be stolen./Everybody knows me now.

Those words are intoned, exquisitely, by Michael C. Hall, in what might be described as a state of glazed desperation. Mr. Hall  best known as the television character Dexter, the serial killer youd most like to have a beer with  is portraying Thomas Newton, a familiar name to Bowie fans.

Newton, as hes usually called, is the title character in The Man Who Fell to Earth, the 1976 Nicolas Roeg movie starring Mr. Bowie  in a role he was born to play  as a fish-out-of-water alien, who has arrived among us in search of salvation for his dehydrated planet. Spoiler: He fails in his quest, but he survives.

Lazarus is a sequel to that film, or rather (officially) to the 1963 novel by Walter Tevis that inspired it. It is 40 years since we last saw Newton, then a bereft, alcoholic and eternally stranded creature. In the meantime, it seems, he hasnt aged a day (you have to envy those E.T. genes), and hes as rich as Croesus. But he exists in a stale time warp in a naked Manhattan penthouse, where he subsists on gin and Twinkies amid memories of his outer space family and of Mary Lou, the earthling who loved and left him.

He is, as described by Elly (a sinuous Cristin Milioti), whom he has just hired as his personal assistant, sorta sad, sorta unknowable in the way that you imagine rich, reclusive, eccentric men to be. Ellys new job puts a serious strain on her marriage to Zach (Bobby Moreno), since she finds herself not only falling in love with Newton but also turning into the late, lamented, blue-haired Mary Lou. Talk about ch-ch-ch-changes.

At the same time, Newton is visited by a fellow businessman (Charlie Pollock) and an otherworldly child (a radiant Sophia Anne Caruso) who knows all about him and promises to help him return to his little house in the stars. Shes as improbably innocent as a waif out of Dickens (or from the final scene of La Dolce Vita). But the hope she brings seems destined to be derailed by the sinister Valentine (Michael Esper, embodying Mr. Bowies cabaret side), a knife-wielding man in black.

Photo

This synopsis is a crude simplification, since identities are highly fluid in Lazarus. The script, by Mr. Bowie and Mr. Walsh (the fine outre Irish playwright who did the Tony-winning book for the musical Once), switches between passages of flat-footed, literal-minded exposition and cryptic collegiate dialogue in which its suggested that what youre seeing is only a Newton-spun illusion.

Listening to the characters talk, your response is likely to be either an irritated Oh, please, or a dumbfounded Huh? But then, the music (performed by a ravishing-sounding band, divided from the stage by a transparent wall) starts up. So do a host of visual effects that mirror and mock the people singing or suggest that they (and you) have tumbled into a three-dimensional television set that is perpetually changing channels.

A backup team of performers shows up in various guises, including Geisha girls, phantom teenagers and jaded nightclubbers. Mr. Hall, Ms. Milioti, Mr. Esper and Ms. Caruso  who all have more full-bodied voices than Mr. Bowie does  nonetheless capture the Bowie inflections and phrasing, while striking gorgeously gnarled and introverted poses, choreographed by Annie-B Parson. Whether the song is vintage Bowie (Changes, Absolute Beginners, The Man Who Sold the World) or one of the new pieces (loved the self-lacerating Killing a Little Time), you usually feel youve ascended to a special tier of heaven, one produced by MTV.

The voyage is overseen by Mr. van Hove, who is currently represented on Broadway by his stunning revival of Arthur Millers A View From the Bridge (with his take on Millers The Crucible scheduled for next year). Mr. van Hoves signature style  skeletal, shimmering and ominous  is as distinctive as Mr. Bowies, and in many ways, a perfect match for it.

Though no one is likely to describe Mr. Bowie as a minimalist, these artists share a vision of universal solitude and dislocation. In Lazarus, Mr. van Hove realizes that sensibility with the expert assistance of his longtime collaborators Jan Versweyveld (set and lighting design), An DHuys (costumes) and Tal Yarden (video design).

These elements often meld exactly as they should, which means that they create a haunting impression of dividedness, of life as a perplexing jumble of puzzle pieces that can never be fully assembled. Unfortunately, that sense of dislocation extends more clumsily to the relation of the script to the songs. The spoken story line, when its not opaque, brings to mind a young adult novel of the supernatural, featuring restless and winsome spirits longing to be put to rest.

Although Mr. Hall, a fabulous alien in chief, has mastered a perfect semi-anesthetized style of speech, the rest of the cast members dont always sound convinced by what they are required to say. You become impatient for the characters to stop talking and start singing again. When they do, their words and music require no labored annotations  and transport us to that lonely planet where all of us aliens at least sometimes feel we live.

On Thursday, we challenged Well readers to figure out the case of a 36-year-old man with a 20-year history of migrating joint pains along with other strange symptoms. Nearly 300 of you offered thoughtful suggestions of what he might have had. And one out of 10 of you were spot on.

The correct diagnosis is:

Ehlers Danlos syndrome

The first reader to correctly make this diagnosis was Bryley Williams, of New York City. She told me she knows nothing about medicine but found the answer on the Internet by investigating noninflammatory causes of joint pain and pneumothorax. All of the winners of this contest are extraordinary, but I think Ms. Williams may take the prize. She is 15 years old, a freshman in high school in New York City. Well done, Ms. Williams! Maybe you should consider a career in medicine once you graduate.

The Diagnosis

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or EDS, is a group of inherited disorders that affect the bodys connective tissues  the skin, muscles, tendons and ligaments that hold us together. Since the 1990s, the disease has been divided into six main types, depending on which connective tissues are most affected. Based on the gene study done in this patient, he was given a diagnosis of the least severe and most common variety, which primarily causes hypermobility of the joints as well as skin that is easily damaged and scars badly. EDS was probably recognized as early as 400 B.C., when Hippocrates noted that the nomads and Scythians had lax joints and multiple scars. This disorder came to more modern medical attention in the 17th century when, at a medical presentation in Holland, a Spanish sailor by the name of George Albes exhibited his remarkable ability to stretch the skin on his chest out an arms length. The first complete description of the condition was given by a Russian physician, Dr. A. N. Chernogubov, at the end of the 19th century. He presented a 17-year-old boy who suffered from recurrent joint dislocations and easily stretched and fragile skin. The boy had many scars resulting from minor injuries, because these patients do not heal normally. Based on these observations, Dr. Chernogubov predicted that the clinical manifestations were caused by an abnormality of the connective tissues. That report did not come to the notice of Western Europe for many years. So while the disorder still carries Chernogubovs name in Russia, in most places it referred to as EDS, after the two physicians who first characterized the disorder in Paris decades later: Dr. Edvard Ehlers and Dr. Henri-Alexandre Danlos.

How the Diagnosis Was Made

The patient, a 36-year-old man with a 20-year history of migrating joint pain, had been to dozens of doctors  internists, orthopedic surgeons, rheumatologists. All had examined him and seen nothing. Indeed, his last rheumatologist kept saying that she wanted to believe that he had this much pain but that she couldnt find anything physical to cause it. One orthopedist had asked him if his skin was particularly stretchy or if he was very flexible  obviously thinking of a diagnosis like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but the patient said no. He didnt think he was particularly flexible or that his skin was unusually stretchy. Later, once he had the diagnosis, he showed one of his doctors how he could move his thumb, and the doctor told him that he was popping it in and out of joint. And the geneticist told him that his skin was stretchy enough to fit the diagnostic criteria. Still, it all seemed normal to him. Not extraordinary in any way. Still, after 20 years of searching, the patient was finally willing to accept that he was just more prone to getting these pains. And he began keeping a list of the types of exercises or activities that seemed most likely to trigger the episodes of joint pain. His wife was unwilling to give up. She continued to search the Internet for answers.

Like Son, Like Father?

The final clue came not from the mans doctor but from his sons. The boy, age 11, went to see his pediatrician, Dr. Renee Brand, for his annual physical exam. He was tall and slender, like his father. He had a colt-like awkwardness about him, with arms and legs that looked just a bit too long to be well managed. And he had a stooped posture, as if he spent too much time gazing into a smartphone he didnt even have. Could he sit up completely straight? Dr. Brand asked. He couldnt, though he tried. Later the doctor asked him to bend over so that she could check his spine for scoliosis. He immediately flopped down, his chest almost touching his knees and his hands lying flat on the floor in front of him. Dr. Brand was surprised by this remarkable degree of flexibility. When the boy righted himself, she asked him to straighten his legs as far as they would go. When he did, his knees went well past straight, so that his legs bowed backward. Straightening his elbows produced a similar curve. I think maybe you should take him to see an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Brand suggested to the boys mother. Two weeks later the mom called Dr. Brand with a report. Shed taken the boy to see the surgeo,n and he had in turn recommended that she take him to see a geneticist. I thought so, replied Dr. Brand with satisfaction. Seeing how remarkably flexible the young man was, and how hard it was for him to stand up straight, Dr. Brand thought the boy might have a disorder known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

Getting a Diagnosis

After making the appointment with the geneticist, the boys mother sat down at the computer to read up on Ehlers-Danlos. As she read through the descriptions, she could definitely recognize her son. But in those pages she also recognized her husband. Joint pain, check; pneumothorax, check; osteoporosis, check; scoliosis, check. Ultimately this inherited disease was diagnosed in both father and son. Theres no cure for EDS, but its important to know that you have it. The son sees a cardiologist every couple of years, since EDS can lead to problems with heart valves and vessels. He was found to be at risk for a dangerous stretching of his aorta that, without repair, could lead to rupture. And both father and son now understand which exercises are going to be a problem for them  possibly causing joint dislocations or other musculoskeletal injuries.

PARIS  Paris Fashion Week went out with a bang on Tuesday, thanks to a scattering of glittering parties held on the penultimate night of the calendar. Hordes of high-heeled  if weary  industry revelers prepared their Instagram filters, determined to document the end of the season in style.

Days after announcing that revenues had topped $1 billion last year, Valentino hosted an after-party titled Its Happening at the Hotel Salomon de Rothschild, and Alessandra Ambrosio and Dakota Fanning came to let down their hair.

The British fashion biannual AnOther Magazine threw itself a 15th anniversary bash at the Chanel couture salon on the Rue Cambon, and Pharrell Williams, Kendall Jenner and the K-Pop singer G-Dragon stood by to watch Karl Lagerfeld  cover star of the latest issue  sing Happy Birthday alongside his young godson Hudson Kroenig and a gigantic tiered cake. And over in the 10th Arrondissement, Kenzo transformed a former cabaret club-turned-concert hall into a lush and leafy Champagne and ice cream-fueled rave scene, to toast a Disney collaboration related to the coming movie version of The Jungle Book.

Meanwhile, just south of the Arc de Triomphe, a constellation of women in scarlet  models to be precise  descended upon a private mansion for the LOreal Red Obsession party. The Formula One racing champion Lewis Hamilton, now a near-ubiquitous presence on the fashion circuit, looked like all his Christmases had come at once as he snapped selfies with the models Barbara Palvin and Irina Shayk on the red carpet. A Balmain-clad Eva Longoria posed with the president of LOreal, self-consciously standing a good head-and-shoulders below everyone around her despite towering five-inch heels.

I feel like a Power Ranger, announced Lara Stone with a grin, looking hot  in all senses of the word  in a red rubber PVC jumpsuit. Ive always wanted to be a superhero and will reveal my powers to you later with some magic moves.

Two rooms over, Karlie Kloss and Doutzen Kroes dutifully tried to get the party started in the corner on an otherwise deserted dance floor, joined at one stage by the rapper Chris Brown to the bemusement of several noncelebrity onlookers.

Later, Francois-Henri Pinault, chief executive of the luxury group Kering, arrived with Bradley Cooper, the actor and beau of Ms. Shayk, who was holding court in a plunging Dior minidress. The men, however, soon retreated into a deep conversation with Mr. Hamilton for much of the night, and Ms. Shayk explained that despite the curtain falling on fashion week, her work was far from over.

I cant go too wild tonight. I still have to walk the Miu Miu show tomorrow and then its back to New York for more work, work, work  I feel like I am always working, she said, a tuxedo jacket draped over her shoulders.

nytimes.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,Annie Dillards Impossible Pages,['Introduction Sam Anderson'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Its unclear what to call Annie Dillard, where to shelve her. Over more than 40 years, she has been, sometimes all at once, a poet, essayist, novelist, humorist, naturalist, critic, theologian, collagist and full-throated singer of mystic incantations. Instead of being any particular kind of writer, she is, flagrantly, a consciousness  an abstract, all-encompassing energy field that inhabits a given piece of writing the way sunlight clings to a rock: delicately but with absolute force, always leaving a shadow behind. This is an essential part of what it means to be human, this shifting between the transcendent self and the contingent world, the ecstasy and the dental bill. We all do some version of it, all the time. But Dillard does it more insistently. This month, she publishes The Abundance: Narrative Essays Old and New, a collection of pieces that spans her entire variegated career.

Dillard began publishing books in 1974. Tickets for a Prayer Wheel, a small collection of poems, was followed immediately by Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, a long nonfictional account of her experience embedding, Thoreau-style, for a year of close observation of the titular waterway in Virginia. Pilgrim won the Pulitzer Prize and unleashed upon the world Dillards radical style: prose right on the border of poetry, dense with dazzling effects  strong metaphors, heavy rhythms, bold verbs, sudden parables, outlandish facts harvested from the darkest corners of the library. From the start, this has been Dillards mission: to crowbar surprise, sentence by sentence, into all the tiny gaps of our ordinary experience. Water turtles smooth as beans were gliding down the current in a series of easy, weightless push-offs as men bound on the moon, she writes in Pilgrim. A pile of burned books flaked in my hand like pieces of pie. In Dillards writing, strange things are constantly becoming familiar, and vice versa. (Like mushrooms and engines, they didnt have hands, she writes of nuns.) Above all, Dillard refuses to fall into traditional expository rhythms, to calm down, to be normal, to proceed with caution. She feels driven, always, to summon revelations out of nothing  to call for fireworks, with only a ballpoint pen.









You will find, in the following pages, a small but rare bloom of Annie Dillards fireworks: three early essays, all short and characteristically strange, all appearing for the first time in this form. They have been revised multiple times over multiple decades, because Dillard is always revising, and then re-revising. When your project is to articulate all the intricately nested subtleties of a human mind in contact with the ever-changing world, your work, by definition, will never stop.

Two of these essays (Recalling Niels Bohr and Lonesome, With Snails) revolve around jokes  a favorite subject of Dillards. In one, the joke is that a fireplace, paradoxically, cools a room. In the other, a snail is described, absurdly, as short. Thats it. Those are the jokes. They are not, by normal joke-telling standards, particularly good; they are run-of-the-mill, everyday, lukewarm witticisms. But such everydayness serves Dillards purposes exactly. We dont need great writing to tell us that obviously amazing things are amazing, just as we dont need high-powered telescopes to tell us that the sun is warm. What we need from great writing, most urgently, is an understanding that the mundane itself  snails, fireplaces, shrubs, pebbles, socks, minor witticisms  is secretly amazing.

Poetry and jokes are each, as William Carlos Williams said of the former, machines made out of words, and Dillard is a highly trained mechanic. In An American Childhood, her classic memoir of growing up in Pittsburgh, Dillard describes life with her parents as a long and rigorous apprenticeship of wisecracking. Her description of the compressed power of a joke (A few words suggested a complete story and a wealth of feelings) applies equally well to the compressed power of poetry. Each form emphasizes the sudden turn, the improbable connection. Dillards brand of neo-Transcendentalist prose-poetry is, in this light, a distant cousin of stand-up comedy: a risky solo performance that depends, to a large extent, on the unusual motions of a mind, as rendered in a deliberately heightened style, with the goal of ecstatic density.

And so, in Dillards joke essays, Thoreau and Colette and Heisenberg and Niels Bohr commingle with an unnamed Tennessee mountain hermit who has invented the typewriter 50 years too late; snails feet, upon being touched, recoil, curling, like tickled lips. This is sit-down stand-up, to be consumed by a silent audience of one.

The second essay here, Utah, is less like a joke than a dream: a surreal flight of free-associative fancy. Dillard sees (or does not see) windshield wipers in the desert, clacking dry as hoofbeats over the glass and hurling themselves from side to side like dancers. She sees (or does not see) Native Americans the size of ants. But then, as she says near the end of the essay: Truth interests me less than contact.

One of these essays ends, out of nowhere, with a brief but bold artistic manifesto. Possible books abound; Id rather write an impossible page. This might help to explain why Dillard has written less and less over the years. There will always be the lure of the merely possible, and very few writers have the discipline to stay away.

I am beginning to bore myself with the following joke about the fireplace. Since it doesnt draw well, I open the door a crack, which circulates air through the room and up the chimney. This cools the room. I say Im going to get another couple cords of wood this summer for air-conditioning. I have not noticed that the innocent islanders in the captive audience on the receiving end of this little pleasantry are rushing it into print, but I have just found it in Werner of-all-people Heisenberg, in Physics and Beyond. One cannot be too careful of ones reading.

Heisenberg attributes the first remarking of this remark, quite correctly, to Niels Bohr (who loved paradoxical formulations)  for, although this might have been another of those many instances of simultaneous discovery by independent researchers which confound lay thinkers, but at which casehardened science historians merely shrug, it is, alas, not. The intervening decades are too embarrassingly long.

My belated discovery that fire cools is like the famous case of the Tennessee mountain hermit who called a newspaper reporter to his shack because he had, in the 1930s, invented the typewriter. (The typewriter had been invented in ever-improved forms since 1867 and was in common use by 1900.) This mans was an enormous, loom-size construction with a keyboard like a pianos, whose keys one depressed either by two slammed fists or by a wood-splitters maul. But that is another tale. Niels Bohr, according to Heisenberg, claimed that the fireplace had been especially put in as a cooling device. Surely now this joke is well wrung.

Werner Heisenbergs Physics and Beyond disappoints me. He is merely filling in the inches. He knows the material in this book cold  too cold. It is far behind him, not only in years, but in his thinking and, one hopes, in his sense of what writing is. But it is a book. People read books. If you have something to say, write a book. Thoreaus Kathmandu principle, the Colette principle (Break of Day as diary), still holds: You can write anything, anything at all, if youre honest, because we are each as bizarre and foreign to one another as the news from Kathmandu (as Colettes life was to me).

On the other hand. Writing is too hard to waste on the weirdness of your daily life, or at least on mine. I love to sock the reader into some odd time and place and let him breathe there and love it, and love the world for having such a place  and then to call for fireworks there with only a ballpoint pen. Possible books abound; Id rather write an impossible page.

Argument is penny-ante play, or talk with tea. It is the literary, pace Julia A. Moore (the sweet singer of Michigan), that is a work very difficult to do. Arguing draws a line linking corridors through chaos with reason. Art, by contrast, is the whole ball of wax  a system, coherent, chopped out from chaos and held.

Two. | Utah

August: Im trying to float this Plymouth over State Route 740. There has been nine years drought in this spot, and the canyons are cracking like pods. The heat heaves from the asphalt: No wonder the roadrunner runs. Show that bird cool grass and hell loll till kingdom come.

A truck comes along trailing a travois of dust, a Ford pickup, and the fellows got his windshield wipers on. Some drunk, I think; theres not a cloud. Next thing, an old Mustang rounds the bend, robed in dirt, full of dogs, and the wipers are on, the wipers are on, clacking dry as hoofbeats over the glass. The suns burned my eyes, I think; its a whiteout, heat exhaustion, delirium. I pass a Chevy pickup, meet a 58 Olds, and everythings normal; then here comes some young guy with a Pinto, and the wipers are on, hurling themselves from side to side like dancers.

That night in a motel in Moab I heard the story. Its a fad now, the last few years, with the local Native Americans. They flick on the windshield wipers when the land needs rain. Like a prayer wheel! I was amazed! You should have told me.

Actually, I was in line at the light on Peters Creek Road, coming back from the liquor store, clear day, and the lady in front of me had her wipers on. Just cleaning her windshield with water shot up from her car. Thats all. Believe what you will; take what you want.

Theres a May drought on. All day yesterday I followed Tinker Creek to its source. I drove north to the first place the creek cuts under a road, parked by a cedar and headed upstream, up the mountain, up under the flowering dogwood and into the laurel and pines. Early in the afternoon, I ate lunch. The creek bed narrowed, blackened and emptied. I climbed on stones. Soon I straddled the creek, and then it died, or was born, at a patch of sourgrass in a strip of sunlight torn by a windthrown oak. A rock marked the source, a chip of granite shoulder; I threw it aside and crouched.

There, under the granite, was a tiny traveling tribe of Native Americans, perfectly formed. They emerged, stuck with clumps of clay, from the right side of the red hole, brushed themselves off and filed to the left side, where they pried the earth apart and scrambled in. Their dogs ran alongside, barking minutely; their travois poles, slung from ponies, etched faint parallels in the ground. The adults kept catching their hair in grass roots coming and going. Streamers hung from their armbands, lodge poles and parfleche bags. Several women wore dresses that rattled from deer hooves sewn in pairs to hems. One woman  in this heat!  had wound fringed doeskin leggings over her calves. Over her back fell a sunbleached, hairless, elkskin robe.

I pressed my ear hard to the ground to catch their words. Wrakan, I heard in one song, repeated in a whining chorus  a word which I believe is Crow for water, but which in modern usage can also mean eel.

What I want, what any of us wants, doesnt, apparently, matter. Our daily rain-bread, our nightly salt-rising. I stuck a cedar bough under your windshield wiper upright, like a feather in a headband, in a hatband, like a feather in a mirror frame, flame. I have barely spit to lick a finger, barely a finger to stick upright for wind. Truth interests me less than contact.

My eyes need wiping; Ill wash the windows with whisky. Ill seed the clouds. I run roads, seeking sweetgrass or sour. I take off shoes; I run roads, clattering on split hooves. I bed down in laurel, leaving the faintest of tracks, till kingdom come.

Three. | Lonesome, With Snails

My best friends are two land snails. I feel very close to them sometimes; we each share all that we have, all that we know and are. They slide around slowly, up the mantelpiece and down. I sit or pace in my rooms, agitated, picking up and putting down a saxophone, changing my shirt, hefting by turns a china lamp, a leather pouch, trying to joke with the snails. One is tannish; one is yellowish.

They differ  the yellowish one is more. . . . Oh, if they were very different, if one were, say, a musician, wry, and one a muscular philosopher, say, what society I would enjoy! For the plain fact is, if you insist upon it, that they are much alike. So much alike that for most purposes, an outside observer, and even, to be perfectly frank, myself, would have to call them identical, more or less. Quiet.

After I have spent some long time absorbed with the snails and their ways, occasionally, or, in fact, almost always, I am struck by the incongruity of the picture we present. I am, after all, a human being, and, as such, almost six feet tall, give or take a few inches. I line up the snails on my palm and inspect their ranks. I carry them to my eye, while one snail or the other retracts and protrudes first one feeler, then another. I wait until all four of the knobby bulbs on their feeler tips are fully extruded and plump, until they are well forward, supplied with a dark drop of blood, and calm . . . and then I see myself suddenly and think, I treat my friends too curiously, too curiously for words! I put the snails under the philodendron, disgusted, and leave, walk to the newsstand, hail and greet the newsstand owner behind the counter with his wondering, joyous expression; and buy the foulest cigars at any price and carry a dozen to my rooms, triumphant.

Or I say to the snails, Friends, children, illiterates, you imbecilic nubs (and I stroke or pinch the furls of their feet, which recoil, curling, like tickled lips), The trouble with you, the ridiculous, ludicrous thing about both of you, is: You are too short.

Short! Look at them! It is unheard-of to be so short! Friends are friends, and I love these two on their merits and idiosyncrasies quite apart from their positions as my sole and best friends, and quite apart from the figures they cut  just as you love your friends, I am sure. But their size, once I notice it, strains my credulity.

Once this notion takes possession of me, as it has, I confess, now, the inappropriateness of the snails height, which at first seems so marvelously comical, takes on a lunatic air, the smack of a cosmic incongruity. It is an anomaly so endlessly comical that the very length of its humor pierces the bounds of the mind and touches the rim of mystery itself. It is too much to think about, and far too much to explain, that these snails are so impossibly short.

Sometimes in consequence I have taken a kettle from the fire and thrown it through a window. Sometimes, I jump on my own foot, I bite my finger, I run out and break a framed painting over the skull of a pedestrian (once); I throw things; I do, actually, love to throw many things. There is much I love. Because the world is so astonishing, the snails  to take just one of the many possible examples  are so short, and it is all too great for me to think about alone. Or at all.

On many fine mornings I do not concern myself overmuch with the mystery. And by controlling the depth of my thinking carefully, I permit myself a little joke.

Good morning, I say to each snail in turn: to the tannish one looking dead on the hearth, slowly turning her gelatinous head; to the half-dead yellowish one who rides a trail of slime up a window like Botticellis Venus afloat on a frilly foot  Good morning . . .  I say, narrowing my eyes, Shortie.

And a good morning it may be. Many are.",[]

On a gray Wednesday afternoon in Southeast Portland, Ore., someone flicked on the lights in Tango Berretin, a dance studio devoted entirely to Argentine tango. Alex Krebs, the owner, teacher and acclaimed dancer, pressed play on traditional music from the 1930s and 1940s, as students drifted in, tossing aside street shoes for strappy stilettos. Against a backdrop of tango sheet music on the walls, the dancers didnt wait for a formal invitation to the timeworn hardwood floor. One look with sustained eye contact (cabeceo) was a mutual agreement to dance. Within moments of arrival, dancers were locked in a cheek-to-cheek embrace, gliding to the music.









Tango took off in Portland in the late 1990s. The city is now a renowned destination for Argentine tango in North America, attracting dancers from around the globe with two annual festivals (Portland Tango Festival in October and ValenTango last month) and a thriving social dance scene.

The survival of ballrooms from their heyday in the 1920s has been central to the continued growth of tango in Portland, providing affordable and central venues for weekly milongas (tango social dances). In recent years, tango has expanded beyond the ballroom to anywhere with a suitable dance surface, including a local bakery.

Baking was just a cover for tango, Tissa Stein, the owner of Tabor Bread, said with a smile about the conception of her bakery in 2012. Even before it opened, tango was very much a part of the design.

Instead of concrete floors, Ms. Stein chose honey-colored hickory, a smooth surface ideal for tangos gliding steps. The countertops where bread is made by day are on wheels to open up space for dancing by night. Tango and baking are both deeply nourishing, Ms. Stein said. To me, tango is another type of nutrition for the body.

After hours, Tabor Bread hosts sultry tango soirees, attracting up to 50 dancers a night. Tables are cleared away and dancers spin around the floor, often to live music, against the backdrop of the bakerys wood-burning oven. Ms. Stein, 67, who began dancing about nine years ago, is planning a sunset, or happy-hour, milonga for dancers whose schedules dont allow them to dance into the wee hours (or as a warm-up for those who do).

The warm embraces of tango compensate for the lack of sunshine in Portland, said Antje Kalinauskas, one of the hosts of several past milongas there, including Chispa (Spanish for spark) at Tabor Bread. Originally from Germany, Ms. Kalinauskas, 40, found a welcoming tango community in Portland. Tango can be like speaking another language, she said. Think about how fun it can be to meet someone new and chat in their language.

The community has spread beyond the boundaries of the dance studio, too, with organized group bike rides. Jeff Mandel, a shoemaker, runs Tango by Bike, where free group rides are announced, gathering dancers to bike into the heart of the city to tango. What began as organized social rides in 2007 during tango festivals has grown exponentially to include all sorts of tango gatherings including ballroom milongas. They draw locals and often rope out-of-town visitors into the community before dancing begins.

Tango al fresco especially flourishes in the summer.  Tango in the Park began as a flash mob type thing, said Jim Labbe, organizer of the community group. At first we danced on cement, then began looking for suitable surfaces in Portland, and wed travel there by bike. One that they found is the hardwood boardwalk at Jamison Fountain in the Pearl District, a central landmark that often draws crowds who watch the dancers. Tango in the Park has grown to include a portable dance floor that can be put on top of most surfaces, from a concrete path along the Willamette River to a patch of grass in the abundant parks.

A devotion to tango in Portland is fed by two prime factors: Dancing is affordable and gatherings are easy to reach in this compact, mostly flat city. A milonga is held weekly on Thursdays at Norse Hall, a community center with a ballroom ($10), drawing up to 125 dancers a night. Wednesdays at Norse Hall attract a somewhat younger crowd for an alternative milonga ($8), a modern approach with nontraditional music.

The weekday Guided Practica at Tango Berretin ($8) is regularly full on Wednesday afternoons. Since Alex Krebs, 38, began teaching in 1997, his email list has grown to 1,200 students ranging from age 18 to 80. According to Mr. Krebs, on any weekend in Portland, you could fly in on a Thursday or Friday and dance Argentine tango all weekend long.",[]

SATURDAY PUZZLE  Roland Huget is back, and he says below that he might have filled his puzzle differently these days, compared with how he filled it when it was submitted. Thats reasonable. We all evolve over time. And at least Mr. Huget can claim to be the guy who first introduced BARE IT ALL in The New York Times crossword.

There is some less-than-desirable fill here, like ENOL, TALCUMS and ECH, but there is also some really good fill, like SILENT TREATMENT, ILL BE THERE (I defy you to fill that in without humming), NO SIREE BOB, CRIME SCENE, MENNONITE, PETER FALK, THE HEIRESS (great movie!), ARMWRESTLE, HERE AND NOW and I LOVE L.A. I enjoyed filling in JASMINE, but had never heard of it referred to as the name of a color. I drink JASMINE tea, though and, come to think of it, it is sort of a pale yellow. Live and learn.

There was a lot of good cluing in todays puzzle, but the one that nearly made me do a spit take was 38 Acrosss Bush native to the South, for JEB. It just sits there so quietly, waiting to be discovered, and of all the ways to clue JEB, that misdirection is the last way I would have expected to see it. Very clever.

Lets check in with Mr. Huget:

Constructors Notes

This is my third crossword in The New York Times. From now on, Ill stop keeping count in the constructor notes. The crossword we see before us is actually the third version that was submitted using this grid skeleton. I recall several aborted attempts at this grid before I completed a fill that I felt comfortable in submitting, in the summer of 2013. It was rejected, and from that effort only HERE AND NOW made its way into the final version, although not in the same word slot. The second version was submitted in late 2013, just when I was starting to get the hang of crossword construction. It too was rejected, but the top and bottom stacks and the vertical SILENT TREATMENT got a thumbs-up. The final version, incorporating these elements, was completed in June of 2014, and was accepted for publication in September of that year. Its interesting to revisit an early construction that one hasnt seen in a while. Thankfully, there arent any entries here that make me cringe, but my style definitely has changed since this puzzle was produced. More than I realized, this puzzle is tailored to the over-50 crowd. I hope younger solvers arent put off by that. My favorite clues are 26A: MENNONITE: [One speaking the language Plautdietsch] and 56A: ARM WRESTLE: [Try to win hands down?]. I cant claim credit for either.

nytimes.com,2011-08-12 00:00:00,Saturday: Celebrity Guest Blogger Daniel Okrent,"['Tim Croce', 'Deb Amlen']","Edward Hausner/The New York Times

SATURDAYS PUZZLE  Before anyone accuses me of being a troublemaker, I would like to say that Daniel Okrent is appearing here today as our celebrity guest blogger of his own free will and because he simply loves solving crossword puzzles. His contribution has nothing, and I mean nothing* to do with the fact that TIME Magazine contributor Joel Stein, who appeared here in June (Across Lite, Solution, blog), accused him of being smug or perhaps even too smart for his own good. This is a blog about crossword puzzles, after all, and it would certainly not be appropriate to use this forum to stoke the fires of competitiveness or to provoke two renowned journalists into a public face-off, no matter how much fun I could have doing it.

Still, fair and balanced is fair and balanced, so I asked Mr. Okrent to choose a puzzle to tackle and he graciously agreed to do Tim Croces grid. I have to say that I agree with Mr. Okrents assessment that the puzzle is clever, and in addition to his comments below, I got a kick (sorry) out of 15 Acrosss Trigger-happy NEIGH, as well as the very clever Clay target? clue for Sonny LISTON. Im also not familiar with Saabs, so 9-5, e.g made me think of working hours rather than car models.

Before we turn it over to Mr. Okrent, Im sure you all know that he is the author, most recently, of Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition; his Great Fortune: The Epic of Rockefeller Center was a finalist for the 2004 Pulitzer Prize in history. He was the first public editor of The New York Times, editor at large at Time Inc. and editor of Life Magazine. He finished 22nd in the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament about 10 years ago, and reports that its been all downhill since then. He is also the inventor of Rotisserie League Baseball  one of the first popular forms of fantasy sports  but apologizes to everyone for having done so.

Daniel Okrents Solving Notes

I think Ive been invited to comment on todays puzzle because Joel Stein invoked my name when he was the guest solver a few weeks ago. Joel may be too cool to do crossword puzzles (which, of course, isnt necessarily very cool at all), but his performance - on a Monday, yet!  was nonetheless pathetic. Having my name associated with his in this context is sort of like being a sponsor at the Special Olympics. Except being a sponsor at the Special Olympics is socially worthwhile, and not at all embarrassing. How addicted am I to the Times puzzle? Well, I do it every day  and have done so since the bad old days of Will Weng, and the nearly as bad and nearly as old days of Eugene Maleska. Its been at least 40 years, maybe longer  but in the late 60s I was in college, and the fog of recreational drugs has obliterated all memory of the period. Other evidences? Of course I do it in pen. When I return from an overseas trip, I unpack my bags, make a drink, and before I even open the mail (and sometimes before I even talk to my wife), I sit down to complete every puzzle Ive missed. Worse yet, I have timed myself every day since July of 1992 and keep a record of my times in a filthy, raggedy, possibly even smelly old composition notebook. When Wordplay had its premiere at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament several years ago, and I was shown flipping through the notebook, even this audience  crossword geeks all  audibly gasped. Saturdays, of course, are what we addicts live for (Sunday puzzles are just big Wednesdays.) I usually spend 13 to 18 minutes on a Saturday puzzle, with occasional 11s or 28s. On April 23, 2005, I completed the Saturday puzzle in a record 6:40. This was especially gratifying because I did this at the kitchen table in my brothers house. Larrys also a puzzler, and humiliating him in this fashion after years of his humiliating me at various other competitive endeavors was exceedingly rewarding. Barely a year later, I set another record: on July 16, 2006, the Saturday puzzle took me 63 agonizing minutes. I clocked in at 18:25 on todays puzzle, mostly because of the intransigence of the upper left quadrant. Upper lefts are especially vexing, of course, because more words begin here than anywhere else, and getting the starting letters of an answer is the key to speedy solving. The answer to 2 Down (GET A ROOM) was both very clever and somewhat diabolical, as Get a ride could have conceivably (if less cleverly) been the answer as well. The one that really stumped me was 31 Across. DOTS as the answer to City representatives? didnt make sense to me even as I filled it in; it took me another two or three minutes until I slapped my forehead in sudden comprehension. The other clue that most impressed me was 57 Across (Am or Fm stat); I didnt note the telltale lower-case ms until my second or third time through the clues. The puzzles weakness lies in its over-reliance on prepositional compounds (LISTEN TO, IN MONO, COMES INTO, ROLLED OUT, INTO IT), but I may just be bitter over my worse-than-average performance. My only comfort? Joel Stein could spend a week on this one and not complete it  even if he had the answers right in front of him.

Uh oh.

Since the dawn of time  or at least the dawn of social media  men have been maneuvering themselves and their loved ones into foolish situations to set the stage for jaw-dropping marriage proposals.

Some have taken it to the extreme  lighting themselves on fire, hurling themselves off buildings and staging their own fake deaths  to provide lucky ladies with maximum shock value. But this week, a 24-year-old man from Texas named Vidal Valladares Navas seemed to take it too far.

His offense? Stopping traffic.

Mr. Valladares Navas and a few of his friends got in the way of impatient drivers on Sunday so that he could propose to his girlfriend, Michelle Wycoff, 23. A shaky video of the proposal posted to Ms. Wycoffs Instagram account showed her suitor on bended knee under a cloudy sky, in the middle of Interstate 45, a busy highway that runs through the middle of Houston.

Drivers did not give them more than a few seconds to celebrate. As the ecstatic couple hugged, the blare of car horns could be heard as people in trucks and S.U.V.s began to drive around the couple and their entourage, who were also recording.

Last post but best moment ever and I am so happy, Ms. Wycoff wrote as a caption for the video.

People on the Internet did not entirely share in her joy, instead pointing out that Mr. Valladares Navas had put himself, his friends, his fiancee and everyone on the highway in danger.

The video from the couples social media pages was quickly shared and reposted, often with new headlines: Idiot Shuts Down a Major Highway for Marriage Proposal had more than 800,000 views on YouTube as of Wednesday morning.

The fulminations drew the attention of the authorities. The Houston Police Department did not have officers on the scene quickly enough to arrest the couple, a department spokesman told The Houston Chronicle on Tuesday, adding that the common charge would have been obstructing a highway, a class B misdemeanor under Texas law.

As the backlash grew, the couple did not respond to emails or phone calls from The New York Times for comment but defended themselves to local media outlets.

Im wanting to apologize to everyone if I caused any problems, Mr. Valladares Navas told ABC 13 on Tuesday. That wasnt my intention in the beginning. I just wanted to do something different.

Though his extreme proposal had a happy ending, his apology was apparently not enough. Jeff McShan, a public information officer with the Harris County District Attorneys Office confirmed in an interview that Mr. Valladares Navas would face the charge of obstructing a highway.

Mr. Valladares Navas checked in with a bail bondsman, and was scheduled for a court appearance on Dec. 23, Mr. McShan said.",[]

Its not a put-on. Bob Dylans Shadows in the Night, an album of 10 songs that were all recorded by Frank Sinatra, is a tribute from one venerated American musician to another, a reconsideration of a school of songwriting, a feat of technical nostalgia and a reckoning with love and death.









Mr. Dylan devotes the album to a particular subset of the Sinatra legacy. Its not Sinatra the airborne swinger or Sinatra the voice of confidence. Its the Sinatra who made thematic albums about separation and heartache  albums like Where Are You? in 1957, which included four of the songs Mr. Dylan revives, and No One Cares (1959) and All Alone (1962), which each supply one. They are ballads, mostly Tin Pan Alley standards, sophisticated enough to be utterly succinct. They never move faster than midtempo and they often luxuriate in melancholy; they testify, above all, to loneliness.

Shadows in the Night (Columbia) offers bait for trivia seekers. Sinatra was born in 1915, 100 years ago. The opening track, Im a Fool to Want You, is one of very few songs with a Sinatra songwriting credit. The front cover emulates the vertical-bar design of the jazz trumpeter Freddie Hubbards album Hub-Tones, which was released  like Mr. Dylans debut album  in 1962. The photo on the back poses Mr. Dylan and a masked woman in formal wear at a nightclub table, alluding, perhaps, to the 1966 Black and White Ball, a masked ball that gathered a glittering assortment of 1960s celebrities, including Sinatra and his new wife, Mia Farrow. In the photo, Mr. Dylan holds a Sun Records single, a touch of rock; its title is too grainy to decipher.

But theres no posing in the music. Mr. Dylan brought his touring band to a studio where Sinatra often recorded, Capitol Records Studio B, and he sang the songs with his five-man touring band. They recorded live and listening to one another in the room without headphones; turn the album up too loud and you can hear amplifiers humming as songs begin and end. There was no tuning and there was no fixing, the albums engineer, Al Schmitt, said in an online interview. Everything is what it was.

The arrangements are largely of a piece. The young, suave Sinatra found tragedy and melodrama in these songs, which he often sang as slowly as Mr. Dylan does. But where Sinatra had string orchestras, Mr. Dylan has Donny Herrons pedal-steel guitar, perpetually hovering and gliding, and Tony Garniers bass, often bowed with grave watchfulness. The guitars of Charlie Sexton and Stu Kimball melt into the chords; the drummer George Receli relies on brushes. And for these songs, Mr. Dylan presents yet another changed voice: not the wrathful scrape of his recent albums, but a subdued, sustained tone. Its still ragged; he is 73. But he carefully honors the melodies, even the trickier chromatic ones, and he fully inhabits the lyrics.

Hes not suave; he has seen too much. In Im a Fool to Want You, he begs, Pity me, I need you, knowing full well that hes embracing misery. Autumn Leaves isnt a throwaway jazz exercise but a reflection on solitude and advancing time. Full Moon and Empty Arms, adapted from Rachmaninoffs second piano concerto, becomes a ghostly country shuffle; even as Mr. Dylan sings about wishing for a reunion, his voice knows better than to hope. Mr. Dylan has been performing Stay With Me, sung by Sinatra for the 1963 film The Cardinal, to end his recent concerts; its a humble prayer, and Mr. Dylan sings it on the album with weary repentance.

Not every song thrives under Mr. Dylans treatment. Some Enchanted Evening is stiff, and Why Try to Change Me Now denies the songs humor. But even when it falters, Shadows in the Night maintains its singular mood: lovesick, haunted, suspended between an inconsolable present and all the regrets of the past. JON PARELES

DIANA KRALL

Wallflower

(Verve Records)

Photo

Diana Krall sounds glum and fatigued on Wallflower, a collection of songs mostly from the 70s and 80s associated with the Eagles, Elton John, the Carpenters and others, that sustains a mood of quiet desperation. The muted, wistful tone is established with the opening cut, California Dreamin, the Mamas and the Papas first hit in which Ms. Kralls somnolent delivery suggests a snowbound New Englander longing for brighter days and happier times on a frigid winter evening. It is deepened by her rendition of Desperado, the Eagles ballad comparing a rock stars grueling life on the road to the exhaustion of an aging cowboy reluctant to come in from the range.

The most evocative cut is the Carpenters hit Superstar, the plea to a rock star by a besotted fan to remember her long after their dalliance. As Ms. Krall murmurs Loneliness is such a sad affair, sounding like Peggy Lee in her sultry boudoir mode, those words define an album whose other depictions of unhappy relationships include I Cant Tell You Why, Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word, Dont Dream Its Over, Im Not in Love and Alone Again (Naturally), sung with Michael Buble.

Wallflower was produced and arranged by the megahit maker David Foster, whose lush but static string arrangements, written by William Ross, couch each song on a soft feather bed. Where Ms. Krall usually plays vigorous keyboards on her albums, here her pianism is all but absent. Most of the fills, played by Mr. Foster, are strictly routine. Its all the more mystifying because Ms. Krall, when prodded by a rhythm section, can really swing. But on Wallflower, drums are minimal.

The record, whose title song is an obscure, country-inflected Bob Dylan number, has the feel of a sullen concept album by a woman who feels abandoned. It is tempting to imagine that it reflects the frustrations of her marriage to Elvis Costello. These two great musicians, after all, are driven workhorses who are on the road much of the time on separate tours. Loneliness is such a sad affair. STEPHEN HOLDEN

VIJAY IYER TRIO

Break Stuff (ECM)

Photo

The pianist Vijay Iyer publishes his compositions under the name Multiplicity Music, and that word goes to the heart of his enterprise as an artist. Hes led an important jazz-tradition trio for most of the last decade, but hes also been writing music inspired by other traditions and functions, working with poets and M.C.s and string quartets. He doesnt just improvise, he teaches a class in aesthetic and social theories of improvisation, at Harvard; he makes music that not only intersects different strategies but lingers over the places of intersection.

Hood, from Break Stuff the third and best record by Mr. Iyers trio, and the first on ECM  was inspired by the Detroit techno producer Robert Hood. Its a kind of process piece, an analysis of an intersection, that you could imagine being used as an excerpted interlude on someone elses record. On this one its an event, a centerpiece, amid other blocks of material. Mr. Iyer and the drummer Marcus Gilmore fall in and out of sync, moving in repetitions with different rhythm and tempo; the bassist Stephan Crump negotiates between them in small strokes, subtly connecting. Sometimes Mr. Gilmores playing sounds flexible, and Mr. Iyers sounds rigid; then their playing fuses, or swaps character. Mr. Iyers keyboard sound gradually changes, and his chords gradually change, too, widening and evolving, turning into arpeggiated motion.

The trio makes sense in a physical way, moving together as one unit. And its good how evolved that motion can sound in a piece as strange as Hood, because over the course of the record, the strength of the track takes the heat off Mr. Iyers versions of songs by his heroes (Thelonious Monks Work, Billy Strayhorns Bloodcount, John Coltranes Countdown). Those versions arent formal stunts  least of all the slow, elegant Bloodcount. Theyre just more refined representations of the way Mr. Iyer and his trio perform in real time, with a rhythmic logic and a coordinated bustle of breaks and intersections. Likewise, the albums reduced or evolved sections of two commissioned suites from 2013 dont seem like material from other assignments. The bands refractive language makes sense of whatever material it plays. You dont hear the record and seize on its sense of rupture or argument. Instead, it sounds whole. BEN RATLIFF

MATANA ROBERTS

Coin Coin Chapter Three: river run thee

(Constellation)

Photo

I like to tell stories, Matana Roberts says, with an offhanded frankness, at one point deep into the immersive experience of her new album, Coin Coin Chapter Three: river run thee. Its just one of many scraps of text and sound assembled therein, and far from the most gripping. But that plain-spoken declaration is a key to comprehending Ms. Roberts and the motivations of her art  in particular, Coin Coin, a 12-part cycle of personal, socio-historical and psychic inquisition.

An alto saxophonist and composer originally from Chicago, Ms. Roberts has found oblique but potent uses for narrative throughout her Coin Coin series, in performance and on two albums, released in 2011 and 2013. Working with folklore, family archives, public records and other faded ephemera, shes creating her own patchwork monument to African-American history, a tale of harrowing struggle and brittle stoicism.

Coin Coin Chapter Three is the first installment to feature no musicians other than herself, which puts a stark emphasis on the interiority of the work. Ms. Roberts recorded the album in layers, overdubbing parts in real time: vocal recitations; ribbons of song; keening saxophones; analog synth drones; ambient sampled material. In the notes, she refers to the album as a fever dream of sound, an accurate sensory impression. (Shell perform this material on Tuesday night at Union Pool in Brooklyn.)

Her tone wheels between dispassion and despair, neither side achieving the upper hand. Oh, why do we try so hard? she cries in All Is Written, the opening track. All is written in the cards. Later she reads clinically from the ships log of a 19th-century slave vessel and reflects with eerie calm on the double-crossing of a people. Every sonic element  her voice, her saxophone, the clip of a baby crying  comes woven into a tapestry, with no stable relationship of foreground to background.

One exception comes at the albums finish, with a recording of a speech delivered by Malcolm X on Feb. 14, 1965  the same day that his house had been firebombed, one week before his assassination. I am not a racist in any form whatsoever, he says, his voice fading against a glow of synthesizers, the ending of that story artfully left unsaid. NATE CHINEN",[]

SUNDAY PUZZLE  April of this year marks the 400th anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare, and David J. Kahn is back with a puzzle about some of the Bards characters.

But hark, as the Bard no doubt would have said: What hath happened to our clues? All of the theme entry clues say See blurb. In case you missed it, the blurb is a Notepad that says The answers to 23-, 31-, 45-, 62-, 69-, 90-, 103- and 115-Across are themselves clues to the names spelled by their circled letters. That means that you will have to first solve the puzzle to get the clues, and then you will find the answers to the clue/answers inside the shaded/circled squares. Got that?

Not really? O.K., lets spell it out (sorry). Did you note the puzzles title, In Character? Thats a big hint to the theme. If you can solve 23 Across using the crossings, you get COMRADE OF MERCUTIO, and the shaded/circled letters inside that phrase spell out ROMEO, who was, in fact a COMRADE OF MERCUTIO. The character is in the clue, which is also the answer. Forget it, you guys; its Stratford-upon-Avon.

Here are the rest of them:

31A: BANQUET GHOST / BANQUO

45A: ELDERLY MONARCH / LEAR

62A: SCHEMER AGAINST CAESAR / CASCA

69A: LOVE INTEREST OF OLIVIA / VIOLA

90A: EVIL ANTAGONIST / IAGO

103A: MACABRE THANE / MACBETH

115A: UNHAPPY MALCONTENT / HAMLET

Clue of the Day for me was Italian fine? for BENE, followed by One carrying a toon? for CEL. I thought that 118 Downs answer was N.F.L. for Packers org., and was unpleasantly surprised when it turned out to be N.R.A. Oh well.

Lets hear from Mr. Kahn:

Constructors Notes:

I had just seen Something Rotten!, a very funny Broadway musical, and I was looking to do something to commemorate the upcoming 400th anniversary of Shakespeares death. The theme came to me when I realized that FRIEND OF MERCUTIO (where FRIEND later became COMRADE) included the name ROMEO. Coming up with other answers and getting this puzzle accepted was a struggle. My original submission had a few themed answers Will and Joel felt were either contrived (OPHELIAS COMPLEX SUITOR, anyone?) or hid characters with only four letters in 21-letter answers (e.g., VILLAIN UNDOING OTHELLO). They liked the concept, though, so I focused on shortening the answers and adding some 5-, 6- and 7-letter characters. I stuck to Shakespeares more popular plays and Will/Joel offered a lot of feedback along the way. Finally, deleting SHAKESPEARE as an answer, which I did at the very end, makes for more of an aha moment.

If you would like to join the observance, which is being called Shakespeare400 online, you can start here.

And while were talking iambic pentameter, lets watch Robin Williamss brilliant take on the playwright:

The surprisingly dangerous Caitlin Lovinger will be sitting in for me while Im on vacation. Happy solving, and Ill see you all when I get back.

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Squares Loss Widens in Its First Report as a Public Company,['Mike Isaac'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Square, the mobile payments company, reported a wider loss than it had a year ago and posted a 49 percent revenue increase on Wednesday, in its first earnings report as a public company.

The company, based in San Francisco, reported a loss of $80.5 million, or 34 cents a share, for the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $37.1 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales totaled $374 million.

Excluding a payments processing agreement with Starbucks, which is winding down this year, Square reported adjusted revenue of $135 million. Square also said it processed $10.2 billion in gross payment volume, up 47 percent from a year ago.

We are off to a great start with fourth-quarter results that demonstrate both high growth and strong operating performance, the company said in a statement.

Squares earnings report is being closely watched as a barometer for how its chief executive, Jack Dorsey, is performing. Mr. Dorsey is also chief executive of Twitter, and investors have questioned whether he can juggle both companies at the same time. Twitter is grappling with growth problems, trying to attract more people to its service.

The earnings are also being scrutinized for the greeting that other technology companies might receive if they go public. Squares initial public offering in November on the New York Stock Exchange came in a tumultuous climate for tech offerings. Etsy, the online marketplace, now trades at around $8, a little more than half its offering price last April. Other companies recently taken public, like Box, are also trading well below their stock prices a year ago.

While Square has spent heavily to expand its business over the past few years, investor attitudes are growing more conservative when it comes to the bottom line.

If you look over the past few years at a lot of recent tech I.P.O.s, there was an almost myopic focus on growth, said Josh Beck, a research analyst for Pacific Crest Securities. Weve seen a correction and a different focus in the last year. Now everyone is really looking for a path to profitability.

Shares of Square rose after the company announced its earnings. The company went public at $9 a share.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Master of Go Board Game Is Walloped by Google Computer Program,"['John Markoff', 'Choe Sang-hun']","SEOUL, South Korea  Computer, one. Human, zero.









A Google computer program stunned one of the worlds top players on Wednesday in a round of Go, which is believed to be the most complex board game ever created.

The match  between Google DeepMinds AlphaGo and the South Korean Go master Lee Se-dol was viewed as an important test of how far research into artificial intelligence has come in its quest to create machines smarter than humans.

I am very surprised because I have never thought I would lose, Mr. Lee said at a news conference in Seoul, South Korea. I didnt know that AlphaGo would play such a perfect Go.

Mr. Lee acknowledged defeat after three and a half hours of play.

Demis Hassabis, the founder and chief executive of Googles artificial intelligence team DeepMind, the creator of AlphaGo, called the programs victory a historic moment.

The match, the first of five scheduled through Tuesday, took place at a Seoul hotel amid intense news media attention. Hundreds of reporters, many of them from China, Japan and South Korea, where Go has been played for centuries, were there to cover it. Tens of thousands of people watched the contest live on YouTube.

Go is a two-player game of strategy said to have originated in China 3,000 years ago. Players compete to win more territory by placing black and white stones on a grid measuring 19 squares by 19 squares.

The play is more complex than chess, with a far greater possible sequence of moves, and requires superlative instincts and evaluation skills. Because of that, many researchers believed that mastery of the game by a computer was still a decade away.

Before the match, Mr. Lee said he could win 5-0 or 4-1, predicting that computing power alone could not win a Go match. Victory takes human intuition, something AlphaGo has not yet mastered, he said.

But after reading more about the program he became less upbeat, saying that AlphaGo appeared able to imitate human intuition to a certain degree and predicting that artificial intelligence would eventually surpass humans in Go.

AlphaGo posed Mr. Lee a unique challenge. In a human-versus-human Go match, which typically lasts several hours, the players feel each other and evaluate styles and psychologies, he said.

This time, its like playing the game alone, Mr. Lee said on the eve of the match. There are mistakes humans make because they are humans. If that happens to me, I can lose a match.

To researchers who have been using games as platforms for testing artificial intelligence, Go has remained the great challenge since the I.B.M.-developed supercomputer Deep Blue beat the world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.

Really, the only game left after chess is Go, Mr. Hassabis said on Wednesday.

AlphaGo made news when it routed the three-time European Go champion Fan Hui in October, 5-0.

But Mr. Lee, 33, is one of the worlds most accomplished professional Go players, with 18 international titles under his belt. He has called the European champions level in Go near the top among amateurs.

AlphaGo has become much stronger since its matches with Mr. Fan, its developers said. It challenged Mr. Lee because it was ready to take on someone iconic, a legend of the game, Mr. Hassabis said. Google offered Mr. Lee $1 million if he wins the best-of-five series.

Mr. Hassabis said AlphaGo does not try to consider all the possible moves in a match, as a traditional artificial intelligence machine like Deep Blue does. Rather, it narrows its options based on what it has learned from millions of matches played against itself and in 100,000 Go games available online.

Mr. Hassabis said that a central advantage of AlphaGo was that it will never get tired, and it will not get intimidated either.

Kim Sung-ryong, a South Korean Go master who provided commentary during Wednesdays match, said AlphaGo made a clear mistake early on, but that unlike most human players, it did not lose its cool.

It didnt play Go as a human does, he said. It was a Go match with human emotional elements carved out.

Mr. Lee said he knew he had lost the match after AlphaGo made a move so unexpected and unconventional that he thought it was impossible to make such a move.

Mr. Lee said he now thought his chances for victory in the five-match series were 50-50.

Some computer scientists said Wednesday that they had expected the outcome.

Im not surprised at all, said Fei-Fei Li, a Stanford University computer scientist who is director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. How come we are not surprised that a car runs faster than the fastest human?

On Tuesday, before the match began, Oren Etzioni, the director of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a nonprofit research organization in Seattle, conducted a survey of the members of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

Of 55 scientists, 69 percent believed that the program would win, and 31 percent believed that Mr. Lee would be victorious. Moreover, 60 percent believed that the achievement could be considered a milestone toward building human-level artificial intelligence software.

That question remains one of the most hotly debated within the field of artificial intelligence. Machines have had increasing success in the past half-decade at narrow humanlike capabilities, like understanding speech and vision.

However, the goal of strong A.I.  defined as a machine with an intellectual capability equal to that of a human  remains elusive.

Other artificial-intelligence scientists said that humans might still find refuge if the goal posts for the competition were moved.

I wonder what would happen if they played on a 29 by 29 grid? wondered Rodney Brooks, a pioneering artificial intelligence researcher who is the founder of a robot company, Rethink Robotics. By enlarging the playing space, humans might once again escape the machines computing power.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,A Judges Message to the Xenophobes,['The Editorial Board'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

More than two dozen Republican governors were in a virtual stampede last fall to be first to bar the resettlement of federally approved Syrian refugees in their states. The shameless display of jingoism was prompted by the Paris shooting massacre in November and fears  wildly driven by the Republican presidential rivals  that terrorists could infiltrate the United States as refugees despite a resettlement process that is one of the strictest in the world.

A federal district judge in Indianapolis punctured this fiction last week in blocking the attempt by Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana to cut off federal resettlement funds for Syrian refugees who had passed a vetting process that took up to two years. Mr. Pences order was unconstitutional and clearly discriminates against Syrians compared with other refugees, Judge Tanya Walton Pratt ruled in a suit brought by a nonprofit resettlement agency. The judge found that Mr. Pences move to withhold resettlement funds was in no way justified by his claim that his main concern was the safety of Indiana residents.

The ruling delivered a jolt of reality to the xenophobic politics now inflaming the presidential primary campaign. The state was forced to concede that it does not really have the authority to bar refugees from crossing into Indiana, a concession that no Republican governor was willing to make in the states-rights bombast of last fall. Mr. Pence had simply cut off the funding the refugees were entitled to  a tactic the judge excoriated. This is essentially a policy of punishing Syrian refugees already in Indiana in the hopes that no more will come, she wrote.

Resettlement lawyers said the ruling was the first to address substantively the attempt by some governors, mostly Republicans, to exploit the terrorism issue. The presidential candidates, of course, have been vying furiously to keep up with venomous nativism coming from Donald Trump and from Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who told a conservative radio interviewer that I dont think orphans under 5 are being, you know, should be admitted into the United States at this point.

According to the State Department, 67 percent of the Syrian refugees referred to the United States for asylum are women and children under the age of 12. Mr. Trump has falsely suggested that federal officials steered Syrian refugees to states with Republican governors, when in fact resettlement decisions are made by mainstream social agencies like the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Mr. Trumps claim was one more example of propaganda being used to distort the truth on the refugee issue.

The fact is, the refugee resettlement program in this country involves a cautiously paced investigative process that contrasts sharply with the uncontrollable floods of refugees in Europe that Republican politicians are using to arouse terrorist fears in this country. Over three million people fleeing persecution and war have been investigated and welcomed to the United States in the last four decades. Syrian refugees must be no less welcome.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,Letter of Recommendation: Vanderpump Rules,['Naomi Fry'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

American reality television has a near-pathological focus on success. It makes no difference whether a show documents an actual competition (Survivor) or a milestone refigured as a competition (The Bachelor), or offers some version, however far-fetched, of everyday life (Keeping Up With the Kardashians). The trajectory is the same: relentlessly upward.









Over the last couple of years, however, Ive found an exception to this tendency in the Bravo series Vanderpump Rules. Watching it, especially after a long day at my own job, feels like a tonic for all that ails me. But this isnt only because the show helps me relax and forget. The experience of life that the show exemplifies  a miasmic forever-present where not a whole lot happens and the pressures of achievement appear mostly absent  parallels a utopian, even resistant, impulse in me.

The show is set in the West Hollywood dining establishment SUR (an acronym that stands, amazingly, for Sexy Unique Restaurant) and is a spinoff of another Bravo offering, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, in that a star of that series, Lisa Vanderpump, is one of SURs owners. Though Vanderpumps role as a kind but no-nonsense boss is central to the show, she isnt the protagonist. Instead, the series centers on SURs hard-bodied wait staff, few of whom seem keen on climbing the rungs of the management ladder.

Continue reading the main story The worlds most economically competitive countries, according to the World Economic Forum: 1. Switzerland 2. Singapore 3. United States 4. Germany 5. Netherlands 6. Japan 7. Hong Kong S.A.R. 8. Finland 9. Sweden 10. United Kingdom

Early on in the shows run, its cast members all dreamed big of a life beyond SURs walls. Among these conventionally attractive aspirants was Jax, a leathery bartender-model who wanted to become a sweater designer; his fellow bartender Tom Sandoval, an actor and musician; Kristen, Toms erratic waitress girlfriend, a model and actress; Stassi, another waitress and aspiring stylist; and Scheana, a hostess and performer of club music who has Its all happening tattooed on her forearm. As Kristen explained in the first season, Vanderpump doesnt want us to be lifelong waitresses or bartenders but to kind of use it as a steppingstone to get into whatever it is that we aspire to be.

I really began to think of Vanderpump Rules as a true outlier in the reality-show world, though, when it abandoned the conceit that there should be any trajectory  upward or even downward  to the plot of its characters lives. Four seasons in, while some strong personalities have been added to the mix (among them James, a cunning busboy and D.J., and Lala, a flirty hostess and lingerie model), most of the original cast is still working at SUR. The plot centers almost exclusively on the staffs love lives, the twists of which are mostly carried out, near incestuously, among a closed loop of SUR regulars. Matters of the heart are cyclically worried and fought over during breaks in the alley behind the restaurant, not far from the Dumpsters.

The familiar reality-show arc of development has been traded for a Simpsons-like freezing of time, in which the characters never change or even seem to naturally age. Of course, stasis was a given on television for decades, but in the personal-growth-obsessed universe of reality TV, Vanderpump stands apart. The SUR staff members, with their stardom-primed appearances  their snugly sheathed gym-toned bodies and smooth Botox-injected brows  have been locked in a state of readiness that hasnt yet led to ascent.

You would be correct to point out that the characters lives have, in fact, developed, and that theyre most likely ambitious and success-oriented in a manner that lies outside the shows plotted purview, being that they are now reality-show celebrities who make nightclub appearances and hawk protein supplements and teeth-whitening devices on social media. But this has left no mark where it really counts for the viewer. The series remains a near-pure portrait of motionlessness, a still point in the turning world. Watching it is like having my brain stroked to a very low-grade, consequence-free orgasm  a pleasurable sort of noninvolvement. And I never once have to compare myself unfavorably with the people onscreen.

I moved to America more than a decade ago from Israel and found myself half-seduced and half-flummoxed by the very American fixation on growth and improvement. Seduced because it seemed the law of the land to side with the winners, no matter the circumstances or cost; flummoxed because there appeared something unsustainable, and maybe even slightly fascistic, in this unswerving focus on worldly achievement. Over the years, as Ive nervously jumped my way through a succession of professional and personal hoops, with varying degrees of effort, Ive thought a lot of a moment in Tama Janowitzs 1985 short story Spells, in which the protagonist, Eleanor, is forced to listen to her boyfriend go on glowingly about his overachieving ex-girlfriend. When he pauses, Eleanor responds: I like to rest, myself. Reading it, I remember thinking: Exactly.

Id rather poke out my own eye with a stick than participate in a so-called opting out. But thinking of stasis as one possibility among others  even if just for limited periods of time, even if just in the sense of loosening the hectoring voice in your own head that urges you to always keep marching forward  seems a culturally viable, emotionally necessary option. Vanderpump Rules is like that burnout friend who always urges you to take that smoke break, to have another drink, to call in sick to work. And see, now: Dont you feel better already?",[]

Tuesday nights surprise win in Michigan for Bernie Sanders was a humbling night for political prognosticators.

He had trailed in pre-election polls by around 20 points  a bit less in some polls, a bit more in others. My colleague Nate Cohn has written an excellent post-mortem; Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight declared it to be among the greatest polling error in primary history.

Its worth juxtaposing this with a less-noticed fact: Hillary Clinton beat the (admittedly sparse) polls in Mississippi by an average of 22 points. Those polls had predicted Mrs. Clinton to win, but by a much smaller margin than 66 points. It may be less embarrassing for pollsters when they miss the margin badly but correctly pick the top vote-getter, but when delegates are awarded proportionately, its no less consequential.

Perhaps we shouldnt be surprised: Polling response rates, particularly for robocalls, are down around the single digits. Some pollsters still havent fully adjusted to the fact that landlines are now a historical curiosity in many households.

And as a Michigander  albeit one in living in a liberal college town  I can report that the race may also have been distorted by the #NeverTrump movement, leading some mainstream Democrats to ask for a Republican ballot instead.

Indeed, there was a notable spike within Michigan in Google searches for How to Stop Trump.

But, to be clear, its also a result whose implications can be oversold.

Mrs. Clinton had accumulated a solid delegate lead, and she only increased that lead. As Mr. Cohn has noted, the proportional delegate allocation rules make it very difficult for Mr. Sanders to make up this lead in the remaining races.

For all the breathless commentary Ive seen, I think that the prediction markets basically have it right. They gave Mrs. Clinton a 95 percent chance to win the nomination as of Tuesday morning, and by Wednesday morning, she was at 93 percent.

nytimes.com,2016-03-04 00:00:00,Ask Well: The Best Exercises to Improve Balance,"['Reader Question', 'Http Topics Nytimes Com Topics Reference Timestopics People R Gretchen_reynolds Index Html', 'Gretchen Reynolds']","A

Your options are legion. Tai chi, for instance, with its flowing movements and poses, rapidly builds balance. A study published last year found that older people who completed several weeks of tai chi classes performed much better afterward on a variety of balance tests than they had at the studys start. They also generally performed better than another group of volunteers who had spent those same weeks learning ballroom dancing. But dancing did have benefits; the waltzers and fox-trotters could now close their eyes and stand much more steadily than they could before.

Similarly, yoga generally enhances balance, even among people who enjoy fine bodily equilibrium. In a study published in January, for instance, collegiate male athletes displayed better balance after 10 weeks of yoga classes than a control group of athletes who did not change their routines.

But you also can become less wobbly without attending classes or even leaving your living room. All you need is some space, a table or wall nearby to steady yourself if needed, and a pillow, said Jay Hertel, a professor of sports medicine at the University of Virginia and expert on balance training.

Simply stand near a wall and raise and bend one of your legs. Press that leg against your other leg, stork style. Try not to sway. If you start to topple, steady yourself against the wall. Hold this stance for as long as possible, then switch legs and repeat.

Seem easy? Do it with your eyes closed, or stand on a thick pillow, Dr. Hertel said, which makes the ground unstable. (A wobble board also works, but pillows are cheaper.) It may help, too, to ritualize the practice. Stand on one leg while you brush your teeth, Dr. Hertel suggested, and close your eyes if its too easy. It may sound ridiculous, but if you do that for two or three minutes a day, youre working your balance really well.",[]

Her entrance applause was so loud, and lasted so long, that it must have been difficult to hear the orchestra during her first few steps. After the curtain went down on the last act, she received a 23-minute ovation and enough bouquets to stock a small flower shop. They were tributes to Julie Kent, who danced her farewell performance with American Ballet Theater on Saturday night after 29 years with the company  a final Romeo and Juliet  and stirred strong emotions among fans and fellow dancers. Through social media, the moment reverberated far beyond the Metropolitan Opera House. Heres a sampling of how her fans and colleagues shared the experience on Twitter.

It was not a night when the prohibition on photography was very strictly enforced:

Or video, for that matter:

Excitement began building earlier in the day. David Hallberg, a principal dancer with Ballet Theater and the Bolshoi Ballet, got things going before the performance with a question:

Fans were soon responding with votes for her performances in A Month in the Country, Swan Lake, Manon and Romeo and Juliet, among others.

Even before the curtain went up, colleagues posted tributes:

Once the ballet started, fans gave updates throughout the evening:

Musicians applauded from the orchestra pit. The concertmaster, Benjamin Bowman, reported:

nytimes.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Ask Well: Booster Shots for Grown-Ups,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Reference Timestopics People R Roni_caryn_rabin Index Html', 'Reader Question', 'Roni Caryn Rabin']","Should 20-somethings and older folks be getting boosters for childhood immunizations that may have lost potency? Which ones?

A

By your early 20s, theres a good chance you are due for some boosters, said Dr. Wanda Filer, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. You may also need to play catch-up if youve missed any vaccines or failed to complete a series, she said.

Everyone needs a tetanus and diphtheria booster every 10 years; the shots are often combined. So if you were 12 the last time you had a tetanus shot, youre due for one at 22.

Adults ages 19 to 64 should also get a pertussis, or whooping cough, booster. Pregnant women should be vaccinated against pertussis toward the end of each pregnancy in order to protect their newborns from this disease, which can be devastating for a baby.

If you are not pregnant but may become pregnant, its a good idea to plan ahead and be tested for immunity to two other childhood diseases: rubella and chickenpox. If you do not have evidence of immunity -- and are not pregnant -- you should be vaccinated.

If you were not vaccinated against the human papilloma virus, or HPV, or did not complete the recommended series of three doses, women can complete the series through age 26, and men through age 21, with more leeway for men who have sex with men and those with compromised immune systems, who who may be vaccinated through age 26. The HPV series protects against viruses that cause cervical cancer, head and neck cancers and anal cancer.

Beyond childhood immunizations, flu shots are recommended every year for just about everybody, Dr. Filer said. The shingles vaccine is also recommended for older adults.

You may also want to check whether youve been vaccinated against meningitis, said Dr. Carolyn Bridges, associate director for adult immunizations at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Its a good idea to obtain a record of your vaccinations, she said, and to encourage your physician to input your record into a state vaccine registry.

The above recommendations are for the general population. Additional vaccines may be advised for anyone with a chronic health condition such as a compromised immune system, asthma or diabetes; those who work in the health care field; men who have sex with men; people who travel to certain parts of the world; and adults 60 or older. Talk with your doctor.

You can find out if youre due for shots by taking the C.D.C.s online vaccination quiz, Dr. Bridges suggested. Vaccine recommendations are confusing.""",[]

nytimes.com,2010-12-21 00:00:00,Interview With Will Shortz,['Jim Horne'],"Don Christensen

This is my final interview for Wordplay, and Ive saved the best for last. The name Will Shortz is on every crossword that The New York Times has published since Nov. 21, 1993. He doesnt create them himself. Rather, he relies on a carefully nurtured army of freelance constructors who flood his mailbox with submissions, all competing for that most coveted spot in puzzledom, the crossword page in The Times. Only a fraction make it to print.

Selecting puzzles is only the first step. Sometimes puzzles are returned with suggestions, noting areas of the grid that need to be cleaned up or completely rewritten. Almost always, clues are tweaked or rewritten. Then there is the endless fact-checking and test-solving to oversee. Oh, and table tennis to play, too.

All of this makes Mr. Shortz the most powerful man in puzzles. His personal style, aesthetic, humor and sensibility set the standard for what makes a great crossword in this publication and beyond. I started our conversation by asking about his background.

Q.

Most people enjoy puzzles, but you seem to have made it a lifelong pursuit. When did you first catch the bug? What puzzles did you enjoy when you were growing up?

A.

My favorite kinds of puzzles when I was growing up were ... almost any kind. Word puzzles, math puzzles, you name it. Sam Loyd (1841-1911), the great American puzzle genius, was my childhood hero. I bought his puzzle collections from Dover Books. The works of Henry Ernest Dudeney and Martin Gardner were other favorites. Of course, I solved crosswords. But I was especially interested in offbeat things, such as the novelty word puzzles of Gerald Lynton Kaufman and Puns and Anagrams edited by Margaret Farrar. In the eighth grade, when asked to write a paper on what I wanted to do with my life, I said I wanted to be a professional puzzlemaker. Looking back, I wonder what sort of kid thinks like that? No one else in my family solved puzzles. I picked up the bug entirely on my own.

Q.

You, famously, engineered a unique college degree at Indiana University. How were you able to pull that off?

A.

I.U. has an innovative program called the individualized major program, which was new when I was there. If youre accepted, you can major in absolutely anything. As a kid, Id joked about majoring in puzzles in college, never dreaming that this might be possible. During my sophomore year at I.U. (1971-72), my mom read about the program and encouraged me to investigate. I liked the idea but was cautious. During my junior year, I took one independent study course on puzzles each semester  things I arranged one on one with professors within the regular department framework. One was on 20th-century American word puzzles, through English. The other was on popular mathematical puzzles, through math. These worked out so well that I switched my major from economics to enigmatology in my senior year. Subjects I studied included crossword construction, logic puzzles, math puzzles, anagrams, crossword magazines and the psychology of puzzles. My thesis was on The History of American Word Puzzles Before 1860. For that, I spent literally months in the I.U. library poring over the microform and microfiche of every American magazine, newspaper or almanac published before 1860 that I thought might contain puzzles. I.U. had given me a grant the previous summer to study puzzles at the Library of Congress in Washington, so Id done more research there.

In most individualized program majors, students take a combination of existing courses and tutorials. As I.U. had no courses on puzzles, not surprisingly, every course in my major was independent study. I may have been the only student at I.U. who knew more about his field than any professor!

Q.

What was your path to becoming editor of Games magazine, and what were your goals there?

A.

In the summer of 1974, after graduating from I.U., I worked for Penny Press in Stamford, Conn. Penny was one of maybe a dozen crossword magazine companies then, and it was the only one that offered me a summer job. I had a blast, and I returned there in the summers of 1975 and 1976, between years at the University of Virginia School of Law.

My worry had always been that puzzles wouldnt pay the bills. Thats why I went to law school. My plan was to practice law for 10 years, then retire to do what I really wanted  puzzles. After my first summer at Penny Press, though, I realized that I could make a living as a puzzle editor, not just as a creator. When I graduated from U.Va. in 1977, I skipped the bar exam, never practiced law and never looked back.

Games magazine started in 1977, and I was a charter subscriber, while working for Penny Press full time. When the first issue arrived, my reaction was an intense combination of love and jealousy. This was the quality, fun, wide-ranging puzzle magazine that Id literally dreamed about starting myself. I devoured it.

Early in 1978, I saw a classified ad in The Times for a puzzle-related editorial position. It mentioned quality and innovation, and I supposed it was for Games. The copy didnt say whose ad it was, though, and interested parties were supposed to respond to a blind box number. I thought Id beat the competition by applying for the job personally. So I put on a coat and tie, took the train into New York, walked into Gamess offices on 53rd Street and announced I was there for their position. It turned out the ad was not theirs, and no position was open. The editor, Mike Donner, saw me anyway. We hit it off. I got freelance editing work within a few months and a staff position by the end of the year.

It was a dream job for a young puzzler, and it had a talented staff, which at one time or another included Henry Hook, Mike Shenk, Peter Gordon, Emily Cox/Henry Rathvon and other notables of the modern puzzle world. Whenever Merl Reagle was in town, he stopped by. Games was like a laboratory of innovative puzzle ideas for a new generation of puzzlers. Most of the rules of modern crosswords originated there.

Q.

How soon did you have your eye on the most prestigious job in puzzles, crossword editor of The New York Times? What was the hiring process like? It must have been an exciting time for you.

A.

Being editor of the Times crossword wasnt something I dreamed about, because, frankly, I didnt consider myself educated or cultured enough. I grew up in rural Indiana. The job also felt restrictive. Im interested in all kinds of puzzles, not just crosswords. But when my predecessor at The Times, Eugene T. Maleska, died in 1993, I applied for the job. Im told that three candidates were seriously considered. Jack Rosenthal, the editor of The Times Magazine, interviewed each of us and asked us to submit samples of our work. The first question I was asked was what I would do differently if I were the crossword editor. I said my goal would be to continue the tradition of culture and quality, but I would do several new things: 1) add bylines to the daily puzzles, so the constructors would no longer labor anonymously; 2) reduce crosswordese and obscurity; 3) broaden the cultural references in the crossword to include modern subjects; and 4) encourage young constructors. Whatever I said must have worked.

Q.

I remember very well when you made your debut with a Sunday puzzle that delighted many but set off controversy. You seemed to have been trying to make your mark right away, but not everyone was pleased. What was that time like?

A.

Yes, my first puzzle  a Sunday by Peter Gordon in which solvers were to fill certain squares not with letters but with colors of the rainbow  caused a lot of comment pro and con. (Download that crossword in Across Lite format or view the solution.)

Mainly, I remember my start as being a very stressful time, because all my predecessors were deceased, and none of them could give me advice. Id just bought and moved into my first house, besides. Having devoted my life to puzzles, including being at Games for 15 years and founding/directing the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament since 1978, I thought I knew just about everything there was to know about crosswords. But The Times has a special audience - older, more educated, and more cultured than I was used to.

At the start, I was bombarded with complaints that my puzzles were too easy and that I was dumbing things down. I was getting at least 75 letters a week, all of which The Times expected me to answer personally, which was stressful as well. And I thought, All right, you want hard? Ill show you what hard is! So I went to the other extreme ... and complaints poured in the other way. After about six months, I settled into my eventual routine, in which I created a fairly steep slope of difficulty through the week - easy/medium on Monday (probably easier than the Monday puzzles had ever been) and very hard on Friday and Saturday (harder than theyd ever been). Eventually, most solvers seemed satisfied.

Q.

You get credit for evolving puzzles considerably over your 17 years at The Times. What changes are you most proud of?

A.

Im proud of:



enlivening the puzzle themes with fresh ideas and pushing the boundaries of the crossword form.

greatly lessening the amount of crosswordese and uninteresting obscurity.

introducing in-the-language phrases as puzzle entries and encouraging their use.

broadening the cultural references in both the clues and answers to include modern subjects alongside the old ones.

introducing a variety word puzzle (Split Decisions, Spiral, 3-D Word Hunt, etc.) in the Sunday Magazine rotation, once every six weeks.

in general, including more playfulness and brain-twisting in the puzzles.

Q.

You clearly make a conscious effort to keep puzzles fresh and, in particular, you foster new constructor talent and encourage innovation beyond the standard formats. How do you strike the right balance?

A.

I try to include something for everyone. Probably nobody will like every Times puzzle I edit, but I hope everyone likes enough of the puzzles to keep coming back. If, for example, several wacky Thursday puzzles appear in a row, chances are the next few will be more straightforward. And vice versa.

As for the constructors, I try to include as broad a range of talent as possible. In the whole history of the Times crossword up to me (1942-93), only three teenagers are known to have been published. Ive published 23 teenagers in just 17 years. At the other extreme, Bernice Gordon is still going strong at age 97, and Mel Taub is continuing his 50-plus-year Times tradition of Puns and Anagrams.

Q.

Thats remarkable. Youre a big name in conventions and tournaments as well. Youre involved with the National Puzzlers League, your American Crossword Puzzle Tournament has become a huge success and you founded the World Puzzle Championship. Why are these important to you?

A.

If one theme runs through my career, it is my effort to bring people together and touch peoples lives through puzzles. All the above activities  as well as my weekly NPR puzzle  further this purpose.

Q.

I like that. Thanks so much, Will, for agreeing to chat with me. One final question: The world is changing and more people get both their news and their entertainment online. Have you had to adapt how you think about your product in a changing market? What is the future of crosswords and other puzzles?

A.

In my opinion, crosswords and most pencil puzzles are better suited for print than online, so I think the popularity of crosswords will decline a little when print dies. But they will always be with us. Im told that more than 50,000 people are currently subscribed to the Timess crosswords online, which is a testament both to the quality of the puzzles as well as to the enduring appeal of the form.",[]

INDOORS: The multilevel 2007 house was designed by Glenn Vogel, a sculptor and architectural metal fabricator who runs a wine-rack fabrication business called De Botello Wine Systems. Inspired by mining structures in California and Colorado, the exterior is corrugated Cor-Ten steel, with walls of glass facing Mount Evans in the Front Range.

The interior has an open, industrial ambience, with hydronically heated concrete floors, corrugated metal ceilings and exposed metal beams throughout. The front doors open to a foyer with a 26-foot ceiling and a water feature made of descending copper bowls. Eight 400-gallon Cor-Ten planters hold tropical plants. Stairs lead up to the main-level great room, a 2,000-square-foot space with a 28-foot ceiling from which copper and aluminum lanterns are suspended by metal cables, all designed by Mr. Vogel.

The living area has a fireplace with a copper surround and two old chairlift seats bolted to the ceiling that rock back and forth. The kitchen has a granite bar with seating for 12. The dining area is a few steps away. Surfaces and cabinets in the kitchen are either stainless steel or copper, while appliances include a heavy-duty Imperial range and a GE Monogram refrigerator and freezer. Glass doors throughout the main level open to a wraparound concrete patio on the grade of the land.

The upstairs master suite and gym are reached by a curving staircase and connected by a steel-grate walkway over the great room. A two-sided fireplace in the bedroom separates the sleeping area from a jetted tub; a hand-carved wall of frosted glass slides away to open the suite to the great room below. The bedroom also opens to a private deck. The picture windows in the gym face the Front Range. Another staircase on the main level leads to the other three bedrooms, as well as a family room and office.

The studio is detached, and has its own deck. The property also has a three-car attached garage.

OUTDOOR SPACE: The house is on an acre. The concrete patio off the main level has an outdoor kitchen with a granite bar, a 48-inch grill, a Garland range and oven, stainless-steel counter space and a sink. Also on the property is a small granite amphitheater with a wood-burning fire pit. The house is framed by large granite outcroppings, jutting out of the ground.

HOW MUCH: $1,795,000, fully furnished

SIZE: 2,980 square feet

PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT: $602

SETTING: Coral Gables is a coastal city of about 50,000 people, just south of Miami. This house is in Chinese Village, one of a handful of themed neighborhoods designed during the 1920s to add architectural diversity to the citys predominantly Mediterranean palette. The village was designed by Henry Murphy, an architect and scholar who worked in both the United States and China, including for Chiang Kai-shek on a modern capital for China in Nanjing. The eight houses are linked by a shared wall with ornamental gates, creating the ambience of a compound. Downtown Coral Gables is about two miles away; downtown Miami five miles; and Miami Beach about 15 miles.

INDOORS: The house was built in 1926 and updated within the last two years. Renovations were done in part by Alicia Kossick, who runs a store called the Polished Coconut in nearby Coconut Grove. Most of the furniture in the house comes from the store, which specializes in handcrafted goods made by women.

The two-story house is set back from the street, behind a 10-foot wall and courtyard. Almost all of Mr. Murphys original designs, including circular moon gates marking transitions between the front and side courtyards, a roof with Ludowici tiles, and second-story balustrades with ornately interlocking beams, have been maintained or replicated by the current owner.

The entryway, on the side of the structure, opens to a living room with intersecting walls of leaded-glass doors opening to the backyard. Similar doors in the dining room open to the front courtyard. The kitchen has been updated with a Sub-Zero refrigerator, a Miele dishwasher and a Viking range. Where possible, the original octagonal white tiles were kept in the bathroom floors.

Two bedrooms are on the main floor; the other three, including the master, are upstairs. The master bedroom is a large suite with a walk-in closet and an en-suite bathroom. It has two Juliet balconies. The upstairs hallway has three sets of doors opening to an outdoor walkway along the side of the house, leading to an upstairs terrace. The property has a two-car garage.

OUTDOOR SPACE: The house is on a fifth of an acre, walled and gated, with a landscaped yard.

Fashion Month comes to an end today in Paris, and weve seen plenty of trends on the runways: from extra-warm shearling and new plays on puffer coats to reimagined check and leopard patterns, plus deliciously goth black velvet and lace.

We heard some trends, too: most notably, gleeful throwbacks to the late 70s and 80s. Throughout the shows in New York, London, Milan and Paris, designers dialed back the soundtracks by three decades, from the drama-fueled synth pop of the Pet Shop Boys Left to My Own Devices (at Philosophy di Alberta Ferretti) to Rick Jamess funky Mary Jane at Brandon Maxwell to Madonnas Oh Father at Hood By Air and the MJ classic Dont Stop Til You Get Enough at Tommy Hilfiger.

But the undisputed king of the fall/winter season was David Bowie: Multiple shows paid tribute to the late singer, on models hands, on jackets and on their soundtracks. A sampling: Brandon Maxwell played Under Pressure, his collaboration with Queen, BCBG Max Azria played a remix of Lets Dance and Donatella Versace closed out her show with Ground Control to Major Tom.

Even before revelations that the Fox Sports reporter Erin Andrews was secretly videotaped naked by a stalker in a hotel room in 2008, female sportscasters have understood how frightening obsessed fans can be.









Andrea Kremer recalled being in a hotel room while she was at NFL Films in 1988 when a man called late at night as she was falling asleep.

He started saying all these things he wanted to do to me, and it scared the living hell out of me, Kremer, who is now with NFL Network and HBO Sports, said. I hung up, called downstairs, and said: I got a really threatening call. Can you trace it? They said it was coming from inside the hotel. Then he called back  it was so chilling and terrifying. I was shaking. My heart was beating fast.

After another call to the front desk, she said, the hotel stationed a security guard outside her door.

I told the men on my crew, and they were livid, she said. They said: Why didnt you call us? We would have slept on the floor.

In an age of round-the-clock sports broadcasting and the widespread dissemination of their work across social media, female sportscasters have unparalleled reach. There are more of them now than ever, across multiple channels and websites.

But the flip side can be unwanted attention from an audience that is male dominated, from stalkers or even from self-described fans who recognize them and simply get uncomfortably close.

Female newscasters and celebrities have long faced such harassment and threats  one newscaster in St. Louis two years ago said she had to quit her job under repeated threats from a stalker  but some sportscasters work in potentially vulnerable and highly visible places like stadiums and arenas where they are in close proximity to passionate fans, many of them males.

They routinely take precautions like asking hotel clerks not to say their name loudly when checking in, refusing to step in elevators if they see glaring male eyes, and opting for private transportation in late hours, to avoid the flock of people who often gather outside studios, innocently or not. Some check to make sure the hotel door peephole has not been tampered with, as it was in Andrewss case.

In one of the most disturbing episodes faced by a female sportscaster, a determined fan named Michael David Barrett used a hacksaw to alter the peepholes of Andrewss hotel rooms in Nashville and Columbus, Ohio. Jurors on Monday found Barrett and the companies that manage the Nashville Marriott responsible for invading Andrewss privacy and awarded her $55 million in damages.

Jessica Mendoza, an analyst on ESPNs Sunday Night Baseball, said that what happened to Andrews made her wonder about taking more than minor precautions like closing the blinds in hotel rooms.

You think about all the times youre in a room  and how scary that someone could see me in there, she said.

But even less egregious encounters can leave female sportscasters unsettled and almost always on guard.

Ill try to avoid ever being in the hall of a hotel by myself, Kim Jones, a reporter for NFL Network, said. And Ill allow whoever is behind me to pass me before I put my card or key in the door. You have to be so aware because unfortunately that one time out of 10,000 something can happen.

Alyssa Roenigk, a reporter for ESPNs magazine who also appears on ESPN television, primarily covering action sports like the X Games, said she rarely gave her security much thought. For years, she usually walked from venues to her hotel, even late at night. But as she began to do more television, and was recognized more often, she was told by her bosses to start taking the courtesy car provided by the network.

At first I thought I was getting special treatment, and I dont want special treatment, Roenigk said. Its not special treatment. Its being safe.

Jamie Little of Fox Sports, who primarily covers Nascar and other motor sports, said: Just last week, I got on an elevator and there were some race fans in there, and they were drinking and it made me a little nervous. And they were kind of watching what floor I was going to, so I pressed the wrong floor. So I go to the wrong floor, get off the elevator, wait for them to go and get back on.

In another instance, she said, she was on an airport shuttle on her way to pick up a rental car when a man approached her. She is still not sure if he was an ardent fan, or something else.

This guy turns right into me and says, Hey, Jamie, so you going to so-and-so today? I was like, Whoa, hey, well, Im here for Nascar,  she recalled. And he kept trying to make small talk. I went down another escalator, and when I looked over, he was literally standing there staring at me, on his phone.

That kind of stuff makes you worry, she continued. You want to give people the benefit of the doubt. Yeah, Im on TV, its not a big deal. But you have to watch the mannerisms, the body language, the constant following you as they try to ask questions. I tend to be overly nice to people. When weird things happen, I honestly kind of forget about it because its your job and Ive got to get on a plane the next week.

Laura Okmin, a sideline reporter for N.F.L. games on Fox, dealt with a stalker in the mid-1990s when she was working at a TV station in Chattanooga, Tenn. The man became angry when she did not respond to letters he sent her and gifts he dropped off for her. Eventually, police officers escorted her home several times and security was provided at events that she covered. Later, a man kept calling her at every hotel she checked into.

She uses these experiences at seminars she holds for aspiring female sportscasters at her company, Galvanize.

I tell them that sometimes someone will be lovely and pay you a great compliment, but if you dont respond the right way in person or on social media, they turn angry and belligerent, she said. Nowadays, it can be 24/7 with all the ways they can come at you.

After the jury award, Andrews was thankful for the encouragement she said she had received from other victims of harassment, and she suggested the cases outcome would improve safety.

Ive been honored by all the support from victims around the world, she said on Twitter. Their outreach has helped me be able to stand up and hold accountable those whose job it is to protect everyones safety, security and privacy.",[]

She joined the papers staff in January of last year after graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she was named College Photographer of the Year in a separate national competition associated with POYi.

Todd Heisler of The New York Times placed second in the Newspaper Photographer of the Year category and Alon Skuy of The Times in Johannesburg took third.

Paolo Marchetti, an Italian freelance photographer represented by Getty Images, was named Photographer of the Year, with Espen Rasmussen of the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang taking second and Chip Somodevilla of Getty images third.

The New York Times was named Best Publication by POYi, which is a program of the University of Missouri School of Journalism. The Times also won first place in the Newspaper Visual Editing category as well as 14 other awards. Mr. Heisler took first place for Sports Picture Story for Hardwood, a look at a New York City high school basketball team. Joshua Z. Weinstein received the top award in Multimedia Feature Story for a Times Op-Doc video, Holocaust Survivor Band.

In news photography contests, the top-prize winners are most often entrants who travel far from their homes to cover dramatic events. Those doing strong work in their own communities, unless they live in a war zone, are more likely to be passed by.

This year, the Pictures of the Year International competition tried to alter that dynamic by tweaking its two divisions. The open category, which Mr. Marchetti, 41, won, continues to be for all photographers working anywhere in the world. But the newspaper categories are now focused on those working in their local areas. This does not prohibit newspaper photographers from entering the open categories if they traveled outside their region.

There are so many important local stories and issues that often get overshadowed in competitions by the big global news events, said Rick Shaw, director of POYi. We wanted to recognize great photo stories produced in photographers own backyards.

Ms. Van Houten, 25, said that there are stories everywhere, though they may sometimes be more subtle or harder to find.

National Geographic won the Angus MacDougall Overall Excellence in Editing Award as well as the Documentary Project of the Year for its environmental issue Cool It.

The Timess sports photo editors Becky Lebowitz Hanger and Jeffrey Furticella received first and second places as well as an award of excellence in the Print Feature Story Editing.

Andrew Ellis of MediaStorm was named the Multimedia Photographer of the Year. Second place went to Katie Falkenberg of The Los Angeles Times and third to Jonah M. Kessel, a video journalist for The New York Times who was also was cited in two other categories.

Al Bello of Getty Images was named Sports Photographer of the Year. Hossein Fatemi took the World Understanding Award for An Iranian Journey, which was first published on Lens. Casper Dalhoff received the Community Awareness Award for A Commitment to Life. The Environmental Vision Award went to Brent Stirton of Getty Images for Ivory Wars, while Stephen Dupont received the Best Photography Book Award for Generation AK.

Yunghi Kim took first place in the General News category for a photo of the funeral of Freddie Gray, a black man from Baltimore whose death from an injury suffered in police custody set off nationwide protests.

Robin Hammond took first place in Portrait Series for his images of L.G.B.T. people living in countries where homosexuality is illegal. The series was featured on Lens last September. Mark Peterson took first for his political photos in the News Picture Story category and Gabriella Demczuk took third for work made on assignment for The Times. Ms. Demczuk also received special recognition from the judges in the Community Awareness category. Bryan Denton, a freelancer for The New York Times, received third place in the Feature category.

The Times also took first in the Online News and Issues Story Editing category for Walking in Wars Path, with photographs by Tomas Munita, text by Jodi Rudoren and Isabel Kershner and produced by David Furst, Jon Huang and Sergio Pecanha. The Times also placed third in the category with Josh Haners Greenland Is Melting Away, produced with Coral Davenport, Larry Buchanan and Derek Watkins.

Mr. Furst, The Timess international photo editor, was also part of a team that placed second in the Online Feature Story Editing category for David Guttenfelders Illuminating North Korea. It was produced by Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Douglas Schorzman, Rumsey Taylor and Mr. Furst.

In Multimedia News Story, Francesco Zizola of Noor placed first and Samantha Stark of The Times took second for How a Love Story Triumphed in Court. Is Nadia Sussman received an honorable mention for The Times for In Rio, Pacification Without Peace.

A Syrian freelance photographer covering his countrys conflict for Agence France-Presse won first place for Spot News and an award of excellence for News Picture Story. The same photographer took second in the World Press Photo contests General News category this year. Although AFP sends out the photographs under the name Abd Doumany, it is a pseudonym.

When asked about the use of pseudonyms last week, Francis Kohn, AFPs photo director, confirmed that Abd Doumany was not the photographers real name. He said that local Syrian photographers and their families might be in danger if their actual names were published.

We thought it was fine for these guys, he said. They chose their own names. And we agreed to that. We have a policy that we use real names, but in some really extraordinary circumstances we agree to use other names. The alternative would be to just use stringer, which we do sometimes.

Photo

The New York Times does not use pseudonyms in credits to avoid the risk of misleading readers, but will omit photographers real name if they might be in danger. The Times has previously published AFP photos using the credit Abd Doumany both online and in print without knowing it was a pseudonym. The Times has also published AFP photographs credited to Sameer Al-Doumy, another name that Mr. Kohn confirmed was a pseudonym.

Until he was contacted by Lens today, Mr. Shaw, of POYi, said he was not aware that Abd Doumany was a pseudonym.

We understand that there are situations that we would not want to put somebody in jeopardy, Mr. Shaw said. I think its acceptable under certain circumstances that Anonymous or a pseudonym can be used as a credit, as long as we can be transparent and divulge that to our audiences.

Mr. Shaw also said that he would contact AFP and ask for a clarification, which would be added to the list of winners.

My heart is with the photographers in the trenches working in conflict, he said. I want to do the right thing so they can continue to bring the images of conflict that we need to see.

Admission fees, normally $18 for adults and $12 for children, seniors and students, will be waived from 7 pm on April 15 through closing on April 17.

We have four terrific exhibitions on view, live classical music and jazz, and a variety of programming throughout the museum, Colin Bailey, the Morgans director, said in an email. I can think of no better way of marking this milestone than by sharing it with the people of New York.

Ten years ago, an expansion designed by the architect Renzo Piano added 75,000 square feet to the Morgans existing campus. A new, modern steel-and-glass entrance on Madison Avenue took the place of the smaller, more old-fashioned entrance to the museums original Gilded Age building around the corner on East 36th Street. Until then, the institution had been known simply as the Morgan Library.

LONDON  Buckingham Palace said on Wednesday that it had filed a formal complaint against The Sun, Britains biggest tabloid, after the newspaper reported that Queen Elizabeth II supported the countrys departure from the European Union.









A referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union will take place on June 23. It is a major test for Prime Minister David Cameron, who in 2013 promised a vote on the issue. After recently securing concessions from Brussels to reflect Britains special status in the European Union, he is calling on Britons to vote to remain in the 28-nation bloc.

The Sun, citing anonymous sources, reported on Tuesday that the queen had made her skepticism of the European Union known during a lunch at Windsor Castle with Nick Clegg, who was the deputy prime minister under the previous government, and at a reception at Buckingham Palace with members of Parliament. The newspaper did not provide dates or any other details of the two occasions.

A spokeswoman for the royal family denied the report.

The queen remains politically neutral, as she has for 63 years, the spokeswoman said Tuesday evening, speaking on the condition of anonymity under palace rules. We will not comment on spurious, anonymously sourced claims. The referendum is a matter for the British people to decide.

In a statement on Wednesday, the spokeswoman added, I can confirm that we have this morning written to the chairman of the Independent Press Standards Organization to register a complaint about the front-page story in todays Sun newspaper.

The organization, which was founded in 2014, is the independent news media regulator in Britain. It has the power to compel members to publish corrections, and, in cases where failings are particularly serious and systemic, it can impose financial penalties.

The spokeswoman for the royal household said the complaint, the first the monarchy has made with the new regulator, was filed under Clause 1 of the Editors Code of Practice, which states: The press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text.

The Sun stood by its article. Its political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, was quoted by the BBC as saying that its information came from two different and impeccably placed sources. On Twitter, Mr. Clegg called The Suns article nonsense. He said that he had no recollection of this happening, and that it was not the sort of thing I would forget.

The palaces decision to file a complaint is unusual. In 1999 and 2012, the royal household opened cases with the Press Complaints Commission, the predecessor to the Independent Press Standards Organization, after embarrassing images of members of the royal family were circulated online.

The queen, who acceded to the throne in 1952 and in September became the longest-reigning British monarch, is expected to stay out of politics under Britains unwritten Constitution.

However, there are occasional glimpses into her personal views.

In September 2014, before a referendum on whether Scotland should leave the United Kingdom, she told a well-wisher in Scotland that she hoped people will think very carefully about the future, a remark that was interpreted as suggesting that she opposed Scottish independence.

Last month, the queens grandson Prince William, who is second in line to the throne, after Prince Charles, was seen as supporting staying in the European Union when he said at a speech in London, For centuries, Britain has been an outward-looking nation, and added: We have a long, proud tradition of seeking out allies and partners.

In both instances, the royal household denied that the monarchy was taking a political stance.",[]

Tilikum, the orca whose killing of a trainer at a SeaWorld park in Orlando became the focus of the documentary Blackfish, has been found to have a respiratory disease that could likely end in death, his caretakers said.

According to a statement by SeaWorld, the killer whale, known to his caretakers as Tili, has been in captivity since 1983, and is estimated to be around 35 years old.

In an accompanying video, Tilikums veterinarian, Dr. Scott Gearhart, said that the bacteria found in the orcas lungs is found also in wild marine animals, and that theres no doubt in my mind that care at SeaWorld prolonged his life.

I wish I could say I was tremendously optimistic about Tilikum and his future, Dr. Gearhart said, but he has a disease which is chronic and progressive, and at some point might cause his death.

As Tilikum grows more lethargic, workers at SeaWorld have also been struggling to keep his teeth, which have been damaged for years, free of bacteria. (A 2010 report by Outside Online said that Tilikum had developed a habit of chewing on metal pool gates during his time in captivity at a park in Canada, before he was moved to SeaWorld in 1992.)

Tilikum, a whale that has been involved in the deaths of three people, has been central to the scrutiny SeaWorld has faced since February 2010, when the 12,000 bull orca bit down on the ponytail of Dawn Brancheau, a 40-year-old trainer, before dragging her underwater and killing her. The whale has also been involved in the deaths of two other people: Keltie Byrne, a 21-year-old student and part-time trainer who slipped into a pool containing Tilikum and two other orcas in 1991, and Daniel P. Dukes, a 27-year-old man who slipped into SeaWorld after hours in 1999. He was found dead, draped over Tilikums back.

After Ms. Brancheaus death, SeaWorld conducted an extensive review that resulted in trainers further isolating themselves from the animals for safety. But Tilikums problematic history has made him a unique case.

Tilikum is basically psychotic, the marine biologist Ken Balcomb told Outside Online in 2010. He has been maintained in a situation where I think he is psychologically unrecoverable in terms of being a wild whale.

In 2013, the scrutiny returned, and intensified, when the documentary Blackfish probed the death of Ms. Brancheau by examining the mental state of whales that are taken from their pods in the wild and raised at marine parks. The film essentially makes the point that whales, which are perceptive and highly intelligent animals, suffer mental and physical harm after they are plucked from the wild.

Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox. Monday  Friday.

SeaWorld has been aggressive in its rebuttal of the films accusations, but the company continues to deal with claims that trainers are improperly trained, and is combating scrutiny over breeding whales in captivity. In October, California banned the breeding of captive whales, and a month later, SeaWorld San Diego said that it would phase out its killer whale performances.

Animal rights activists have now seized upon SeaWorlds announcement about Tilikums health. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals posted a series of messages to Twitter, blaming the water park for isolating Tilikum and subjecting the whale to emotional stress over a period of decades, causing him to succumb to mental illness resulting in aggression and now to some incurable illness.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,The Politics of the Hoodie,['Troy Patterson'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

On a recent night, shopping online for a light jacket or a cotton sweater  some kind of outerwear to guard my body against a springlike breeze  I clicked on the new arrivals page of the website of a popular retailer and encountered, unexpectedly, another instance of the complex oddity of race. Here, projecting catalog-model cordiality in the sterile space of an off-white backdrop, was a young black man in a hoodie.









On the street, a black guy in a hoodie is just another of the many millions of men and boys dressed in the practical gear of an easygoing era. Or he should be. This is less an analysis than a wish. The electric charge of the isolated image  which provokes a flinch away from thought, a desire to evade the issue by moving on to check the sizing guide  attests to a consciousness of the hoodies recent history of peculiar reception. In a cardigan or a crew neck, this model is just another model. In the hoodie, he is a folk demon and a scapegoat, a political symbol and a moving target, and the system of signs that weighs this upon him does not make special distinctions for an Italian cashmere hoodie timelessly designed in heather gray.

Watching Beyonces recent video for Formation, with its set piece showing a black child in a hooded sweatshirt disarming a rank of riot police with his dance moves, most Americans grasped the outfit as a rhetorical device serving a dreamlike declaration about protest and civil rights. During the N.F.L. playoffs, football fans saw the quarterback Cam Newton, the locus of a running dialogue about blackness, wear hoodies to interviews, and they read tweets that called him a thug for it. The boxing movie Creed,  starring Michael B. Jordan opposite Sylvester Stallone, who made the hoodie a fixture in Rocky (1976)  features rousing scenes of Jordan jogging across Philadelphia in a gray hoodie. The transfer of the garment from the old white champ to the young black contender plays as an echo of the films broader racial politics.

At the computer, prodded out of the rhythm of browsing, I tried to imagine the meetings that led to this catalog model being placed in this hoodie, in the vacuum of commercial space. Beyond the usual earnest discussion of the styling of his pushed-up sleeves and the asymmetrical dangle of his drawstrings, there had to have been delicate conversations, informed by H.R. policy and P.C. etiquette, straightforward aesthetic concerns and knotty social ones. It is impossible that the production designers were ignorant of the ghost of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed 17-year-old fatally shot four years ago while wearing much the same thing. Did the model present a distraction from the reality on the streets? Did the art director start feeling somehow guilty for even considering such a question? The choice to put the kid in the picture must count as a modest political act, given the rich absurdity of the codes pertaining to a harmless piece of clothing.

The hooded sweatshirt emerged as a pop political object after decades of mundane hard work. In the 1930s, the company now known as Champion Athletic Apparel began turning them out to keep football players warm on the sidelines, also attracting business from men who operated backhoes and cherry pickers and forklifts  the forefathers of style for the guys who top their hoods with hard hats turned backward.

But the hoodie did not warrant enough consideration to earn its diminutive nickname until after it was processed by B-boys, graffiti artists and break dancers in the 80s. Youth culture did the work of tugging it from the sphere of sportswear, where clothing exists to enhance performance, into the world of street wear, where clothing is performance in itself. By the 1990 release of the video for Mama Said Knock You Out, with LL Cool J styled as a boxer in his corner, his lips visible beneath a hood that shielded his eyes, the hoodie had accomplished its transformation into an element of style.

Continue reading the main story Slide Show

Like their peers in the suburbs, bundled up on BMX bikes or skateboarding in sweatshirts with the logo of Thrasher magazine, a generation of hip-hop kids found the hoodie suitable for the important adolescent work of taking up space and dramatizing the self. There was and is a theater of the hood: pulling it up with a flourish, tugging it down to settle in its energetic slouch. The hood frames a dirty look, obscures acne and anxiety, masks headphones in study hall, makes a cone of solitude that will suffice for an autonomous realm. And if, in its antisurveillance capacity, the hood plays with the visual rhetoric of menace, it is heir to a tradition in teen dressing stretching back to the birth of the teenager, when he arrived fully formed in leather jacket and bluejeans. The cover of the Wu-Tang Clans first album catches the mood: Members of the group wear black hoodies and white masks, as if to abduct the listener into a fantasy of ninja stealth.

But this was just a prologue to an era in which the hoodie became at once an anodyne style object and a subject of moral panic, its popularity and its selective stigmatization rising in proportion. A glance at almost any police blotter, or a recollection of the forensic sketch of the Unabomber, will confirm the hoodie as a wardrobe staple of the criminal class, and this makes it uniquely convenient as a proxy for racial profiling or any other exercise of enmity. The person itching to confirm a general bias against hip-hop kids or crusty punks imputes crooked character to the clothing itself.

Which brings you to the transcript of the 911 call made by Trayvon Martins killer. Dispatcher: Did you see what he was wearing? George Zimmerman: Yeah. A dark hoodie, like a gray hoodie. Trivial details can bear serious import. Surely there would have been demonstrations after the killing and the killers acquittal regardless of what the victim wore. As it happened, those demonstrators  legislators on chamber floors, marchers in the street  picked up the sweatshirt as an emblem, donning hoods in solidarity. Instantly a symbol aggrieved at having to be one, the hoodie was jolted into a curious space: Where the basic hoodie means to defend against the elements, the protest hoodie seeks to offend the right people. In the paranoid view of stodgy shopkeepers, the hoodie is to be feared for extinguishing individuality; in its politicized life, it mutes identity to signal alliance, not unlike a resistance groups uniform.

All that potential subtext is attached to a generally evocative item of clothing. The white working-class hoodie still glows with the Rocky Balboa ideal of grit and tenacity. The yoga-class hoodie is sold on a promise of snuggly virtue that may explain why in Saskatchewan they call the thing a bunny hug. The tech-sector hoodie made default by Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg carries on the garments proud juvenile tradition of informality and defiance. Once perceived as an affront to professionalism, it has since settled in as a convention.

In January, there emerged a debate in the business press regarding the rituals of dress in the tech industry and their relationship to the fields hospitableness to women. The argument proceeded in an article on Quartz headlined The Subtle Sexism of Hoodies and in counterarguments suggesting, for instance, that hoodies represent a rejection of old ideas and an openness to new ones. I was struck by the ready acceptance of the notion that a Silicon Valley hoodie was not just a prerequisite in its field, like Gucci loafers on Wall Street, but also a costume of dominance. Its visual strength abets its powers as a cultural marker, needing just a nudge to create its own contexts.

You must have seen a sitcom or TV commercial in which black actors wear hoodies in new millennial colors  mustard, maroon  to portray coders. In a current General Electric ad, for example, the costume functions as characterization, and the cheery color of the cotton somehow trumps that of the skin in terms of mass iconography. But the ascent of casual wear does not quite disguise the unchanging strictness of social codes, and the hood continues to frame matters of class and race in ways that tend to satisfy the interest of power. The lingering question of the hoodie is simply: Who enjoys the right to wear one without challenge?",[]

The Public Art Fund, which in recent years has looked far outside its New York City base for artists and projects, announced Tuesday that it had enlisted Adrian Cheng, a prominent Chinese collector and the scion of a multibillion-dollar retailing empire, to join its board.

Mr. Cheng, 36, has become more visible in the international art world in recent years through the development of an unusual business-meets-nonprofit model in China for promoting shopping and fine art at the same time. Mr. Chengs K11 Art Foundation, a nonprofit, works with his familys business to organize museumlike exhibitions (a sizable Monet show last year in Shanghai) and displays of contemporary art in the familys high-end malls. Such arrangements, which are becoming more popular among retailers in Asia, were once common in the West, though their history is now little remembered. (Michael Kimmelman, writing in The New York Times about that history in 1995, noted that the first Cubist art show in America took place at Gimbels in Pittsburgh in 1913, at a time when department stores sought to elevate the taste of their patrons and you were more likely to find high culture at A.T.

In a telephone interview from Seoul, where he was traveling, Mr. Cheng said he was interested in joining the Public Art Funds board  his first presence as a trustee for an art institution in New York  because he sees his foundations mission as fostering greater awareness of contemporary art in China, where public art institutions have often lagged. Its all about art for the masses, said Mr. Cheng, who was educated at Harvard and owns an apartment in Manhattan. So the Public Art Fund actually matches our mission.

Nicholas Baume, the Public Art Funds director and chief curator, said that as the fund became more globally engaged it was interested in a patron with a really key position in Asia.

NBCs The Carmichael Show has a simple message: America, we need to talk.









Returning after a six-episode tryout late last summer, this family sitcom starring the standup comic Jerrod Carmichael has a lot to say  about topics from guns to race to the downfall of Bill Cosby. There are more inventive sitcoms, more visually artful ones. But few are as devoted to the bracing power of strong voices in a room, talking.

Running Sunday nights on NBC (with a preview on Wednesday), The Carmichael Show is built on the barest of premises. Jerrod (Mr. Carmichael), a young man in Charlotte, N.C., finds himself caught between his liberal girlfriend, Maxine (Amber Stevens West), and his old-fashioned parents, the blue-collar Joe and the deeply religious Cynthia (David Alan Grier and Loretta Devine). An issue will arise  it will be pretty clear what, as the episode titles are along the lines of Prayer and Gender  and were off.

Yet The Carmichael Show consistently feels surprising, not formulaic, partly because of the talent assembled, partly because of Mr. Carmichaels comic philosophy of prodding his audience. (The episode in which Jerrod and Maxine argued over firearms, for instance, spoofed gun ownership and captured its allure at the same time: Its like listening to Beyonces album, Jerrod said of packing heat. You just feel stronger and prettier for some reason.)

The Carmichael Show is part of a mini-revival of issues-oriented sitcoms, in the spirit of the 1970s comedies of Norman Lear, who produced All in the Family and Good Times (and is rebooting One Day at a Time for Netflix with Latino characters). CBSs Mom tells stories about addiction and recovery, Foxs Bordertown is rooted in the immigration war and Louis C.K.s self-distributed Horace and Pete has dabbled in commentary on the 2016 election.

Thematically, The Carmichael Show has most in common with black-ish  also about an African-American family, albeit a more affluent one  which in its second season has redoubled its social commentary. Black-ish has recently done episodes on handguns and the Black Lives Matter protests, subjects The Carmichael Show tackled last summer.

Where black-ish has a more contemporary look, shooting single-camera and using more locations, The Carmichael Show is unapologetically old-school, shot multiple-camera on sets. (Joe and Cynthias living room even recalls Edith and Archie Bunkers.)

The staging determines the shows style. Its more playlike and hermetic; big events largely happen offstage, and the characters recount and debate them in the home and apartment sets. The action is almost all verbal.

This is a more theatrical style of sitcom, and the show benefits from the brassy stage duet of Mr. Grier and Ms. Devine. Mr. Carmichael, in the grand tradition of stand-ups-turned-actors, can deliver a bone-dry punch line, but needs a seasoned cast around him.

The new season kicks off with Everybody Cheats, a moral-dilemma story  Cynthia sees a friends husband with another woman  that unfolds into an argument about ethics, double standards and power. Cynthia worries about hurting her friend, Maxine argues that a good friend has to tell, and Jerrod cynically argues that successful men cheat, and the world accepts it: Hillary Clintons running for president, and we think shes weak because she should have left, he says. But if Bill Clinton walked through that door, wed all go, Oh my God, its Bill Clinton!

The second new episode, Fallen Heroes, is about Bill Cosby, and it is on fire. Jerrod surprises Maxine with tickets to Mr. Cosbys stand-up show, which she rejects because of the dozens of accusations of sexual assault against him. The ironic part, Maxine says, is you would have to knock me unconscious to get me to go see Bill Cosby.

The episode doesnt much debate whether Mr. Cosby is guilty. Instead, it turns on the audience: Can you separate love of the art from knowledge of the man?

Airing on Mr. Cosbys old network, this episode feels like a leaders statue being pulled down in a public square. Even when the family laughs warmly at a rerun of The Cosby Show, Mr. Carmichael caustically deflates the moment: Damn shame what he did to those women, though.

That gaspworthy kicker is the essence of The Carmichael Show, which is less interested in persuading its audience than denying them easy refuge. This sitcom is trying to say a lot right off the bat, and it sometimes knocks up against the cardboard edges of its characters. But its on its way to becoming one of TVs finer discomfort zones.",[]

By Barb Rosenstock. Illustrated by Gerard DuBois.

Dorothea Langes life is an example of art triumphing over many of the tougher, grimmer realities, and its also the story of an innovator who forged new ways of looking at things. This biography covers some difficult ground by breaking down Langes story into simple ideas, like her commitment to always seeing with her eyes and her heart. We learn of Dorotheas bout with polio at age 7, which left her with a forever-withered leg, and her decision during the Great Depression to leave her comfortable life  and, though its not explicitly mentioned, her two young sons  to document the lives of the poor and suffering. DuBoiss art creates a kind of vintage paper doll effect, with figures set against white space and little rubbed-out areas of acrylic paint. Not until the text is done do we get to see a few of Dorotheas photographs, which might seem like a curious editorial decision, though perhaps the images enormous emotional impact is heightened by the wait.",[]

A Hedwig and the Angry Inch reunion of sorts will arrive at Cafe Carlyle this month, set to the music of ... Radiohead.

Lena Hall and Michael C. Hall, who appeared opposite each other in Hedwig in 2014-5, will perform a tribute titled Radiohead: Obsessed, on March 19.

The duo (who are not related) will perform songs from the bands early days, when it originated with the 1992 single Creep, to its last album, The King of Limbs, which was released in 2011. Radiohead will play several festival dates this summer, and a new album is expected this year.

Ms. Hall, a Tony winner, performed at the Carlyle last spring, and has made Radioheads Karma Police part of her recent repertoire. (Last month, she wrote on Twitter that she had recorded the song.) Mr. Hall recently played in the lead role in the musical Lazarus, one of David Bowies last projects.

nytimes.com,2016-03-03 00:00:00,The Puerto Rican Lower East Side,"['David Gonzalez', 'Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Reference Timestopics People G David_gonzalez Index Html']","When I first came across Arlene Gottfrieds vintage pictures of Puerto Rican New York, Bacalaitos & Fireworks, I chuckled. Her reference to the siren call of a Lower East Side street vendor hawking codfish fritters and firecrackers struck me as having all the ingredients for a Fourth of July party (just add Bacardi). My second reaction was nervousness  given the areas devastation from poverty and drugs during the 1970s and 1980s, how would the photographer portray this world?

With love and humor, it turns out.

This is not to say that Ms. Gottfried glossed over the untidy parts of the local narrative. It was impossible not to notice the empty lots, the dazed junkies, the weary-faced couples. But she did not let herself be mesmerized by that. She delved into the community, where her mother had moved after decades in Crown Heights, and connected with its residents who, in turn, embraced her and her camera.

She documented birthday parties in spotless living rooms (with chairs sheathed in plastic slipcovers); whole pigs roasting on a spit in an empty lot; religious services and funerals, first communions and parades. Her camera also singled out critical, if sometimes overlooked, cultural figures like Jorge Brandon, considered to be the father of Nuyorican poetry. In more than a few images, she has Miguel Pinero, the poet, playwright, addict and criminal whose life was as complicated as it was short.

Most of the images were from the Lower East Side  Loisaida  although she also took some in Brooklyn and the Bronx, as well as along the Fifth Avenue route of the Puerto Rican Day Parade.

It was a mixture of excitement, devastation and drug use, said Ms. Gottfried, who will be exhibiting a selection of these images at Daniel Cooney Fine Art in Chelsea from March 3 through April 16. But there was more than just that. It was the people, the humanity of the situation. You had very good people there trying to make it.

Photo

Ms. Gottfrieds ability to connect to communities of color is something she credits to her family having stayed in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, even after many of her white neighbors fled during the 1960s. She became friends with the newcomers.

By the 1970s, her mother had moved to the Lower East Side  where she herself would live in the 1990s  and she visited often. Looking beyond the jarring landscape, she found the people to be welcoming. She ended up taking pictures for years, not with any specific project in mind.

In some cases, she would be struck by what she encountered, like the procession of girls about to make their first communion, walking down the street past televisions perched on cars and connected by extension cords to lampposts. Or the time someone told her to keep walking down the street.

Wait until you see what you find down the block, she recalled being told. And there was this pig roast. You get exposed to all that being outside. It was a lot of fun.

Her pictures reflect that, including touches of humor and warmth familiar to anyone who grew up during that time, when residents often had only each other for support.

The humor comes from being with the people, Ms. Gottfried said. Part of it is how I see life. You know, the humanity. There was openness, and I felt really comfortable. It was a mixture of excitement, joy and warmth. There was this striking beauty the people had.

Photo

Her pictures of some of the areas cultural figures  whom she often encountered at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe  also show the areas rich creativity.

It was a big mixture of people involved in all kinds of things, she said. I used to enjoy having conversations with people and bumping into people you knew. The musicians and the actors, there was a lot of theater going on at the cafe and other places. We could go to Henry Street Settlement and there would be a free Tito Puente concert.

Ms. Gottfried would go on to other projects, other assignments. The area would undergo a major transformation, attracting newcomers to renovated tenements and luxury buildings. Some pockets of the old world remain, which makes her feel sentimental.

Money came in and changed everything, she said. But it was an experience I had and others didnt. I was able to go to places other people would only see in pictures.

And not all change was unwelcome. Over the years, she had photographed Johnny Cintron, looking rough and covered with tattoos. She even visited him in jail and took a picture of him there. She always remembered him as a smart guy who went astray.

Two years ago, Mr. Cintron tracked her down on Facebook. The two decided to meet at Tompkins Square Park.

Walking through there, I was bumping into people I knew, Ms. Gottfried recalled. I was sitting there thinking, how will I recognize Johnny? Then, I saw a man standing with his back to me. I recognized him from behind, how he stood. There he was. Hes all cleaned up, married, looking good and doing well. Thank God for that.

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Real Madrid Advances in Champions League but Has Reason to Worry,['Rob Hughes'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

LONDON  Real Madrid needs to win the Champions League the way a capsized crew needs a life raft. Its team, one of the most expensive ever assembled, won at home, 2-0, to complete what looked like a rout of Roma over the two legs.









Looks can be deceiving.

Though Cristiano Ronaldo scored again for his 90th goal in 123 Champions League appearances, the evidence is that the good ship Real Madrid is less of a force and less complete than Barcelona or Bayern Munich, the two most impressive teams in this years tournament.

For more than an hour Tuesday in Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, it was Roma that created the better chances.

Created, and squandered.

If only Roma had a finisher remotely like Ronaldo, it would have comfortably wiped out the two-goal deficit it dug for itself after losing the first leg. Im asking my team to do the impossible, Roma Coach Luciano Spalletti had said before the game in Madrid. The way they are training allows me to ask that. But we mustnt be weak mentally.

Roma has excelled in Italy this year  it has won seven straight in Serie A  and Spalletti easily identified the obvious flaw in Madrids lineup. He told his players, particularly the speedy Egyptian winger Mohamed Salah, to get behind Madrids left back, Marcelo, and create havoc there.

Salah did that part to perfection. Marcelo is adventurous at going forward and linking up with Ronaldo, but the Brazilian has barely any inclination to fulfill his defensive duties.

Madrid Manager Zinedine Zidane, a marvelous player who now is a rookie coach, appeared happy enough to pick Marcelo. Why? Perhaps because what Zidane best knows and loves about soccer is attacking and exploiting the opponents weakness. He did it par excellence as a Real Madrid forward. And earlier this week, one of his players, Raphael Varane, said, He is a coach who loves the game and loves attacking football. He likes movement, moving the ball around quickly and playing higher up the pitch.

Marcelo, then, is a definite Zidane pick. But the risks are obvious: On Tuesday night, Salah (twice), Edin Dzeko and Alessandro Florenzi were in good position to score, one on one, against the Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas.

Only once did the goalkeeper need to show his agility to make the save. The other three shots went wide. And Spallettis face on the sideline showed that he feared that once such opportunities came Real Madrids way, there would be no such wastefulness.

Madrid, to be sure, was carving out its own openings: Statistics had Real having 37 shots on goal to Romas 12. But that statistic didnt tell the whole truth.

Most of Real Madrids attempts came from long range, against a well-organized double line of Roma defenders. And most were either off target or so tame they were mere catching practice for Roma keeper Wojciech Szczesny.

When he was finally beaten, it was by Ronaldo, of course. A week or so back, when some in Madrids media were prematurely calling time on Ronaldos career, his response was to tell them to look at the statistics because they never lie.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Ronaldo was booed by a sizable portion of the crowd Tuesday, but in a handful of minutes, between the 64th and 68th, he scored the first goal and set up the other by James Rodriguez.

Neither finish was a work of art. Rodriguezs shot went straight through the legs of the goalkeeper, and Ronaldos was tapped in from close range, although it did require him to think and move quickly to reach the low cross by Lucas Vazquez.

Vazquez is that rarity, a player actually produced by the Real Madrid youth system. The 24-year-old had to wait a long time for his breakthrough season in Reals white, and he spent last season at Espanyol, the other club in Barcelona. Vazquezs role on Tuesday was to come off the bench and replace Gareth Bale  recently returned from injury  once he tired.

After linking up with Luka Modric, Vazquez danced past a defender and demonstrated that he had the talent to shine, if his club allowed him to show it.

Ronaldo now has 353 goals in 336 games with Madrid, and no one would deny that he is a superstar. Yet, the Madrid fans boo him. The older supporters look beyond the goal totals and want less hubris. They saw it in previous stars like Alfredo Di Stefano and, later, in Zidane.

And Tuesday, the crowd that harangued Ronaldo gave a standing ovation to a man who never played for them. As the game neared its end, Roma sent it its longtime magician, Francesco Totti.

Now 39, Totti first wore Romas distinctive purple and golden yellow when he was 16. Real once bid for him, but Totti always was a one-team kind of a guy.

He can no longer inspire his beloved team to victory, as he once could with instinctive and almost insolent guile.

But as he made a cameo during his 595th game for Roma  most likely his last appearance at the Bernabeu  Totti was given the ovation denied to the man who scored the game winner, Ronaldo.

Spalletti reiterated after the contest that his team needed, somehow, to toughen up on the mental side of the game, something Totti never had a problem with.

But by fielding Totti at the end, he demonstrated that Roma is also woefully short in what Madrid has in abundance: the ability to score goals. And Real, which has no chance to win its league and has only the Champions League left to play for, advanced to the quarterfinals for the sixth year in a row.",[]

WARSAW  A political crisis in Poland entered a new and dangerous phase on Wednesday, as the countrys Constitutional Tribunal struck down a new law limiting its powers. The nations right-wing government, which adopted the law in December, said it would ignore the courts ruling.









The legal showdown is the latest manifestation of a rightward lurch that began after the conservative Law and Justice Party swept to power in elections in October.

The government is facing growing pressure from the European Union and the United States to respect the decisions of the Constitutional Tribunal, the only court empowered to review national laws. In January, the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, opened an unprecedented inquiry into whether the government had violated democratic norms, a condition of membership in the 28-nation bloc.

Poland, the sixth-largest economy in the European Union, is a major net recipient of economic development aid. It is also a member of NATO and an American ally against an increasingly belligerent Russia.

In some 20 cities across the country in the past two months, democratic activists have staged huge demonstrations against the government, which has also cracked down on the news media.

But so far the government has remained defiant. Even before the court issued its latest ruling, Prime Minister Beata Szydlo had said her government would not abide by it.

The constitutional crisis began in October. Sensing it was going to lose the elections, the previous party in power, Civic Platform, appointed five judges to the court, including two to fill terms that were not due to expire until after the election. The president refused to swear them in.

Upon winning power, the Law and Justice Party appointed five judges of its own choosing, who were promptly sworn in. In December, however, the tribunal ruled that the old government had properly appointed three of the five judges it tried to install; the president has refused to seat them.

Parliament then passed a law reorganizing the court, requiring a two-thirds majority for any decision to be binding, instead of a simple majority, and requiring that 13 of the 15 judges hear a given case, instead of 9. The decision announced on Wednesday was heard by only 12 judges, and the government argues it is therefore not valid.

This situation  described by the media as paralysis, which unfortunately is not far from the truth  means that fundamental constitutional principles have been abused, Judge Stanislaw Biernat, a member of the tribunal, said at the court on Wednesday.

Judge Biernat said that the Law and Justice party  the first party since the fall of Communism in Poland in 1989 to hold an absolute majority in Parliament  had abused the rule of law, separation of powers, independence of the judiciary and the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals.

The court also rejected the new two-thirds requirement as unconstitutional.

The Constitution requires that the government publish all rulings by the Constitutional Tribunal immediately in the official Journal of Laws. The justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, said the prime minister would do no such thing.

Mr. Ziobro said that the court appeared to have made up its mind before it even heard the case on Tuesday.

This whole thing could have been a put-up job, he said. Its outrageous. The judges dont want to reach a compromise.

The Constitution does not specify what should happen if a sitting government ignores a ruling of the Constitutional Tribunal.

This will lead to a complete anarchy in our country, Eugeniusz Klopotek, of the opposition Polish Peoples Party, said. Social tensions will escalate. I can already feel it.

Adam Bodnar, the human rights ombudsman at the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, told the tribunal during a hearing: The Constitutional Tribunal will survive, but the question is whether its function will not be purely decorative. This court guarantees the real protection of citizens rights and freedoms, but the Parliament intends to deprive citizens of this fundamental instrument to protect their rights.

The ruling on Wednesday came just days before the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe, a human rights watchdog, plans to issue a report on the status of political freedom in Poland, including the recent laws changing the powers of the Constitutional Tribunal and control of public broadcasters.

According to a draft report, the commission will find that these changes endanger not only the rule of law, but also the functioning of the democratic system.

Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is the head of the Law and Justice Party and the power behind the prime minister, Ms. Szydlo, said that Poland must stand up to external attempts to intervene in its internal affairs.

Poland is and must be a sovereign country, Mr. Kaczynski said.

If the European Union finds that Poland has violated democratic norms, it could strip the country of its voting rights, though it is not clear whether officials in Brussels would be willing to go that far.",[]

TUESDAY PUZZLE  This was a straightforward circled-answer puzzle with a good number of long clues for early in the week  potentially slow going for a new solver, but the corners used crossword standards like ASSUAGE, THANE and UPROOT that you will encounter again. Odd little semi-words like AHH, URL and SLR contributed to the challenge here.

For some reason, I knew OTTO PREMINGER had directed Anatomy of a Murder. Right away and right across the middle, then, my answers spread quickly in all directions. I cant for the life of me remember seeing the movie itself, but, like most of us, I did go through a Jimmy Stewart phase so it could have happened. I registered otter at that point, but the nature of the beast didnt become clear until I got MINUTE STEAK. SETTHETABLE and FUSEBOX came fairly easily after that.

The spelling and definition of MESHUGA sent me to the archives and the Internet, because I had heard and spoken so many variations and it looked funny on paper, but that is The New York Times-ordained spelling, so that was something I learned today, my bubelehs.

David Steinberg corroborates my findings, and, as it turns out, I did get lucky with that Jimmy Stewart thing:

Constructors Notes:

I constructed this puzzle just over a year ago. At the time, I was making almost all themelesses, so I decided to construct a themed puzzle for the sake of variety. Im not sure where the inspiration for this puzzle came from, but I was fortunate to find just enough types of fur to scrape together a theme set. Interestingly, both OTTO PREMINGER and OTTO KLEMPERER wouldve worked for the center theme entry  I chose OTTO PREMINGER because I felt he would be more familiar to early-week solvers. I settled on this grid pattern because I wanted to give solvers something a little different from the several theme entries with a pair of long downs structure used in most themed 1515 crosswords these days. I personally use the traditional layout the majority of the time, but when I end up with a theme set that I could go a different direction with, I like to switch things up. The 74-word grid with all the 7s was definitely a challenge, but I was pleased to work in MESHUGA, JUNIPER and BLASTER. Keeping the less savory bits to a minimum was significantly harder, but Im pleased with how the fill turned out over all (with the exception of NATALE, which the Tuesday solver in me is grumbling about!). I hope you enjoy my puzzle. One of the R.A.s in my dorm just started solving The New York Times crossword  as of right now, he only attempts Mondays, so Im hoping this puzzle will persuade him to graduate to Tuesday!

It is Science Times Tuesday, and I was reminded by this puzzle of the Russian Fox experiment, a decades-long project that dissipated along with the Soviet Union, but still pops up on nature shows and in genetics classes. An attempt was made to breed foxes that were less aggressive and less inclined to bite their captors on a fur farm; the result was a complete and rapid domestication, and the new, sweeter foxes proved more lucrative as exotic pets for the ultrarich than fabric for same.

Lucky little critters. Although, you never know...

nytimes.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Hopping Freight Trains With the Dirty Kids,['Rena Silverman'],"If you combine the tinge of loneliness in Jimmie Rodgerss Waiting for a Train with the outcast mentality of Bob Dylans I Am a Lonesome Hobo, you might understand the millennial hippiedom of a group called Dirty Kids. Theyre not a band, but a self-proclaimed set of countercultural vagabonds: a new wave of nomadic, homeless youth traveling state to state hitchhiking, sleeping in cars and hopping on freight trains.

Last autumn, Emily Kask, a photojournalism student at Western Kentucky University, took a semester off to document  and become  part of the Dirty Kids family.

I had to panhandle, I had to eat out of Dumpsters, said Ms. Kask, 21. Everything that they had to do to survive, I had to do the same thing, too. They didnt cut me any excuses because I was a college kid or a journalist.

Her project started with a search for subjects on Hippie Hill in Christiana, Tenn., where the homeless can find temporary housing, comradeship and free expression. Contacts there led Ms. Kask to Southern Illinois, where she attended a rainbow gathering, a traveling convention that aims to inspire peace, love and community among multigenerational hippie types. It was there that she met Bambi, then 20, who had left her suburban home in North Carolina for the open road.

We were both kind of the same age, young women, Ms. Kask said. So I kind of felt at ease with her.

Photo

Bambi, who preferred to be identified by only her street name, had just parted ways with another group and was getting ready to learn how to hop freight trains with her friend Travis Sauter. Ms. Kask asked if she could come along. They agreed, and Ms. Kask drove them to Kentucky.

On arrival, Mr. Sauter, 41, was arrested over a prior panhandling incident, but Bambi and Ms. Kask continued with a new friend, Matt Johnson, or Smerph, who grew up in a family of train riders. He taught them the moves. Later the group met up with others, including Deverayn Armstrong, 26, who had been in and out of foster homes before taking to riding the rails.

Ms. Kask hopped on her first freight train  a gondola car full of scrap metal  near Bowling Green, Ky. She and the others got off in Nashville, about 65 miles away.

That is an exhilarating feeling, jumping on a train, Ms. Kask said.

Shooting it was a different story. She tried to use her Nikon D4 or smaller Fuji, but in the end many of her train photos were shot with her iPhone for safety.

Photo

There are two ways to get on a train, she said. You can either get on a side off or hop on the fly. When youre siding off, the trains going to stop for a little bit. That is the easiest way to get on. When youre hopping on the fly, you are going to wait for the train to slow down to a speed where you can get on. Thats different for everybody. I wouldnt be able to do it more than a couple miles per hour, but there are some kids who can do it up to 10.

Train hopping is hardly new to American society. Even before the Great Depression (think John Steinbecks Of Mice and Men), there was the post-Civil War railroad scene when war veterans, westbound drifters or migrant workers headed across the country via freight train.

I think it is absolutely this wild revolution, Ms. Kask said of the Dirty Kids. I think its this blend of these Great Depression train riders and the hippies of the 60s and 70s, and, I think its come to blend together with the millennials.

SHANGHAI  Inside the K11 Art Mall, an elevator ride away from Burberry, Chloe, Balenciaga and other high-end shops, hundreds of people line up each day to see very different kinds of luxury items on display. An exhibition of 40 paintings by Claude Monet, billed as the largest-ever show of the Impressionists work in China, opened in March in a basement gallery space of this retail magnet. On a recent Sunday, 600 people at a time filled the two rooms of the gallery space to see Monet: Master of Impressionism, on view until June 15.









The approximately 300,000-square-foot art mall opened in May 2013, and its not the only one. Many malls in China now make art-viewing part of the shopping experience, with some devoting themselves equally to exhibiting art and selling merchandise.

The K11 Art Foundation claims to have pioneered the concept, known as museum-retail: Each of its art malls have an in-house team that programs the gallerys offerings and coordinates how other work appears throughout the building.

Photo

As art and commerce mix in China, this art-retail concept has become a formidable trend in shopping-happy Shanghai. Here, art is used as a marketing tool to lure shoppers away from competitors. Those at the helm also see such exhibitions as viable forms of art education in a country where access to art can be limited to the rich and malls are destinations for young people and a new generation of wealthy women.

K11 Art Foundation, a nonprofit organization registered in Hong Kong, showcases around 20 works by emerging Chinese artists and blue-chip staples at each of its two K11 Art Malls in Hong Kong and Shanghai, along with holding regular exhibitions.

Over the coming five years, K11 aims to open iterations of its museum-retail centers across China  in Beijing and Guangzhou, and in rapidly developing cities like Shenyang, Tianjin, Haikou, Ningbo and Guiyang. Two will open in Wuhan.

Usually the shows are free, but for the Monet show, tickets cost 100 renminbi, about $16, to offset the cost of shipping, handling and security for the works, which have been loaned by the Musee Marmottan Monet in Paris. After leaving the show, visitors can buy ephemera like framed posters of water lilies at a gift shop.

The works on view at K11 are not meant to be for sale. Other art malls, however, tack on the dressings of the museum or gallery experience by adding rentable gallery space or staging sporadic mall-wide exhibitions in collaboration with artists, curators or galleries, sometimes making works available for purchase.

K11s first mall opened in 2009 in Hong Kong, the hometown of its founder and chairman, Adrian Cheng. Retail-empire building runs in his family: His grandfather is the jewelry-store mogul Cheng Yu-tung, one of the richest people in Hong Kong. Mr. Cheng, an avid art collector who was educated in the United States, started the foundation in 2008 after moving to China.

At that time, China was like the Great Gatsby, he said in Hong Kong, where he organized a show of Zhang Enli paintings under the K11 banner during the Art Basel show there.

He said his malls provided education, like tours and lectures, about new Chinese artists and art in general. I have the resources, Mr. Cheng said, adding, Chinese audiences, or even Western audiences, are not really sure whats going on with contemporary emerging Chinese artists.

Mr. Chengs foundation often supplies its two art malls with work from its two K11 Art Villages, in Wuhan and Guiyang, where Chinese artists can apply for residencies. Just before the Monet exhibition, the gallery space held a show produced by artists at these villages. Within the mall itself, Eric Chan, K11s director of operations in south China, said the focus was on creating a nonthreatening setting for viewing art.

A lot of people in China think that art is for very rich people and get intimidated, Mr. Chan said. Galleries aim to attract 25- to 50-year-old women  the sophisticated lady, he said  with childrens art classes and collaborations within stores. The MaxMara store at the mall, for example, exhibited works by three Chinese artists that all used the brands signature coat.

Other malls in Shanghai have begun to capitalize on the publicity that high-profile exhibitions can bring. Last fall Jingan Kerry Center, a chain throughout the city, held a 25-year retrospective of photography from Elle China; LVMHs LAvenue held an exhibition of works by the conceptual artist Xu Zhen last year; and in November the new IAPM Mall threw an exhibition opening for David LaChapelles photographs of the new line of Tods handbags.

Contemporary art in China is categorized within the realm of luxury goods, said Mathieu Borysevicz, the founder and director of BANK gallery in Shanghai, who has worked in the Chinese art world since the 1990s. Now the malls themselves have taken the initiative to embrace contemporary art. Of course what starts out as grossly superficial may, hopefully, lead to sincere interest in the future.

Not all the shows are tied to fashion. On May 30, Reel Shanghai Department Store opened an exhibition titled In and Out with works by artists from ShanghART, one of the citys premier galleries. The monthlong exhibition focuses on installations best served by the large space, like a small aircraft mounted on wheels by Shi Yong, whose work encompasses photography, performance art and installations.

The painter and installation artist Han Fengs floating city of parchment paper is featured, as is work by Xu Zhen, who produces pieces with a company of around 30 people under his name.

The opening also inaugurated a new gallery space on the top floor of the mall.

The idea of an exhibition at the mall, located at the busy Jingan subway stop, intrigued ShanghARTs director, Lorenz Helbling. Art needs to be shown to the public, said Mr. Helbling, who founded the gallery in 1996. As long as it is done honestly and with respect to the art and artists. He said that in Shanghai, mixing art with commerce was not just a trend, but a tradition: One of the citys first major contemporary art exhibitions, Art for Sale in 1999, was staged in a shopping center.

Inside the Monet exhibition, Mr. Chan, K11s director of operations, pointed out a painting of the bridge in Giverny. It closely resembled Monets Le Pont Japonais (The Japanese Bridge), which was sold to an Asian bidder at Sothebys in New York on May 7 for $15.9 million.

We have a lot of collectors visit, Mr. Chan said, smiling. We wonder: Maybe he was inspired by our exhibition?",[]

Where Ms. Merkel, the chancellor, has welcomed refugees, Ms. Petry, a rising far-right leader, has said border guards might need to turn guns on anyone crossing a frontier illegally.

Where Ms. Merkel has urged tolerance, Ms. Petry has embraced the angry populism now running through Europe and the United States.

The preachers of hatred was how the news weekly Der Spiegel characterized the new German right on its cover last month, emblazoned with a portrait of the petite Ms. Petry.

But this brisk, garrulous 40-year-old is more than Ms. Merkels foil. She is a disruptive, new force on the German political scene.

She and her party, the Alternative for Germany, have ridden a wave of discontent over the chancellors embrace of more than one million refugees to their strongest poll ratings ever.

They are now roiling Germanys placid, consensus-driven politics and threatening to alter its political landscape as insurgent parties have done in less stable or prosperous countries around Europe.

Not unlike Donald J. Trump in the United States, she is also breaking open a political dialogue and liberating a new and impolitic  critics say racist  language in the mainstream.

The power of the established parties is crumbling, a jubilant Ms. Petry told supporters after her party took 13.2 percent of the vote in normally sleepy local elections in the central state of Hesse last Sunday.

This Sunday is another test, with elections in three larger and more important states  one in the east and two in the west  that are being closely watched as a referendum on the chancellors refugee policies and a bellwether for the nation.

In the east, support for the Alternative for Germany now nears 20 percent  about double that in the west.

But even in the west, the far-right rebellion is chipping away at the chancellors conservative Christian Democrats, as well as its Social Democratic coalition partners, in a country where the Nazi past looms large.

The Alternative for Germany party has already elbowed its way into five state Parliaments, and is predicted to sail into three more with up to one-fifth of the vote on Sunday.

Ms. Merkels push this week for European Union leaders to hammer out a deal with Turkey to stem the refugee flow was intended in no small part to beat back the challenge Ms. Petry represents.

There is no doubt that the migrant crisis changed the fortunes of Ms. Petrys party.

Initially founded in 2013 as a protest against the euro, the Alternative for Germany shifted emphasis to protecting German identity as hundreds of thousands of migrants entered the country last year.

Ms. Petry and other nationalist-minded leaders ousted the more Europe-oriented founder of the party, then locked onto the identity issue as the embodiment of how Ms. Merkel and the German establishment were ruining the country and ignoring ordinary folk, said Hajo Funke, a politics professor at the Free University in Berlin.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Starting in the former Communist East Germany, in Ms. Petrys home state of Saxony, they whipped unhappiness about political and economic alienation into anger and double-digit scores in opinion polls, Professor Funke said.

Ms. Petry has stood out, he added. She seems like a split personality, not integrated, cold and intelligent, but above all power-conscious, he said. She wants power, she wants to get into government.

Professor Funke and other leading political scientists are doubtful her success will last, pointing to former right-wing parties that briefly emerged in the 1990s and then faded. But the immediate impact of the migrant crisis is undeniable, cutting across age, education, social class, region and political persuasion.

Street protests rapidly descend into right-wing chants of Merkel must go! and left-wing cries of Out with Nazis! Violent attacks on asylum seekers and their housing have increased.

Now, the elections in three of Germanys 16 states on Sunday will be the first significant voter test of both Ms. Merkels policy and Ms. Petrys rapid ascent.

Both women are from former East Germany, both hold doctorates in science and both have connections to the Lutheran church  Ms. Merkels father was a Lutheran pastor, as is Ms. Petrys estranged husband.

There, however, the similarities end.

Unlike the 61-year-old chancellor, Ms. Petry sees 1990 as a missed opportunity to really reunite.

Much that was successful in the East was simply swallowed by the West, she said in an interview. In the next 25 years, she argued, a view of Germany evolved that demeaned the country, with policies against families, against nuclear power and against German traditions.

In this atmosphere, it is not surprising that a party which argues for a self-conscious nation-state in a Europe of Fatherlands is seen as reactionary, she said.

That only shows how one-sided the discussion in Germany has been for years, said Ms. Petry, a mother of four.

As for the Nazi past, she said, the uniqueness, the singularity of German guilt has stood much too often in the forefront, and distorted the view that there are also enough positive aspects to our history.

In a shabby hall on the outskirts of Mannheim, a city of almost 300,000 about 60 miles south of Frankfurt, Ms. Petry got a sympathetic hearing from some 250 listeners.

Germany is crazy, said Katja Kornmacher, 46, who said she works in a publishing house and holds two university degrees. We have the feeling that we cant say anything against the leftist view in Germany. It starts in school, where we are told what is correct.

And those who follow this line land better in life, she continued. The line is: Right is bad, left is good. And then the leftists are outside shouting against this democratic event.

Ms. Kornmacher was referring to perhaps 30 leftists who jeered those who came to hear Ms. Petry. More than 200 police officers were on duty to ensure there were no clashes.

Emotions are high since the local newspaper, the Mannheimer Morgen, ran a now-infamous interview with Ms. Petry in which she contemplated border guards using guns to keep out refugees.

While not averse to the attendant publicity, Ms. Petry says her words were twisted by what she calls the Pinocchio press to say that she favored an order to shoot, similar to that in East Germany.

The political establishment in Germany has mostly dealt with Ms. Petry and her party by refusing to appear with them in public, and ruling out any coalition government with them.

Hotels and other institutions have even declined to rent halls to the party, stoking the resentment of its supporters.

In Merseburg, a picturesque town of 36,000 in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, which votes on Sunday, the Christian Democrat mayor, Jens Buhligen, 49, has managed to accommodate about 2,800 refugees, mostly spread through the town in empty apartments.

He said he has defused protests by going to them, and listening. It works, he said.

But some of Sundays prospective voters had a very different view. When about 150 people rallied for the Alternative for Germany, the anger of a cluster of women, all 60 or older, was palpable.

We were not asked! about the refugees, they yelled. We are here for our children and grandchildren!

A burly 63-year-old woman in a red anorak, who like the others declined to give her name, said she had worked for 42 years and gets 621 euros a month, about $685, from her pension.

Watching how the refugees are treated, she said, I have never had so much hatred inside me.",[]

The Harvard Art Museums, which have been without a director since last July, announced Wednesday that they had chosen Martha Tedeschi, a longtime curator and administrator at the Art Institute of Chicago, to lead the institutions.

She will succeed Thomas W. Lentz, who directed the museums for more than a decade and shepherded them through a long and sometimes contentious $350 million renovation and expansion, designed by Renzo Piano, that was completed in 2014.

Ms. Tedeschi, 57, a specialist in British and American art with expertise in the history of printmaking, began her career at the Art Institute in 1982 as an intern and became a full curator in 1999. Since 2012, she has served as the deputy director for art and research, overseeing the institutes libraries and archives, publishing and imaging, academic programs and conservation departments, while also serving as its academic liaison to local universities and foundations.

In a statement, Harvards president, Drew Gilpin Faust, said that Ms. Tedeschis experience would serve the museums well as the university seeks to elevate our extraordinary collections and integrate them more fully into Harvards intellectual life.

Ms. Tedeschi, who will take over in July, said in a telephone interview that she was drawn to the job because of her deep interest in how the visual and the creative and intuitive can be meaningful to students regardless of the field in which theyre working and training, and that she believed that Harvard was a campus that is so clearly ready to collaborate with the museums.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,The Costumes That Obscure Doctor and Patient,"['M D', 'Abigail Zuger']","Photo

Hard Cases Dr. Abigail Zuger on the everyday ethical issues doctors face.

Is it time for new costumes in the long-running improv act featuring doctor and patient? The white coat and the cotton gown are tattered, under continual assault for their practical deficiencies and outmoded symbolism.

Along with ties and long sleeves, Britain banned white coats for most doctors almost 10 years ago. Our priestly garb turns out to harbor quantities of bacteria, including the hospital-associated germs we try to keep away from patients.

Presumably all garments carry bacteria, including the vestments of priests. The clergy, though, probably tote a less noxious load  and probably change robes more often. Doctors report that they do so only every couple of weeks, long enough for grime to accumulate.

Most American medical schools now bestow a fresh white coat on every new student, a symbol of our exalted professional aspirations. Some American hospitals now discourage those selfsame coats in the name of hygiene. Draw what moral you will. Many pediatricians would no more dress in a white coat than in a gorilla suit, lest they scare the little ones. Some adult doctors, reasoning that we are all children in illness, feel likewise. Some of us just need the pockets.

The best clinician I ever knew was draped in a grayish shabby thing spilling over with scraps of paper, vaguely redolent of his usual weekday lunch of pea soup. Whether you were a patient or a trainee, you didnt really want him near you, until you quickly figured out that you really did.

One of the worst specimens of doctor Ive run into wore snowy white, changed daily. You really didnt want that guy near you, period, as many of his patients ultimately realized, including the ones who took him to court.

The symbolism surrounding patient gowns is just as fraught. They are cheap, demeaning, undignified and chilly. One way to cope is to wear two of them, one opening to the front and one to the rear. Thus encased, the patient is snug and warm, and also extremely well defended from inquisitive fingers and probing stethoscopes. It turns out that actual clothes are far easier to push aside for an examination than are two johnnie gowns firmly knotted together.

But patient gowns are out of style in some places mostly because they clash with the dominant medical fashion these days: doing everything at top speed. People need time and privacy to dress and undress. Medical settings without time or extra space find their stacks of clean gowns going undisturbed.

Instead, patients disrobe incompletely, or sometimes not at all, just opening little portals in their clothing through which what passes for a physical examination can be performed. Such accommodation is regrettable, but necessary to maintain our cruising speed. Call it laparoscopy for the nonsurgeon.

For my professors, the physical exam was a sacred ritual. I sometimes wonder which would distress them more: the thought of treating a rash glimpsed only on a cellphone screen, or the idea of asking a patient to open two shirt buttons under his tie for a quick inspection of that thing on his chest. Ive been guilty of both.

A couple of months ago, on a frigid winter day, a stolid, silent patient came in because her knee hurt. Just give me something, she said. I was sorely tempted, but I couldnt do it: I had to examine both unclad legs. She cast me a look of pure disgust and hauled herself to her feet.

It took almost 10 minutes for her to peel off the layers of tight, ill-fitting jeans, socks, pantyhose, more socks, more hose, long underwear, down to the arthritic knee. It took another 10 minutes to put it all back on.

My professors would have stepped out to give her some privacy. For some reason, I stayed where I was.

Those 20 minutes were death to the days schedule, but invaluable for showing the harried doctor something of the grim labor of everyday life for this patient, a heart-rending discomfort of binding elastic and straining seams she could never have articulated, and, of course, one that would have been invisible with her on display in a hospital gown.

It was the process that educated, not the final tableau.

We are never more human than when we are dressing and undressing, and yet for our medical care, we have, for some reason, decided to posture in front of one another fully costumed, pretending that, encased in our separate roles, we will get to the bottom of the pain.

Perhaps we need not new costumes but new stage directions. Perhaps doctors should routinely watch patients undress and then dress again. Perhaps, for that matter, patients should watch doctors washing their chapped hands yet again and putting on their white coats, checking the pockets for tools, phone numbers, reminders, lists of urgencies, looking at those coffee stains and wincing, vowing to get to the laundry and then forgetting.",[]

FRANKFURT  The German carmaker BMW reported on Wednesday that its operating profit was better than expected, thanks to healthy sales of high-margin sport-utility vehicles. The company, however, disappointed investors with its dividend.

The companys earnings before interest and tax rose to 9.59 billion euros, or $10.6 billion, above the average forecast of 9.55 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts. The results gave the producer of BMW and Mini cars an operating margin in its automotive division of 9.2 percent.

Last year, BMW retained the title of the worlds biggest luxury carmaker, with sales of BMW-branded cars reaching 1.91 million, a 5.2 percent increase from the previous year. It was the 11th year in a row that the Munich-based company held the title.

Harald Kruger, BMWs chief executive, said the company aimed to continue increasing sales.

We are again targeting a new sales volume record in 2016, with sales expected to be slightly up on the previous year, Mr. Kruger said on Wednesday in a statement.

BMW said it would recommend a dividend of 3.20 per share of common stock and 3.22 for preferred stock, which was below the 3.38 per share expected in the Reuters poll.

Analysts at Evercore ISI said that although results beat market expectations, the lack of any announcements about higher dividend payments was disappointing.

The lack of any special dividend and the flat payout ratio disappoint, said Arndt Ellinghorst, the head of global automotive research at Evercore.",[]

Normally on Land Day, I would not have gone to school. In Syria, where I grew up, they usually let Syrian-Palestinians march to remember the day, March 30, 1976, when Israeli forces killed six Palestinians and wounded at least 100 who had been protesting Israels expropriation of Palestinian land. But when I was 15, the government banned the commemoration.









Twelve of us lived in my familys three-bedroom house in Yarmouk, a Palestinian neighborhood in Damascus that began as a camp for refugees. (My parents fled to Lebanon in 1948, then fled to Syria 10 years later.) I slept on a mattress near the kitchen with three older brothers. We got up at 7 a.m. to eat breakfast  yogurt, halloumi, Arabic pita bread and sweet tea  before my father and older siblings went to work or university. Then I headed to school in my khaki uniform, down our street, which was scented and soundtracked by a big, raucous market. All the houses had gardens out front. Ours had lemon and loquat trees.

As it turned out, our teachers decided to end classes early that day and send us home. Some Syrian-Palestinians were defying the ban, and some students had joined in. Guns were going off, and tires were burning. Security forces showed up. Students threw stones at them. There was a lot of shouting and fighting as people were arrested. But I was a shy, skinny boy who stayed away from politics and protests. I just wanted to go home.

The youth wing of the Baathist party, led by President Hafez al-Assad, had many offices in our neighborhood. I saw a young man standing in the doorway of one. He was a couple of years older than I was and looked a little like one of my brothers: chubby, with fair skin, a light beard and curly brown hair. I knew who he was; his name was Kamal. He was holding a gun.

I walked faster through the rush of people. He can see Im just carrying my books, I told myself. He can see I dont want to protest. But Kamal looked right at me, aimed his gun in my direction and shot.

As I ran, my left calf began to burn. I staggered into my yard and bled on the lemon and loquat trees. Once inside I saw a big chunk of my flesh was missing. The bone was exposed. But I was relieved.

My family said not to report the shooting. One of my sisters was a nurse and treated my wound. The next day, she took me to the hospital for an X-ray to make sure the bone wasnt fractured. We said I fell down the stairs. When school reopened two days later, I returned in my khaki uniform. I tried not to limp. I never told my classmates what happened.

I saw Kamal every day. When we passed each other, he looked at me with a blank stare. He didnt seem to know he had shot me. I went on to graduate, go to college, get a job in sales, marry and start raising three wonderful children.

One afternoon, I was buying fish from a chubby, bearded man nicknamed Abu al-Bara. He looked familiar. We knew many of the same people. We went to the same school. I dont remember you, he said, shaking his head.

Abu al-Bara was friendly, and he happened to live on the same floor of our building. Sometimes he sent us fresh fish or squid, and I would reciprocate with a tub of homemade tarator, a tahini, garlic and parsley sauce that goes really well with fried seafood. Then one day, I found out his formal name: Kamal.

I hadnt thought about my scar in years. When I realized I had been buying fish from him, the scar  now a wafer-size crater  throbbed. Everything came back to me: how he shot me as I carried my books, how I bled on the lemon and loquat trees.

After that, I stopped buying fish from him. I refused his offerings. He drank a lot. One winter day, his wife knocked hard on our door. My husband has fallen, she said. I called an ambulance right away.

I went inside Kamals home and saw him slumped on the floor, white foam coming out of his mouth. He was gasping and smelled heavily of alcohol. The paramedics gave him an injection. I sensed they wanted money, so I gave them everything in my pocket, about 400 Syrian pounds.

Kamal survived that day. After a few months, we moved to another neighborhood. The war separated my family, and now Im in Germany. (I applied for asylum two years ago but havent received an answer.) I wear shorts in the summer, something I never did in Syria. Sometimes people ask about the scar. I usually say I fell down the stairs. Its a long story to tell in German, which Im struggling to learn.

I dont know if Kamal is alive or died of alcoholism or died in the siege of Yarmouk, when so many people starved. We all lost our homes and livelihoods in the war. We lost family and friends. Yarmouk is gone, and we are all refugees now.",[]

Its 2 a.m. The bar is closing. Republicans have had a series of strong and nasty Trump cocktails. Suddenly Ted Cruz is beginning to look kind of attractive. At least hes sort of predictable, and he doesnt talk about his sexual organs in presidential debates!









Well, Republicans, have your standards really fallen so low so fast? Are you really that desperate? Can you remember your 8 p.m. selves, and all the hope you had about entering a campaign with such a deep bench of talented candidates?

Back in the early evening, before the current panic set in, Republicans understood that Ted Cruz would be a terrible general election candidate, at least as unelectable as Donald Trump and maybe more so. He is the single most conservative Republican in Congress, far adrift from the American mainstream. Hes been doing well in primaries because of the support of extremely conservative voters in very conservative states, and he really hasnt broken out of that lane. His political profile is a slightly enlarged Rick Santorum but without the heart.

On policy grounds, he would be unacceptable to a large majority in this country. But his policy disadvantages are overshadowed by his public image ones. His rhetorical style will come across to young and independent voters as smarmy and oleaginous. In Congress, he had two accomplishments: the disastrous government shutdown and persuading all his colleagues to dislike him.

There is another path, one that doesnt leave you self-loathing in the morning. Its a long shot, but given the alternatives, its worth trying. First, hit the pause button on the rush to Cruz. Second, continue the Romneyesque assault on Trump. The results on Saturday, when late voters swung sharply against the Donald, suggest it may be working.

Third, work for a Marco Rubio miracle in Florida on March 15. Fourth, clear the field for John Kasich in Ohio. If Rubio and Kasich win their home states, Trump will need to take nearly 70 percent of the remaining delegates to secure a majority. That would be unlikely; hes only winning 44 percent of the delegates now.

The party would go to the convention without a clear nominee. It would be bedlam for a few days, but a broadly acceptable new option might emerge. It would be better than going into the fall with Trump, which would be a moral error, or Cruz, who in November would manage to win several important counties in Mississippi.

This isnt about winning the presidency in 2016 anymore. This is about something much bigger. Every 50 or 60 years, parties undergo a transformation. The G.O.P. is undergoing one right now. What happens this year will set the partys trajectory for decades.

Since Goldwater/Reagan, the G.O.P. has been governed by a free-market, anti-government philosophy. But over the ensuing decades new problems have emerged. First, the economy has gotten crueler. Technology is displacing workers and globalization is dampening wages. Second, the social structure has atomized and frayed, especially among the less educated. Third, demography is shifting.

Orthodox Republicans, seeing no positive role for government, have had no affirmative agenda to help people deal with these new problems. Occasionally some conservative policy mavens have proposed such an agenda  anti-poverty programs, human capital policies, wage subsidies and the like  but the proposals were killed, usually in the House, by the anti-government crowd.

The 1980s anti-government orthodoxy still has many followers; Ted Cruz is the extreme embodiment of this tendency. But it has grown increasingly rigid, unresponsive and obsolete.

Along comes Donald Trump offering to replace it and change the nature of the G.O.P. He tramples all over the anti-government ideology of modern Republicanism. He would replace the free-market orthodoxy with authoritarian nationalism.

He offers to use government on behalf of the American working class, but in negative and defensive ways: to build walls, to close trade, to ban outside groups, to smash enemies. According to him, Americas problems arent caused by deep structural shifts. Theyre caused by morons and parasites. The Great Leader will take them down.

If the G.O.P. is going to survive as a decent and viable national party, it cant cling to the fading orthodoxy Cruz represents. But it cant shift to ugly Trumpian nationalism, either. It has to find a third alternative: limited but energetic use of government to expand mobility and widen openness and opportunity. That is what Kasich, Rubio, Paul Ryan and others are stumbling toward.

Amid all the vulgarity and pettiness, that is what is being fought over this month: going back to the past, veering into an ugly future, or finding a third way. This is something worth fighting for, worth burning the boats behind you for.

The hour is late and the odds may be long. But there is still hope. Its a moment for audacity, not settling for Ted Cruz simply because hes the Titanic you know.",[]

That was Robert De Niros booth, Al Pacino would sit here, Johnny Depp and Kate Moss sat there.









Michael Cecchi-Azzolina, a short, excitable man sporting an early-Cher wig, gestured toward the booths and banquettes inside the packed bar area of Raouls, a French bistro and discreet celebrity hangout in SoHo that recently celebrated its 40th anniversary with an unusual dinner party that brought together regulars and former servers like himself.

I was a waiter here for 20 years, said Mr. Cecchi-Azzolina, who now runs the West Village restaurant Bobo. When asked why he stayed so long at one place, he spread his arms out and tried to embrace the room. This is all my family.

Its not often that you see waiters and busboys hugging patrons in a New York restaurant, but that was the rule at this epic 10-hour birthday bash that doubled as a family reunion for a SoHo institution that remains a refuge for the neighborhoods bohemian old guard.

Opened in 1975 by Serge Raoul, who was a sound man for France 2, and his brother Guy, who was a chef, Raouls is the rare family operation that caters to actual families, as well as waves of actors, producers, models, journalists, gallery owners, designers and other assorted downtown glitterati who have made this their living room for four decades.

Mr. Raoul, 78, is now retired and living in Nyack, N.Y. His son, Karim Raoul, 37, started managing in 2010 after his father had a stroke, and is keeping the familys social legacy alive.

We wanted the real regulars in tonight: those people who had 90 reservations and upwards, said Karim Raoul, as he made his way through the packed bar, shaking hands and squeezing shoulders of old friends. We have three generations of customers: the parents, the grandparents and the kids.

Raouls started off as a place for his fathers journalist friends to hang out after restaurants in the neighborhood, then quiet, shut down for the night. SoHo artists and dealers from the budding 1970s gallery scene adopted it as their boozy canteen. It got its first taste of celebrity a few months after opening, when a young TV producer named Lorne Michaels arrived with his troupe from Saturday Night Live.

I worked at S.N.L. from the inception with Lorne and John and Danny, said James Signorelli, 73, a producer on the show for decades, referring to John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. At that time we were finishing up our work at 11 p.m. and no one was serving. Then we discovered Raouls, and it was like going to heaven, and we were here midnight to 2 a.m. three nights a week.

Were there any memorable antics? I wish I could tell you, he said with a demurring grin.

Others were a tad more forthcoming. I get all weepy thinking about all the great times I had to pour myself out of here, said Barry Tubb, 52, an actor from Friday Night Lights who may be best known as Wolfman in Top Gun. Mr. Tubb had so many fond memories of Raouls, he flew in from Marfa, Tex., for the night. I first came here in 1985 with Kelly McGillis and we had dinner with Jennifer Beals, he said. Wow, it was like all the good things about New York in one room.

Though not officially an after-hours club, Raouls seemed to operate like one at the height of its popularity in the mid-1980s, led by a charismatic headwaiter at the time, Rob Jones. After midnight, Mr. Jones was known to descend the circular staircase in Dusty Springfield drag, lip-syncing and leading the crowd in dance that more than once ended with patrons shimmying naked on the bar.

The party ended abruptly when Mr. Jones died of AIDS in 1989. In the 1990s, Raouls became a hangout for members of the indie film set, with the producer and former Raouls waiter Laurence Bender bringing Quentin Tarantino and the Pulp Fiction cast to celebrate the movies debut at the New York Film Festival. Other regulars of that era included Sarah Jessica Parker, Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman.

But Serge Raoul did not set out to create a bacchanalian celebrity magnet. Indeed, the genesis of the place was something of a lark.

A colleague of his from French television, Jim Szalapski, took him to an Italian restaurant at 180 Prince Street at the time. They were so taken by the quaint spot that they approached the owner and jokingly said that they had heard that the business was for sale. The owner, who was ready to retire, liked them and sold the restaurant to Mr. Raoul for $15,000 with two odd conditions: the owners husband and their cat Inky could stay.

Mr. Raouls parents owned an upscale restaurant back in France, so he and his brother, Guy, decided to open a low-key bistro. The original idea was to try to create something where people could come, feel at home, said Guy Raoul, 65, who is still an owner of Raouls. A place to eat with their fingers if they wanted to and just give that nice leisurely atmosphere.

Like his father, Karim Raoul did not plan to get into the family business, studying filmmaking at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts a few blocks away. But in 1995, he started working weekends there, doing everything including washing dishes, assisting the butcher and waiting tables.

When he graduated, he took up residence in an apartment above the kitchen and, after a short stint running his own restaurant in Brooklyn and working in film, he returned to Raouls after his fathers stroke.

We come from a long legacy of people who didnt want anything to do with the restaurant business, he said, with a knowing smile.

As Raouls enters its fifth decade, Karim sees a bright future for the restaurant, even as he pursues filmmaking, directing a documentary about the changes in SoHo. The current chef, David Honeysett, has broadened the menu beyond traditional bistro fare to include seasonal dishes. But the steak au poivre remains firmly in place.

I think they drug everybody with that steak, Mr. Tubb said. I think the steak au poivre sauce has some kind of LSD effect on people and they have to have it. They crave it.",[]

Many people long to live near water for the pleasures of swimming, boating, fishing, or just to contemplate.

But, says Manu Prakash, a scientist at Stanford with broad interests, the surface of an alluring lake or pond, the boundary where water meets air, can be far less inviting for certain insects.

Water is about 100 times as viscous as air, and insects that live on its surface must somehow negotiate movement in both realms. Most seem to choose one or the other. Some, like long-legged water striders, maintain a small measure of distance from the water with a cushion of air that lets them skate on the surface. Others, like whirligig beetles, embrace the water and swim.

The lily pad beetle, which Dr. Prakash and his colleagues report on in The Journal of Experimental Biology, has evolved a unique solution to moving in water and air at the same time.

It flies, beating its wings for propulsion much as it would if it were taking off into the air. But it remains tethered to the water by claws at the end of its legs that break through the surface and act as anchors so a strong wing beat wont unexpectedly lift the beetle.

The movement is unusual, a bit like windsurfing, except that rather than having a sail to catch the wind, the beetle uses its wings to generate power.

Dr. Prakash runs a laboratory devoted to projects as varied as economical paper microscopes, water computers and biophysics. He conducted the study of the lily pad beetle with Haripriya Mukundarajan and Dong Hyun Kim at Stanford and Thibaut C. Bardon of the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris. He described the research as just good old natural history, with a large dose of physics.

It began some years ago when he saw, on a pond, something that moved so fast that I couldnt actually see it. He stayed for a couple of hours trying to track the culprit down and finally found the beetle, which eats holes in lily pads and zips from one to the other on the waters surface.

He thought its technique was a great way to move around and had a hunch that the physics would be intriguing. And he was attracted, he said, to a creature that had really claimed this harsh environment.

With high speed video and mathematical analysis of the movements and forces involved, the team made several discoveries.

The beetles legs repel water, which keeps it afloat, except for claws at their tips, which penetrate the surface of the water and tie it to the surface.

As the beetle flies, or surfs, the up and down force of its wings and the attachment of the claws make the surface of the water bounce up and down like a trampoline. The tips of the wings almost touch the surface of the water, and the beetle copes with aerodynamics, surface tension and another kind of drag that appears only when the insect is moving faster than about nine inches a second. The beetle actually travels close to a foot a second. Its called capillary wave drag.

The whole system, Dr. Prakash said, is right at the edge of chaos, mathematically speaking. A chaotic system is one so complicated that given the initial conditions, one cant predict what is going to happen. One way or another, the beetle manages to navigate this environment.

The self-powered surfing actually demands more energy than fully airborne flight, which the beetle can also do. It seems to prefer this sort of locomotion. Dr. Prakash said that may be because its a good way to find new food sources, or because predators havent figured it out.

He said that he and his colleagues were now turning to a fly that seemed to do something similar but in the sea. There are, of course, ways that one could imagine applying the findings to robotics, but the research really was done, he said, for pure scientific curiosity.

One thing the remarkable beetle did not evolve is a braking system. In the lab, it runs into the edge of a dish and just topples over. On a pond, Dr. Prakash said, they seem to stop the same way.

They hit the leaf, he said.

nytimes.com,2013-06-22 00:00:00,Champion at Opera Theater of Saint Louis,['Vivien Schweitzer'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

ST. LOUIS  Toward the end of Terence Blanchards Champion, which received its premiere this week at the Opera Theater of Saint Louis here, the protagonist, Emile Griffith, relives the terror of being attacked by homophobic thugs. I killed a man and the world forgives me; I love a man and the world wants to kill me, he sings despairingly.









That line in Michael Cristofers libretto was inspired by a quote from the real Emile Griffith, the world welterweight champion who killed the boxer Benny Paret, known as the Kid, during a bout in 1962. Some 50 years later, with a spate of attacks against gay people in New York City and the N.B.A.s Jason Collins becoming the first openly gay athlete active in a major American team sport, the opera certainly strikes a resonant chord.

Mr. Blanchard, a jazz musician who has written scores for some 50 films and composed for Broadway shows, had never written for singers before Champion, the 24th premiere that Opera Theater (which commissioned the work with Jazz St. Louis) has presented in 38 seasons. Mr. Blanchard has described the work, scored for full orchestra and jazz trio, as an opera in jazz. Remarkably, its the second opera with a boxing connection to receive its premiere this month, following the Washington National Operas thoughtful Approaching Ali at the Kennedy Center. That work was billed as a family opera in one act, but much of the profanity-heavy Champion libretto isnt suitable for a family newspaper.

Photo

The opera takes place in 10 rapidly shifting scenes that unfold with cinematic fluidity, opening with the elderly Emile, poignantly rendered by Arthur Woodley, struggling to get dressed. The real Mr. Griffith, who has dementia, now lives in a nursing home on Long Island. The operatic Emile, like the living Mr. Griffith, is assisted by his adopted son, Luis Rodrigo Griffith (sung by Brian Arreola).

On the day he is to meet Benny Paret Jr., son of his dead opponent, he relives his past in a series of flashbacks, beginning with a carnival scene in his boyhood home in the Virgin Islands.

The production, directed by James Robinson, is visually a treat, with Allen Moyers sets and James Schuettes colorful costumes framed by digital images and video. The young Emile initially hoped to become a hat maker; in one alluring scene a group of female hat makers unfold ribbons to create a boxing ring, a neat segue way into the following scene. Emelda Griffith, Emiles delinquent, foul-mouthed, glamorous mother  brilliantly enacted by the mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves  pulls up in a yellow convertible and confuses her son with another of her seven abandoned children. The mezzo-soprano Meredith Arwady offered a powerful performance as Kathy Hagen, the boisterous owner of a gay bar frequented by drag queens.

The comic interludes are in contrast to the many poignant elements of the narrative, like Emiles abandonment of his wife (expressively sung by Chabrelle Williams), his confusion about his sexuality, and the dramatic duet between Emile and Benny Paret (an effective Victor Ryan Robertson), seen here in a coma on his death bed after the match.

George Manahan conducted the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra in a confident performance of the jazz-inflected score, woven through with bluesy harmonies and Afro-Caribbean beats. The music at times sounded thin and the dramatic pace sometimes flagged, but over all the scores cinematic flow aptly complemented the action on stage.

Mr. Blanchard included several introspective arias for the main characters, including one for the young Emile, convincingly portrayed by Aubrey Allicock. A boy soprano, Jordan Jones, vividly represented Emile as a child.

In an aria before the famous fight, in which the real-life Emile Griffith was taunted about his sexuality by his opponent, the operatic Emile muses: What makes a man a man?

In the last act Emile asks for forgiveness during the visit with Bennys son, who tells the old man that he needs to forgive himself. Emile finally does, the drama coming full circle as his emotional conflict gives way to his mundane, but equally poignant, struggle to dress himself.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,Art as Collateral in a Fickle Market,['Scott Reyburn'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

LONDON  Art and money have long been closely linked, but in the 21st century, it seems, the two have become synonymous.









One way to extract the latter from the former is art-based lending, in which paintings or sculptures are used as collateral for loans. Now that the notoriously fickle and opaque art market is seemingly headed toward a downturn, with money tighter and the prices of many artworks lower, will this kind of niche financing become more attractive to collectors?

Carlyle Group, the private-equity behemoth, certainly thinks so. In October, the company started Athena Art Finance Corporation, a collaboration with Banque Pictet that would use $280 million of Carlyle equity to enable owners of high-end art to tap the liquidity of their collections.

Crucially, Athena is offering nonrecourse loans, exclusively secured by art works rather than other assets. Those loans can be attractive to borrowers, because the lender can lay claim only to the art in the event of a default.

Art lenders who have offered full-recourse loans, secured by a range of personal assets, have faced unfavorable publicity. During the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the photographer Annie Leibovitz pledged her four homes and the rights to her images to secure a $24 million loan from Art Capital. She was unable to service the debt, and a high-profile court action ensued.

This is an opportunity, Andrea Danese, a co-founder of Athena and the companys chief executive, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Danese said there was potentially about $150 billion worth of art in private hands that could be collateralized. He identified three groups to whom his companys products might appeal.

First, there are billionaires who put the money into private equity deals, where they make 20 to 25 percent, he said. Then there are collectors with, say, $30 million of art they leverage to buy another piece. And thirdly there are the art-rich and cash-poor in their 70s and 80s who dont want to sell because of capital gains or estate taxes.

Athena offers loans of at least $1 million over six months to seven years based on a maximum of 50 percent of the low valuation of a collection or artwork. It typically charges annual interest of 7 to 9 percent, including origination fees.

Athena is just one of two big self-financed lenders offering nonrecourse loans secured by art. Falcon Fine Art in London is the other. Since opening in January 2015, Falcon has arranged about $50 million in loans against high-value artworks, again at annual interest rates of about 7 to 9 percent.

Larger banks, even those with art advisory facilities like Citi Private Bank, offer full-recourse loans to wealthy clients for as little as 2.5 to 3 percent a year, said Paul Ress, the managing director of the art lender Right Capital in London.

Art lending is quite limited because of the affordability conundrum, he said. If youre a high-net-worth individual, you dont need to use art solely as collateral for a loan.

But art lenders, like pawnbrokers, can get a boost when markets dip.

On Monday in New York, the evening session of Phillipss New Now auction of contemporary art, designed to kick-start the week of the Armory Show, contained a meager 23 lots, 13 of which managed to sell, raising just $1.7 million. The only work that was sold significantly above its estimate was a 1983 Jean-Michel Basquiat drawing of a snarling dogs head, estimated at $80,000 to $120,000, which drew the nights top price of $257,000.

There is a process of attrition at the moment. Its cyclical, and its healthy for the market, said the Los Angeles entrepreneur Carlos Rivera, the founder of Art Rank, a website that uses algorithms to analyze contemporary artists as stocks to be bought, held or sold.

Mr. Rivera has a new venture, Levart, that  much like the new-age pawnbrokers Borro  aims to provide liquidity at a much lower level of the market than Athena. Levart says it can provide nonrecourse financing within 12 hours, if backed by suitable contemporary works valued at as little as $5,000.

The monthly interest is a hefty 4 percent for loans under $250,000. But that has not deterred art insiders from using the site to finance profitable short-term resales.

Levart cites, for example, the $20,000 borrowed by a client to buy Newz!, a 2014 painting by the Los Angeles artist Math Bass. The work was then sold at Phillips in November for $81,250 against a low estimate of $25,000, reflecting the original purchase price.

If the market does take a serious dip, lenders believe they can play a role in preventing a fire sale. People dont want to sell when things are going down in value, said Tim Hunter, the vice president of Falcon Fine Art, but they might need to take liquidity out of their collection.

Wealthy art buyers certainly took plenty of liquidity out of their collections last year at Sothebys. Throughout 2015, the auction houses finance division had an average of $733 million of full-recourse loans on its books, generating $65 million of income, according to fourth-quarter results released on Feb. 26.

Those figures might not seem much compared to the companys $6 billion in auction sales, but Sothebys 2015 auction commissions of $719 million were 5 percent less than in 2014, while income from financing rose 38 percent.

For many, art collecting today is all about maximizing returns on an investment portfolio. But an auction in France last month is a reminder of the premium buyers place on collections put together without commercial considerations.

On Feb. 22 and 23, the Paris auctioneer Artcurial sold the collection of Pierre Hebey, a French intellectual property lawyer who died last year at 89. The sale raised 8.9 million euros, about $9.8 million, well above the estimate of 6 million, with 85 percent of the 564 lots sold. Top price was the 845,000 paid for Roberto Mattas 1938 surrealist painting Morphologie Psychologique de lAngoisse.

Hebey, who counted Max Ernst and Marc Chagall among his friends, had been well-positioned to acquire 20th century art. But he was also a lifelong collector of Art Deco, 19th-century bronzes and other antiques, and he could often be found at flea markets around Paris, flashlight in hand, at five in the morning.

One of his most striking purchases was Emmanuel Fremiets gilded bronze sculpture Pelican Gastronome, showing the bird feeding its chicks, commissioned in 1890 by the president of the Banque de France. The Petit Palais museum in Paris bought the work at the Artcurial auction for 76,200.

Fabien Naudan, the vice president of Artcurial, explained why he thought buyers were so eager to bid at the Hebey sale.

They were trying to buy part of his life, said Mr. Naudan, who added that Mr. Hebey was motivated as a collector solely by his love of an object. People are ready to pay much more for this charge emotionnelle.

How much? Maybe 20 percent, Mr. Naudan suggested.

The financial industry sometimes classifies art as an investment of passion. Paradoxically, passion, rather than portfolio planning, seems to be the thing that ensures above-average financial returns.",[]

Kenneth had a moment of global fame about a year ago after sharing the Cheryls Birthday problem, a simple challenge that went wildly viral (covered in Numberplay here). The problem generated quite a storm on Twitter, including suggestions for more puzzles. I asked Kenneth if he had a favorite, and he pointed to a suggestion by Igor Diev, who introduces his puzzle this way: Frankly speaking, the task of #cherylsbirthday youve showed the world is rather easy and its a shame to be unable to solve it. Let me give you a task that Russian 14-year-old students solve. Thats what should really blow your mind.

Well, nothing activates the neurons like a playful taunt. Lets try 



Ali Babas Cave

Ali Baba found a cave full of gold and diamonds. A bag full of gold weighs 200 kilograms, a bag full of diamonds weighs 40 kilograms. Ali Baba can carry only 100 kilograms at a time. A kilogram of gold costs $20, and a kilogram of diamonds costs $60. What is the greatest amount of money Ali Baba can earn for the gold and diamonds he can carry out at once (in one attempt in one bag)?

Paris  Twenty-five years ago, in February 1991, the leaders of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary met in Visegrad, a Hungarian town overlooking the Danube. Those three countries had recently broken free of the Soviet bloc; their newly elected leaders, Lech Walesa, Vaclav Havel and Jozsef Antall, had taken an active part in the liberation. Two, Mr. Havel and Mr. Walesa, had been jailed for their activities.









The Visegrad meeting had one central purpose: to accelerate the integration of the three countries into a free, democratic and prosperous Europe, through NATO and what was then the European Economic Community of 12 member states. Western European leaders looked favorably on the Visegrad Group: Central Europeans could practice regional cooperation before joining the adults group of what would become the European Union.

Visegrad was where the kings of Bohemia, Hungary and Poland parlayed in 1335. Since then, these nations had gone through many wars and occupations, their borders redrawn several times, or even dissolved altogether.

Today, the Visegrad bloc is experiencing a resurgence of sorts. In a splintering familiar to Central Europe, the Visegrad Three became four: Czechoslovakia ceased to exist in 1993, giving way to the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

All four joined the European Union in 2004. But when they get together today, it is to fight the union. Over the centuries, they have been dominated by Prussia, Austria, Germany and Russia; in 2016, the common enemy is Brussels. To Western Europeans, it is unsettling to see a new East-West divide emerging, threatening to fracture the European Union itself.

The Visegrad countries opposition to Brussels is different from Britains. They dont want to leave the union, they just refuse to abide by some of its rules. The Romanian-born French political scientist Pierre Hassner has reminded us of the concept of collective neurosis, a notion devised by the Hungarian philosopher Istvan Bibo in his 1946 book The Misery of the Small Eastern European States. Bibo described the existential angst of Eastern and Central European states leading sometimes to political hysteria.

Political hysteria reigns today over the European Commission initiative to assign refugee quotas to each member state. Mr. Havel and Mr. Antall, the voices of reason, have passed away. Mr. Walesa, the hero of the Solidarity movement, is fighting accusations of collaborating with Polands former Communist authorities. In parliamentary elections in Slovakia, where Prime Minister Robert Fico has indulged in fierce anti-immigrant rhetoric, a far-right party with neo-Nazi ties just won 14 seats.

The new rulers in Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava and Budapest flatly refuse Muslim refugees. They dont want the ethnic, religious and cultural homogeneity of their societies to change. They see multiculturalism as a failed model.

Hearing such messages from Donald J. Trump or Marine Le Pen is bad enough, but from the leaders of these new democracies?

The way these leaders practice democracy, bending the rule of law as far as they can within an elected government, is equally unsettling to the older democracies of Western Europe. Another French political scientist, the Czech-born Jacques Rupnik, has identified two converging trends.

We are witnessing a democratic regression and identity-related tensions on migration, and both phenomena are strengthening each other, he told me. The same nationalist conservative authoritarianism at work in domestic politics also applies to the response to the refugee crisis, notably different from the European Commissions and most other member states responses.

Once the poster children of post-Communist transition, these countries were not supposed to take such a turn. With its so-called goulash socialism, Hungary was the most liberal of the Soviet satellites and eased peacefully into democratic rule. Poland was more restless, but once it had been the catalyst for the collapse of Communism, it managed the shock therapy of moving to a market economy with impressive discipline. The Czechs and Slovaks, it was hoped, would behave as Mr. Havels enlightened heirs.

But no Communist country had ever experienced these radical shifts to democracy and market economics. Only Czechoslovakia had enjoyed genuine democratic rule, between the two world wars. The end of the Cold War made Europeans euphoric: Once democratic institutions were built, free elections held and centralized economies replaced with capitalist ones, everyone assumed the job was done.

Joining NATO and the European Union was the icing on the cake. In 2008, with end of history hubris, a World Bank report proclaimed that the transition was over. Mission accomplished.

Obviously, it was not. The effort to transform the economy was so demanding for the new democratic elites that little attention was paid to nurturing a new political culture. Modern Hungarian and Polish politics look riven with the legacy of Communism, trouble with sharing power, conspiracy theories and exclusionary discourse toward opponents.

Another, overlooked, factor is that most people in these countries are still poor. Despite nonstop economic growth since 1992, Polands gross domestic product is only 68 percent of the European Unions per capita average. When Polands foreign minister, Witold Waszczykowski, says the world should not move in one single direction  toward a new mix of cultures and races, a world of cyclists and vegetarians  he is rejecting the progressive social values perceived as part of the Western European economic model.

The Visegrad bloc has welcomed European Union subsidies, so crucial to their development. But we in Old Europe never really insisted that a democratic culture and diversity were also part of the deal; we didnt think we had to.

Is the rise of so-called illiberal democracy threatening the unions cohesion? Maybe. But Euroskeptic populist movements are far from a purely Central European phenomenon; they are also on the move in the unions founding member states. Twenty-five years after the Visegrad summit, Europe is still searching for unity  but the mood has shifted: from solidarity to recrimination.",[]

nytimes.com,,How Do I Find and Operate Across Lite in Windows 8?,[],"If you are upgrading your PC to Windows 8 (which will not have the familiar Start button), here are some helpful hints from LitSoft on how to find Across Lite on your computer, as well as information on whether or not you need to download Across Lite again. Please note that Across Lite has been fully tested in the new Windows 8 environment, and we have been assured that it works.

If you are upgrading an existing installation of Windows 7, it may or may not be necessary to download and install Across Lite again depending on how you upgrade. If you do not see Across Lite in the Home Screen, download and install again. The free download can be found here.

From LitSoft:

As you might already know, Windows 8 has changed its user interface somewhat and may create some confusion as to where to find the Across Lite program after installation (Windows 8 does not have the Start menu in the desktop view). The following might help in answering any questions you may have.

1. Across Lite v2.x for Windows as currently distributed is completely compatible with Windows 8. Across Lite is NOT available for Windows 8 on tablets yet, only on desktops and laptops. Use of a mouse is recommended rather than a touch screen on desktops and laptops that do come with a touch screen.

2. The installation process is the same as before. Simply download the installation program currently being distributed and run it to install Across Lite.

3. Windows 8 has two different usage modes. The first is a tiled screen where applications are seen as square/rectangular tiles. This is the screen Windows 8 boots to and is called the Home/Start Screen. There are apps that run in this screen and designed for it. Regular apps like Across Lite run in a desktop screen that looks like the Windows 7 screen.

When Across Lite is installed, a tile is created on the Home screen with the Across Lite icon in it. One may have to scroll this screen to the right to see it depending on how many programs you have installed. Clicking on this tile will launch Across Lite in the desktop mode which will look identical to Windows 7 screen (except for no Start button  you can think of the Home Screen as the Start menu for Windows 8). Clicking the Windows key in the keyboard in the desktop mode brings up the Home Screen with the tiles.

One of the tiles in the Home screen is to get to the desktop/laptop mode. The tile will display the wall paper that is used to identify it. This tile and the Windows button on the keyboard is used to switch back and forth between the two modes.

So the most likely question while you get used to the Windows 8 interface will be Where is my Across Lite that I installed on my PC?

First, please make sure that you have installed Across Lite by running the downloaded installation file. The process for this is the same as in earlier Windows downloading via the web browser.

If you have run the installation program, go to the Home screen (the tiled screen) if not already there and look for a tile with the Across Lite icon in it. Click it to start Across Lite. Once again, think of the tiled Home screen as the equivalent of Start->Programs in earlier versions.

Downloading a crossword after installing Across Lite will automatically start Across Lite with the puzzle loaded just as before. No further configuration is necessary.

But Deb, if I am upgrading to Windows 8 from Windows 7, do I really need to re-download and re-install Across Lite?

The safest answer is YES, although for a few people the upgrade will have moved the programs as well. However, weve been told that a re-install will not hurt. For new Windows 8 PCs, of course, please download and install Across Lite the same way as in Windows 7.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-02 00:00:00,"Young Africans, Wrapped in Tradition",['Whitney Richardson'],"The young woman sat proudly, firmly placing her hand below her chin to profile her face. Colorful silk fabric was neatly wrapped around her chest, while the studio light and golden backdrop bathed her gently oiled skin. Small circular tribal markings were tattooed on her upper body. Her neck and wrists were adorned with layers of beaded jewelry.

Just a few hours before, she had been wearing jeans, a button-up shirt and stiletto heels.

This transformation was spurred by Joana Choumali, a photographer from Ivory Coast who has been documenting modern African women wearing their familys traditional clothing. She said these portraits allow her subjects to reconnect with their family history in a physical way.

Even if we dont speak the language or dont go to the village every day, we are still African, Ms. Choumali said. I think its time to redefine what being African is.

That motivation came from her own experiences. Ms. Choumali, 41, was born and raised in Abidjan  Ivory Coasts economic capital and West Africas most populous French-speaking city. She attended international schools and was surrounded by students from all over the world.

But at least once a year, her family would travel to Adaou, a small town in the southeast, to visit her paternal grandmother, Ettien Amalan Louise. The visits were brief, and Ms. Choumali often felt a cultural disconnect with her grandmother: They didnt speak the same language or have relatable life experiences. Ms. Choumali eventually got a top-level job at an ad agency, while her grandmother spent her life in the village working as a farmer and a trader.

When her grandmother died in 2001, Ms. Choumali realized how much of her family history would be lost because she had not been able to talk with her about her life.

I felt like a part of me was going and part of my family was fading away, she said. For a long time, I felt guilty. I thought, I dont speak the language, maybe Im not that African.

Photo

In her portrait series, Resilients, which was recently featured at the Photolux Festival in Lucca, Italy, sponsored by the African Artist Foundation, Ms. Choumali sought to document young, professional African women  mostly Ivorian  who also struggled with the lingering guilt of not being able to relate to their familys traditional past. Over the course of several months, each portrait session required intense research on the specific details of how the clothes, jewelry, skin and hair needed to be styled based on the specific tribe the family was from.

She initially found most of her subjects  lawyers, students, doctors and managers  on the streets of Abidjan. Her sole requirement for the portrait was that the women had to wear traditional clothing already worn by their grandmother or an older female relative. This was intended to emphasize the link between past and present, and also the cultural heritage, Ms. Choumali said. Inspired by the golden hues of Rembrandts paintings, she handmade a backdrop to give the portraits a feeling of time travel, she said.

Ms. Choumalis interest in portrait photography began when she was 13; like many West African families, her parents hired a professional photographer to do a traditional family portrait at home. That same year, she received a camera for Christmas and said she had since been exploring how photography can address social issues. After quitting her job as an art director in an advertising agency, she became a full-time freelance photographer and has created her own studio in Abidjan.

Over the course of her Resilient series, women began reaching out to her to participate. Of her more than 30 subjects, a student studying in France came to her studio with her mother wearing a miniskirt and Converse sneakers. They had descended from the royal family of Grand Bassam, a city that was briefly the French colonial capital in the late 19th century. She had asked the king of Grand Bassam if she could wear her great-grandmothers outfit for the portrait session (image above).

The mother was so emotional, Ms. Choumali said. We dont even know why we cried, but the energy was really special. I feel that they were feeling the same feeling as I felt  relieved and kind of reassured that they were also part of their culture.

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Republican Delegate Math Favors Donald Trump After Latest Wins,['Trip Gabriel'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Donald J. Trump drew closer to grasping the Republican presidential nomination with his victories in three states Tuesday night, and the chances of party leaders wresting it from his hands at a contested convention were a bit remoter on Wednesday.









By winning Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii, Mr. Trump captured the greatest share of the 150 delegates at stake Tuesday, and his mathematical path to a majority of 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination is increasingly brighter than his rivals. He needs about 54 percent of outstanding delegates; his closest rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, needs 62 percent.

But Mr. Trump gained something even more valuable than delegates on Tuesday: momentum as the race heads into a watershed moment, March 15, when the first states that award delegates winner-take-all hold their primaries. They include Senator Marco Rubios home state, Florida, and Gov. John R. Kasichs, Ohio. Both men now have their backs to the wall, fighting for their political lives.

The only person that has a shot of getting 1,237 is us given how well we did last night, said Barry Bennett, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, who is closely tracking the delegate race for him. He said the clock is ticking on other candidates but not necessarily on us.

After Florida and Ohio, Mr. Bennett said, if we win both those states, Cruz will be 300 delegates behind. The winner-take-all states are the rocket fuel.

Mr. Cruz did better than polls predicted in Michigan and Mississippi, and he won a commanding victory in Idaho. In all, he netted an estimated 57 delegates to Mr. Trumps 71.

But Mr. Cruz, who trails Mr. Trump in delegates awarded so far by an estimated 462 to 358, is facing a primary map of big states in the North and West that are demographically more favorable to Mr. Trump. He seemed to acknowledge the difficulty of overtaking Mr. Trump before the convention even if the race becomes the two-man contest he has long sought.

Look, Reagan and Ford battled it out in a contested convention, Mr. Cruz told Fox News in an interview released on Wednesday morning. Thats what conventions are for.

Tuesdays results were a reversal for Mr. Cruz, who performed well in four states that voted on Saturday, winning two, Kansas and Maine, and emerging ahead of Mr. Trump in the days delegate haul.

Mr. Kasichs third-place finish in Michigan, a blow after he predicted as late as Tuesday night that he would come in second, is a sign of potential trouble for him in Ohio because of the demographic similarity of the two states.

Mr. Kasichs chief strategist, John Weaver, sought to make the case that the governor was in a good position as the nominating race moves away from the South.

After March 15, more than 1,000 delegates will still be available, and the electoral map shifts significantly in our favor, with the delegate-rich states fitting Governor Kasichs profile, Mr. Weaver wrote in a strategy memo late Tuesday.

But even if Mr. Kasich wins Ohio and its 66 delegates, along with some of the others at stake on the same day in Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina, his chances of gaining a majority of 1,237 is close to a mathematical impossibility. Only 1,000 delegates will remain after March 15.

His path to the nomination during regulation time, primary season, is narrow enough to be invisible, said Joshua T. Putnam, a political science lecturer at the University of Georgia with an expertise in delegate selection. His only path is to survive with some delegates into the convention.

Similarly, Mr. Rubio is facing a daunting mathematical roadblock. In failing to reach 15 percent of the votes in Michigan and Mississippi, and 20 percent in Idaho, he was shut out of delegates entirely in the three states holding primaries on Tuesday. He may have picked up only as few as two in Hawaii.

Mr. Trumps rivals seized on a new poll from The Wall Street Journal and NBC News on Tuesday showing a tight race among all four candidates in states that had not yet held primaries or caucuses. Mr. Trump was the favorite of 27 percent of likely Republican primary voters in those states. Mr. Cruz was favored by 25 percent, Mr. Kasich 24 percent and Mr. Rubio 23 percent.

The poll also suggested that if the race were to narrow to a one-on-one contest, Mr. Trump could be in trouble. In two-person matchups, all of Mr. Trumps three rivals were preferred by voters.

Next week will give us our first real clear indication, Mr. Putnam said. If Trump is shut out in Florida and Ohio, that portends a long battle in a race for a plurality rather than a majority.

On Tuesday, Mr. Kasich said that if Mr. Trump had a plurality of delegates coming into the convention, but fewer than a majority, the Republican party should not assume he deserves the nomination.

Its like being in school and you know that a 90 is an A and you get to 88 and everybody else is below you, he said. We dont grade on a curve when it comes to conventions.

But Republicans would be playing with fire if Mr. Trump is leading the delegate race and is denied the nomination at a contested convention.

It would tear the party in two, Mr. Bennett said. Whoever gave his sham acceptance speech would be doing it to a lot of empty chairs.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,ISIS Detainee Tells U.S. of Militants Plan to Use Mustard Gas,"['Helene Cooper', 'Eric Schmitt']","Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

WASHINGTON  An Islamic State detainee currently in American custody at a temporary detention facility in Erbil, Iraq, is a specialist in chemical weapons whom American military officials are questioning about the militant Sunni groups plans to use the banned substances in Iraq and Syria, defense officials said.









The detainee was identified by officials as Sleiman Daoud al-Afari, a chemical and biological weapons expert who once worked for Saddam Husseins Military Industrialization Authority.

Mr. al-Afari, described by the military as a significant Islamic State operative who was captured a month ago by commandos in an elite American Special Operations force, has, under interrogation, provided his captors with details about how the group had weaponized mustard gas into powdered form and loaded it into artillery shells, the officials said.

One official said that the gas was not concentrated enough to kill anyone, but that it could maim people.

As is protocol, Defense Department officials notified the International Committee of the Red Cross, which monitors the treatment of detainees, that they were holding an Islamic State fighter. The Red Cross acknowledged in a statement on Tuesday that it had visited the detainee but gave no other information.

Defense Department officials insist that the United States had no plans to hold the detainee or any other captives indefinitely, and that they would be handed over to the Iraqi and Kurdish authorities after they had been interviewed. The officials say they did not intend to establish a long-term American facility to hold Islamic State detainees, and Obama administration officials have ruled out sending any to the United States military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Mr. al-Afari was captured last month, shortly after the arrival in Iraq of a new Special Operations force that is made up primarily of Delta Force commandos. They are the first major American combat force on the ground there since the United States pulled out of the country at the end of 2011.

Before this, the American military has largely fought the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, with airstrikes, killing large numbers of Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria. But the 200-member Special Operations team has been given the task of killing and capturing Islamic State operatives, the latter in particular to use in gathering intelligence.

Defense officials said the team had set up safe houses and worked with Iraqi and Kurdish forces to establish informant networks and conduct raids on Islamic State leaders and other important militants.

Senior Defense Department officials say the model for handling Mr. al-Afari came from a Delta Force raid last May, when two dozen American commandos from Iraq entered eastern Syria aboard Black Hawk helicopters and V-22 Ospreys, killed a man known as Abu Sayyaf, described by American officials as the Islamic States emir for oil and gas.

Abu Sayyafs wife, Umm Sayyaf, was captured and taken to a screening facility in northern Iraq, where she was questioned and detained. American forces seized laptop computers, cellphones and other materials from the site.

Umm Sayyaf was kept for three months by the American authorities and provided them with information, officials said. Last August, she was transferred to Kurdish custody, and last month the Justice Department filed an arrest warrant charging her with conspiring to provide material support to the Islamic State in an offense that officials said resulted in the death of Kayla Mueller, the American aid worker who was killed in Syria in February 2014.

Officials say that Umm Sayyaf provided information on the Islamic States kidnap-for-ransom networks.

The United States has long suspected the Islamic State of using sulfur mustard, a chemical warfare agent, and last year officials said that they had confirmed the presence of the mustard gas on fragments of ordnance used in Islamic State attacks in Syria and Iraq. Laboratory tests, which were also performed on scraps of clothing from victims, showed the presence of a partially degraded form of HD, also known as distilled sulfur mustard, a substance banned internationally that burns a victims skin, airways and eyes.

Chemical warfare agents, broadly condemned and banned by most nations under international convention, are indiscriminate. They are also difficult to defend against without specialized equipment, which many of the Islamic States foes in Iraq and Syria lack, and they are worrisome as potential terrorist weapons, though chlorine and blister agents are typically less lethal than bullets, shrapnel or explosives.

It was unclear how the Islamic State obtained sulfur mustard, a banned substance with a narrow chemical warfare application. Both the former government in Iraq and the current government in Syria previously possessed chemical warfare programs.",[]

Oh, yes, theyre just politicians. This is how they think, and this is who they are. And thats why Donald Trump is killing them.









Trump may be many things, but he is not much of a politician, at least in any traditional sense. Everyone else on the Republican debate stage last night was. I almost forgot that for a few hours. It was easy to lose sight of amid the high dudgeon over Trump from so many prominent Republicans. There were so many frantic declarations that Trump was a liar/know-nothing/potentially catastrophic con man, and whatever else Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio were throwing at La Grande Orange in Detroit last night.

But in the end, the Republican debate came down to the one question I really wanted answered by the non-Trumpeters: Would they still commit to supporting the nominee of the Republican Party, even if he were Donald Trump? I mean, if he were as pure evil as they have been suggesting, shouldnt that, er, trump whatever musty notions of party loyalty they still cling to?

Even with all the breathless predictions of catastrophe from many Republicans in recent weeks, relatively few elected officials have actually come out and said they would not support Trump in November under any circumstances  whether that meant staying home, holding out for some still-unseen third-party alternative or actually pulling the lever for Hillary Clinton. Governor Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska and the former New Jersey governor, Christie Whitman, have all said they would choose one of those alternatives. Im sure there have been others, but not many. The band has been more of an a cappella group than a full orchestra to this point. That would have changed instantly had Cruz, Rubio or John Kasich actually joined them, which I would have thought  given some of the scorched-earth rhetoric  at least Cruz and Rubio would be ready to do.

But nuh-uh. All three of them answered the question by reiterating their vow to support the Republican nominee, even if it were Trump. Wow. This was the moment where Vince McMahon and all the W.W.E. performers came out and assured everyone not to worry, that they would never let things get really out of hand here. They were all just following a script and putting on the same old show.

If it were Trump in second or third place, and he felt as aggrieved as Rubio and Cruz supposedly do, there is no way he would promise to support the nominee. No way. Thats not how he thinks. He is not constrained by orthodoxy. And again, its probably a big reason hes winning. On the other hand, Im sure the non-Trumps were all thinking about what it might mean for their political futures if they said they would not support the nominee. Perhaps they want to run again, in 2020 or whenever, and want to remain pure in the eyes of the people who still define pure by fealty to whoever has the R next to his or her name. Whatever. Given all the noise and delirium of recent weeks  and some of the things Trump has also said about Cruz and Rubio  this still struck me as a monumental walk-back.

For his part, Rubio had even taken to selling #NeverTrump T-shirts and stickers on his campaign website, punctuating tweets with #NeverTrump and, as recently as yesterday, posting a #NeverTrump image on Instagram. That should now be amended to a hashtag version of Never Trump  unless hes the nominee of this party, which is a much better than average possibility, so Im covering my backside.

Or better yet, just change the hashtag to #NeverMind.",[]

If all goes to plan, a postponed mission to probe beneath the surface of Mars will launch in two years, NASA announced Wednesday.

The InSight spacecraft was to head to space this month, but in December, NASA delayed the mission when it realized that there was not enough time to fix stubborn leaks in a vacuum enclosure housing a key instrument.

NASA is now aiming to launch InSight in May 2018, the next time that Earth and Mars are close enough to allow a quick six-month trip. (Because Mars is farther from the Sun than Earth and orbits more slowly, the two planets line up just once every 26 months.)

Im thrilled, said W. Bruce Banerdt, a planetary geophysicist at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who is the missions principal investigator. We were hoping we would get the opportunity to give this another try.

InSight  a shortening of Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport  would land on Mars on Nov. 26, 2018.

However, the space agency does not yet know exactly how much the delay would add to the missions $675 million cost. Dr. Banerdt said his team had given officials at NASA headquarters a rough estimate on the order of $150 million, more or less.

Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Science Times Newsletter Every week, we'll bring you stories that capture the wonders of the human body, nature and the cosmos.

CNES, the French space agency, is in charge of the seismic instrument that turned troublesome.

InSight is designed to listen to what is going on in the deep interior of the planet including the shaking of tiny quakes. Measuring the change of velocity of seismic waves as they pass through the planet could also offer clues about Marss crust, mantle and core.

The three seismometers in the instrument, sensitive enough to detect movements as small as half the radius of a hydrogen atom, require a near-perfect vacuum to operate with precision. Tests in August revealed a small leak in the enclosure, a flattened sphere about nine inches wide. Engineers attempted to patch it, but the leak persisted.

NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managing the mission, is to redesign and build a new enclosure.

Dr. Banerdt will travel to NASA headquarters in Washington in about six months to present a more detailed cost estimate and report on the fixes. Theyll be watching that very closely and making sure were making good progress, he said.

NASA officials could still cancel the mission, but Dr. Banerdt said he was extremely optimistic that InSight would get off the ground.

Last month, Lockheed Martin, which built InSight, shipped the spacecraft back from the launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California to Denver, where it is now being prepared for storage.",[]

MIAMI  Carly Fiorina endorsed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas on Wednesday, supplying his campaign with a high-profile supporter and an eager critic of Donald J. Trump.

Mrs. Fiorina, the former presidential candidate and Hewlett-Packard chief executive, took to the role quickly, appearing as a surprise guest at Mr. Cruzs morning rally in Florida.

Some people are now saying: Well, Donald Trump wouldnt be so bad. O.K., maybe hes a liberal, maybe hes a fraud but at least hes a deal-maker,' Mrs. Fiorina told a crowd of about 200 people. The truth is that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are two sides of the same coin. They arent going to reform the system. They are the system.

For Mr. Cruz, who has increasingly moved to frame the primary season as a two-man race against Mr. Trump, the endorsement provides a crucial boost.

Our message today is one of unity, he said after Mrs. Fiorina  who suspended her campaign after the New Hampshire primary in February  spent several minutes praising him.

He surmised that, as news of the endorsement spread, We just heard a whole bunch of Democratic activists and Hillary supporters go, Whoa, what was that?

Mrs. Fiorinas history as a vocal critic of both Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump leaves her well-positioned to act as a major Cruz surrogate. Few candidates have been as successful as Mrs. Fiorina in knocking Mr. Trump off balance during debates.

In her first act as a Cruz supporter, Mrs. Fiorina even managed to praise the senator using a favored Trump phrase.

He has won over and over and over, Mrs. Fiorina said of Mr. Cruz. He has won.",[]

It looks like he is still getting inspiration from Film Noir (se picture above). The director, Otto Preminger also made Frank Sinatras best film, The Man With The Golden Arm.

It seems to be a sequel of sorts of his last album and will most probably consist of Frank Sinatra standards (songs Sinatra did).

At least some of the work on the album is done in Studio B at Hollywoods famed Capitol Studios (According to producer Al Schmitt, Feb 11).

It seems like he is brushing up on already recorded material.

nytimes.com,2016-03-04 00:00:00,Review: Memoirs From Two Eras Testify to Prisons Corrosive Effect,['Michiko Kakutani'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Two newly published prison memoirs  one contemporary, the other written in the late 1850s  provide harrowing portraits of life behind bars. They also speak to the personal consequences of what is today an epidemic of mass incarceration: America has the largest prison population in the world, and one in 35 African-American men are in prison.









The Life and the Adventures of a Haunted Convict is a memoir by Austin Reed, a free black man, born in the 1820s in upstate New York, chronicling his years at the New York House of Refuge, an early juvenile reformatory, and at the Auburn State Prison. The manuscript was found several years ago at an estate sale in Rochester, and was later identified by scholars at Yale working with the universitys Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library as the first known prison memoir by an African-American.

Mr. Reed writes in an utterly idiosyncratic pastiche of styles and genres  part confession, part jeremiad, part lamentation, part picaresque novel (reminiscent, at times, of Dickens and Defoe). But his story also reads like a bookend to Writing My Wrongs, a gritty, visceral memoir by Shaka Senghor, a Detroit drug dealer in the 1980s, who pleaded guilty to second degree murder in 1991 and served 19 years in prison, seven of them in solitary confinement.

Both men knew a measure of security in their early childhoods, which was shattered by family upheavals. After his father died, the young Mr. Reed was indentured, at the age of 8 or 10, to a white farmer, who tied him up like a slave and whipped him, and he soon ended up at the Refuge, where boys were so severely beaten with a cat-o-nine-tails that their backs were shredded into coats of red stripes.

Mr. Senghor had once dreamed of becoming a doctor, but after his parents separated and his mother began beating him, he left home and fell in with crack dealers. After being shot himself, he took to carrying a gun, and one night, shot and killed a man whom he felt threatened by.

In their books, both Mr. Senghor and Mr. Reed recount the horrors and humiliations they experienced in unblinking detail, conveying not just physical abuse (which in Mr. Reeds case included a form of waterboarding administered by prison officials) but also the psychological fallout that left them filled with rage and fear.

What helped sustain both men was writing, which provided a means of regaining a measure of control over their lives. Writing enabled Mr. Reed to document his defiance, and to leave future readers a record of the early days of a prison system that would bridge the era of slavery and our own age of mass incarceration. His book chronicles his dehumanizing treatment in two penal institutions in antebellum America and, at the same time, it looks forward to 20th-century prison writings like The Autobiography of Malcolm X and George Jacksons Soledad Brother, which, in turn, would help inspire Mr. Senghors book and the poet Reginald Dwayne Bettss fierce 2009 memoir, A Question of Freedom.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In Mr. Senghors case, writing helped him atone for his wrongs  and the life he had taken. It also provided a respite from the harsh day-to-day realities of his cell. With a pencil and a piece of paper, he recalls, it was almost like I could travel outside of prison and go wherever I desired. I could stand on the corner in my neighborhood, and no one could stop me. I could drive down the freeway to see my ex-girlfriend in Ohio, and the bars and wired fences couldnt hold me back. Writing was freedom, so I wrote till my fingers were sore.

Reading, too, became a refuge: Alex Haleys Roots, Stephen King novels, Malcolm Xs autobiography, the Bible, the Quran, revolutionary works by George Jackson and Assata Shakur, and books on African history. When books arrived from the prison library, he says, it felt as if Santa Claus had just come sliding down the chimney, and he began taking part in study groups with other prisoners to discuss what theyd read.

Such literary pursuits belie the brutality of prison life. Mr. Senghor writes that during his first six weeks at the Wayne County Jail, he witnessed everything from rape and robbery to murder, and that life behind bars was defined by violence  oppressed against oppressor, predator against prey. Just as Darwinian rules of survival held sway on the streets during the crack epidemic, so the law of the jungle prevailed in prison.

If you and another male exchanged glances, he writes, youd better be up to the challenge, or you would be considered weak. And in our world, the weak became prey. Even ball games in the yard could be deadly: It was common for inmates to play basketball with a shank in the sole of their shoes. A hard foul could lead to a stabbing or, worse, a riot.

Writing and studying provided Mr. Senghor with a refuge from the chaos of prison and a growing awareness that he wanted to turn his life around. It was a resolution galvanized by his correspondence with the godmother of the man he had killed, who told him she forgave him, and by a letter from his 10-year-old son, Lil Jay, who had learned that his father was in prison for murder. Its the anger in my heart that hurts me the most without a dad in the house, Lil Jay wrote. My mama said I am the man of the house. She tells me I have to take over the anger so I wont be in jail.

Mr. Senghor was released from prison on June 22, 2010, the day after his 38th birthday, and after a series of part-time writing jobs, he started a mentoring program for at-risk youth. He delivered a TED Talk, and eventually received fellowships with the M.I.T. Media Lab and the W. K. Kellogg Foundation.

Mr. Senghor writes about the process of atonement and the possibility of redemption, and talks of his efforts to work for prison reforms that might turn a system designed to warehouse into one aimed at rehabilitation. The ending of Mr. Reeds story is murkier: He was released from prison in May 1863, and may have been arrested again.

The story Mr. Reed tells is one of being broken, his youthful hopes of self-betterment whipped out of him and drowned in the shower baths.

When I first entered this prison in the days of my boyhood, he writes, the cheerful respects and good manners bloomed and shined in my face like a midsummers day, but, he goes on, these hard and cruel hearted tyrants have taken my education, my good reason which God had given me, all away, and made me to become the harden convict of a gloomy prison where all is dark, cold, chilly, and dismal.

Though Mr. Reeds book suggests he found some solace in the act of writing, it is also a chilling reminder to the reader of the roots of an American prison system that has grown no more humane and grown so exponentially that it now houses a startling 2.2 million people, taking a devastating toll on the countrys poorest and least educated, and wreaking further desolation on entire families and neighborhoods.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,The Costumes That Obscure Doctor and Patient,"['M D', 'Abigail Zuger']","Photo

Hard Cases Dr. Abigail Zuger on the everyday ethical issues doctors face.

Is it time for new costumes in the long-running improv act featuring doctor and patient? The white coat and the cotton gown are tattered, under continual assault for their practical deficiencies and outmoded symbolism.

Along with ties and long sleeves, Britain banned white coats for most doctors almost 10 years ago. Our priestly garb turns out to harbor quantities of bacteria, including the hospital-associated germs we try to keep away from patients.

Presumably all garments carry bacteria, including the vestments of priests. The clergy, though, probably tote a less noxious load  and probably change robes more often. Doctors report that they do so only every couple of weeks, long enough for grime to accumulate.

Most American medical schools now bestow a fresh white coat on every new student, a symbol of our exalted professional aspirations. Some American hospitals now discourage those selfsame coats in the name of hygiene. Draw what moral you will. Many pediatricians would no more dress in a white coat than in a gorilla suit, lest they scare the little ones. Some adult doctors, reasoning that we are all children in illness, feel likewise. Some of us just need the pockets.

The best clinician I ever knew was draped in a grayish shabby thing spilling over with scraps of paper, vaguely redolent of his usual weekday lunch of pea soup. Whether you were a patient or a trainee, you didnt really want him near you, until you quickly figured out that you really did.

One of the worst specimens of doctor Ive run into wore snowy white, changed daily. You really didnt want that guy near you, period, as many of his patients ultimately realized, including the ones who took him to court.

The symbolism surrounding patient gowns is just as fraught. They are cheap, demeaning, undignified and chilly. One way to cope is to wear two of them, one opening to the front and one to the rear. Thus encased, the patient is snug and warm, and also extremely well defended from inquisitive fingers and probing stethoscopes. It turns out that actual clothes are far easier to push aside for an examination than are two johnnie gowns firmly knotted together.

But patient gowns are out of style in some places mostly because they clash with the dominant medical fashion these days: doing everything at top speed. People need time and privacy to dress and undress. Medical settings without time or extra space find their stacks of clean gowns going undisturbed.

Instead, patients disrobe incompletely, or sometimes not at all, just opening little portals in their clothing through which what passes for a physical examination can be performed. Such accommodation is regrettable, but necessary to maintain our cruising speed. Call it laparoscopy for the nonsurgeon.

For my professors, the physical exam was a sacred ritual. I sometimes wonder which would distress them more: the thought of treating a rash glimpsed only on a cellphone screen, or the idea of asking a patient to open two shirt buttons under his tie for a quick inspection of that thing on his chest. Ive been guilty of both.

A couple of months ago, on a frigid winter day, a stolid, silent patient came in because her knee hurt. Just give me something, she said. I was sorely tempted, but I couldnt do it: I had to examine both unclad legs. She cast me a look of pure disgust and hauled herself to her feet.

It took almost 10 minutes for her to peel off the layers of tight, ill-fitting jeans, socks, pantyhose, more socks, more hose, long underwear, down to the arthritic knee. It took another 10 minutes to put it all back on.

My professors would have stepped out to give her some privacy. For some reason, I stayed where I was.

Those 20 minutes were death to the days schedule, but invaluable for showing the harried doctor something of the grim labor of everyday life for this patient, a heart-rending discomfort of binding elastic and straining seams she could never have articulated, and, of course, one that would have been invisible with her on display in a hospital gown.

It was the process that educated, not the final tableau.

We are never more human than when we are dressing and undressing, and yet for our medical care, we have, for some reason, decided to posture in front of one another fully costumed, pretending that, encased in our separate roles, we will get to the bottom of the pain.

Perhaps we need not new costumes but new stage directions. Perhaps doctors should routinely watch patients undress and then dress again. Perhaps, for that matter, patients should watch doctors washing their chapped hands yet again and putting on their white coats, checking the pockets for tools, phone numbers, reminders, lists of urgencies, looking at those coffee stains and wincing, vowing to get to the laundry and then forgetting.",[]

This weeks GIF science lesson might give you a newfound appreciation for how simple it is for most humans to consume a shrimp cocktail.

No, this tiny aquatic creature is not that multi-headed sea beast of Greek mythology that regenerates a head every time some daring hero chops it off. It doesnt even have a head. But like the mythical hydra, the real hydra does regenerate, which is why scientists have been studying it for decades. Over time, researchers have learned one fact creepy enough to fuel nightmares: Every time this pond-dweller wants to eat  for example a little brine shrimp  it rips a hole through the center of its bodys outer layer. When dinner is done, it closes back up.

Photo

Researchers have been aware of the hydras unusual mouth for quite some time. But the GIF above, pulled from a 25 second video clip published Tuesday by biophysicists at the University of California, San Diego, helps show whats going on at the cellular level.

Just seconds after the researchers applied a chemical present in shrimp, the hydra detected the possible snack and ripped open a mouth. Later, the mouth sealed back up so the hydra could digest.

It looks a little bit like the control of the pupil in the human eye, said Eva-Maria Collins, who led the research team, noting that the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems control dilation of the pupil.

When a human detects a threat, the sympathetic nervous system prepares the body to respond, dilating the pupils to help see better. In the absence of the threat, the parasympathetic nervous system brings the pupil back to normal. Dr. Collins thinks the hydra opens and closes its mouth for food by a similar process.",[]

This weeks puzzle was suggested by Kenneth Kong, a TV personality in Singapore. Kenneth had a moment of global fame about a year ago after sharing the Cheryls Birthday problem, a simple challenge that went wildly viral (covered in Numberplay here). The problem generated quite a storm on Twitter, including suggestions for more puzzles. I asked Kenneth if he had a favorite, and he pointed to a suggestion by Igor Diev, who introduces his puzzle this way: Frankly speaking, the task of #cherylsbirthday youve showed the world is rather easy and its a shame to be unable to solve it. Let me give you a task that Russian 14-year-old students solve. Thats what should really blow your mind.

Well, nothing activates the neurons like a playful taunt. Lets try 



Ali Babas Cave

Ali Baba found a cave full of gold and diamonds. A bag full of gold weighs 200 kilograms, a bag full of diamonds weighs 40 kilograms. Ali Baba can carry only 100 kilograms at a time. A kilogram of gold costs $20, and a kilogram of diamonds costs $60. What is the greatest amount of money Ali Baba can earn for the gold and diamonds he can carry out at once (in one attempt in one bag)?

Thank you, Kenneth Kong, and spasibo to Mr. Diev!

MONDAY PUZZLE  The main challenge I faced while solving this nicely symmetrical Monday puzzle was swallowing the emotions that surfaced, a tasty mix of fondness and revulsion for the cute little decade sandwiched between the Awesome 80s and the terrifying era we live in now. Im Generation X, though. Eating our feelings is one of our specialties.

The four clues to 90s phenomena were clear enough for me, therefore, although I wonder if that was the case for everyone. As the puzzles center readily admits, these are 90SFADS  for anyone unconcerned with the zeitgeist of that slice of time, solving could have been a challenge.

One wonders if THE RACHEL, for example, will really stand the test of time, and although THE MACARENA is probably an earworm for many of us, does anyone wonder what really happened to Los Del Rio? TAMAGOTCHI is a portmanteau that means absolutely nothing in English but is pretty fun to say out loud, so maybe the word will last longer than the demanding little trinkets it refers to ever did.

DRMARTENS are classic, however, and will be with us until the end of time. Even post-apocalyptic zombies wear Docs.

As a funny twist to this nostalgia trip, this is the first time that any of these definitions appeared in a New York Times puzzle. Itll be interesting to see if any of them come back and when.

Some other nice related touches by the constructor were references to earlier pop culture phenomena  the SAYHEY kid is a moniker that supposedly dates back to the early 50s, and WHAMO is older (although the Frisbee will turn 60 next year). I believed the SMURFS to be pure 80s, weakly reprised this decade, but to my surprise the little blue characters actually began as a 1950s Belgian cartoon, so maybe the Smurfs of my memories are also a weak reprise of Les Schtroumpfs. What goes around, comes around, right?

If the Macarena is still playing in your mind, this should knock it out:

Location Los Angeles

His Favorite Place The Spanish-style duplex apartment Mr. Maggio rents near Beverly Hills. Dark and masculine, the space is filled with, as Mr. Maggio put it, those rich textures that are cliche pimp 70s.

What do you love about it here? Its very me, the weird mix of stuff. I have these big, comfortable modern sofas, and then that burlwood credenza, and then I have this ridiculous river rock coffee table. Its the cheesiest, but I thought it would be so rad to mix it with this stuff. Its obvious that a designer didnt put it together. Nothing in my house makes sense. I have an 80s Santa Cruz skateboard banner framed.

What I love about your house is the way it refutes the light, airy image of the Southern California interior. When I think of L.A. interiors, I go to Tony Duquette and the old-school Hollywood dark and opulent homes. The rich tones, the jewel tones. Thats what I love about L.A. interiors. My place is just dark, so even if the walls are white, it would still be dark. Its a cave, but its a soft cave.

Do you have a girlfriend? What does she think? My girlfriend loves the place. She also likes white walls, too, so some things might have to change.

I see a Cire Trudon candle on the bookshelf. Im going to guess that its Ernesto. I do love the Ernesto, because it smells like Hemingways breath. But thats Carmelite.

I Took My Husband, Not His Name









I am getting married this May and do not plan on changing my last name. As a feminist, I feel this tradition is outdated, sexist and insulting. My fiance does not care either way. However, he is very tight with 10 of his former high school friends who are all married to educated, smart and career-minded women, all of whom proudly changed their last names. Those friends are part of our close circle of friends (even though they live in another state). Ms. Post, they are already using the labels the future Mrs. Smith or the Smiths, and we are already getting holiday cards with just his last name on them. How do I (as a newcomer to the group) make this stop without insulting their values? Or is this worth it at all?

Forever Ms.

Even though this particular group of women has stuck with the custom of taking their husbands names, there are women of all ages and walks of life who have done as you plan to do.

You care greatly about keeping your given name, and it is entirely your prerogative to do so. To keep your friends from making a wrong assumption about your name it is important that you communicate your decision in a factual, upbeat, nonjudgmental way to others. Is it worth it? Yes, it is. Otherwise, their error will continually grate.

You do not have to go into a big explanation or defend your desire to keep your name. No lectures extolling your stance that, in your opinion, it is an outdated tradition for a woman to take her husbands name. Simply state you are keeping your last name. Word of mouth works well, Im going to keep my given name after Jeff and I are married. The other women in the group shouldnt be insulted by the information if you skip an editorial on the topic.

You can also get the point across on the return address of the thank-you notes written after your wedding, or on other correspondence you send them in the future. Another way to communicate that you plan to continue to use your last name is with a statement on your wedding website, Kristy is keeping her name after we tie the knot, or post your new address using your preferred style: Mr. Jeffrey Smith and Ms. Kristy Hoving, 555 South Street, Anytown. (By the way, either your or your husbands name can be listed first.)

After your wedding, give it a little time for the others to get used to not calling you Mrs. Smith. If someone slips, you can gently offer your friendly reminder, Im thrilled that Jeff and I are married, but remember, Im still using my last name. Be patient as they get used to your preferred name and get to know you and your fiance as newlyweds.

Its basically a matter of respecting others choices. If you show respect to the other women by not commenting on their married names and your opinion of that decision, Im sure they will be respectful of you, too. After a little time, you will likely get to know your husbands friends better. Once they remember your choice of name, Im sure they will honor it.

Wanting to Throw Something Else Instead of Rice

I received an email in January from my friend and the mother of the bride saying that they hoped we would be able to join them in March for my friends wedding, adding, Formal invitations will be mailed in early January.

The email went on to say where the reception is being held and the name of the hotels where they had blocked rooms and by what dates to book.

About a week ago (one month before the wedding), I asked another friend if she had received her invitation in the mail. She said that she had received it.

After that, I received an email from the mother of the bride to say that she was sorry for the awkwardness (apparently my other friend said something), but that the wedding couple had included more of their friends and that she, therefore, had to cut their list of friends. In other words, I would not be receiving the formal invitation. My husband and I had been cut!

I would have expected a personal call or would have expected my friend to tell me personally when we recently saw each other. Should I say something to my friend to express my surprise and disappointment in the way she handled things? Was this all incredibly rude?

Anonymous

This unfortunate turn of events can be labeled rude because it was thoughtless and hurtful to you. The scenario is a prime example of why one really cant retract an invitation, even one that was through an initial save-the-date email.

Your friend, the mother of the bride, sounds as if she let the details of the wedding get out of hand. The planning was obviously not managed well if it meant the guest list was so drastically chopped when the invitations went out. Clear communication and decisions about a wedding guest list have to occur before save-the-date notices are sent. Even a casual, early comment of I hope you can come to the wedding needs to be valid and followed up with an invitation. Otherwise, its a slap in the face to be omitted, as you have discovered.

Ideally, the brides mother should have stood up to the couple and explained that all of the guests who had received a save-the-date notice must receive an invitation. As that wasnt the case, it is clear that she could have done a better job of damage control  that is, of communicating with you. It might have been less hurtful to you if she had immediately called, or even seen you in person, to explain the problem. But whether she was overwhelmed with wedding planning, embarrassed or just plain clueless, time went by, and she skipped making the effort to have an immediate conversation with you. In a delicate situation like this, sending an email rather than speaking in person does tend to add salt to the wound. At least your friend said she was sorry. My hunch is that she did feel terrible and did not know what to do about the situation.

You have to be the judge about whether you and this friend have a relationship that you want to get back on track. Friends are precious commodities. Maybe you and she were never really that close and youd prefer to let the relationship fade. If thats your decision, try to at least forgive her enough to be civil and gracious. In time, some of the hurt should dissolve.

On the other hand, you might want to forgive her if the friendship means enough to you. Allow yourself to cool off before reaching out to her. After the wedding  she probably wont be able to focus on your friendship until the wedding is over  contact your friend and arrange to get together. Its O.K. to tell her how surprised and hurt you have been, but also let her know you would like to mend fences. Your friend will probably be grateful for your forgiveness and glad that you want to continue your friendship. (She might need a friend, as it sounds as if others were cut from the list, and my guess is they were offended, too.) Lets hope she learned a good lesson about the importance of keeping commitments. Good luck!

A jury on Wednesday found a former United States serviceman guilty of seeking to support a foreign terrorist organization after trying to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State.

The former serviceman, Tairod Pugh, 48, hung his head as the jury foreman announced the verdict in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.

The trial, which began on Feb. 29, was the first case related to the Islamic State to reach a verdict in an American courtroom, although there is another trial underway in Phoenix involving a man accused of conspiring to support the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Over the last two years, dozens of other people have also been arrested on charges of trying to travel to Syria and Iraq to fight with the Islamic State or of plotting terrorist attacks in the United States on behalf of the organization.

The evidence in the case demonstrated that Mr. Pugh, an itinerant airplane mechanic at airports across the Middle East, had researched border crossings to Syria and had boarded a flight to Istanbul, a common jumping-off point for would-be foreign fighters seeking to make their way to territory controlled by the Islamic State in neighboring Syria.

Mr. Pugh, an Air Force veteran, consumed slickly produced Islamic State propaganda and watched scenes of beheadings, crucifixions and other atrocities. And the evidence showed that he had alienated his American colleagues by making inflammatory statements in support of the Islamic State.

He had drafted a letter to his wife, promising to bring her along to paradise after he died a martyr. In the letter, he had pledged to use the talents and skills given to me by Allah to establish and defend the Islamic State. But he had not sent the letter, giving his defense an opening to argue that although Mr. Pugh was an ardent ideological supporter of the Islamic State, his visions of joining the group were just fantasies.

The jury rejected that defense, convicting him of crimes that carry a potential 35-year sentence. In addition to the material support charge, Mr. Pugh was found guilty of trying to destroy a number of flash drives that the government claimed contained evidence against him.

One aspect of the case against Mr. Pugh remained a mystery. When Mr. Pugh landed in Istanbul in January 2015, the Turkish authorities detained him and ultimately deported him, through Cairo, back to Kennedy International Airport, where the Federal Bureau of Investigation was waiting for him. But it remained unclear whether the Turkish authorities had grown suspicious of Mr. Pugh on their own, or whether they had been alerted to Mr. Pughs possible intentions by the United States government.

The trial also demonstrated that Mr. Pugh, a solitary figure drifting between jobs in places like Kuwait and Dubai, had managed to cultivate a network of like-minded strangers over Facebook, including, prosecutors claim, a Queens woman named Noelle Velentzas.

Their Facebook conversations were among the contents of Mr. Pughs computer that were shown to the jury. Three months after Mr. Pughs arrest, Ms. Velentzas was arrested in Queens on charges related to plotting a terror attack. Prosecutors say that she had declared that she and her roommate, who was also arrested, were citizens of the Islamic State.",[]

FRIDAY PUZZLE  When you dont have a theme to cling to and the clues are ramped up to weekend-level, it can be difficult to conquer a crossword puzzle. If you are just dipping a toe into the late week, themeless puzzles, there are only two things you will need to be successful, and they are 1) patience and 2) more patience.

There are two ways to approach a late-week puzzle. You can scan the clues looking for something, anything that you definitely know, or you can take an educated guess. I highly recommend starting out with the former approach. Nothing boosts your solving self-esteem like filling in that first entry in a blank grid. This first entry will vary, depending on your personal wheelhouse. In my case, I started with 57 Downs Janies got A GUN' and Almond ROCA at 60 Down (I know. Aerosmith and candy. Sorry, Mom.) If those are not your speed, how about Al JOLSON at 9 Down, who sang the timeless Toot Toot Tootsie (Goobye)? Or perhaps you are a bit of a dandy, and you are all about the PERIWIGS. I can remember reading The Bobbsey Twins as a child, so NAN went in right away.

No matter what you know, fill it in and pat yourself on the back for embarking on a late-week solve. From there, branch out and try to connect as many of the entries as you can. The patience comes in when you feel stuck. Put the puzzle down and go do something else. Your brain will continue to process what youve seen in the clues and when you come back to it, youll be surprised at how much more you suddenly know.

The second approach, which can also work, is to take an educated guess at entries that might not be what they seem. At 61 Across, the clue One who can see right through you? is obviously misdirection, what with the question mark at the end. So it probably doesnt mean someone who can see that youre not being honest, which is one possible definition of ... see right through you. Who else can see right through you? My first guess was SUPERMAN, but that doesnt fit. The only other person that could possibly see through you is a RADIOLOGIST.

Having fun yet? You should be. Remember, this is a game. Its a pastime, and its supposed to be fun. Getting angry because you dont know or like a certain word or you think that crosswords should be a strict test of intelligence is pointless and bad for your health. So, if youre having trouble with the puzzle, put it down and come back to it when you can solve it in the fun spirit in which it is meant to be solved.

Evans Clinchy offers us this Friday puzzle and has quite a bit to say about it, so Ill stop lecturing and let him take the mic:

Constructors Notes

So this is my second crossword published in The Times, and if you compare this puzzle with my previous one, youll notice a host of similarities. Both are themeless, both feature stacks of 11-letter entries across the top and bottom three rows, and both are built around the seed entry of a famous N.B.A. player. Last time, back in 2014, it was KEVIN DURANT; this time, I give you Kareem ABDUL-JABBAR. I swear, I have other ambitions in life beyond cramming as many basketball players as possible into Times puzzles. Eventually Ill have no names left to play with besides FESTUS EZELI or someone equally obscure. I should quit now while Im ahead. Anyway. This puzzle was a joy to construct  I remember it began with the realization that the fun CARTOONLIKE fit perfectly beneath ABDUL-JABBAR, and it all flowed from there. I liked getting to sneak in PERIWIGS (which Ive always thought is a cool word, no?) and ONE-TWO PUNCH. Including the name LOUIS C.K. in a puzzle was always something of a bucket-list goal, as the comedian has always been a favorite of mine. Funny, though  I thought I was so original for including Louie at the time I wrote this puzzle, as hed never been featured before. Then his name showed up three times shortly thereafter  in November 2014, January 2015 and March 2015. Great minds think alike, or something? At least I had the neat twist of crossing the comics name with TITLE ROLE, since he has one on his FX show. Its the little victories. As for the clues, Im happy with a few that I wrote (especially the pyramid scheme wordplay for CHEERLEADER), but Im equally grateful for Will sprucing up some of my duller clues with some flavorful ideas of his own. One who can see right through you? for RADIOLOGIST is great. Wish Id thought of that. Also, a picture in one of the clues! [The picture is in the print version only. D.A.] Thats crazy  didnt even know it was a thing. I understand its very, very rare, so Im honored that Will chose my puzzle to decorate. Thanks for reading (and solving), everyone. Ill be back with a Sunday puzzle next time, obviously, because how else am I gonna fit GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO into a grid?

And now for something completely different: a PERIWIGged game of charades:

A great new neighborhood bar slides in seamlessly, filling a hole without unraveling the local fabric. Lovers Rock, a mellow reggae-themed bar that opened in Bedford-Stuyvesant over the summer, is this rare kind of place.

On a Saturday in December, a Japanese D.J. spun tunes to visitors with au courant mom jeans, tattoo sleeves, quilted bombers and stocking caps. At a table near the bar, a 30-something couple praised the diversity. The music makes everyone tolerate everyone, a contractor from Flatbush said.

THE PLACE

An unassuming storefront on a Tompkins Avenue intersection that is undergoing rapid changes (bodega, farm-to-table soul food restaurant, building demolition). The room is a warm, low-ceiling box with checkerboard floors, posters for Sly and Robbie, and overhead lights that resemble maraschino cherries. A gravel patio has picnic tables, strung pepper-shaped lights and an occasional jerk-chicken pop-up. On summer nights, its a major melting pot, said Shane Feirstein, an owner. Its lit. When we close the yard at midnight, thats when the music vibe gets popping.

THE CROWD

Bartenders in Supreme hats and Ramones T-shirts sling fruity drinks to a lively rundown of locals and transplants. One night, the backyard resembled Fader Fort during SXSW, with unisex Huaraches and Chuck Taylors, guys in clasped baseball caps and women dressed in vintage ensembles befitting Billy Crystal circa City Slickers. Whatever the drinking population, everyone wants a nice bar, Mr. Feirstein said, pointing out that Lovers Rock could refer to reggae, the Clash or Sade.

THE PLAYLIST

D.J.s spin Sleng Teng, dub and dancehall on vinyl several nights a week. Theres an R&B party called Pure Grind. New Years will feature Deadly Dragon Sound System from the Lower East Side record store of the same name.

GETTING IN

21 and over, usually no cover.

DRINKS

Affordable beverages sway tropical, with copious rum and tequila; the Old Jerk ($10) mixes Appleton with spicy jerk syrup. A bottle of Red Stripe costs $5. Curry fish and other varieties of empanada are $4.",[]

TUESDAYS PUZZLE  What reaction do you usually get if you dare to share your fondness for crossword puzzles with others at cocktail parties? One of the most frequent comments I get when I tell people that I construct puzzles is, Oh, I can never do those, followed immediately by, Who ate all the dip? I cant help it; I like dip. But that is not my point.

My point is, people have a tendency to make assumptions about what they can and cant do without even trying, and that seems to go double for crossword puzzles. Solving is one of those skill sets we acquire only by doing, so the best way to do them is to ... well, do them. Even if you need to call in reinforcements to help you out, the next one will be easier. It might not become your new favorite pastime, but thats O.K. I believe you gain something just for having solved.

In order to prove my point, I called in the fabulous Michael Musto, writer of The Village Voices popular La Daily Musto gossip column and author of the coming Fork on the Left, Knife in the Back (Vantage Point, September, 2011) to be our guest solver today. Michael is a self-professed non-finisher when it comes to crossword puzzles, but he agreed to give todays festive grid a try. Not only did he and a friend finish it, but they had fun doing it.

Here is his experience:

Ive always appreciated crossword puzzles because theyre a challenging test of your intellect and character. Besides, no one really needs to know how well you did on them. And I dont do that well on them! Even though I graduated from an Ivy League college with a degree in English Literature and have made a living at language for decades, I usually find that The New York Times puzzle tends to remind me of how many arcane yet fascinating things I simply dont know. Still, I gamely gave this a whirl and found it more up my tin pan alley than usual since there were show bizzy items in there about SHIRLEY TEMPLE and David Bowie. Easy! When I even managed to figure out things like Something found in an old board, maybe  which was so not me  I was beside myself with the realization that these puzzles are not always as un-doable as Id thought. Even so, the lower left patch wasnt completely filled, since Most played part of a 45 and Transport in a western were stumping me, even though I still own 45s and I just saw True Grit. I had to use a lifeline, namely my friend Lynn Yaeger, whos also a writer and is much better at crosswords than I am. It became a really fun social experience as we giggled over lunch and she explained the answers to me  ASIDE = A side and STAGE. We had a gratifying time solving the rest of these clues  and then I promptly went back to my stack of 99-cent Word Search books.

Thats O.K., Michael. Thanks again for playing, and even if youre not a convert, I still think youre a MENSCH.

Barely four minutes into Jerrod Carmichaels 2014 debut comedy special, Love at the Store, he makes a joke about the death of Trayvon Martin. Money changes you, Carmichael tells the audience, recounting how he recently entered his upscale apartment building wearing a hooded sweatshirt and made it through the lobby unquestioned by his doorman. I was concerned, he says. I pay a lot of money  like, a lot of money  so that niggas in hoodies like me cant waltz by you. Addressing the doorman, he adds, Next time, stand your ground. The laughter that greets this phrase is scattered and uneasy, but Carmichael only digs in. Really? he says.  Cause, like, that Trayvon [expletive] is really affecting your day to day ... you wake up, have your cup of coffee, and you do this  he blows a kiss  to a picture of Trayvon. And then you start your day. Is that what you do? Carmichael grins genially.  Cause you dont.

Carmichael has one of stand-ups most unorthodox approaches to exploring race and class, and in building to his Martin joke, he assumes an unexpected voice: that of the race traitor. While working on Love at the Store, Carmichael argued about this bit with Spike Lee, who signed on to direct the special at his request. I just didnt think it was funny, Lee wrote in an email, and it was too soon to be making a joke about Martins coldblooded murder. Carmichael  insisting that his aim was not to mock a dead teenager but to explore what it means to truly care about his death  kept it in. I want to be a voice that challenges, Carmichael told me recently.









He takes this mandate to extremes that can verge on perverse. Consider the bit, soon after the Martin joke, about how Carmichael cant wait to grow rich enough to say Republican things out loud such as: I dont think people on welfare should be allowed to eat breakfast . . . which is kind of true when you think about it. Like, youre building up your strength for what? The satire and ironic distance here is sliced razor-thin; it gets thinner still when Carmichael, declaring that some people are more important than others, describes looking at my little cousin, and you can just tell hes gonna work at Wendys. Like, you could see it in his eyes: He has Wendy eyes. By the time Carmichael arrives at his own account of police brutality  he was once slammed to the ground by L.A.P.D. officers, their guns drawn, because I fit a description  he is on the way to a point about how Americas racist legacy is worth accepting because, were it not for slavery, I would be in Africa right now. Africa. Are you hearing what Im saying to you? Like, they have AIDS there. Jammed end to end with such jokes, Carmichaels special is unrelentingly bleak  even toxic in its nihilism. And yet Carmichael remains supremely affable, speaking in a slow, honeyed voice and smiling throughout. Your groans, he tells the crowd, will only make me go deeper.

At 28, Carmichael is one of Hollywoods fastest-rising young comics, and his preoccupation in Love at the Store is black-American success: systematically thwarted, highly politicized and something he enjoys all the same. In 2011, impressed by his stand-up, the makers of New Girl asked Carmichael to test for Winston, a main character, but he turned them down, uninterested in tying himself to someone elses sitcom. That self-assurance paid off. NBC eventually picked up his own sitcom, The Carmichael Show, and the same week that he shot Love at the Store, the hit feature comedy Neighbors  which starred Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne  arrived in multiplexes, with Carmichael in a scene-stealing role. (Initially envisioned as a white Jewish kid, the part was rewritten for him.) This month, The Carmichael Show returns for its second season; a Neighbors sequel, again featuring Carmichael, arrives in May.

The comedian Neal Brennan, a creator of Chappelles Show, was an early mentor. Praising the way that Carmichaels disarming, bright-eyed delivery belies the grimness of his message, he told me that at its best, Jerrods stand-up shows America/humanity at its worst  capitalist, cutthroat, cynical, narcissistic. Even so, the speed of Carmichaels ascent took him by surprise. In 2010 or so, we got something to eat, and I explained everything that was gonna happen in his career, Brennan said. And I was right, except I mapped out way more hardship than he encountered. A more recent admirer of Carmichaels is 93-year-old Norman Lear, the man behind classic sitcoms like All in the Family and The Jeffersons and, according to Carmichael, a major influence on The Carmichael Show. Lear told me that Carmichaels comedy helps America look at itself in the mirror, adding, He sees the foolishness of the human condition  he understands that there is humor to be found in the darkest of places.

In late January, Carmichael was at his sitcoms production offices, trying to find the humor in a particularly dark place. The week before, he taped Episode 202, in which the Carmichael family  a working-class North Carolina household modeled on his own  struggles with the tarnished legacy of Bill Cosby, the master comedian and suspect in multiple rapes. Standing in an editing room, Carmichael, who is 6-foot-1, wore a hoodie, fitted jeans and Timberland work boots. He faced a monitor as his editor, Kirk Benson, dialed up the Cosby episodes closing minute.

I did a line off the top of my head at the very end that might ruin the entire episode, Carmichael said as he watched David Alan Grier, who plays Carmichaels father, Joe, do a virtuoso, sweet-natured impression of Cosby holding court. This cracked up the other fictional Carmichaels and elicited big laughs from the studio audience. Amid this jubilation, Jerrod smilingly interjected, Damn shame what he did to those women, though. Although the line was unscripted, Grier gamely caught Carmichaels splash of cold water, dropping the smile from his face.

The Carmichael Show is, among other things, an attempt to prove that a multicamera sitcom, in the venerable but dusty tradition of All in the Family, can command a place in the pop-cultural vanguard while attracting broad audiences. The success of series like Empire and black-ish has hammered home the fact that black-led shows need not be considered niche entertainment. Carmichael theorizes that these shows helped strengthen NBCs resolve in supporting The Carmichael Show, which features an entirely black cast. The shows chief selling point  besides the prodigious talents of Grier and Loretta Devine, a veteran actor who plays Jerrods mother  is its social relevance. Carmichael and his staff build scripts around hot-button issues, producing episodes like Gender, which involves a transgender teenager and features a cold-open riff about the drawbacks of removing Confederate flags from government buildings. The only thing worse than racism is surprise racism, Jerrod says in the show, making the case for letting the flag fly.

Carmichael says that, whereas rebuttals to his stand-up jokes can only be implied, on the show he and his writers are able to stage counterarguments via the other characters. The premise of Episode 202, titled Fallen Heroes, is that Jerrod scores tickets to see Cosby perform; his girlfriend, Maxine, is appalled; debates ensue. (The shows creators solicited outside opinions on the episode, including from Judd Apatow  one of Cosbys most prominent Hollywood critics  and Darnell Hunt, a professor of sociology and director of African-American studies at U.C.L.A., whom Carmichael brought on last year as a series consultant to help him navigate controversial issues.) Carmichael offered few details about the Cosby story line, but if one of his old stand-up bits is any indication, the results will not be milquetoast: Arguing that talent is more important than morals, Carmichael cites the abhorred 2014 RoboCop remake, deeming it so atrocious that halfway through it, I forgave Woody Allen.

In the editing room, considering his damn shame line, Carmichael said, It might be more interesting to fade out on the warm feeling, because the line I say is, sadly, implied the whole episode, anyway. He pursed his lips and walked into the hall. I try to avoid having a message,  he went on. The risk here is that the whole episode is a gray area, and that lines black  I wanted to watch my delivery, to see if it allowed for gray.

In Carmichaels comedy, the line between unflinching provocation and outright trolling can grow fuzzy. He says hes fueled by a Socratic curiosity: What about this? What if what you think is right is wrong? This manifests most shockingly when, breaking the unwritten comedy rule against punching down, Carmichael makes some of societys most disempowered people the objects of seeming cruelty. In the joke about his Wendys-destined little cousin  delivered in the aftermath of Trayvon Martins death and mere months before the killings of Michael Brown and Tamir Rice  the target is a black boy. Elsewhere its black women, as when Carmichael mocks Beyonces single Run the World (Girls) as too ambitious for most of the bitches in her fan base, suggesting she sing instead about being a shift manager at Arbys, or a dental hygienist. You can watch this joke on YouTube courtesy of an anti-feminist account called F3MH8R, which underscores the queasy way that some of his lines could be transplanted into bigots mouths almost verbatim. Carmichael takes this, however, as a point of counterintuitive pride: Its become increasingly easy, in art, to only listen to people you already agree with, he told me. Thats boring.

If a black comics audience includes many white fans, as Carmichaels does, the dynamics surrounding such jokes can be particularly fraught. Some liberal-minded whites doubtless enjoy hearing black comics make jokes at white peoples expense because they like to imagine, in a self-congratulatory way, that their laughter constitutes an act of penance and expiation: by chuckling, they may feel they are insulating themselves against charges of racism and demonstrating their own enlightenment. But Carmichaels jokes, routinely directed not at the perpetrators and beneficiaries of racism but at its victims, dont permit any such easy feelings  if I, well-intentioned liberal, laugh at a joke about a black boys scarce self-worth, what does that say about the sway that negative black stereotypes have over me?

Then there is the white fan who laughs with no such unease. Dave Chappelle has invoked this figure in explaining why he stepped away from his hit sketch series: in part, he worried that some white viewers appreciated his anarchic treatment of black stereotypes for misguided reasons  that, in effect, his comedy risked compounding rather than dismantling those stereotypes. Neal Brennan touched on this issue while interviewing Carmichael during a 2015 podcast, identifying something almost anti-black in Love at the Store. Its not anti-black, Carmichael replied. Its anti-allowing-yourself-to-be-a-victim.

When I raised this topic with Carmichael, he reiterated that his jokes were intended as motivational tough love. He said he heartily rejects the pull up your pants mantras and bootstrap narratives of black respectability politics but aims nonetheless to encourage personal responsibility: Its not saying Im on the systems side; its me saying Im determined to beat it, and join me, why dont you? As for the reactions and possible misinterpretations of white fans, these were not foremost among Carmichaels concerns. Im not talking to you; its not about you, he told me. Im not talking about that cousin with Wendy eyes for anyone but that cousin with Wendy eyes.

Elaborating, Carmichael pointed to his joke about turning Republican and denying poor people breakfast. Id taken it as a layered critique of right-wing callousness. He acknowledged this but added that the joke also represented an extreme argument for freedom. Being black, you hear sentences like, Black people dont blank. How inhibiting is that? Like, how come I havent gone snowboarding? Because embedded in me is a belief that black people dont snowboard. So its a challenge of saying, Im not supposed to be a Republican, but I can do anything. Im breaking the ultimate rule, politically  Im so free in that joke its almost disgusting.

Growing up, the kids in Carmichaels neighborhood werent expected  or set up  to amount to much, he said. There was a path laid out for me by circumstance, decided at birth, that I sent back. He characterized the Morningside Manor section of Winston-Salem, where hes from, as all black, lot of very nice, hardworking, honest people, some people that werent, adding, It was the type of neighborhood where my mothers only goal was that I get a high-school diploma. Cynthia Carmichael worked as a secretary; Joe Carmichael is a truck driver. Joe told me that Jerrod displayed an early taste for show business: I built a clubhouse in the backyard, and when he was 8 or 9, he and his friends decorated it into a haunted house and charged admission. Jerrods older brother, Joe Jr., recalls Jerrods constantly toting around the video camera hed begged for one Christmas: If I was playing ball, hed be on the side, taping us, interviewing the players.

In adolescence, I was kinda awkward, kinda quiet, Carmichael said. My sneakers were wack. Id get picked on. Toward the end of middle school, however, I remember discovering humor and a boldness that came with it. Other parts of growing up in Morningside were far harder: A friend of mine, Marcus, was murdered. A friend of mine, Hasan, was murdered. These things would just happen. Very regular moments could hurt you a lot: I remember getting a ride home with a buddy of mine. Were talking about algebra II, and suddenly he says, I need to stop really fast, takes the air vent off the dashboard and pulls out some crack to sell. And that was not unique.

Carmichael had an autodidactic drive, spurred by his parents, who engaged their boys in debates replicated on his show  about entertainment, religion, politics. Being from the hood, I had no access to certain things  its a cliche, but I didnt know who Paul Thomas Anderson was, he said. I didnt know who the Coen Brothers were. He recalled staying up till 3 a.m. reading about the Defenestrations of Prague on Wikipedia, or spending eight hours at the Barnes & Noble, posted up in an aisle with a cup of coffee. This was also a reaction to institutional failure. I remember when I was in eighth grade, the assistant superintendent came to my school. Id visited a white middle school recently and noticed a difference. More computers. Nicer. I remember raising my hand and asking, Why dont we have those things? His response was: You see those new tables in the cafeteria? Were looking out for you. Right then, I said, Im not relying on this system to get where I need to be.

Carmichael sold sneakers at a Finish Line, nursing abstract dreams of a stand-up career that friends stoked. I didnt want to start in North Carolina, he said. I went to a club in Greensboro once, and knew I wasnt gonna start there. Im competitive; I wanna go up after Louis C.K. His thinking, he continued, was: Where are the best people doing this? Take me to them. One day at work, a guy came into the store, said he was an actor in L.A. I said, Man, L.A., I really wanna move there. And he said: Then just move. Go to Craigslist, Westside Rentals, find a place. I said, O.K. 

Carmichael headed west in 2008, crashing in shared studio apartments and hitting open-mike nights not just at proper clubs but also in living rooms and bars. I annoyed so many people who were trying to watch hockey games. The comedian Hannibal Buress, who befriended Carmichael, recalls being impressed by the tough angles he took into risque material, and his willingness to lose a crowd in the service of an idea  he doesnt care about bombing. Of the apparent audacity of his move to Los Angeles, Carmichael told me: I dont like safety nets. Like, a lot of comedians, they bring friends to their first show. And their second and third. You have a net there, crutches, guaranteed pity laughs. I dont want that.

On the day I first met him, in January, Carmichael was due to rehearse scenes from the next episode of his show, 203, on the soundstage near Beverly Hills where The Carmichael Show is made. Episode 203 takes place largely at a funeral parlor: Jerrods paternal grandfather, William, dies, sending Griers Joe into an ambivalent funk, because William was an abusive alcoholic; Joe wonders if he doesnt owe him a sanitized eulogy anyway. The episode would be taped twice the next day and assembled from both performances: if a joke didnt go over at 4 p.m., alternative lines, or alts, could be tried at 7. The production crew had constructed a spacious set for the funeral-service scene. Adjoining it was a cramped, impressively ugly antechamber  floral-print settee, chintzy sconces, sad carpet. An open brown coffin with a dummy corpse jutted toward the cameras. Most of this episode plays really claustrophobically, in this room, with the coffin, Carmichael said. There was originally supposed to be just one moment in here, but I expanded it to, like, 25 pages. Its not that long now, but I like pushing to see how far you can go within a limitation.

Carmichael aims to at once embrace and break the format of multicamera sitcoms, and visual monotony is just one of his strategies. In Episode 201, Jerrod makes a harsh joke about cancer, and in the cut I saw, the crowd responded with an audible disapproval that hadnt been scrubbed from the laugh track. Usually you dont keep that take, you use an alt, Carmichael said. But at the taping, I just kept saying that same line, so there is no alt. The crowd kind of winces. You hear them react to it unhappily. Im like, keep that reaction.

Thanks to Season 1s ratings, which were strong enough to bolster executives faith in him, Carmichael has some creative leeway. In Episode 203, Joe recalls Williams abuse in graphic detail, delivering tough lines about beatings and chokeholds. Carmichael said, The studio read this script and they were like  he inhaled sharply, miming pain  and I told them, Its gonna get sad for a bit. We can stay heavy. Its O.K.

Carmichaels willingness to stay heavy  to create prolonged moments of discomfort  may be the most formally radical thing about him. In his sitcom and his stand-up, he can seem as satisfied provoking groans, or awkward silence, as he is provoking laughter. At work here is a fundamental reconsideration of a joke tellers function: With Carmichael, the goal is not only to orchestrate a series of raucous eruptions  signaling, as they do, a simpatico mind meld with the audience  but to generate rifts of displeasure, confusion and anger too. Danielle Sanchez-Witzel, the showrunner on The Carmichael Show, said that such emotions can be productive: Jerrod likes to make people uncomfortable not for the sake of making them uncomfortable, but to shake them out of their regular way of seeing the world.

I saw this in action a couple of nights later, when Carmichael invited me along for an unannounced appearance at the Comedy Store in West Hollywood  the site not just of his HBO special but also of his first-ever L.A. open mike, in 2008. Carmichael had scribbled some notes earlier that night, but mostly he winged his set. I dont know what to talk about, he said onstage, but in a good way. Im open. Wearing a bomber over a gray hoodie, he paced, took long pauses and fussed with different things  his lip, a bottle cap, the mike stand. This was not a result of nerves, he told me later, but a deliberate technique to think through jokes and inculcate the crowd in his unhurried cadences. At one point he took off his jacket: I wasnt hot, he explained. Its to let you know: Relax. Listen. Lets explore. 

The Iowa caucuses loomed, and Carmichael had politics in mind. He got medium-size laughs with a medium-grade Bernie Sanders joke  Hell be the first president in history to broker a nuclear deal with a mustard stain on his shirt  then grew more familiarly challenging as he defended Donald Trumps proposed wall along the Mexican border: You dont just have an open wall at your apartment, like, I like my neighbors to be able to come in if they feel oppressed. 

Where this riff led, however, was wholly unexpected: Im thinking about not voting, Carmichael said. I dont trust America anyway. Can I say: I dont think we went to the moon? For the next few minutes, he contended that the manned Apollo missions had been faked. All of you are crazy for believing it, but we dont have time to get into the real facts because its not funny. People tittered, but with notes of hesitation and befuddlement, as they tried to suss out Carmichaels relationship to this bizarre tangent. I think its kinda cool we made it up, he went on. Thats so American. Lying about a moon landing? Thats so us.

Later that night, he told me that the moon-landing material reflected a deep-seated mistrust of authority that animates nearly every joke he tells and that has been with him since his youth in Morningside. You think we went to the moon? he said. Well, the same people said the drinking water is safe in Flint, Mich. His point was that conspiracy theories about nefarious government action  which circulate not only among crackpots but also among marginalized people with legitimate social grievances  were sometimes revealed to be the stuff of actual government behavior. I dont want people to be comfortable in the black-and-white that were handed, he continued. When you grow up and a lot of things people tell you arent true, you learn to challenge and question everything. If youre in Flint and the government said the water is safe to drink, and you find out it wasnt, and they knew. . . .

Carmichael trailed off for a moment, shaking his head, then declared, Its up to you to figure out the truth for yourself.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,New U.S. Rule Extends Stay for Some Foreign Graduates,['Liz Robbins'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Shruthi Aramandlas education and her job are geared to New York Citys skyline. She did not want to go back to her native India and start all over again.









Ms. Aramandla, 24, who has a masters degree from the Tandon School of Engineering at New York University, has been waiting anxiously for the federal government to publish its new rule on a foreign-worker training program so she would know whether she could stay longer  and perhaps one day permanently  in the United States.

The federal government will publish the rule on Friday, saying that international students earning degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields in the United States will now be eligible to stay for three years of on-the-job training. This is seven months longer than under the 2008 rule it replaces for the STEM Optional Practical Training program, known as OPT. The new rule will take effect on May 10.

Beyond offering graduates more experience in their fields, the extension serves another purpose. If my work visa gets denied this year, I still have two more opportunities to apply, and I can keep working within the country, said Ms. Aramandla, who wanted to be an engineer since she was 10, growing up in Chennai, India. She graduated from N.Y.U. in May; under the previous 29-month rule, she would have been able to stay only through October 2017.

Ms. Aramandla will apply in April for a visa, known as an H-1B, for so-called skilled foreign workers. But Congress caps those yearly at 65,000, with an additional 20,000 slots for graduates with advanced degrees like Ms. Aramandla. The government received nearly four times as many applications for those visas as were accepted in last years lottery.

This rule is yet another flash point in the controversy over immigration reform. Industry leaders who say they are desperate for skilled talent and those defending the rights of American workers see the training programs extension as an end-around to stalled reform. But that is all they agree upon.

Its an ongoing assault on American workers, said John Miano, a lawyer for a technology workers union in Washington State, whose lawsuit last summer was what forced the government to vacate the previous rule and create a new one, this time for public comment.

They are just trying to double down on what theyre doing before, he said of the government. O.K., you didnt like 29 months? Well make it 36 months.

Mr. Miano says his group, the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers, is still arguing the legality of the program in an appeal. The next hearing will be in May at the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

The government posted a similar version of the rule in the federal register in October, drawing more than 50,500 comments. (Death threats to President Obama were removed, officials said.) A large number of commenters who said they were foreign students supported the rule. But there were also comments from people who identified themselves as unemployed technology workers or concerned citizens who believed the government was destroying this country, and thought that it showed the government was standing with illegals.

I hope you rip it up, one commenter said.

The new rule states directly that a STEM OPT student would not replace a full- or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. worker, and that the salary offered would be commensurate to American workers.

Officials with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said they tried to tighten training programs, mandate oversight of employers and make sure that the students come from accredited universities in an effort to prevent fraud.

In our mind, it enhances training and puts safeguards in to make sure that if you are an employer that you are not unfairly disadvantaging U.S. workers, Rachel Canty, deputy director for the agencys Student and Exchange Visitor Program.

The agency said it would provide help sessions for eligible students, employers and academic institution on its website on Friday.

Ms. Aramandla, who works for Loring Consulting Engineers and designs heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems for schools in New York, said her training would not be applicable in India, nor would she find the same work environment there; as a woman in India, she feels she would not be as respected as she is in the United States.

Michael DesRochers, the president of Loring, said Ms. Aramandla was an integral employee in his technical work force, which is 7 percent foreign.

The labor market is tight, Mr. DesRochers said. We dont look at it as the international students are taking away American opportunities. We feel were offering to all.

His companys work may intersect again with the new rule: Recently, his engineers replaced the ventilation and mechanical systems for the United States Supreme Court.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-02-25 00:00:00,Free Coffee? Starbucks Saves Its Loyalty for Big Spenders,['Josh Barro'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Wheres the loyalty?









Starbucks is changing its My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program so that rewards are tied to dollars spent instead of number of visits. To no ones surprise, some customers feel that the coffee house chain is less than loyal.

This is a huge slap in the face for people who enjoy regular coffee, said Matt Baumann, an editor in Philadelphia who has been a Gold Level My Starbucks Rewards member since 2007. He probably would not have made that proclamation if Starbucks directly raised the price of his cup of coffee by 31 cents  even if such a price increase would have caused him to buy his coffee elsewhere.

Mr. Baumanns hurt feelings are easier to understand when you realize the company is not just raising the effective price he will pay for coffee. It did so by changing the rules of a program that was supposed to be about how they like seeing customers like him.

Currently, Starbucks rewards customers based on how often they visit. Every transaction gets you a star, and 12 stars get you a free drink. On Monday, Starbucks announced that will change in April to reflect the #1 request we heard from members: more Stars awarded based on what you buy, no matter how often you visit.

Indeed, Starbucks customers will soon get a lot more stars: two for every dollar they spend. But instead of 12 stars for a free drink, they will need 125. This is probably not what customers meant when they asked for more stars.

The change mirrors recent revisions to airline reward programs. In 2015, both United Airlines and Delta Air Lines started giving out reward points based on how much customers spend on airfare. This change means that the frequent flier mile is no longer directly related to distance traveled, and that high-spending corporate travelers get a lot more rewards than bargain hunters. American Airlines will make a similar change in July.

There is a logic to these shifts: Companies want to reward their most profitable customers, not necessarily their most frequent ones. At Starbucks, small spenders will lose out. A customer who likes drip coffee at $1.95 per cup will have to buy 32 of them to qualify for a free drink. But the change is good news for those who spend at least $5.21 per Starbucks visit, the minimum amount at which customers will earn rewards faster under the new program than the old one. And its especially good news for people whose job requires them to make Starbucks runs for the office.

Some Starbucks customers on the losing end of the shift, despite disappointment about the deterioration of their rewards, acknowledged the companys rationale in emails to me.

It feels like Starbucks values my business less because Im spending less per visit, regardless of the fact that Im in the drive-thru four to five days a week, said Megan Johnson, a television news producer in Portland, Ore. And on the surface, thats fair, because obviously running a company is about profit, and Im providing less of that.

In the past, Starbucks said its rewards program was about bonding with all its customers, not about rewarding those who generate the most profit.

At Starbucks, our rewards program comes from a different philosophy, the marketing manager Justin Tidmarsh wrote in 2012 on the My Starbucks Idea blog, explaining why the company does not give more stars for buying more items per transaction. At its simplest, we like seeing you, regardless of whether your purchase is a short-brewed coffee or four Venti White Chocolate Mochas. My Starbucks Rewards is designed to show our appreciation simply for stopping by.

If you step back, the we like seeing you, regardless is a nonsensical statement from a company. Starbucks as an entity has no feelings, and its shareholders want profits, which come in greater quantity from customers who buy more. And sure enough, in just a few years, the company realized it actually does like seeing customers more when they spend a lot.

With the we like seeing you framing, Starbucks fell into a trap that is common with loyalty programs: establishing not just an exchange relationship with its customers based on mutual benefit, but a communal relationship based on mutual caring and support. The norms surrounding communal relationships  the fiction that a company is your friend  can strengthen customers bonds with a company. But they also set up customers for disappointment.

That said, Starbucks has not been the only violator of communal norms in the Starbucks customer relationship. I have it on good authority that many Starbucks customers  including at least one Upshot editor  have been gaming the existing system by splitting their transactions: for example, being rung up once for a coffee and again for a muffin, in order to receive two stars when they might otherwise get just one.

You might say, hey, Starbucks is a big company, and theres nothing in the My Starbucks Rewards terms and conditions that would seem to prohibit transaction-splitting. And thats fair enough in an exchange relationship, but taking advantage of a technicality is probably not how you would treat a friend.

If customers are going to take a hey, its just business approach to their relationship with Starbucks, they should expect the company to do the same  and it has.",[]

Personal Health Jane Brody on health and aging.

I had no idea the world of food was so big. There are so many simple, tasty foods from all these cultures that are so easy to make. You dont have to eat them in a restaurant or be a trained chef to prepare them.

This is what Lynn Fredericks, the creator of FamilyCook Productions, discovered when, divorced with two young sons, she sought to reduce tension in her household by enlisting the boys help in the kitchen and introducing them  and herself  to cooking healthful, easy-to-prepare and delicious foods, and eating them together in a civilized fashion.

You might call it gracious dining: cloth napkins in rings, tea lights, flowers occasionally and, most important of all, no TV, mail or toys at the table.

The food industry keeps telling parents to go out to eat and order from the childrens menu for the kids, Ms. Fredericks said. As an alternative to the ubiquitous burgers and fries, mac n cheese and sodas, she said, I began offering cooking workshops for young mothers, encouraging them to use some time each day to connect in a happy way with their children.

What began as a personal mission grew into a nonprofit organization, now 20 years old, that teaches schoolchildren and their families the delights that can ensue from preparing affordable, fresh and tasty foods that benefit their health and well-being.

Though lacking credentials in dietetics, Ms. Fredericks was aided by two experts, Mercedes Sanchez, a food-loving dietitian who grew up in Spain and who specializes in one-pot cooking, and Antonia Demas, founder of the Food Studies Institute and creator of the Food Is Elementary curriculum that teaches children about organic gardening, environmental issues, plant-based nutrition and healthy cooking.

With support from foundations and government agencies, Ms. Fredericks and a number of professional collaborators created curriculums that teach nutrition through cooking for preschoolers through high schoolers.

No elaborate equipment is needed. Classrooms can perform culinary miracles with just a sink, a portable induction stove and a good knife or two, Ms. Fredericks said.

Parents initially looked at me as if I had six heads, and wondered why I was having the kids make Thai-inspired fish chowder and not mac n cheese with broccoli, she said. Despite parental protests that my kids would never eat that, the children really enjoyed the more exotic dishes they prepared, she added.

The programs, which have been field-tested with great success, provide nutrition education through hands-on cooking in schools and community organizations, on farms and in other settings around the country. The organization estimates it has reached more than 200,000 families, some members of which have gone on to become health educators themselves.

Fatima Basir of Brooklyn started in the program at 16 and lost so much weight  some 50 pounds  that her first summer out of college, she got a job at a weight-loss camp for children. Now 22, Ms. Basir works for theHarlem Childrens Zones healthy eating initiative.

Joel Allette, 21, who lost about 20 pounds as a teenage participant, is jointly talented in cooking and music. He now teaches Teen Battle Chef, a FamilyCook program, at Urban Assembly School of Music and Art in Brooklyn and has composed three songs for Ms. Frederickss endeavor to promote healthy eating and exercise.

You wouldnt believe how many kids lose weight in our program, Ms. Fredericks said. No crash diets allowed. The kids know its a lifestyle change.

But good health is hardly the only goal of her programs. Cooking by the children in schools is coordinated with lessons in mathematics, science and culture. For example, young children learn both math and portion control when divvying up a recipe for six among themselves. They learn where food comes from and the importance of sustainability, as well as food science and safety.

In preparing meals together, the children learn teamwork. And teens who participate in groups of six in the semester-long Teen Battle Chef program (fashioned like a TV show competition) hone their public speaking skills when describing the cultural background and nutritional value of the dishes they prepare.

Teens do presentations for their parents, who are then more inclined to let the kids prepare foods at home, said Ms. Fredericks, who is also the author of Cooking Time Is Family Time and Get Your Family Eating Right!

The program inspires insight into other cultures and tolerance. While learning about Japan, for example, elementary school students might prepare a Japanese tea ceremony. The world of food is a much bigger place, and it can be fun to explore the cuisines of other cultures, Ms. Fredericks said.

The emphasis, too, is on simple ingredients that can produce tasty and colorful dishes. Theres no need for special ingredients, she said. In making a stir-fry dish, the children learn to use whatever is in the fridge.

The program for preschoolers focuses on introducing children to a wide range of colorful fruits, vegetables and healthy snacks. An evaluation in Women, Infants and Children centers showed it increased the amount and variety of fruits and vegetables purchased at farmers markets by participating families.

The 15 weeks of the elementary school curriculum are seasonally linked, and emphasize these nutritional priorities: breakfast, portion control, juices, avoiding fast food, understanding food marketing, restaurants and snacking. At family night sessions, parents help their young chefs prepare a meal at school.

FamilyCook Productions uses a business model to train facilitators around the country. Some come from departments of public health, others from nonprofit organizations, as well as schools and community groups. Parents, too, can become facilitators. In addition to food preparation and teaching techniques, trainees learn how to store food and equipment, and must pass an assessment in food safety.

We now have the capacity to train anyone anywhere because everything is online, Ms. Fredericks said.

She added that FamilyCook Productions is constantly retooling our programs. For example, with a research grant from the National Institutes of Health, trained Teen Battle Chef students are working to improve high school wellness by sharing easy ways to make healthier foods and drinks with their peers.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE  I found this one very difficult for the day of the week, possibly because I approached it nonchalantly and filled in several words incorrectly, including a theme answer, then had to right my wrongs to finish.

When I solve I almost always scan once for gimmes before settling in. Im not sure if this is the most efficient approach but its reflexive, and Im always pleased when I find some substantial words that seem to fit the bill. For this puzzle, three of these were BURNOUT for 20 across, fatigue; ABOUTFACE for 29 down, complete reversal; and JELLYFISH for 25 across, translucent sea creature that drifts with the current, which was a mighty specific clue  one that I would have looked sideways at on Friday or Saturday, but blithely took at face value here.

I then went up to the northeast corner (Im a lefty  maybe thats why  habit again) and got far enough to replace BURNOUT with TIRE OUT, and figured out BOISE, where you need an ID (for Idaho) to get your mail, one of a few clever wordplays in this puzzle. I even worked west and figured out NATURE PRESERVES, which was enough to give me the cute theme. But then I got stuck on that JELLYFISH for a long time. Maybe Im stubborn, maybe Ive never in my life heard of MOON JELLY; but I confess that I sent a few brain cells back to my long-term memory to see if there could possibly be any other chipmunks than Theodore, Simon and ALVIN, because I was trying to smush JUKE in for a Karaoke need and keep ABOUT FACE.

Soon enough, though, that straightened itself out. I thought that a lot of the clues and answers in this puzzle were solidly beyond beginner-level. VOLTEFACE obviously stopped me for a bit; UPBRAIDED, PILASTERS, IRATER and ABBESS are all classic, more challenging fill.

It was easy to find chipmunks singing slow jams but that just didnt seem fair.

Being out of shape at age 18 may increase your risk for eventually developing Type 2 diabetes, regardless of your weight and family history, a new study says.

The study looked at data from more than 1.5 million Swedish men, using tests of muscle strength and aerobic capacity when they were conscripted for military service at age 18, between 1969 and 1997. Their muscle strength had been measured with hand grip and other tests, and their aerobic capacity calculated as they exercised on a stationary bicycle.

With this data in hand, researchers checked the mens medical records from 1987 to 2012. They found 34,008 cases of Type 2 diabetes over an average 26 years of follow-up. The study is in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

Both low aerobic capacity and low muscle strength at 18 were associated with a higher risk for Type 2 diabetes; poor aerobic capacity was a slightly stronger risk factor. Having both weak muscles and low aerobic capacity more than tripled the risk for future diabetes. The effect was independent of other risk factors  body mass index, family history of diabetes, education and socioeconomic status.

Early life interventions are really important, said the lead author, Dr. Casey Crump, a professor of family medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. Prevention of Type 2 diabetes should begin early in life, and should include both aerobic fitness and muscular strength. This is important regardless of peoples weight.",[]

His project An Iranian Journey, which was published on Lens in 2013, earned Mr. Fatemi the World Understanding award in the Pictures of the Year International contest last month.

Im trying to get away from the stereotypes and cliches that Western cultures have about the Iranian people, said Mr. Fatemi, 35. Most Americans have a third world perception and cant even separate Arab culture from Persian culture.

Mr. Fatemi says there is a lifetimes worth of photographs for him to make in his country.

But he cannot.

Photo

The day after Mr. Fatemis story was featured on the website of his photo agency, Panos Pictures, he received the first of many emails from conservative hard-liners who wield power in political parties, official news media and the government. They accused him of undermining Islam and of having a Western ideology and perspective, Mr. Fatemi said. Similar emails were sent to his photo agency, and its website was blocked in Iran.

At the time, Mr. Fatemi was visiting a photo festival in San Diego, and it quickly became clear to him that it would be too dangerous to return to Iran.

Although he settled in Chicago, he did not give up on documentary photography in Iran. He enlisted eight of his former students and started A Journey Inside, a documentary project on social issues in Iran. Although he could not be there physically, Mr. Fatemi stayed in contact through Skype, social media, email and phone.

The stories the participants  four men and four women from different parts of the country  chose focused on the place of women in Iranian society, university students, drought and a disabled war veteran. Mr. Fatemi did not tell them to take any particular point of view or political position.

I just want them to be free and take the pictures they need to, he said. I chose a subject that would not cause them to be arrested or get into any trouble if they were published. There are many subjects that could force photographers to leave the country as I did.

Photo

Indeed, scores of photographers have fled Iran since the post-election protests and 2009 crackdown, he added.

Mr. Fatemi arranged and led virtual workshops throughout Iran to teach his students how to be better visual storytellers and to have an open-minded viewpoint. At times, local government officials banned his workshops because they included men and women together and because a critical documentary viewpoint was politically unacceptable.

The project lasted 14 months, including training and photographing under the supervision of Mr. Fatemi and Panos Pictures, with the assistance of Maryam Athari. The photographers included Zahra Ostadzadeh, Bahar Aslani, Hossein Heidarpour, Hamid Akhlaghi, Negin Kiani, Saeed Zeidi, Mahya Rastegar and Ali Tajik.

Ms. Ostadzadeh, who has a masters degree in sociology, concentrates on womens issues in her photography and video work. For the project, she documented an all-girls boarding school in Kerman Province where, she said, the girls were satisfied by what they have, even though in the larger society women are sometimes seen as inferior.

I wanted my photos to improve their life, she said. My approach wasnt looking down at them. I dont want my photos to only show poverty. Instead I want to show lifes happiness and the great goals they envision. I want to show that despite all the poor conditions and poverty that should be changed they are still content.

Photo

For Mr. Fatemi, receiving the award from POYi was a little bittersweet. Although he cannot return to Iran for now, he has forged a new way forward  with his students. The Journey Inside project was, he said, another way to get at the truth.

Iran is a very complex and complicated country, he said. We photographers think that through this kind of photography we can understand ourselves, our beliefs and our viewpoints.

nytimes.com,2016-03-03 00:00:00,The Puerto Rican Lower East Side,"['David Gonzalez', 'Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Reference Timestopics People G David_gonzalez Index Html']","When I first came across Arlene Gottfrieds vintage pictures of Puerto Rican New York, Bacalaitos & Fireworks, I chuckled. Her reference to the siren call of a Lower East Side street vendor hawking codfish fritters and firecrackers struck me as having all the ingredients for a Fourth of July party (just add Bacardi). My second reaction was nervousness  given the areas devastation from poverty and drugs during the 1970s and 1980s, how would the photographer portray this world?

With love and humor, it turns out.

This is not to say that Ms. Gottfried glossed over the untidy parts of the local narrative. It was impossible not to notice the empty lots, the dazed junkies, the weary-faced couples. But she did not let herself be mesmerized by that. She delved into the community, where her mother had moved after decades in Crown Heights, and connected with its residents who, in turn, embraced her and her camera.

She documented birthday parties in spotless living rooms (with chairs sheathed in plastic slipcovers); whole pigs roasting on a spit in an empty lot; religious services and funerals, first communions and parades. Her camera also singled out critical, if sometimes overlooked, cultural figures like Jorge Brandon, considered to be the father of Nuyorican poetry. In more than a few images, she has Miguel Pinero, the poet, playwright, addict and criminal whose life was as complicated as it was short.

Most of the images were from the Lower East Side  Loisaida  although she also took some in Brooklyn and the Bronx, as well as along the Fifth Avenue route of the Puerto Rican Day Parade.

It was a mixture of excitement, devastation and drug use, said Ms. Gottfried, who will be exhibiting a selection of these images at Daniel Cooney Fine Art in Chelsea from March 3 through April 16. But there was more than just that. It was the people, the humanity of the situation. You had very good people there trying to make it.

Photo

Ms. Gottfrieds ability to connect to communities of color is something she credits to her family having stayed in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, even after many of her white neighbors fled during the 1960s. She became friends with the newcomers.

By the 1970s, her mother had moved to the Lower East Side  where she herself would live in the 1990s  and she visited often. Looking beyond the jarring landscape, she found the people to be welcoming. She ended up taking pictures for years, not with any specific project in mind.

In some cases, she would be struck by what she encountered, like the procession of girls about to make their first communion, walking down the street past televisions perched on cars and connected by extension cords to lampposts. Or the time someone told her to keep walking down the street.

Wait until you see what you find down the block, she recalled being told. And there was this pig roast. You get exposed to all that being outside. It was a lot of fun.

Her pictures reflect that, including touches of humor and warmth familiar to anyone who grew up during that time, when residents often had only each other for support.

The humor comes from being with the people, Ms. Gottfried said. Part of it is how I see life. You know, the humanity. There was openness, and I felt really comfortable. It was a mixture of excitement, joy and warmth. There was this striking beauty the people had.

Photo

Her pictures of some of the areas cultural figures  whom she often encountered at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe  also show the areas rich creativity.

It was a big mixture of people involved in all kinds of things, she said. I used to enjoy having conversations with people and bumping into people you knew. The musicians and the actors, there was a lot of theater going on at the cafe and other places. We could go to Henry Street Settlement and there would be a free Tito Puente concert.

Ms. Gottfried would go on to other projects, other assignments. The area would undergo a major transformation, attracting newcomers to renovated tenements and luxury buildings. Some pockets of the old world remain, which makes her feel sentimental.

Money came in and changed everything, she said. But it was an experience I had and others didnt. I was able to go to places other people would only see in pictures.

And not all change was unwelcome. Over the years, she had photographed Johnny Cintron, looking rough and covered with tattoos. She even visited him in jail and took a picture of him there. She always remembered him as a smart guy who went astray.

Two years ago, Mr. Cintron tracked her down on Facebook. The two decided to meet at Tompkins Square Park.

Walking through there, I was bumping into people I knew, Ms. Gottfried recalled. I was sitting there thinking, how will I recognize Johnny? Then, I saw a man standing with his back to me. I recognized him from behind, how he stood. There he was. Hes all cleaned up, married, looking good and doing well. Thank God for that.

My sister is the greatest blessing in my life. My parents and I were at the hospital when her birth mother went into labor, so she has been with us for her entire life. My parents never told her that she was adopted, and they asked me not to say anything. They planned on telling her when she was old enough to understand, but they kept putting it off. They know that I believe they have done her a serious disservice.









I think she suspects shes different. She asks me sometimes why shes so much shorter than the rest of us, for example. I do my best to deflect her questions, but it hurts every time. My sister and I are very close, and we see each other often. Keeping this lie feels like a giant burden, but, at this point, I dont know that it would do her any good to know the truth. She was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder and has been working hard to keep her life balanced. Finding out now that shes adopted could throw her into a depression. I fear, however, that with the mail-in DNA tests available these days, or should a medical emergency arise, shell find out the truth and she wont forgive me.

I want my sister to feel as deeply loved as she is, and I am at a loss for what to do. Name Withheld

How do we end up in these binds? Easily. And, in a way, rationally. Sorites  from the Greek for heap  is the name of a philosophical paradox. A grain of sand isnt a heap, and adding one more grain cant make it a heap, and as you add grains of sand, you reason that another grain cant turn your pile into a heap. Yet at some point, a heap is what you have. In the temporal realm, theres an analogous problem. Very often, it wont do any harm to wait one more day to do something. So you put the deed off until, at some point, youve waited too long.

Sorites sins can creep up on well-intentioned people. Maybe your wife meant to tell you, when you first started dating, that she once had a fling with your brother, but the time never seemed right. There was no particular moment when she crossed the line from permissible deferral to culpable silence. A decade later, though, a spiny eel wriggles in her stomach whenever she thinks about it. She prays you never find out. Sorites sins can rock relationships.

They can sometimes rock nations. When the German novelist Gunther Grass, often called the conscience of his country, was in his 70s, he revealed that he had served in the Waffen-SS as a teenager. The public was dismayed. Not because of the consequences of a youthful decision, but because he kept quiet about it for so long. If you rewind to the start of his career, there was never a specific day when it was incumbent on him to discuss this painful happenstance. Then decades passed, and it became a shame-heaped secret.

Now, to your predicament. Your parents had a responsibility to tell your sister the truth, and no doubt they meant to  just not at any specific time. (On what day of the calendar does old enough to understand fall?) Then so much time elapsed that they couldnt justify not having told her.

The sorites model helps explain how we can gradually end up in a dire state through inaction. It doesnt, alas, offer solutions. But I can make one general suggestion about the form of procrastination your parents evidently succumbed to. If its unclear when someone is ready to be told something, then the question May I tell her today? will get you there quicker than Must I tell her today?

So now what? Your folks asked you not to tell; the promise you presumably made should be taken seriously. But it matters that your parents extracted the promise from you when you were a child; it also matters that they didnt live up to their side of it. Your sister really is entitled to know this basic fact about her life and they arent entitled to command your silence indefinitely (though you should tell them if youre breaking it).

The main argument against informing your sister is that shes currently in a precarious condition. Because you know her well, youll have to gauge how the revelation will affect her. You might seek guidance from her doctor as to when and how its safe to tell her. To do so, it would probably make sense to ask your sister, first, if she would let you talk to her doctor about ways in which you can help her.

Maybe today isnt the best time to break the news. Maybe tomorrow isnt, either. But dont let too many more days go by.

My 66-year-old sister was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005. Within two years, she died. During her illness, she would not tell our 88-year-old mother of the severity of her condition. She lived 100 miles away, so Mom couldnt see her easily. She called when she had the strength. Mom would say to me: What is wrong with your sister? She doesnt sound right, and she never invites me to come for a visit anymore. I would answer: I dont know, Mom. Did you ask her? All the while, my sisters time was running out.

I begged my sister to tell her the truth. (My sister had extracted a promise from me that I would not tell Mom; she said she would get better and then tell our mother why she hadnt invited her.) I spoke with friends in the counseling profession. Most agreed that I should honor the sick persons wishes. And I did so until two weeks before the end.

I took my mother to see my sister, who was so weak she couldnt sit up. To this day, I feel that I made the wrong decision in hiding the truth. I could see the hurt in my mothers eyes that she was not allowed to spend more time with her dying child. Five years later I lost my own beloved daughter to the same ravaging disease. I was able to tend to her in her last year. Should I have given my mom that privilege? Name Withheld

It was your sister who made the wrong decision. No doubt, she wanted to spare your mother, but it also seems that she wasnt willing to face the reality of her situation. By the time the truth was clear, she may have felt it was too late to come clean. Another sorites situation.

Though your sister was wrong, its hard to hold it against her. Its tough to make the right choices when you are terrified by the prospect of a painful death. She might have been comforted by asking her family to gather around. But it was her choice to make, and you cant blame yourself for doing what she asked, especially once you promised to do so.

What about your decision to tell your mother when it was clear your sister was dying? You dont say how your sister felt about it. Even if she didnt agree, the moral gravity of the promise may have been outweighed by the consideration that guided you: allowing your mother and sister to be together one last time.",[]

LONDON  Less than a year after his unexpected general election victory, Prime Minister David Cameron has undertaken an even greater challenge. Staking his future on the outcome, he is holding a referendum on June 23 to decide whether Britain should stay in the European Union, or leave.









Mr. Cameron is said to be a lucky politician, good in a crisis. But is this a gamble too far?

Not since 1975 have Britains voters been given a specific say on their countrys participation in the union, which has undergone a transformation in the intervening years, evolving from a free-trade pact into an integrated political and economic alliance with many of the features of a superstate. Those who favor Britains departure, or Brexit, claim that too much control has been lost to the European Commission in Brussels and the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

Like a majority of Conservatives of his generation, Mr. Cameron himself is a euroskeptic, firmly opposed to European federalism. Yet he believes with no less vigor that Britain can have the best of both worlds, and would suffer economically, diplomatically and strategically outside the union.

Photo

As evidence of his determination to strike a sensible balance, the prime minister promised to renegotiate Britains terms of membership before putting the matter before the electorate. This deal, struck in Brussels on Feb. 19 after more than 30 hours of talks, is considerably better than most of the critics will admit. On a range of issues  Britains exemption from the goal of ever closer union, the benefits it must pay to European Union migrants, the position of the City of London, the ability of national parliaments to resist European law  Mr. Cameron won significant concessions.

The Leave camp claims that this so-called special status is flimsy and will lack the status of law until enshrined in a European Union treaty. But as those around Mr. Cameron admit, the fine print of the agreement was never going to be the deciding factor in the referendum.

Inasmuch as such surveys can be relied on after failing to predict the wide margin of Mr. Camerons victory in last years general election, opinion polls suggest that 15 to 20 percent of voters are undecided. It is their support that both campaigns must now chase. And that battle became all the more dramatic when Boris Johnson, the charismatic Conservative mayor of London, declared himself a supporter of a Brexit.

Like Mr. Cameron, Mr. Johnson is an upper-middle-class product of Englands most famous private school, Eton. But their styles could scarcely be more different.

In his statement to members of Parliament about the deal and referendum, Mr. Cameron made scathing references to Mr. Johnsons position and ambitions. These were ill received by the mayor. Neither man looks in any mood to back down. Whichever side prevails at the ballot box, this particular breach may be irreparable.

Mr. Johnson was only a political friend. But Michael Gove, the highly regarded justice secretary, has been close to Mr. Cameron for years. On the night of the 2010 election, Mr. Goves wife looked after the Cameron children. Mr. Gove also helped to write most of Mr. Camerons key speeches. So his decision to champion Britains exit from the union is a blow to Mr. Cameron personally as well as politically.

Another longtime ally, Michael Howard, a former party leader and now a Conservative peer, has also abandoned the prime ministers camp. On Feb. 25, he wrote in The Daily Telegraph that Mr. Camerons quest for a better deal for Britain had met with failure. The only step that might shake Europes leaders out of their complacency, he went on, was the shock of a vote by the British people to leave.

So much has been imperiled by this referendum. Membership in the European Union is not the essence of the countrys nationhood, but it gives Britain global punch and secures its economic prosperity. If Britons vote to leave, they will also be voting, in effect, for Mr. Cameron to quit Downing Street, his home of six years. After the distraction of the long referendum campaign, the Conservative Party would then be embroiled in a monthslong leadership contest. This would probably involve a runoff between George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. Johnson, his prospects enhanced by backing the winning side in the referendum.

This would be merely the local consequence. As Britain formalized its withdrawal, it would find its status in the world dropping like a bad stock. Britains special relationship with the United States would doubtless endure in rhetoric and sentiment. But America would need a new best friend for its negotiations with the European bloc.

Within Britains borders, most Scottish voters would be deeply aggrieved at exiting the European Union. One of the first tasks confronting the new prime minister could well be to grant a further referendum on the union of England and Scotland. The last such vote, in September 2014, resulted in a defeat for Scottish independence (by 55 percent to 45 percent), but the Scottish National Party has tightened its political grip since then. A Brexit could then be enough to drive Scotland and England apart  if only to allow the Scots to negotiate continued membership as a distinct nation.

A leadership crisis, the breakup of Britain and a shrinking role on the global stage as a commercial, diplomatic and strategic force: The stakes could hardly be higher. When Mr. Cameron won last years general election, he called it the sweetest victory. Doubtless it was. But losing the referendum would be the most bitter defeat imaginable.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Limit the Next Presidents Power to Wage Drone Warfare,"['Jameel Jaffer', 'Brett Max Kaufman']","Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

WHEN Barack Obama took office as the reluctant heir to George W. Bushs war on terror, he renounced some of his predecessors most extreme policies. There is one Bush-era policy, though, that President Obama made emphatically his own: the summary killing of suspected militants and terrorists, usually by drone.









In less than a year, the president will bequeath this policy, and the sweeping legal claims that underlie it, to someone who may see the world very differently from him. Before that happens, he should bring the drone campaign out of the shadows and do what he can to constrain the power he unleashed.

President Bush started the drone wars, but Mr. Obama vastly expanded them. Almost entirely on his watch, United States strikes have killed as many as 5,000 people, possibly 1,000 of them civilians. The president approved strikes in places far from combat zones. He authorized the C.I.A. to carry out signature strikes aimed at people whose identities the agency did not know but whose activities supposedly suggested militancy. He approved the deliberate killing of an American, Anwar al-Awlaki.

The president also oversaw an aggressive effort to control the public narrative about drone strikes. Even as senior officials selectively disclosed information to the news media, his administration resisted Freedom of Information Act lawsuits, arguing that national security would be harmed if the government confirmed drone strikes were taking place.

The administration also argued in court that federal judges lacked the authority to say whether drone strikes were lawful. It refused to release the evidence that it claimed made Mr. Awlaki a lawful target. In lieu of information, the administration offered assurances that the president and his aides were deeply moral people who agonized over authorizing lethal force.

But as this election season has underscored, powers this far-reaching should not rest solely on the character of the president and his advisers. In a democracy, the ability to use lethal force must be subject to clear and narrow limits, and the public must be able to evaluate whether those limits are being respected. Mr. Obama observed almost three years ago that the same human progress that gives us the technology to strike half a world away also demands the discipline to constrain that power. At the very least, the president has the responsibility to ensure that drone strikes are subject to meaningful oversight.

The president should begin by publishing the Presidential Policy Guidance, a document that has provided the legal and administrative framework for the drone campaign since 2013. In response to litigation, the administration informed a federal judge last week that it would release parts of the document, but it remains to be seen how extensive the disclosure will be and whether it will be accompanied by a broader reconsideration of the secrecy surrounding the program.

The president should also release the legal memos that purport to justify drone strikes away from battlefields. Courts have compelled the administration to release portions of two of these memos, but the public should have access to all of the governments legal reasoning about who may be targeted, where and for what reasons. The government has a legitimate interest in protecting properly classified information, but the law behind the drone program should not be a secret.

The president should also make it the countrys default practice to acknowledge all drone strikes  not just those carried out on conventional battlefields, as in Iraq and Syria. To facilitate this shift toward greater transparency and to strengthen congressional oversight, he should withdraw the C.I.A.s authority to carry out drone strikes and provide that any future strikes will be authorized and carried out by the Department of Defense.

On Monday, the presidents chief counterterrorism adviser said that the government intended to disclose annual assessments of casualties from lethal strikes outside areas of active hostilities. This information will be of limited use to the public, however, unless the government also discloses information about individual strikes  when and where they took place, and numbers of casualties.

Finally, the president should establish a policy of investigating and publicly explaining strikes that kill innocent civilians, and of compensating those victims families. After an American drone strike last year killed two Western hostages, Warren Weinstein and Giovanni Lo Porto, the government apologized, opened an investigation and said it would offer compensation. It should do the same when drone strikes kill or maim innocent Pakistanis, Yemenis and Somalis.

These kinds of changes, of course, will not quiet the drone campaigns critics. Many of those critics believe, as we do, that the campaign is broader than international law permits, that congressional oversight should be far more stringent and that, at least in some circumstances, the lawfulness of strikes should be subject to after-the-fact review by the courts.

But at a minimum, the changes we propose would allow for a more informed debate about a subject that urgently needs one, and they would create new, if modest, checks against overreach and abuse. Equally important, the president could make the changes we propose on his own in the limited time he has left in office.

A second sibling from the film-directing duo that created The Matrix series came out as a transgender woman on Tuesday after a reporter from The Daily Mail appeared on her front porch to ask questions about her gender identity.









The director, Lilly Wachowski  who with her sister, Lana, are the first major Hollywood directors to come out as transgender  condemned the British publication for sending the reporter to her home on Monday night and released her own statement to The Windy City Times in Chicago.

I knew at some point I would have to come out publicly, she wrote. You know, when youre living as an out transgender person its ... kind of difficult to hide. I just wanted  needed some time to get my head right, to feel comfortable. But apparently I dont get to decide this.

Ms. Wachowski thanked friends and family for their support, saying it had given her the chance to actually survive this process.

With her announcement, Ms. Wachowski, previously known as Andy, joined a growing list of openly transgender people in Hollywood, including her sister and filmmaking partner, who was known as Larry before coming out in 2012; the reality stars Caitlyn Jenner and Chaz Bono; the writer and musician Our Lady J; and the actresses Laverne Cox, Alexandra Billings, Trace Lysette and Hari Nef.

The Wachowskis created The Matrix films before transitioning, and have collaborated on a number of other high-profile projects over the past two decades, usually works of science fiction that include a lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender element, including Bound, V for Vendetta, Jupiter Ascending and the Netflix series Sense8.

Lilly Wachowski recounted the exchange with The Daily Mail reporter in her statement to The Windy City Times, saying that he told her she had to sit down with him to tell her inspirational story and to have her picture taken  adding that she didnt want to have someone from The National Enquirer following me around, did I?

In a statement Wednesday, The Daily Mail said it categorically denies trying to coerce Ms. Wachowski into revealing her transgender identity.

Our reporter was extremely sympathetic and courteous at all times a spokesman for DailyMail.com said, referring to an unreleased transcript of the conversation with the director.

We wish Lilly Wachowski well with her journey, though we are surprised as to how she has reacted, given the courtesy and sensitivity with which the reporter approached her, he added.

The Daily Mail was harshly criticized for its handling of transgender issues after it ran a column about Lucy Meadows, a British teacher who transitioned over Christmas break in 2012, under the headline Hes not only in the wrong body ... hes in the wrong job.

Ms. Meadows killed herself three months later, citing debts, job stress and the recent death of loved ones, according to The Guardian. But the coroner in Lancashire, England, condemned the news media after her death and singled out The Daily Mail for what he called its character assassination and ridicule and humiliation of a private citizen.

In its statement, Wednesday, The Daily Mail rejected the argument that its coverage had played any role in the death of Ms. Meadows.

Ms. Wachowski said Monday was not the first time that she had been approached by a reporter.

Her agent called several times over the past year to tell her a media outlet was about to publish an article on her gender transition and had requested a comment, she said.

She prepared a mega-sarcastic statement to release in the event that a publication wrote about her transition without her consent, Ms. Wachowski said, but each time, the media outlet backed down.

And now here they were, at my front door, almost as if to say  Theres another one! Lets drag em out in the open so we can all have a look! Ms. Wachowski wrote about her exchange with The Daily Mail reporter.

Transgender people in the United States face far higher rates of murder, poverty and unemployment than the rest of the population, and in the past year several states have considered laws that would make it illegal for a transgender person to use a public restroom that fits his or her gender.

Ms. Wachowski said she hoped the decision by other news media outlets to decline to publish articles before she came out reflected a growing awareness of the potentially fatal effect of publicly outing someone.

Faced with a reporter on her doorstep, however, she decided to take control of the information herself, she said.

So yeah, Im transgender, she wrote. And yeah, Ive transitioned.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-02-26 00:00:00,Video Review: Restoring Diesels Good Name With a New Range Rover,['Tom Voelk'],"Diesel is a dirty word these days thanks to the Volkswagen scandal.

Thats a shame, because the engine technology offers the kind of performance thats quite appealing, namely serious muscle off the line and significantly improved fuel economy over gasoline-powered engines.

Into this hostile environment, Land Rover brings its first diesel for the American market. Do not judge by the misdeeds of others; the Td6 3-liter turbodiesel motor may be the best way to motivate a Range Rover. Diesels stump-pulling power encourages off-roading, perfect when tossing this $103,925 (as tested) luxury vehicle on the Rubicon Trail.

Lets address the gaseous elephant in the room: emissions. Like other automakers, Land Rover uses a fluid called urea, which mists the exhaust to knock down emissions, turning harmful nitrogen oxide into plain old nitrogen. The urea tank gets filled every 10,000 miles or so. Theres low-pressure exhaust gas recirculation, too, but then Id be getting all technical on you.

The Td6 packs 254 horsepower and enough soul-satisfying torque to drag Lucifer back to Hades, 440 pound-feet to be precise. Five minutes behind the wheel of this rig is the best publicity diesel could have. Only those outside the car might, and I emphasize might, know this is a diesel. The telltale grumble is replaced with a sonic quality closer to gasoline direct-injection. Inside, the Range Rover is whisper quiet even as it cranks from rest to 60 miles an hour in about seven seconds. Fuel economy is officially rated by the government at 22 miles per gallon in the city, 29 on the highway. I averaged 28 in mixed driving, heavy on urban slogging.

Power is routed through an 8-speed transmission (its controller knob glides strikingly from the console on start-up). Most will leave Land Rovers Terrain Response four-wheel drive system in auto mode. For severe traversing, dial in the symbol of the terrain you plan to cross (much like sorting socks, only theres always a match). In everyday use, this deftly maneuvers the concrete canyons it will see most. Its no Miata, but its well controlled for the breed.

Imagine fording 35 inches of water while cocooned by fine leather and woodwork. In an S-Class Mercedes, that would mean something is terribly wrong. Everything seen and touched inside the Range Rovers cabin has a stout, hefty quality about it, even the floor mats. The Meridian sound system delivers on its lofty sonic promise. I want the carpet in my house.

The rear seats dont slide fore and aft to max out leg or cargo room. But if passengers complain about the space, feel free to kick them out. They get their own climate control, seat heaters and a great view of the sky. Cargo room is vast enough to haul furniture to the summer place. The air suspension drops the back for easier loading.

Land Rovers have a four-year, 50,000-mile warranty for those concerned about reliability. To be straight-up honest, my practical Midwest upbringing once saw the luxurious appointments of a Range Rover to be a little much. Who pushes a vehicle that begins at $85,945 through knee-deep mud on the way to boulder-strewn paths? I now find the amalgamation of opera house refinement and mountain goat ability perversely appealing.

The $1,500 premium for the diesel engine is a wise investment, less for the fuel economy than its driving pleasure. For the wealthy, a Range Rover can be a money saver, combining luxury car and off-roader into one purchase. S.U.V., in this case, stands for supremely upscale vehicle.",[]

DUBLIN  Nearly two weeks after an inconclusive general election, Irelands chances of forming a stable coalition government revolve around a single question: Can the two center-right parties that have long dominated Irish politics put aside nearly a century of enmity and find a way to run the country together?









The current prime minister, Enda Kenny, is still expected to be nominally in charge of the country when he visits the White House next week for the annual St. Patricks Day shamrock presentation. But his center-right Fine Gael partys big losses and the decimation of his junior coalition partner, the center-left Labour Party, have left him with few options for forming a new government.

After years of cutbacks that turned Ireland into the poster child for austerity in Europe, a furious electorate chose to overlook substantial job creation and economic growth, preferring instead to vent its anger at the Fine Gael-led government over the issues like record homelessness and long waits for hospital treatments.

Fine Gael remains the biggest party after the Feb. 26 general election, with 50 seats in the 158-seat assembly, despite having lost 27 seats. Its center-right rival, Fianna Fail, has 44 seats; left-leaning Sinn Fein has 23; and Labour has seven. The remaining seats are filled by a rainbow of smaller parties and independent candidates of every political hue.

Either Fine Gael or Fianna Fail has usually led the country, typically by relying not on the other but on a minority coalition partner or independents to give it a majority in Parliament.

This time out it is different: For the first time, neither of the big two has the numbers to form a government without the support of the other. But despite their ideological similarities, they have been split over differences evolving from the Irish Civil War and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921.

Fine Gael prides itself on fiscal responsibility, contrasting this with what it described as Fianna Fails free-spending policies that contributed to the last economic crash. In turn, in the prelude to an election that hinged to a large degree on a debate over budgetary austerity, Fianna Fail described Fine Gaels claim to have righted the economy as self-congratulatory bluster.

Since the election, the main two parties have been busy seeking support from the smaller parties and independent candidates but have studiously avoided public acknowledgment of contact with each other. Few political analysts believe an alliance between the pair would be a recipe for stable government.

It would be like Republicans and Democrats going into government together  to us in Ireland there doesnt seem to be much difference between one American president and another, but we know thats not the case, said Johnny Fallon, a political analyst based in Dublin. They simply dont trust each other, and trust is the basis of any government.

Mr. Fallon said he believed the pair would most likely be forced together in the short-term. But he predicted that the eventual outcome would be another election as the two parties jockey to undermine each other for longer-term advantage.

Although it would constitute an enormous gamble for either party, an immediate election remains an option. During the campaign, both parties ruled out any form of coalition and are now warning they will not go into power at any cost.

Charlie Flanagan, a member of Fine Gael and minister for foreign affairs, said in a statement on Friday that the country was still grappling with the aftermath of the economic crash, but he failed to answer the question directly as to whether Fine Gael would be open to forging a new beginning with Fianna Fail.

We will work in a progressive manner toward the formation of a new government, but not at any cost, Mr. Flanagan said. It is critical that any government formed is a lasting one. Stability is key at this point in the countrys recovery. Forming an unstable government is not in the peoples interest.

The skirmishing will begin in earnest when the new Parliament convenes on Thursday, but few expect much progress as an extended vacation period is on the horizon and Ireland is already becoming consumed with a series of public events to commemorate the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising, a seminal event in the states eventual independence from Britain.

Sinn Fein, the party founded as the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, has repeatedly ruled itself out as a minority partner in government, citing ideological incompatibility with either of the larger parties. Analysts say Fianna Fail in particular is wary that Sinn Fein could make further gains in the next election and become a potential governing party.

Sinn Feins leader, Gerry Adams, who had tried to rebrand his party as an anti-austerity voice of the left, appears keen to keep up the pressure on the larger parties and their inability to begin addressing the countrys problems.

The health and housing crises cannot be put on hold, Mr. Adams said last week. There are still people on hospital trolleys, some 425 across the state yesterday. There are still children being brought up in hotels, and this morning men and women woke up in the snow on the streets.",[]

nytimes.com,2011-03-14 00:00:00,Tuesday: Celebrity Guest Solver Merrill Markoe,"['Deb Amlen', 'Jeremy Newton']","Katie Orlinsky for The New York Times

TUESDAYS PUZZLE  We have a very funny guest today, so Im going to keep my own comments brief.

This is a very cool puzzle. The theme goes deeper than the ordinary horizontal, long entry theme. There are those, too, of course, but they all add to the pattern of circles that traipse across the grid. When youre finished, you might feel like humming. Or tickling the ivories. Providing the ivories dont mind.

In nontheme entry news, I found the southwest particularly entertaining, with the crossing of SEEDY and SCUZZ. I also liked seeing SIC EM BOY in the grid, although good luck trying to command Rex Parker to do anything, Mr. Newton. Oh, sorry. I think he meant it to be a canine command.

Merrill Markoe is a very funny writer, and she has accomplished so much that it is hard to know what to highlight. Youve read her books, seen her on television and listened to her on radio. She has won Emmy awards for, among other things, Late Night with David Letterman, and she was an on-air reporter for Michael Moores TV Nation and Not Necessarily the News. Merrills partner, Andy Prieboy, is a talented musician (he is a former member of the group Wall of Voodoo) and an author, having co-written The Psycho Ex Game with Merrill for Random House.

Merrill Markoes Solving Notes:

The only reason I can think of to explain why I am not usually a regular at the crossword puzzle party is that as a writer I spend my days locked in a catacomb, hiding from a horde of angry, incomplete sentences of my own design. Also, I am way behind on my YouTube videos of people feeding capybaras.

But I was so looking forward to doing this puzzle that the moment it arrived Tuesday evening at about 6 I invited my partner, singer-songwriter Andy Prieboy, to spend some time helping me solve it. I imagined a rousing back and forth, since we both work with words for a living. We would conquer it quickly, then feel smart, important and smug.

That lasted until I read the first nine Across clues out loud and learned that the only one we knew for sure was the name of an actress.

Come on! I said to Andy, You know war stuff. Who or what is a five-letter Sioux Adversary?

Look it up online he replied, sounding edgy.

I dont think were allowed to use the Internet, I said.

Whos going to know? he shot back, This reminds me of homework. Lets just do whatever it takes and get it over with.

In a few short minutes, we had both reverted to our eighth-grade personalities. I was afraid of getting a bad grade and he had become surly. So I did a quick Google search, hoping it wasnt considered cheating, only to find that some actual eighth grader had entered The Krawdjasndjgnfg under Sioux adversary on Answer.com.

My brain doesnt work this way, Andy fumed, heading back to his war video games. Im going to land on Normandy Beach. Have fun finding a seven-letter word for composite board.

After he left, and I quickly identified a Pulitzer Prize winner, a writer and a volleyball champion, my optimism returned and I became obsessed with finishing the rest of the puzzle. The more I accomplished, the more obsessed I became.

By 10 that night, when Andy wandered back in, high from a few hours of virtual bloodshed, I was about 75 percent done. But I still dont understand the clues inside these circles, I complained, I can see an alphabetical pattern but I dont get how it works.

Andy stood staring down at the puzzle over my shoulder for a few seconds, then laughed out loud, pointed to the letters and began to sing what he saw. In that moment, he also unlocked the solution to a couple of other clues that had me completely stumped. And now that the puzzle wanted to play with Andy, it had also become his friend. By about 11:30, he had filled in all the rest of the blanks.

And thus did we end our evening as I had hoped: feeling smart and important, if not very smug. Though Im still kind of proud we only used the Internet once.

Thanks for playing, Merrill and Andy!

nytimes.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Donald Trump Doesnt Understand Common Core (and Neither Do His Rivals),['Kevin Carey'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Donald Trumps presidential campaign has not been driven by detailed policy papers. But on one issue at least, his position is clear: He hates the Common Core State Standards. They are, he says, a total disaster, and he promises to abolish them upon assuming the presidency, because education has to be at a local level.









This is revealing, and not just because it shows Mr. Trumps ignorance of how American education actually works. He is promising to solve a problem that doesnt exist by using power the president doesnt have. His plan may also have the unintended effect of stultifying American greatness.

The president cant end the Common Core, because the federal government didnt create the Common Core. Governors and state boards of education developed and voluntarily adopted the standards in reading, language and math. Some states subsequently un-adopted them, as is their right. When Congress passed a new version of the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act last year, it prohibited the secretary of education from requiring or even encouraging states to adopt any uniform standards, Common Core or otherwise.

Mr. Trump has another claim about education: that Americas weak educational results will be improved by returning power to local school districts. Thats a notion, widely held, that is at odds with research, common sense and the education agenda of every president, Republican and Democrat, for the past 40 years.

Jimmy Carter elevated the Department of Education to a Cabinet-level agency. Ronald Reagan was initially cold to education standards, preferring to focus on vouchers  until his secretary of education, Terrel Bell, released the landmark A Nation at Risk report in 1983. It found that many locally controlled districts were letting students wander through their school years with few if any rigorous courses in math, science, literature or history.

President George H.W. Bush took up the banner next, collaborating with Bill Clinton, then the governor of Arkansas, to rally the nations governors around high academic standards. As president, Mr. Clinton built on that idea by shepherding a new education law in 1994 that required states to develop common standards for all schools within the state, and hold schools accountable for helping students measure up. George W. Bush embraced that idea as governor of Texas, and strengthened it with the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. President Obama supported the Common Core by using money from the 2009 economic stimulus package to finance better standardized tests and reward states that adopted challenging standards.

Educational improvement over that time period was steady, if not fast enough for anyones liking. The nations elementary school students made remarkable progress. The percentage of fourth graders who are proficient in mathematics tripled from 1990 to 2015. While high school students have not improved as fast, they are graduating at the highest rate in history. One of the main obstacles to further improvement, you could easily argue, is that standards still arent common enough.

Mr. Trump is correct that education is at a local level. Local school districts hire the principals and teachers, and experiment with methods and curriculums that they think work for their children. Most districts still have substantial autonomy to raise school taxes, though some districts arent able to and this can lead to pervasive inequality between rich and poor districts and brings our national results down.

But states and localities, in a sense, dont actually have the ability to set educational standards, even if they choose to. The world around us ultimately determines what students need to learn  the demands of highly competitive and increasingly global labor markets, the admissions requirements of colleges and universities, and the march of scientific progress.

The only choice local schools have is whether they will try to meet those expectations. The Common Core is simply a way of organizing and articulating standards that already exist, for the benefit of students, parents and teachers, so that schooling makes sense when children move between different grades, schools, districts and states.

Indeed, while Mr. Trump on the stump frequently complains that American test scores lag behind those of other nations, he doesnt mention that many high-achieving countries have adopted common standards for all students.

Why, then, does he hate the Common Core? Because many voters hate the Common Core, which has been subject to an intense disinformation campaign in recent years. Did you know that the Common Core was funded by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and Bill Ayers as part of President Obamas plan to impose Sharia Law on American schoolchildren and create a new Islamic caliphate? It wasnt, but you might think so if you read The Washington Times.

In fairness, Mr. Trump is not alone. Marco Rubio has pledged that on his first day in office he will stop any and all work on imposing Common Core on this country. (That will be easy, since there is no such federal work.) Ted Cruz has denounced the Common Core and supported the Local Control of Education Act, which would have the perverse effect of keeping tens of billions of taxpayer dollars flowing to government schools and their unionized work force while removing any requirements that those schools show educational results in exchange.

But Mr. Trump, more than his rivals, has made opposition to Common Core a part of the pillar of his (admittedly thin) domestic agenda. Its an education vision that is ultimately neither liberal nor conservative. Its a repudiation of four decades of bipartisan effort, and a return to a time when children were at the mercy of whatever local schools decided they should or should not learn.",[]

nytimes.com,2001-04-08 00:00:00,How to Solve the New York Times Crossword Puzzle,[],"A crossword puzzle is a battle between the puzzle maker and editor on one side and the solver on the other. But unlike most battles, both sides here have the same goal -- for the solver to win. A perfect puzzle may put up lots of resistance. It may, in fact, seem impossible at first. Ideally, though, in the end the solver should triumph and think, Oh, how clever I am!

The perfect level of difficulty, of course, differs from person to person. This is why, as editor, I vary the weekday Times crossword difficulty from easy-medium on Monday up to what the actor and puzzle aficionado Paul Sorvino calls ""the bitch mother of all crosswords"" on Saturday. (He said this as a compliment.) The goal is to have something for everyone. I advise new solvers to begin on Monday and see how far through the week they can go. The Sunday Times puzzle, while larger than its weekday counterpart, averages only Thursday-plus in difficulty.

Step 1 in solving any crossword is to begin with the answers you're surest of and build from there. The fill-in-the-blank clues are easy to spot and often the easiest to solve. Focus in the early stages on the three-, four-, and five-letter words, because the English language has relatively few of these, and the same ones tend to repeat a lot in puzzles. This is especially so for vowel-heavy words like ALEE, IOTA, EEL, AGO, OREO, etc. Watch for the celebrity names (UMA, ARTE, ENO, AGEE) and geographical names (ADA, AMES, ELON, ORONO) that crop up with unusual frequency. Once you have a few crossing letters in the longer answers, you'll be more likely to get them from their clues.

Don't be afraid to guess. At the same time don't be afraid to erase an answer that isn't working out. For the clue ""Butcher's offering,"" I once watched a solver successively guess T-BONE, CHUCK and STEAK before finally hitting upon the correct answer, SHANK. Don't assume that because you have a few crossing letters that your answer is necessarily correct. And if nothing seems to cross the answer you have filled in, be very wary.

Mental flexibility is a great asset in solving crosswords. Let your mind wander. The clue ""Present time"" might suggest nowadays, but in a different sense it might lead to the answer yuletide. Similarly, ""Life sentences"" could be obit, ""Inside shot"" is x-ray and my all-time favorite clue, ""It turns into a different story"" (15 letters), results in the phrase SPIRAL STAIRCASE.

The New York Times crossword has not printed hints like ""2 wds."" and ""3 wds."" since the early 1950's, so be on your toes for multiword answers. One answer that always seems to trip solvers up is R-A-N-D-R, which was clued as ""Leave time?"" when it first appeared in a Times puzzle several years ago. Afterward lots of solvers called and wrote me saying that they couldn't find the word RANDR in their dictionaries, and where did I get it? I had to inform them gently that the answer was three words, R AND R, as in the time when one goes on leave.

A question mark at the end of a clue can mean several things. In the above clue for R AND R, it means ""This clue is tricky! Be careful!"" It can also indicate that the answer only loosely fits the clue. For example, ""Cause for a head-slap?"" (BONER). Making a boner may or may not be cause for slapping one's forehead. When question marks appear at the ends of the clues for all the long answers in a puzzle, usually the marks are signals for related puns.

No matter how tricky or misleading the clues, they will always follow a fairly strict set of rules. Most important, a clue and its answer will always be expressed in the same part of speech and as a rule must be interchangeable in a sentence, with the same meaning each way.

If a crossword answer is not a Standard English word, the clue will usually signal this fact. Thus, a slangy answer will have a slangy clue. The clue for an abbreviated answer will contain the tag ""Abbr."" or else a word that is not usually abbreviated (""Entrepreneur's deg."" = M.B.A.). Similarly, words that are strictly foreign will be signaled either directly (""Boy: Sp."" = NINO) or indirectly (""Son, in Sonora""). By convention, diacritical marks are ignored in American crosswords, so don't worry about that tilde in ""nino.""

True crossword cognoscenti observe the bylines on the crosswords and prepare themselves accordingly. Cathy Millhauser, a frequent Times constructor, is famous for puns. In a puzzle called ""M-M-M"" she changed N sounds to M's at the end of familiar phrases, like SAVINGS AND LOAM, AMERICA ON-LIME and AS CRAZY AS A LOOM. Knowing her tendencies helps you nail one or two of the long puns, and you have a big advantage in getting the others.

The constructor's age is sometimes reflected in a puzzle. Frances Hansen, 81, one of The Times's longest-running crossword contributors, produces elegant grids full of classical knowledge, while Brendan Emmett Quigley, 26, a guitarist for a rock band in Boston, conveys a younger, more pop-cultured sensibility.

If you get stuck on a puzzle, a time-honored technique is to put it aside and return later. Perhaps the brain works subconsciously on problems in the interim. Whatever the case, a fresh look at a tough puzzle almost always brings new answers.

A question I am asked often is this: ""Is it cheating to use references?"" In reply I always quote Will Weng, one of my predecessors as Times crossword editor: ""It's your puzzle. Solve it any way you want."" And is it cheating to call The Times's 900 number to get answers? Well, of course! But what nobody knows won't hurt you.",[]

Cold weather and natural ice barriers used to protect the shore, but now the municipal village, home to some 600 residents, faces the immediate threat of inundation.

A recent study noted that Alaskas glaciers have lost some 75 gigatons of ice every year from 1994 to 2013. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, Alaska has been heating up twice as fast as the national average over the last 50 years, and the rising temperatures melt sea ice and thaw permafrost along the coast.

Frozen ice used to form natural barriers that protected Shishmarefs shores from powerful storm surges in autumn. But rising tides now threaten the remainder of an eroded coastline.

We hear about climate change and we hear about foreign countries like Moldova or some such island that is sinking and its all very remote and nebulous, Mr. Taradji said. The Alaska folks are here in the United States. They are folks on our team that are immediately threatened. Its not something that is going to happen in several generations, it is something that is happening to them right now as we speak.

Residents of Sishmaref were so alarmed by the tides that in 2002 they voted overwhelmingly in favor of relocation. Yet few have budged. Mr. Taradji went there to photograph how the villages residents are coping with climate change, staying at the local high school because he said it was the only building with running water.

After talking to the residents, whom he described as divided between elders and a new generation, he didnt find much urgency about the need to move.

I felt a sense of what can we do about it?  he said. A sort of resignation and wait-and-see attitude and hoping for the best from the older people I spoke with. There are not many options. Moving costs money, and the situation is a Catch-22 sort of thing.

Photo

Mr. Taradjis project is centered on people. Each day he would wake up, have breakfast with the schoolchildren, then walk around the village and ask people if he could photograph them.

I had seen many photos of the falling house and the erosion and videos about the erosion, he said. I wanted to show what it is all about. Erosion without people being affected is irrelevant. I wanted to show the people who are actually impacted by climate change.

He photographed 26-year-old Andrew Ningealook, a lifelong resident of Shishmaref, breaking the ice to dip his fishing net underneath (Slide 1). He photographed the mayor, Howard Weyiouanna, at home as he was getting ready to attend a City Council meeting. He photographed residents playing bingo, which he says is a favorite  if expensive  pastime, in which players can win as much as $1,000.

Funds are still needed for relocation. Although the Army Corps of Engineers has taken steps to set up a rock revetment, it is only a temporary solution, and the government has not decided on the villages new location.

Additionally, moving could cost hundreds of millions of dollars, an obstacle for other threatened villages in Alaska, too.

Mr. Taradji said part of the resistance to moving is that Shishmarefs residents have ancestral and cultural ties to the land.

They have their own culture and art and ways to work the food, he said. Its understood, for example, the way they work the seal oil is the best. So all this is threatened by the fact that their home will disappear in a near future.

Maria Sharapovas announcement on Monday that she had failed a drug test at the Australian Open was shocking. But perhaps more surprising was how quickly some of her sponsors turned their backs on her.









Just hours after Ms. Sharapova, the worlds highest-paid female athlete, admitted she had tested positive for the recently banned drug meldonium, Nike said it was suspending its relationship with her.

We are saddened and surprised by the news about Maria Sharapova, the company said, adding that it would continue to monitor the situation.

Other sponsors quickly followed. Porsche echoed Nikes statement, saying it had decided to postpone planned activities. The Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer said it had suspended negotiations to extend Ms. Sharapovas contract, which had expired in December.

Not all of Ms. Sharapovas sponsors have suspended their relationships with her. Evian, for one, said only that it would follow closely the development of the investigation, according to a statement reported by Reuters.

The statements from Nike, TAG Heuer and Porsche were certainly not definitive  suspending ties is not the same as severing them. But in this fast-paced social media age, will people realize the difference?

The swift decisions, even acknowledging their nuance, are still puzzling. After all, isnt Nike the same company that stood by Lance Armstrong for years as he battled doping accusations? More than that, the company publicly defended Mr. Armstrong in 2012 after the United States Anti-Doping Agency released a report that supported the claims.

Lance has stated his innocence and has been unwavering on this position, Nike said at the time, before dropping him a week later.

Nike has also stood by other athletes in their times of trouble, most notably Tiger Woods and Kobe Bryant. Nike signed an endorsement deal with the quarterback Michael Vick in 2011 after he had served time in prison for his involvement in a dogfighting operation. (The company had dropped him in 2007, but only after he admitted in court papers that he funded the dogfighting ring and helped kill dogs that were underperforming.)

Nike declined to comment beyond its statement about Ms. Sharapova.

TAG Heuer, for its part, signed the New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady to an endorsement deal last fall after the team was caught using underinflated game balls.

The rush by companies to distance themselves immediately from Ms. Sharapova is perhaps a product of social media, where outrage spreads like wildfire. (It could also have something do with the fact that Ms. Sharapova, a five-time Grand Slam champion, is past the prime of her career and her marketing power may be waning.)

In recent months, companies have almost seemed to trip over one another to dissociate themselves from any whiff of controversy. Last May, brands including Crayola and Pure Leaf Iced Tea used Twitter to announce they were no longer advertising during TLCs popular reality show 19 Kids and Counting after a report that one of the shows stars, Josh Duggar, had been investigated on suspicion of molesting underage girls. In July Subway suspended ties with its longtime spokesman Jared Fogle, just hours after his suburban Indiana home was raided by investigators. Mr. Fogle later pleaded guilty to sex acts with minors and distribution of child pornography.

More recently, Nike terminated its relationship with the boxer Manny Pacquiao, who is also a politician in the Philippines, a day after he apologized for making anti-gay remarks in an interview.

If a company comes out and theyre proactive and they make a statement like that immediately, it removes the possibility of the spotlight being turned on them, said Bob Williams, chief executive of Burns Entertainment and Sports Marketing, which represents brands that hire celebrities for endorsements.

(Nike has also ended deals with the football player Ray Rice, who was caught on video punching his fiancee in the face, and the South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius, who was convicted of killing his girlfriend in 2013.)

On the surface, at least, Ms. Sharapova, 28, did everything right to avoid this kind of backlash. She held a news conference, acknowledged taking the banned drug and provided a plausible explanation for why she failed the test.

I would think in those circumstances that as a brand you would take a little bit more of a wait-and-see approach to see what the public court of opinion thinks, said Kevin Adler, president of the marketing company Engage Marketing.

But perhaps companies have simply had enough with athletes making excuses.",[]

You would think that if the leader of a country friendly to America likened a serious contender for the American presidency to two of the premier villains of the 20th century, it would set off an uproar.

But Donald Trump has so debased the tone of the presidential race that there was hardly a murmur when President Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico did just that this week. Not only was there no way Mexico would pay for Mr. Trumps wall along the border, but that sort of demagogy, Mr. Pena Nieto said, was how Mussolini got in, thats how Hitler got in.

That may be a natural reaction given all the hatred Mr. Trump has hurled at Mexico. But Mr. Pena Nieto is not alone among people around the world increasingly frightened by the irresponsible and ignorant pronouncements of a man who could be the Republican nominee. Mr. Trump won at least two more states, Michigan and Mississippi, on Tuesday.

In January, the British Parliament held an extraordinary debate on whether to bar Mr. Trump from Britain on the grounds that his comments about Muslims amounted to hate speech (no vote was taken). Last week, Mr. Trumps exercise in Japan-bashing set off panic in the Japanese Foreign Ministry. In China, his vacillation between proclamations of love for the Chinese and fiery pledges of stern action against China for ripping us off has left experts and politicians scratching their heads. At least one foreign government tried to learn more about Mr. Trumps policy positions by making direct contact with his campaign, but has been unable to figure out who is the authoritative channel, one diplomat told The Times.

Spleen and grievance are at the core of Mr. Trumps thinking about the world. China, Japan, Mexico, Europe all must be made to stop exploiting Americas economy, he says; allies must be made to pay more for American protection; borders must be made impermeable to drug dealers, rapists and criminals. The rest is a swirl of instinctive reactions: He welcomes Russias military intervention in Syria; he would bomb the hell out of ISIS in Iraq; hed resume waterboarding; hed keep Guantanamo open.

For Mr. Trumps supporters, such talk amounts to saying it like it is and promises to somehow make America great again. For Americas closest allies in Europe, who have long counted on the United States to be an anchor of liberal democracy, such talk conjures only alarm. They know from their own difficult experience, both past and present, what to expect of fascistic and xenophobic leaders who appeal to the worst impulses. Whether Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen or Geert Wilders  all these right-wing populists are not only a threat to peace and social cohesion, but also to economic development, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel of Germany told the newspaper Welt am Sonntag.

Ms. Le Pen, who has compared Muslim street prayers to the Nazi occupation, is the leader of the far-right National Front party in France, which campaigns mostly on anti-immigrant policies. Mr. Wilders, head of the Dutch far-right Party for Freedom, has also raged against Islam and demanded a ban on the Quran. Some Europeans also see Mr. Trumps reflection in Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian prime minister and wealthy businessman who embarrassed and harmed his countrys reputation with his quips about Mussolini, his vulgar behavior and his destructive policies.

Dealing with an enormously complex and dangerous world is a major responsibility of the president of the United States. And that is why to Mr. Pena Nieto and many others Mr. Trumps rise is so significant and distressing.",[]
nytimes.com,2011-09-13 09:00:27,How Will Shortz Edits a New York Times Crossword Puzzle,['Alex Hoyt'],"Every crossword in the Times is a collaboration between the puzzle-maker and the puzzle editor. On average, about half the clues are mine. I may edit as few as five or ten percent of the clues, or as many as 95 percent for someone who does a great puzzle but not great clues. Why accept a puzzle when I'm going to edit 95 percent of the clues? Well, if someone sends me a great puzzle with an excellent theme and constructionyou want fresh, interesting, familiar vocabulary throughout the gridI feel it would be a shame to reject it on account of the clues, because I can always change them myself.

Will Shortz has served as the crossword puzzle editor for the New York Times since 1993. The only known person to hold a degree in enigmatology, the study of puzzles, he has been the puzzle master for NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday since the program's inception in 1987. In 1978 he founded the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, a competition which became the subject of the 2006 documentary Wordplay . In that film, aficionados such as Jon Stewart and Bill Clinton attest to their love of Shortz's puzzles, which are in fact only partly his. Each crossword is drawn from a pool of freelance submissionsroughly 75 to 100 per weekwith the accepted puzzles edited and often heavily revised by Shortz. Accepted puzzles are arranged in ascending difficulty throughout the week, with the Saturday puzzle the most daunting and the Sunday edition the largest. Here Shortz shares a submission from Elizabeth Gorski, along with his edits and his thoughts on what makes a good puzzle.

This puzzle came from Elizabeth Gorski, one of the pros. Liz is great at putting fresh entries at the short spaces of a grid. That's very hard to do. There was one thing about the construction I didn't like, and that was at 35 Down. The answer was LORELAI, and the sirens on the Rhine are of course ""Lorelei,"" with an ""e-i."" Liz's clue was Rory's mom on Gilmore Girls, and I didn't think solvers should have to know that. Sometimes I'll do little fixes myself. But this was big enough that I asked her to revise the grid. You can see the new letters in blue, where I've amended the manuscript. Then the puzzle was accepted. I earmarked it for a Wednesday, because the theme consists of straight-forward English, but it's a little playful.

Click the images below to enlarge

Her clue for 1 Across was simply ""Coach Ewbank""perfectly finebut I thought there would be some solvers who didn't know who Ewbank is, so I added the words ""who led the Jets to a Super Bowl III Championship."" That way, if you don't know the name, you'll learn something. Fourteen across was simply out of date: the PAC-10 is now the PAC-12. ""Iroquoian language"" I changed to ""Iroquoian people""I don't really know it as a language. ""Mexican hat"" was too easyof course that's a sombreroso I said, ""A Mexican might sleep under it."" Thirty-four is a matter of style: ""Middle East"" is generally rendered as ""Mideast."" I'm always working on brevity.

For 26 Down, Liz's clue is ""ignited anew."" Any time a clue says ""anew"" or ""again"" at the end of it, you know the answer's going to be a word starting with ""re-."" If possible, I like to hide that fact, so I re-clued this as ""like a candle night after night."" Liz clued 28 as the name of a play. It's trivia, either you know it or you don't. I thought it would be fun to clue it in a misleading way: ""90 is a pretty high one."" Your first guess is that I'm referring to temperature, and when the answer turns out to be something else you slap your forehead.

One clue that's fun and twisty is 11 Down: ""Wet blanket"" for SNOW. I can check the databaseI bet she's not the first person to ever use that clue. That's just too nice a clue never to have been used before. Hold on one second, I'll see. There is a database of every clue back to my start. [A pause.] I see previous clever clues for SNOW that include ""winter fall,"" ""white blanket,"" ""winter blanket,"" ""white coat,"" ""falling flakes""that's not all that clever. This one's sort of cute""serial killer."" Snow on your TV, it's going to hurt your reception of a serial. Oh, one more. ""Drifter,"" with a question mark. Well, I don't see ""wet blanket."" Maybe it is fresh.

Will Shortz, as told to Alex Hoyt

A designer eager to be talked about can typically do one of three things. The first is to anticipate the cultural climate and hit upon something consumers want before they know they want it. The second is to manufacture a controversy. And the third is to mine the spirit and feed off it, often by aligning him or herself with a current celebrity phenomenon.









This is what Tommy Hilfiger is doing this week with the announcement of a new collaboration with the 20-year-old It girl, Gigi Hadid.

At first, Ms. Hadid was scheduled to become his brands new global ambassador, but Mr. Hilfiger has come to view that title as a boring descriptor, despite what the news release says.

Global ambassadorships are a bit overused and not too exciting, he said in a telephone interview. Were really doing something different. Were creating a line called Gigi by Tommy Hilfiger, using her style, her sense, her social media presence as the top supermodel in the world today.

Of course, some may see that pronouncement as something other than a self-evident truth, but the announcement represents yet another feather in the cap of a woman on the verge of serious fame.

Since January, Ms. Hadid has been on the covers of both V and W magazines. She has walked runways for Balmain, Marc Jacobs and Versace. Her Instagram account has more than 10 million followers. Although her sister Bella is known for late-night vehicular mishaps, Ms. Hadid has the poise of a budding leading lady, even if this one is still somewhat more likely to be photographed at a banquette with a former boy-band member than at the Kodak Theater during the Oscars.

Famous for being famous, Ms. Hadid is nevertheless well behaved enough not to be deemed offensive to the culture at large (or to big companies like Tommy Hilfiger and Maybelline, for whom she also shoots campaigns). Discussing her reasons for wanting to work with Tommy Hilfiger, she said, Im a big fan of the brand and the images that come out of it.

She recently did a Victorias Secret show and just loved it. The staff worked so hard, she said. Everyone was clapping throughout. It was inspiring.

The word she uses with greatest frequency to discuss her fans (and anyone else to whom she wants to express gratitude) is amazing.

Ms. Hadid grew up in Southern California, where her father is the real estate investor Mohamed Hadid. Her mother is Yolanda Foster, a former model and cast member of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, who after their divorce in early aughts, married David Foster (the music producer behind Whitney Houstons I Will Always Love You) and joined The Real Housewives cast. Mr. Foster had been married to Linda Thompson, whose former husband is now Caitlyn Jenner.

Ms. Hadid is close with the Jenners, Kendall and Kylie, their pictures blasted across social media and in the tabloids (although less for drama than for what they have worn here, there and everywhere). So it shouldnt come as a shock she wound up as the face of a big American brand, particularly after she walked the runway for Mr. Hilfiger in February 2015, flaunting her serious curves.

Mr. Hilfiger was impressed that Ms. Hadid was harnessing the power of social media to build her name and that she did not look like the emaciated models of yore.

Gigi Hadid: Runway Warrior Woman

Shes not anorexic, he said. Shes a real woman.

Afterward, he broached the idea of a larger collaboration, and she jumped at the chance. I ended up staying an extra five hours the first day, she said, discussing her time in the design studio. I think they were surprised I was that into it.

Her first capsule collection debuts next fall, and in tandem with it, Ms. Hadid will become the star of Mr. Hilfigers mainline fall campaign as well as those for his footwear, watches and new as-yet-untitled fragrance.

Recently, Ms. Hadids younger siblings, Bella and Anwar, entered the modeling business, too. This is one subject she is somewhat more forthcoming about. To put it bluntly, shes not convinced that they take modeling as seriously as she does.

My brother kind of does it to get new clothes, she said.

Its not the hardest job in the world, Ms. Hadid added of modeling, but I do work hard.

How could she not? There are rabid fans to satisfy, and she feels a responsibility to them.

Theyre there every day, she said. And the real hard-core fans put in a lot of work to maintain that connection. So it means a lot to me.

They are, in a word, amazing.",[]

Your options are legion. Tai chi, for instance, with its flowing movements and poses, rapidly builds balance. A study published last year found that older people who completed several weeks of tai chi classes performed much better afterward on a variety of balance tests than they had at the studys start. They also generally performed better than another group of volunteers who had spent those same weeks learning ballroom dancing. But dancing did have benefits; the waltzers and fox-trotters could now close their eyes and stand much more steadily than they could before.

Similarly, yoga generally enhances balance, even among people who enjoy fine bodily equilibrium. In a study published in January, for instance, collegiate male athletes displayed better balance after 10 weeks of yoga classes than a control group of athletes who did not change their routines.

But you also can become less wobbly without attending classes or even leaving your living room. All you need is some space, a table or wall nearby to steady yourself if needed, and a pillow, said Jay Hertel, a professor of sports medicine at the University of Virginia and expert on balance training.

Simply stand near a wall and raise and bend one of your legs. Press that leg against your other leg, stork style. Try not to sway. If you start to topple, steady yourself against the wall. Hold this stance for as long as possible, then switch legs and repeat.

Seem easy? Do it with your eyes closed, or stand on a thick pillow, Dr. Hertel said, which makes the ground unstable. (A wobble board also works, but pillows are cheaper.) It may help, too, to ritualize the practice. Stand on one leg while you brush your teeth, Dr. Hertel suggested, and close your eyes if its too easy. It may sound ridiculous, but if you do that for two or three minutes a day, youre working your balance really well.",[]

When Malcolm Gladwell was asked to write a blurb for the 2005 book Freakonomics,  he did not explain that it explored the dynamics of the Ku Klux Klan or the impact of naming a child Loser. Instead, the New Yorker writer and best-selling author of The Tipping Point and Blink simply wrote, Prepare to be dazzled.









Freakonomics became a best seller.

And a decade later, Mr. Gladwells name adorns scores of book covers not his own. He has praised tomes by celebrity restaurateurs (Dan Barber of Blue Hill), Academy Award-winning movie producers (Brian Grazer), first-time novelists (Stephanie Clifford of The New York Times), hybrid writer-artists (Lauren Redniss) and more.

Its hard to compete with Malcolm Gladwell, said A.J. Jacobs, the author of four books, including The Year of Living Biblically, who was once such a prolific blurbist, his publisher demanded he stop writing them. He is always going to get the front cover. I get the back cover or, maybe, inside.

Its hardly news that when it comes to selling books, blurbs from even famous people are of dubious value. I discourage writers from doing them, said Mort Janklow, the longtime literary agent whose firm once represented Mr. Gladwell.

Indeed, in the case of Mr. Janklows former client, they can be polarizing. One person on Twitter posted a photo of Mr. Gladwells blurb from Michael Lewiss 2014 best seller, Flash Boys, saying he almost picked up the book after seeing Mr. Gladwells blurb. (He meant this in a good way.) Another wrote: A Malcolm Gladwell blurb on the cover of a book has the opposite of its intended effect on me.

Is it possible that Mr. Gladwell has been spreading the love a bit too thinly?

The author, 52, was good-natured when asked in an interview why his name seems to be on so many book jackets (he could not say how many). Do I really blurb that much? he asked, laughing. He conceded: The more blurbs you give, the lower the value of the blurb. Its the tragedy of the commons.

Thanks to Amazon ranking and self-publishing, the book market is more competitive than ever before. As with blockbuster movie marketing, everyone is looking for a big first week. Celebrity endorsements can seem vital for authors and sellers to help mint hits, a way to make books sell out on a crowded shelf or site.

Its an arms race, Mr. Gladwell said.

Some, though, are laying down their arms. In 2014, Gary Shteyngart, who also contributes to The New Yorker, published a letter in that magazine swearing off blurb writing because, as he put it then: Literature can and will go on without my mass blurbing. Perhaps it may even improve.

Good blurb writing, Mr. Shteyngart said, is akin to performance art. In 2012, his ubiquitous blurbery was collected on a Tumblr account subtitled a catalogue of promiscuous praise, and, the next year, a 15-minute documentary that discussed it was released. The market is so devalued right now, I dont think anyone cares when I do blurb, he said in a recent interview.

Kathryn Court, the president and publisher of Penguin Books, said authors should not be chastised for supporting their peers. Some people like Malcolm Gladwell are very generous, she said. It is a lot to ask these people to read a book of ours. Seth Godin, whose Unleashing the Ideavirus included a foreword by Mr. Gladwell, did acknowledge, I think it means more to the author than reader.

Mr. Shteyngart also suggested that, as in academic circles, few in the clubby literary world want to offend a fellow writer, because they may need a blurb of their own someday. Everyone is friendly, Mr. Shteyngart said. No one really punches people like in Norman Mailers day. We stand around and drink white wine in bluejeans and talk about health insurance. People are afraid to send a bad blurb.

He sees writers clamoring for blurbs to entice reviewers who may not read a book unless it is recommended by a big-name author. (Mr. Gladwells writing has spawned its own adjective, Gladwellian.) When asked if he would buy a book based on a blurb from Mr. Gladwell, Mr. Shteyngart laughed heartily. I would buy it immediately, he said. I am just kidding. I dont read blurbs. I know how the sausage is made.

According to Mr. Gladwell, his sausage is simple: He writes blurbs because people ask him to, and he does not overthink what to say. People will show you a book and you think, Its cool, he said. You want people to read it. I feel like we have to promote ourselves.

For the paperback version of Stumbling on Happiness, a book about imagination and happiness written by his professional acquaintance, the Harvard University psychologist Daniel Gilbert, Mr. Gladwell raved, imploring readers: Trust me. He also wrote a guest review on Amazon.

And he tweets recommendations freely to his 336,000 followers, as he did for the release of Fareed Zakarias new book, In Defense of a Liberal Education in April. Fareed Zakarias new book is brilliant! he wrote, adding a handy link to Amazon.

Many of the people for whom Mr. Gladwell has written blurbs he knows socially or has even dated, like Ms. Redniss. In the 1980s he was a roommate of Jacob Weisberg, editor in chief of the Slate Group, who introduced him to Mr. Zakaria and the author Michael Lewis, of whom Mr. Gladwell once blurbed: Its good to be reminded every now and again what genius looks like. He featured Mr. Grazer in his books and has eaten at Mr. Barbers restaurant, Blue Hill.

The thing about Malcolm is, he is a personality of the time, Mr. Janklow said. He has become a cultural figure, and I think Malcolm enjoys the role. Hes made the decision if he tries to help anyone, he should help everybody.

But Mr. Gladwell came under fire in 2012 for writing a blurb for his friend Jonah Lehrer, another New Yorker writer, who was accused of fabricating quotes attributed to the singer Bob Dylan in his book, Imagine, which explores brain science and creativity. The Chronicle of Higher Education took Mr. Gladwell to task for writing that Mr. Lehrer knows more about science than a lot of scientists.

Thats a ridiculous thing to say, even by blurb standards, and I cant imagine Lehrer concurs, Tom Bartlett wrote. Its the kind of hubris that could get a science writer into real trouble. In the wake of the scandal, Mr. Lehrer resigned from The New Yorker after admitting he had recycled his work from other publications, and Imagine was recalled.

But Mr. Gladwell stands by his praise. Specific mistakes dont invalidate the work of the author or the book, he said, describing the outrage over Imagine as an incidence of moral hysteria.

He is nothing if not loyal. Last July, the authors of Freakonomics released the paperback edition of their latest book, Think Like A Freak. Malcolm Gladwell was on the cover again, this time saying, Utterly captivating.",[]

Mats Zuccarello had a goal and two assists on Tuesday night, and the visiting Rangers defeated the Buffalo Sabres, 4-2, after nearly blowing a three-goal lead.

J. T. Miller sealed the win with a backhander into an empty net with a minute left after he lost a glove on the rush up the right wing. Derrick Brassard and Jesper Fast also scored for the Rangers, who extended their winning streak over the Sabres to nine.

We didnt play our best game, Zuccarello said.

I think were just happy to do what we had to do to win, and Raanta played good, he added, referring to the backup goaltender Antti Raanta, who stopped the final 24 shots he faced in replacing the injured Henrik Lundqvist.

The Rangers built a 3-0 lead on their first 12 shots before losing much of their momentum against a Sabres team that was playing on consecutive nights. BRUINS 1, LIGHTNING 0 Brad Marchand scored 10 seconds into overtime, Jonas Gustavsson made 42 saves, and visiting Boston edged Tampa Bay in a matchup of Atlantic Division leaders.

Patrice Bergeron sent a pass from the right wing through the slot that Marchand redirected past Ben Bishop.

CANADIENS 4, STARS 3 Alex Galchenyuk got his second goal of the game 1 minute 59 seconds into overtime, and host Montreal survived Dallas to end a four-game skid.

Max Pacioretty and Phillip Danault also scored for the Canadiens. Ben Scrivens made 30 saves.

BLUE JACKETS 5, RED WINGS 3 Cam Atkinson scored twice in the third period, Boone Jenner had a goal and an assist, and host Columbus topped Detroit.

David Clarkson and David Savard also scored for the Blue Jackets, while Joonas Korpisalo made 32 saves.

Tomas Tatar and Andreas Athanasiou scored 46 seconds apart late in the third period to pull the Red Wings to 4-3.

PREDATORS 4, JETS 2 Craig Smith scored twice, and Nashville hung on to win at Winnipeg.

Colton Sissons and Ryan Johansen also scored for the Predators. Pekka Rinne turned away 21 shots.

Drew Stafford and Jacob Trouba had goals for the Jets.

HURRICANES 4, SENATORS 3 The rookie Jaccob Slavin scored in the fourth round of a shootout, and Carolina edged Ottawa in Raleigh, N.C.

Jeff Skinner scored twice for the Hurricanes, including one with 0.2 of a second remaining to force overtime, and Jay McClement had a short-handed goal.

Cam Ward made 21 saves for Carolina.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,One Young Artists 21st-Century Baroque,['Kat Herriman'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The work in the Los Angeles-based artist Jesse Mockrins upcoming solo show at Night Gallery, The Progress of Love, looks pointedly familiar  and yet entirely new. Her saturated oil paintings involve a healthy dose of pastiche, borrowing from late-Baroque masters, including Jean-Honore Fragonard and Francois Boucher.

In some works, the references are literal  one of Mockrins works borrows directly from Fragonards The Swing. Others, like a partial portrait called The Forest, seize on aspects of paintings from that period (in this case, the title of a Boucher landscape) without attempting to mimic it. Im always seeing these images out of their original context  Im usually looking at these 17th-century paintings while Im on the Internet, the painter says. Its what allows me to collage together things from the past and the present. It enables them to inhabit the same space.

The new exhibition shares traits with Mockrins last body of work, which focused on gestural hands and shadowy portraits. I was working in this black space for the past couple of years, where the characters were cropped and placed on top of a black background, but now there is a lot more color and texture, she says. I thought of those paintings as negative space; now its more about positive space. Replacing her signature void with a cornucopia of leaves, fabrics and flowers, Mockrin traded one chore for another. You have no idea how labor-intensive those black paintings were. It was maddening to make layer after layer, Mockrin laughs. Turns out painting fabric is also incredibly difficult, but its a different kind of labor. A close look at Mockrins work reveals the tiny strokes that go into rendering each detail  a practice she shares with Boucher and Fragonard.

To make the images her own, the artist swapped the saccharine palette of the old masters for a moodier one, creating a tension between sweetness and bitterness that plays out across her panels. Evoking the precision of painter Ellen Altfest and the femmages of the 70s art icon Miriam Schapiro, Mockrins paintings push symbols of domestic life into the realm of the surreal. I think one of the things that drew me to Rococo is the fluidity of gender, Mockrin says. While most of her subjects have feminine features, in the past theyve been largely male. Sometimes people have a hard time telling, she says. Its that slippage. With her whimsical characters and lush backgrounds, the artist sweeps the viewer into a fantastically ambiguous realm, where time and sexuality fold in on themselves to form something curiously new.",[]

Kent Clizbe, a 55-year-old former C.I.A. officer and intelligence contractor, has cultivated a diverse set of interests in his later years. He loves bird watching and participates in his local Christmas Bird Count, an informal census organized by the Audubon Society. He has a patent on a device, the TimeOff, that prevents unattended-stove fires. But Clizbes true motivating force  a holdover, perhaps, from his decade with the agency  is an unrelenting compulsion to get to the bottom of things. He vets every person he meets, interrogating every fact presented to him. This perpetual need to turn everything inside out is the defining trait of Clizbes personality, and he remains faithful to it, even when it incurs him great personal expense.

Clizbe grew up poor in Halifax County, North Carolina, raised by a single mother. In 1980, after failing out of East Carolina University, he joined the Air Force. Aptitude tests revealed a gift for languages, so Clizbe enrolled in intensive Vietnamese courses and then was shipped to the Philippines, where he spent three years monitoring Vietnamese radio communications. When his tour ended, he went back to school at Southern Illinois University. On campus, he fell in love with a Malaysian girl, who told him that if he wanted to marry her, he would have to convert to Islam. He converted, married her and followed her back to Southeast Asia, where he found work at a refugee camp in the Philippines. Clizbe made frequent trips to her hometown outside Kuala Lumpur, where he immersed himself in the local customs.









He and his wife lived in Asia for a year before finding jobs at the business college at King Saud University in Qassim Province in Saudi Arabia. He taught English as a second language and made the pilgrimage to Mecca. It was 1988, and the war in Afghanistan was dragging on. At the mosque on Fridays, Clizbe would hear calls for young men to travel east and wage jihad against the communists.

After returning to the United States in 1990, Clizbe earned a masters degree in linguistics and studied business and instructional design. While he searched for a job, he sometimes paid the bills by working the phones at a venereal-disease hotline. He was eventually hired by the C.I.A. as an operations officer.

He was sent to an island overseas, where he worked a day job unrelated to his real responsibilities. At night he recruited spies. His experiences in the Philippines, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia all came in handy. You have to understand your target and immerse yourself in his or her culture and the context from which they come, he said. Do they have access to something of interest to you? Are they suitable to do what you want them to do? What are their motivations? What problems do they have that I can solve? Solve their problems, and theyll become your best friend forever. (This fixation on immersion was a big reason Clizbe practiced Islam in the Muslim world; he stopped going to mosques, for the most part, after leaving.) He told me that during his first overseas tour, he probably recruited as many spies as anybody else in his region. I was really, really good at what I did, he said. Never pitched somebody who said no. This process of elicitation is really like the slow hitching up of a womans skirt.

Clizbe quit the C.I.A. in 1999 but returned shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, working as a contractor. In 2008, he started a blog about intelligence and public affairs that mercilessly criticized the Obama administration, including his eventual boss, John Brennan. The political tension cost him his next contract, he said, so he focused on his writing. He had self-published books with titles like Willing Accomplices: How K.G.B. Covert Influence Agents Created Political Correctness and Destroyed America and Obliterating Exceptionalism: A Chronicle of Obamas Politically Correct Progressive Destruction of America. He wrote articles for conservative sites like Newsmax and Breitbart, joining a universe that has expanded over the last decade and a half with people like him: generals, intelligence workers and special-forces veterans who found that, like everyone else, they could now contribute directly to mass media.

In the fall of 2010, Clizbe was summoned from his Northern Virginia home to a restaurant at Baltimore-Washington International Airport for lunch with a Department of Defense contractor named Kerry Patton. The two had grown friendly on an email list affiliated with the International Association for Intelligence Education. The lunch was Pattons idea; he wanted Clizbe to meet a mentor of his, Wayne Simmons. Simmons had served in the C.I.A. for 27 years and appeared regularly as an analyst on Fox News. He was all Kerry could talk about, Clizbe recalls.

Though Simmons had become well known to people in that right-wing media circle, Clizbe didnt know his name. He never encountered Simmons during his days with the C.I.A.  its a massive, compartmentalized organization, after all  and he didnt have cable TV. Still, Simmons and Clizbe should have had plenty to discuss. Their political leanings were similar enough. Simmons claimed to be far right of Attila the Hun. But something about Simmons didnt sit right with Clizbe.

Over lunch, it seemed to Clizbe that Simmons was oblivious to the routine butt-sniffing that C.I.A. veterans routinely engage in: questions about time spent at the Farm and about stints in war zones. Simmons said he had operated separately from Langley; he hinted at brazen operations against drug cartels, opining on the painful isolation of an operatives existence.  You and me, we know what its like,  Clizbe recalls him saying.  Its how we have to live our lives. 

Clizbe added: He was so full of bluster that anybody who hadnt been in the C.I.A. would have had their socks knocked off. But the things he said were so not C.I.A.

Five years later, in October of last year, Simmons  who, as a frequent guest on Fox News discussing intelligence matters, had become a prominent commentator on national security  was arrested for fraud, on charges that (among other things) he used a fictitious background in the C.I.A. to gain real government contract work. Today, the garrulous 62-year-old is under house arrest pending trial. He claims that he was done in by a vindictive Obama administration, which is taking advantage of the fact that his agency past, while real, is almost unfathomably classified. Nobody could see us, he said. Nobody knew who we were. The program I was in was so black it made the black hole seem white.

Fox News may have been surprised by the allegations, as were many close to Simmons, but doubts about his background had percolated for years within Clizbes social network of ex-spooks, and they began in earnest at that fateful lunch in 2010. As Clizbe drove home, his thoughts drifted to a passage from George MacDonald Frasers 1969 novel Flashman, about a wealthy misfit who, because of a series of misunderstandings, earns a reputation as a war hero. It opens on the fraudulent narrator considering a portrait of himself: I can look at the picture above my desk, of the young officer . . . tall, masterful and roughly handsome . . . and say that it is the portrait of a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward  and, oh yes, a toady.

As Wayne Simmons tells it, his career as a talking head began with a chance encounter on a train. In 2001, on a Washington-bound Acela, he got to talking with Mike Collins, a public-relations executive who was a former press secretary for the Republican National Committee. Simmons told him about his experiences in the C.I.A., and Collins asked Simmons if he was interested in going on TV. Simmons said, Why not? He paid Collins a couple hundred dollars for three days of media training. A few weeks later, a producer from Fox called and asked if he would do a quick spot on Geraldo Riveras show. Simmons was nervous, he said, but performed well. (Collins, who has been named as a potential witness for the prosecution, declined to comment. Fox could not confirm how Simmons came to the network.)

Soon after that, Fox bookers started calling, inviting him to appear on more shows: Rita Cosby, Neil Cavuto, Bill OReilly, Hannity and Colmes. Not only was Simmons a good talker, he was also courteous, dependable and willing to make the trek from his home in Annapolis, Md., to the bureau in Washington whenever he was needed. And he was a guest, not a contributor, so he worked free.

By the time of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, Simmons was a regular on the network, talking primarily about terrorism. His tidy gray mustache and smoky-lensed glasses lent him an air of mystery. Everything else about his appearance  the fullbacks neck, razor-sharp jawline and power suits  amplified his message of American supremacy through force. His opinions were cartoonishly belligerent. He defended the enhanced-interrogation techniques employed by the Bush-era C.I.A. In 2005, after Al Jazeera broadcast footage of Ayman al-Zawahri calling for jihad on the West, Simmons suggested one way to contain the terrorists message was to locate Al Jazeera and blow them off the map. He urged lawmakers to consider a moratorium on the construction of mosques in the United States. After The Times exposed the Bush administrations covert terrorist-finance-tracking program in 2006, he suggested the papers sources ought to be imprisoned and maybe even face a firing squad.

In 2005, Simmons was invited to join a Defense Department effort called the Retired Military Analysts program. Started in 2002 during the Bush administrations push for a U.S. invasion of Iraq, the program recruited retired military officers who had high-profile jobs as cable-news experts to be Defense Department message force multipliers. They were given regular briefings from Donald Rumsfeld, then the secretary of defense, as well as access to other high-ranking department officials. There were trips to Iraq and Guantanamo Bay. It was all done in an effort to win favorable but independent-seeming news coverage for the administrations foreign policy.

Cable-news bookers typically do not run extensive background checks. Standards vary from show to show, but according to producers and bookers I spoke with, a cursory look at an experts website is usually sufficient. (In a statement, Fox News said its vetting procedure is as thorough as possible.) But its somewhat more surprising that the Retired Military Analysts program did not include a thorough check, either. While many participants in the program did have top-secret clearances, program events were no clearance necessary: Any time Simmons wanted to visit the Pentagon or hop on a jet to Iraq, he simply submitted his date of birth, Social Security number and a photo ID for a check that verified only that he was an American citizen and wasnt on any watch lists.

Simmons was prolific. He was making up to six appearances a month, rarely straying from the administrations talking points. Even after the Defense Department wound down the program in 2008, Simmons continued to appear on Fox, often pushing a message of wounded honor about the new presidents national-security agenda. Shortly after the underwear bomber attack in Detroit, Simmons called Obama a boy king who emboldened terrorists and third-world despots. In 2009, after Nancy Pelosi claimed the C.I.A. misled her about waterboarding, Simmons called her a pathological liar who had made the agency soft, weakening national security. He recognized, too, the dangers hidden in Americas own bureaucracy. A Lebanese woman was discovered to have faked a marriage certificate to gain U.S. citizenship, got a job with the F.B.I. and accessed sensitive materials relating to her family and Hezbollah. This has exposed the raw nerve, if you will, of a flaw in the background check, Simmons told viewers. Without a background check, without knowing who were hiring and who we are employing to protect our nation, we are in big, big trouble.

Upon returning home from lunch that day in 2010, Clizbe sat at his computer and started looking into Simmonss background. The biography that Clizbe pieced together was breathtaking. Recruited by the C.I.A. after joining the U.S. Navy in 1973, Simmons became part of an outside paramilitary special operations group and spearheaded deep cover intel ops against the worlds most dangerous terrorists, drug traffickers, arms smugglers, counterfeiters, cyberterrorists and industrial and economic espionage artists. His operations helped lead to the seizures of marijuana, cocaine and heroin with a combined value of more than $1 billion. Since leaving the C.I.A., he had become the president of a small airline and the general manager of a mortgage broker. According to Clizbe, Simmons was the id of every aging conservative male.

Clizbes suspicions grew deeper, so he began compiling the obvious inaccuracies. He had never heard of an outside paramilitary special operations group. The Secret Service fights counterfeiters, not the C.I.A. The F.B.I. would fight industrial espionage. None of it made sense. He was taking the place of somebody who could actually contribute to the public dialogue, Clizbe told me. I know people who could do it. I could do it.

One of Clizbes specialties in the C.I.A. and in his post-agency career as an intelligence consultant was deception detection. He had even codified his method, which he calls the holistic contextual credibility assessment system. Clizbe doesnt believe in polygraph machines and other standard lie-detection techniques. They function, he says, from the flawed assumption that people from all cultures have the same physical and psychological reactions when they lie. After all, famous American traitors like Aldrich Ames passed polygraphs while spying for the enemy. True deception detection requires a far deeper cultural immersion. I am what Wayne was pretending to be, he says. He was stepping into my context. Ive lived it, thought about it, pondered it academically and philosophically. Wayne never saw me coming.

Still, theres no number to call at the C.I.A. about that sort of business  no desk dedicated to fact-checking wild claims nor, for obvious reasons, any public access to the agencys roster. The C.I.A. also has a policy against confirming or denying questions about employment. (The agency declined to comment on the Simmons prosecution, except to say that it is working closely with the Justice Department on the case.) There was also the simple difficulty of proving a negative. Clizbe had been an executive recruiter for clients in Silicon Valley for two years after he quit the C.I.A. in 1999, which taught him to approach such epistemological quandaries the other way around. I never vetted a candidate by starting with the hypothesis that they werent qualified for a job, he says. I tried to prove that they were qualified. If the evidence proves that they arent, then Ive falsified the hypothesis.

He set out to see if he could prove that Simmons was a former C.I.A. employee. Running into old C.I.A. colleagues at the Raleigh Spy Conference or at meetings of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers or the C.I.A. Retirees Association, Clizbe folded his inquiries into conversations with dozens of former spooks. Who is this guy? Seen him around? Ever work with him? Know anybody who has? He was especially interested in those who had worked at the Crime and Narcotics Center (C.N.C.), which was the division of the C.I.A. that he figured Simmons claimed to be a part of. But none of the former agents, even from the C.N.C., remembered working with him or even hearing about him.

By the spring of 2011, Clizbe was convinced that there was no way to confirm Simmonss claims, so he reached out to his former boss, M., an irascible older man who had been a high-ranking Senior Intelligence Service officer. (He insisted on being identified only by his middle initial.) M. spent about 40 years with the C.I.A., both on the staff and as a contract worker, ascending to its highest ranks. He knew of Simmons  he consumed Fox News regularly  and had figured Simmons might have been an obscure contractor at the agency. Clizbe pointed out the irregularities in Simmonss biography, and M. became convinced he was a fraud.

M. alerted Paul Vallely, the retired two-star general who founded Stand Up America, an organization that promotes a conservative foreign-policy agenda through analysis on cable-news networks and talk radio. Vallely met Simmons through Fox News and invited him to serve on the Citizens Commission on Benghazi, a collection of military brass, C.I.A. officers and politicians determined to uncover the truth about the September 2012 embassy attack in Libya. M. remained suspicious when Vallely failed to respond after a month. (Vallely declined to comment for this article, citing Simmonss coming trial.)

M. also contacted Gary Berntsen, a decorated former C.I.A. counterterrorism officer and onetime Republican Senate candidate from New York. Berntsen made occasional appearances on Fox News and wasnt surprised by M.s message. When I started doing television, senior agency guys were calling me on the phone and telling me: That guys on television, he goes on the network you are on, hes a fraud. Please tell them,  Berntsen says. While waiting in the greenroom one day before going on Judge Jeanines show, Berntsen was approached by Col. David Hunt, a retired officer who had done special-operations work.

 Can I ask you something?  Berntsen recalls Hunt saying.  This guy Wayne Simmons, is he a fraud?

Of course hes a fraud, Berntsen said he replied. Hes a blithering idiot.

According to Berntsen, Hunt said that he too had been suspicious of Simmons and intended to inform Bill Shine, a senior programming executive at the network. He suspected Fox would heed Hunts warning. (Hunt did not respond to requests for comment.) But then, one morning, Berntsen was at the networks studios to make an appearance on a radio show, and he bumped into Simmons. He asked Simmons what division of the C.I.A. he had served in. If youre an agency officer, you know exactly what to say, Berntsen told me. But Simmonss response was, he said, bloody [expletive] gibberish.

Clizbe knew from his days as a case officer that the most potent deceptions contain a kernel of truth. He developed a theory about Simmons based on this insight. Maybe, he speculated, Simmons had been caught by some government agency on a drug charge and was recruited into working as a street asset. Simmonss recruiters, whoever they may have been, likely blew air up his butt and mentioned the C.I.A. After that, he became a spy in his own mind.

This assessment could be correct. Publicly available information on Simmonss life after 1973, when he left the Navy, reveals a certain sort of aimlessness that doesnt jibe with a career in the C.I.A. He worked as a headwaiter at Pisces, a nightclub in Georgetown, and as a manager for Making Waves, an adult-entertainment hot-tub complex in College Park, Md. He played semipro football for the Baltimore Eagles and, in 1978, was invited to try out with the New Orleans Saints. He played defensive back for them before being cut early in the season. In July 1980 he got into an argument with three men in a nightclub parking lot and shot at them with his 9 millimeter Walther  the sort of handgun James Bond carries. He pleaded guilty to assault and transporting a firearm and received probation.

In 1983, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the F.B.I. received a tip that Simmons was looking to purchase large quantities of Uzis, grenades and surface-to-air missiles. Undercover agents began meeting with Simmons late at night, in an effort to draw him out. Simultaneously, the Prince Georges County Police Department vice squad learned of a bookmaking operation that Simmons ran out of the small house he shared with his wife and two young children. The police monitored his phone activity and, after gathering enough evidence for an arrest warrant, staged a raid. In addition to gambling paraphernalia, the authorities recovered an old handgun stashed in the garage and a rifle in Simmonss bedroom. They also confiscated a safe. Simmons was charged with possession of firearms by a felon.

When Simmons took the stand, an incredible story emerged. The prosecution revealed that Simmons was involved with a man named Tom Tindall, a pilot who had been caught by the United States Customs Service flying drugs into the country for the Patriarca crime family. Because Tindall decided to testify against the Boston-based organized-crime group, he had a contract on his head. Simmons claimed that the Patriarcas wanted him dead, too, simply because of his affiliation with Tindall. That, he said, was the reason for the rifle in his bedroom. As for the artillery he was looking to buy, Simmons claimed that was Tindalls idea. The two were working undercover with Customs, buying weapons so they could infiltrate anti-American forces in South Florida and Central America. Simmons was found guilty, but his sentence was suspended and he was placed on five-year probation.

In a post-trial motion to modify the conditions of Simmonss release, the prosecutor mentioned the safe seized from Simmonss bedroom. When law-enforcement officers opened the safe, they found a ledger that contained documentary evidence of large-scale narcotics activity. Simmons, however, never faced any drug charges. The safe was barely mentioned during his trial. Simmons claims today that the lenient sentence is proof that he was working for the C.I.A. He also claims he perjured himself to cover up for his C.I.A. work. To Clizbe, though, the outcome of the trial supports his theory: Simmons was an informant. Drug charges were never pursued, perhaps, in exchange for some sort of cooperation. (Simmons denies being an informant and dismissed the notion as amateur speculation.)

Clizbes theory seems plausible, but it was still missing some vital details. The typical informant doesnt try his hand, let alone succeed, at conning his way into Pentagon public-relations programs. Clizbe eventually found what he thought was the missing piece: The 2012 obituary for Simmonss wife, Corinne, a longtime military-hospital administrator, laid out the Simmons family tree, and further digging revealed that it was a remarkable lineage. Simmonss father, Wayne Sr., joined the Navy on the day he turned 17 and was stationed at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked. He served in the Pacific during the war and belonged to the Baltimore Masonic Lodge. His mother had been an F.B.I. fingerprint analyst. Simmonss sister, Patricia Bradshaw, had been the deputy under secretary of defense for civilian personnel policy. Before that, she held a number of high-ranking positions in the Defense Department and the Department of the Navy. She was married to a former admiral. (Bradshaw didnt respond to requests for comment.)

Clizbe finally saw it: the black sheep of a distinguished family, disgraced with an arrest that put him in the hands of special agents. Clizbe imagined Simmons reading spy novels and watching movies, researching the history of the C.I.A., internalizing tradecraft. And then one day, he got a lucky break, finding his way onto Fox and into the Retired Military Analysts program. All of a sudden, he was eating lunch with Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon and making day trips to Guantanamo. He was living the life of the decorated patriot he was born to be.

For two years, Clizbe and M. stewed as they watched Simmons ascend to greater fame. He and a co-author had released a novel, The Natanz Directive, about a retired black-ops agent who infiltrates Iran and single-handedly dismantles its nuclear program. (It has a blurb from Donald Rumsfeld: Wayne Simmons doesnt just write it. Hes lived it.) Simmons, who claims the tale is partly autobiographical, used the ensuing publicity push to advocate for a ground invasion of Iran.

In late 2013, Clizbe and M. developed a plan to extract a confession from Simmons. Their method would be a good-cop/bad-cop interrogation, carried out where Simmons would least suspect it: on Facebook. M. left needling comments on Simmonss page, questioning the validity of his claims. In a series of private messages beginning Dec. 1, M. called him a liar. Simmons shot back, accusing M. of being an Obama apologist. M. responded, I agree with you politically (not an Obamatron), but . . . am convinced that your claim to be a former operative is phony.

Simmons noticed that Clizbe and M. were Facebook friends and suspected a connection, so he wrote to Clizbe in an effort to ward off further attacks: My creds are impeccable. . . . Every Federal Agency in the US gov has been up my ass for 12 years. Clizbe responded with a message that seemed friendly yet was still intended to push Simmons closer to an admission: [M.] is about as wired into the C.I.A. as anyone living. If hes criticizing something . . . it might be worth listening to. Youre welcome to reach out to him. He is not shy. So Simmons turned back to M., again leaning on his work with the Pentagon: BTW . . . I was sent by the SECDEF, Rumsfeld, to GITMO 3 times. My clearances were good on each trip. M. had seen a flight manifest from one of those trips, showing Simmons listed as a former C.I.A. worker. M. knew that didnt prove anything; Simmons most likely provided that description himself.

The next morning, Simmons provided M. with a litany of his operations. He helped bring down the Patriarcas in Boston; he helped uncover an Iranian-American drug-smuggling ring; he orchestrated the recovery of a device stolen from a Scandinavian laboratory. Hed been all over the globe: Central America, South America, Geneva, Bimini, Islamorada, Hong Kong, Macau and Kazakhstan. M. reviewed the message, line by line. He may not have been aware of every operation the C.I.A. ran, but he knew what sort of work they did. And like Clizbe, he noticed the strange jurisdictional confusion in Simmonss resume as well as the suspicious diversity of tasks and locations. Despite its swashbuckling reputation, the C.I.A. is a highly bureaucratic organization, rife with procedures, regulations and paperwork. People like M. rise through the ranks because of their ability to work that bureaucracy to their advantage. The operations Simmons claimed to have carried out, if they were real, would have been well known around the higher levels of the directorate, and M. had never heard of any of them. Moreover, if Simmons had done half the things he claimed, the agency never would have agreed to lift his cover. They most likely would have sued him for writing The Natanz Directive or for appearing on Fox News at all.

On the afternoon of Dec. 2, M. sent a note to a group of former senior C.I.A. officers whose careers would have made them familiar with the operations Simmons claimed to have worked. Nobody knew him or his supposed exploits. M. composed a stern warning to Simmons: If you continue to promote yourself as a former agency operative, we will have to expose you publicly as a poser and a fraud. But he also offered him a way out: either to provide his full name and date of birth so that a friend of M.s with access to the C.I.A.s records could run his name, or to provide the name of a living C.I.A. officer who could vouch for him.

And then, just like that, Simmons folded. He wouldnt admit to having fabricated the operations on his resume, but he was willing to entertain the idea that his bosses had been pretending to be C.I.A.  that he had been duped his entire career by some other outfit. I will cede to your wishes, he wrote. You have my word that I will never personally hold myself out as C.I.A. again.

Almost immediately, Clizbe pitched the story of this vetting operation to The Washington Times. The paper sent Simmons an email. Simmons replied, denying the accusations and claiming that he had run an intel op to expose the link that he suspected between Clizbe and M. (This was apparently a reference to their interactions on Facebook.) It was a bold move, but Simmons was a well-known media figure. Nobody knew who Clizbe and M. were. The Washington Times rejected Clizbes story.

Clizbe had sent a draft to Simmons for comment, and as he tried to find another home for his article, Simmons offered a new and curious response. He categorically denied the accusations, which didnt surprise Clizbe. But then he changed his story completely, claiming that for 27 years, he was a sort of officer known as a NOC (Nonofficial Cover). This is the deepest cover the C.I.A. provides. Rather than working out of an embassy, NOCs often maintain a plausible career  as energy consultants, for example  and if they are caught, the C.I.A. may deny their affiliation.

M. thought this explanation was absurd. If Simmons had been a NOC for almost three decades, one of M.s colleagues would have remembered his name. He began to alert Simmonss media colleagues about his and Clizbes suspicion. One of them, a high-ranking military officer who worked as a paid contributor to Fox News, wrote: Ive had reservations for years. In my experience, some of the programs he claims to have been a part of simply never existed. While he may have somehow been on the periphery of something, Ive seen and heard nothing to convince me he was a NOC. M. also notified Shine, the Fox senior programming executive; the Fox legal chief Dianne Brandi; and Neil Cavuto. Nobody wrote back to him. (These emails were obtained by The Times. Fox says Shine, Brandi and Cavuto have no record of receiving the emails.)

After trying and failing to pitch his story elsewhere, Clizbe eventually gave up. He contacted a former senior official at the agency, who took Clizbes report to an assistant deputy director, close to the top of the chain. He had no idea if he would ever hear back.

At 6:30 a.m. on Oct. 15, 2015, the F.B.I. knocked on Simmonss door in Annapolis with an arrest warrant. He was told that for almost two years  since roughly the same time that Clizbes report was handed to the C.I.A.  he had been under investigation for fraud. In the court hearings that followed, the assistant United States attorney Paul Nathanson punctured Simmonss public image with point-by-point allegations: He was never in the C.I.A. He hadnt made a mortgage payment since 2010. His car had been repossessed. Simmons had been telling people that The Natanz Directive would be made into a movie in 2016, but in actuality, Nathanson explained, someone paid $1,250 for the option to make a movie from the book three years earlier, then renewed the option for the same price. Simmonss only other source of income was periodic financial support from his sister, Patricia Bradshaw.

In papers submitted by the prosecution, Simmons is said to have repeatedly tried to use his reputation as a C.I.A. veteran to find lucrative contracting work. In 2008, he managed to pass an interim security clearance and gain entry into the U.S. Armys Human Terrain System program, which brought anthropologists into Afghanistan and Iraq to learn about local culture. Interim clearances are minimally invasive and granted on a temporary basis, pending the completion of a more intense background investigation. According to Simmons, he self-reported his criminal infractions, explaining them away as the collateral damage of a long, complicated career with the C.I.A. He went to training at Fort Leavenworth but was asked to resign before completing the program. Simmons says he resigned over a pay cut. The Army, however, cited unspecified performance problems.

A manager of the Human Terrain System program told me that Simmons had found his way into the program through BAE Systems, a subcontractor that was struggling to meet personnel quotas. Wayne was like a lot of folks taking advantage of the poor screening by the BAE recruiters to draw good pay during training and then cop out, the manager told me. We had a lot of this. He described Simmons as a mile wide and an inch deep.

In 2009, the prosecution argues, Simmons made false statements on security-clearance forms in an effort to secure employment with the defense contractor Triple Canopy. This application led to a full background check by the State Department, which concluded that Simmons never worked for the C.I.A. in any capacity whatsoever. His top-secret clearance was denied. In 2010, he supposedly used another interim clearance to be hired as a senior intelligence adviser on NATOs anti-insurgency team in Kabul. After a time, his clearance was revoked, and he was sent back to the United States.

Simmons generally failed in his attempts to fleece the government, but he succeeded elsewhere. According to the prosecution, Simmons defrauded his former girlfriend, referred to in documents as E. L. (Simmons denies any romantic involvement.) She gave him $125,000 to invest in a real estate venture, and Simmons pocketed the money. (Simmons denies this, too.) Simmonss trial is set to begin in May and, if he is found guilty, he could face decades in federal prison.

The F.B.I. claims that the timing of Clizbes investigation and their own is coincidental, but Clizbe is skeptical. During the course of his inquiry, he talked to dozens of people, and any one of them could have sounded the alarm. Additionally, Clizbe said, he submitted his article to the C.I.A.s Publications Review Board, which would have sent it to offices all around the agency and, potentially, to other federal agencies as well.

After trying to publish his story about Simmons, Clizbe says, he was blacklisted by the conservative media. (When I asked Simmons about this claim, he grinned, shrugged and said, I have powerful friends.) I asked Clizbe if exposing Simmons was worth the trouble it had brought him. He insisted that it was. We cannot allow scum bags to take away honor and truth and change the meanings of those things, he said. Its the fundamental basis of our society and culture.

In the governments extensive rap sheet on Simmons, the picture that emerges is not of a cynical fraudster but of a man living in a fiction of his own creation. The U.S. attorneys office shared with me a particularly troubling police report from January 2007. Two police officers in Annapolis, Md., were called to Church Circle, right in the center of town, to break up a street fight. They arrived to find Syed Mohammed Azizur-Rehman, a 53-year-old taxi driver, lying face down on the street; nearby, they found Simmons screaming, He has a bomb! Simmons claimed that during a ride in Azizur-Rehmans cab, the driver started ranting about his hatred of America and announced that he had a bomb in the trunk. After grabbing his cellphone, which Simmons believed to be the detonator, he forced Azizur-Rehman to stop the car and subdued him. He was a former C.I.A. officer, he told the Annapolis Police, and he advised them to call the White House or Fox News to vouch for him.

A crowd assembled. Bomb dogs were called in. The driver, meanwhile, explained his side of the story. He picked up Simmons at a downtown steakhouse. Simmons hopped in, handed him a $20 bill and told him to just drive; he wouldnt say where he wanted to go. Once they reached Church Circle, with seemingly no explanation, Simmons grabbed the drivers cellphone and ordered him to stop the car. Simmons pulled Azizur-Rehman out of the car and started kicking him.

Needless to say, a bomb-sniffing dog failed to find any explosive devices in the car. At the local precinct, the police called the C.I.A. and spoke to a supervisor, who advised them to take appropriate action  whatever that meant. They called Corinne Simmons, and she told them Wayne was depressed and was supposed to be at a support group for retired government employees the previous day, but it had been canceled. Simmons was taken to the hospital for observation. No charges were ever filed. (Simmons now blames drinking and PTSD for the episode.)

After some coaxing, Simmons agreed to let me visit him during his house arrest awaiting trial. After the October indictment, the Citizens Committee on Benghazi removed Simmons from its roster. Fox News stopped calling the previous spring. Neil Cavuto issued an on-air apology after the arrest. If its true that all our due diligence and vetting on Mr. Simmons missed this, thats big, and thats on me, he said. And only me.

Simmons answered the door in gray wool slacks, a pressed navy blue shirt and blue boat shoes. At 62, he remains physically imposing and still moves with an athletes grace, something he has retained, he said, through regular krav maga, the Israeli self-defense system. The rooms in his ornately decorated home are painted pink, burgundy and teal. He hadnt changed a thing since Corinne died in 2012, he said. He had a Rottweiler named Brutus and two irresistible Maltipoos. His shelves were covered in patriotic bric-a-brac: presidential biographies, flags and awards earned by his son, a civil servant. (His daughter, who is active in local politics, does his shopping.) On a ledge sat a signed note from Rumsfeld, thanking Simmons for some cigars, and next to it, an autographed photo of Ronald Reagan and a glossy of a gleeful handshake Simmons shared with President George W. Bush in 2006.

We sat down at the kitchen table, and he produced a black binder, stuffed with documents. He began to unspool his current version of events: He dropped out of Jacksonville State to join the Navy. His service lasted less than two months before he was given a medical discharge for post-concussion syndrome. The diagnosis was phony, however: a ruse to separate from the Navy and join the C.I.A. But he wasnt recruited to be an officer, he said. He didnt go to the Farm, the C.I.A.s famous training facility near Williamsburg, Va. Instead, he shipped off to Alaska and got a job with Mukluk Freight Lines  perfect cover. He would work four weeks and then take off to Fort Wainwright to learn tradecraft. He flipped to a printout of the Wikipedia entry on MK Ultra, the notorious C.I.A. mind-control program, and told me he was subjected to similar sorts of experiments there.

The reason Clizbe and M. found his resume bizarre, he said, is that he was part of an off-the-books outfit authorized to do whatever was needed, wherever it was needed. Simmons was a saboteur, specialized in infiltrating criminal organizations or terror groups and dismantling them from the inside by inciting violence between rivals. He insinuated that he killed foreign nationals on American soil. His weapons convictions and several D.U.I.s were proof of how far outside the law he operated: Before his arrest in October, hed never spent a day in jail, he says.

He showed me snapshots of buildings that he said were safe houses. Each one was accompanied by a map, their locations marked with a black X. I told him those didnt prove anything about the C.I.A.; they were just photographs of vacation cottages. He shut his binder and held it up in the air for me to ponder. Alex, you dont just wake up one morning and make this from nothing, he said. If it appears I lived this life, its because I did.

He flipped to a binder tab marked Businesses. He showed me articles of incorporation for consulting firms bearing opaque names like WSS International and Phoenix Management. There was Regal Limousine, which had just one car in its fleet. These were agency fronts, he claimed. The C.I.A. spent millions to make sure no one can see me, he said.

He dropped name after name, putting himself in the middle of real events that I later found news clippings about: the massive heroin bust in Washington that took down that Iranian smuggling ring, for instance. But I was never able to independently confirm his involvement in any of the events he mentioned. He vowed to send me corroborating documents but never delivered them. He promised to introduce me to former colleagues and lawyers who would verify his stories, but those offers always fell to the side.

I questioned Simmons on his credentials, and he fell back, as he did with others, on his trips to Gitmo. We rode down on Air Force Two, he said. He produced a photograph taken on the runway. I dont care who you are, you dont get on Air Force Two unless your credentials are legit. (Allison Barber, who ran the Retired Military Analysts program, says the group never flew to Cuba on the vice presidents plane during her tenure, which overlapped with Simmonss.) He pulled out a photo of him standing nose to nose with President Bush. Who did the background checks on me then? Every time we went to White House or the Pentagon, they ran a background check. I knew that his service in the Retired Military Analysts program didnt require anything more than a cursory check to make sure he wasnt on any watch lists and that a visit to the White House required only his name on the guest list and a name check.

Simmons was quick to point out that the F.B.I. banged on his door just a few days before Hillary Clintons congressional testimony about Benghazi. He told me his legal problems were an Obama administration ploy, a craven attempt to punish him for his opinions and to discredit the Citizens Commission on Benghazi. He removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes. I wish I was this smart, he said, chuckling. Nobody can do what the government says I did, fooling the F.B.I., C.I.A., D.O.D. and I.R.S. If Im that good, they should erect a plaque for me. Are you kidding me? Ive fooled the most powerful divisions of most powerful nation of the world?

Simmons said there were documents that hed scattered around the world, files that detailed the unimaginable things he did. They would ultimately set him free, he said. The C.I.A. knows what else I did for them, he said. Its the royal straight flush of spades. His vindication was coming soon, he promised. Any day.",[]

Ah, the adolescent male appetite. Those always hungry growing boys who eat standing up, drain the quart containers of milk or juice, and are fully capable of finishing off as an after-school snack the whole lasagna or pot of stew or cold roast beef that was supposed to serve as dinner for the family. I have come home to this myself: the teenager who greets his parents in the evening with an empty refrigerator, a sink full of dirty dishes, and the hopeful question, Whats for dinner?

In January, when the recently revised Dietary Guidelines for Americans came out, adolescent boys were specifically mentioned in a slightly unexpected context: Some individuals, especially teen boys and adult men, also need to reduce overall intake of protein foods by decreasing intakes of meats, poultry and eggs, and increasing amounts of vegetables or other underconsumed food groups.

Are teenage boys eating too much protein? What do we actually know about the dietary habits of adolescent males, beyond the sitcom jokes?

Dr. Elsie Taveras, the chief of general pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, is an expert on childhood obesity. The forces that are working against good diet quality in adolescent boys, she told me, begin with that famous appetite. Theyre always hungry, and that hunger, and a lack of satiety with small portions, leads to impulsive eating and eating large portions. And the foods they are choosing arent really keeping them full, since foods with high fiber levels are the kinds of foods which do keep people full.

The dietary guidelines include graphs of what people in different age groups eat, drawing on data from the large National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and showing, for each food group and at each age, how those amounts compare with the recommended daily intake. No one will be surprised to hear that when it comes to vegetables, both males and females of all ages eat significantly less than what is recommended.

For protein, the graphs look very different. For males, intake rises steadily from the 9- to 13-year-old category up through 31- to 50-year-olds, so that by the time they reach late adolescence and young adulthood, males report eating significantly more protein than recommended. Females, on the other hand, report eating quantities at the bottom of the daily standards, and 14- to 18-year-old girls say theyre eating less protein than recommended.

Theres so little research focused just on boys, said Alison Field, an obesity and eating disorders expert who is the chairwoman of epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health. We know that at puberty, boys will acquire more muscle mass, and females will end up with more fat mass, she said. When males go through their growth spurt, which is longer than females, their appetite is tremendous.

These hungry fellows have big appetites, and as a group, they dont tend to fill up on salad. So the primary dietary advice for them is probably eat more vegetables, and the hope is that would mean less meat. What this recommendation really says is that teen boys should be eating more of their calories from vegetables but less from meat to better balance their nutrient intake, Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University wrote in an email.

We know as much as we do about the dietary habits of teenage girls because there has been so much concern about obesity and also eating disorders. Many, if not most, adolescent girls are trying to lose weight whether they need to or not. Eating disorders are less common in males, but adolescent boys, on the other hand, are often preoccupied with building muscle, particularly if they are athletes in a sport like football, where size matters. Males may want to bulk up, may want to be big, Dr. Field said.

We really underestimate how important weight and shape are to males, she told me, suggesting that airbrushed images of models and sports figures in the media promise quick results. Young men are just as influenced as young women by these images.

The extra protein in the supplements that many boys buy in hope of bulking up may be useless. The body can only absorb so much protein, said Jerel Calzo, a developmental psychologist who studies eating disorders in adolescent males and is an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. Boys who are eager to build muscle may exceed the recommended amounts, he said. If youre doubling up, youre only getting the extra calories  sugars and fats. Further, he said, the supplements are under-regulated, and the marketing is often deceptive.

In the worst-case scenario, these protein supplements can damage your kidneys, especially if you get dehydrated, so boys who dabble in protein supplements have even more reason to keep drinking fluids. But again, that can lead to problems, since sports drinks, also heavily marketed to young men with athletic ambitions, include additional refined sugars and empty calories. We do a lot to push the fact that children dont need sports drinks, Dr. Taveras said. Water is just fine.

Although some teenage boys are clearly preoccupied with their bodies, others manage to eat their way right through adolescence without ever making very clear connections between any aspects of diet and health.

The unbounded adolescent male appetite, the athletic ambitions and the concomitant desire to add muscle, taken together with the very deliberate drumbeat of marketing, can add up to a poor diet. To me, protein is a nonissue, Professor Nestle said. You cant talk about protein in isolation from everything else people eat.

The most essential message for adolescent boys and young men is a variant of the basic unsurprising message in the overall report: Eat more vegetables, and substitute healthier, less processed foods for the junk. Oh, and while youre at it, guys, be careful of the protein powders. By and large, extra protein is not what you need.

Switzerlands Office of the Attorney General announced on Wednesday that it had enlisted the help of French authorities in its continuing criminal investigation of Sepp Blatter, the former president of FIFA, world soccers ruling body.

This week, the French police searched the headquarters of the French soccer association in Paris at the request of Swiss authorities.

The search was tied to a payment of roughly $2 million that Mr. Blatter made to Michel Platini, the head of European soccers governing body, in 2011 for work done years earlier. That payment, considered suspicious by authorities, is central to Switzerlands current inquiry into Mr. Blatter; the investigation was announced in September and is exploring the possible misappropriation of FIFA funds.

From 1998 to 2002, Mr. Platini was a FIFA employee working from Paris, in offices leased from the French soccer association. On Tuesday, the French police seized documents from those offices, the Swiss authorities said, at which two other full-time FIFA staff members had worked alongside Mr. Platini.

Lawyers for Mr. Blatter, who will turn 80 on Thursday and has long denied all accusations of bribery or corruption, declined to comment Wednesday. Because of Switzerlands decision to publicly name him as a subject of a criminal investigation last fall, Mr. Blatter is afforded real-time access to investigators files on him, meaning he will have insight into the documents seized this week.

The Swiss announcement came a day after American authorities revealed an advancement in their own case against FIFA, which is based in Switzerland. On Tuesday, a new defendant pleaded guilty in federal court in Brooklyn, while another was extradited from Switzerland to the United States.

The Swiss authorities have for the last nine months served a key supporting role in the United States case, arresting defendants, holding them in jail and ruling on requests to extradite them, while also fulfilling requests for bank information and documents. Still, the Swiss authorities have been wary of being outshined by American prosecutors in policing crime within Switzerland.

This week, as Switzerlands own FIFA investigation expanded beyond the countrys borders, the Swiss authorities found themselves requesting the same type of international legal assistance they had for months provided to the United States.

The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland, a statement released on Wednesday said, thanks to the French judicial authorities for their valuable support in this matter.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,Julie Kent to Lead Washington Ballet,"['Michael Cooper', 'Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Reference Timestopics People C Michael_cooper Index Html']","Photo

Julie Kent, a beloved ballerina who danced her final performance with American Ballet Theater last June after spending nearly three decades with the company, will be the next artistic director of the Washington Ballet, the company announced on Monday.

When Ms. Kent, 46, succeeds Septime Webre as artistic director in July, it will be something of a homecoming for her: She grew up in Maryland and began her dance training in the region at the Academy of the Maryland Youth Ballet in Bethesda.

She said in a statement that she looked forward to the opportunity to share my experience to train and nurture dancers so that they can develop to their full potential.

When she takes over in Washington, Ms. Kent, who has danced in more than 100 ballets, and found a wider audience when she appeared in the 1987 film Dancers opposite Mikhail Baryshnikov, will be one of the few women running a major ballet company.

Sylvia de Leon, the chairwoman of the board in Washington, said in a statement that while Julie is an iconic American ballerina, it is her deep understanding of ballet, the individual dancer, the audience and the role of ballet in humanity that makes her an outstanding choice.

Her husband, Victor Barbee, who has been the associate artistic director of American Ballet Theater for 13 years and was a principal dancer there before that, will join the Washington Ballet as associate artistic director.

Last year, after she retired as a dancer, Ms. Kent was named the artistic director of Ballet Theaters summer intensive program. It was not immediately clear who would assume that role.

Kevin McKenzie, the artistic director of Ballet Theater, wished Ms. Kent and Mr. Barbee well. Together, they epitomize ballet artistry at its highest level, he said in a statement.",[]

One by one, they make their confused, anxious, sometimes mysterious departures. Husband and wife, their two daughters and one daughters boyfriend, a grandmother suffering from dementia, rolled off in her wheelchair, until the stage before us is a darkened void.









Its hard to watch the eerie disappearing act that takes place in the final moments of Stephen Karams play The Humans, as a middle-class Pennsylvania family leaves one daughters Manhattan apartment, without having the unsettling feeling that you are watching, in microcosm, whats taking place on a large scale across America. The current presidential election, the most fractious and even frightening in recent memory, has become a referendum of sorts on the shrinking  or is it the disappearance?  of the American middle class.

His terrific play, happily now on Broadway, is one of several Ive seen recently that homes in on the very subjects roiling the political sphere. Financial anxiety and the sense of an uncertain future have unleashed a populist fury on both sides of the political divide. But these plays allow us to look beyond the posturing, punditry and angry speechifying, to really feel the painful, inescapable hardships of daily life as it is lived by increasing numbers of Americans.

One might fancifully imagine that the two members of the younger generation depicted in The Humans  sisters played by Sarah Steele and Cassie Beck  would be feeling the Bern. Ms. Steeles Brigid is working two bartending jobs to pay off piles of student debt. Her older sisters career as a lawyer is in jeopardy because ulcerative colitis has cut into her billing hours, and she suspects shes soon to be cut loose from the firm  meaning, bye-bye, plush health insurance. Bernie Sanderss call for a single-payer system would be awfully hard for such a character to resist.

Their father, played by Reed Birney, in middle age finds himself with no retirement nest egg, an uncertain work future and bills that keep mounting: Dontcha think it should cost less to be alive? he cracks.

He, or a man like him at least, might find himself heeding the siren call of Donald J. Trumps anti-immigrant demagogy, against his better instincts. And Id bet that his more pragmatic, empathetic and deeply devout wife, played by Jayne Houdyshell  who has been working for four decades as an office manager, with few raises  would quietly cast her vote for Hillary Clinton.

This is all, of course, fantasy, but it illustrates the immediacy with which Mr. Karams play addresses the current cultural malaise. And yet The Humans goes beyond closely observed realism, using unsettling imagery to underscore the idea that the forces bearing down upon everyday Americans are not just a matter of a daily struggle to make ends meet. At the mercy of circumstances beyond their control, people on the economic edge may feel as if they are engaged in a terrifying fight for their lives.

In writing her play Sweat, which I saw last summer at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, Lynn Nottage and her director drew on interviews with residents of Reading, Pa., which has been ranked among the poorest cities in the country. (Its a coincidence, or maybe it isnt, that both plays concern people from Pennsylvania.)

But Ms. Nottages play never feels like a statistics-strewn documentary drama. The play fluidly depicts the conflicts and anxieties simmering among working-class people of all backgrounds in a factory town where the factories have been folding, as of course they have across America, leaving hundreds of thousands without jobs  and seething with the anger that Mr. Trump and, on the other side of the fence, Mr. Sanders have tapped into.

The play is set mostly in a bar where factory workers (and, increasingly, former workers) gather nightly. They struggle to make a living while fighting off the seductive escape of alcohol and drug addiction, with some faring better than others; Ms. Nottage obliquely addresses the slow gutting of the once-mighty union movement. And she explores how the collapse of manufacturing, which once provided opportunities for Americans of all races to better their lives, can potentially stoke racial divisions  and even racially motivated violence.

But with her masterly dramaturgy, and her ability to draw characters whose complex humanity brings us into sympathetic intimacy with their plight, Ms. Nottages play, like Mr. Karams, puts a recognizable human face on problems that are often debated in the political sphere merely in the abstract. I hope, and expect, Sweat will make it to New York next season, when the issues it addresses will probably be just as relevant as they are today.

Both The Humans and Sweat are, to different degrees, dramas with generous doses of comedy that stick fairly closely to theatrical naturalism, the standard for most American drama, and perhaps an obvious choice for plays addressing the real-world concerns of average folks.

But other playwrights have managed to paint portraits of middle-class angst in more stylized ways. Taylor Macs Hir, seen last fall at Playwrights Horizons, while not expressly a play about the decline of the middle class, nevertheless tackles the subject in a sidelong manner.

An outlandishly funny comedy about a semi-deranged mother and her two sons (one transgender), it features a near-mute character, the boys father, whose life slid into decline when he lost his plumbing job (to a black woman). It was then that he began to abuse both his wife and his younger son (then daughter); the abuse ended only when he had a stroke and lost most of the power of speech and much of his mobility.

While it is by no means a sociological study, Mr. Macs play nevertheless speaks  in a cackling voice  to the widely reported difficulties the middle-aged face when they fall out of the work force and cannot find a way back in. The humiliation his wife puts her debilitated husband through (dressing him in garish womens clothing and makeup) derives from personal  and real  grievances, but it may also be seen as a symbol of the powerlessness being felt by middle-aged white men, for whom death rates have been increasing after years of decline, to the bafflement of researchers.

Annie Bakers Pulitzer Prize-winning The Flick, first seen in 2014 and revived last year for a healthy commercial run Off Broadway, also reflects on economic stagnation, this time in near-rural America. Ms. Bakers style, here in particular, might almost be called micro-naturalism, in its rigorous attention to the rhythms of real speech and everyday interaction, which are rarely as smooth  or, ahem, as speedy  as they are depicted onstage.

At more than three hours, The Flick followed the daily lives of three young adults working at a run-down Massachusetts movie theater. Ms. Baker is about as far as you can get from being a writer of didactic plays, but in its depiction of workers making minimal wages, with little prospect of greater advancement, the play unquestionably speaks, in its quiet voice, to the sense of alienation from the so-called American dream that many young people feel today, and which has fired up the young true believers who are Mr. Sanderss greatest supporters. (Ms. Baker rose to prominence with a trilogy of plays about at-loose-ends characters of various ages all living in Mr. Sanderss home state, Vermont.)

Its important to remember, of course, that these plays are not hot-off-the-presses dispatches; they have been written and developed over years. The troubles igniting so much furor in middle-class America now go back to at least the Great Recession and in some ways well beyond.

And this latest is not the first batch of plays to depict the hardships of lower- and middle-class lives. Lisa DAmours Detroit, which I first saw in Chicago in 2010, portrays a middle-class couple in an unnamed suburb of an unnamed city (the title was symbolic) who find themselves precipitously close to losing their hold on financial stability when the male half of the couple loses his job as a loan officer.

David Lindsay-Abaires Good People, seen on Broadway a year later, depicts a middle-aged woman from a blue-collar Boston neighborhood whose life is thrown into jeopardy when she is fired from her job at a dollar store and cannot find another. These two fine plays were among the first to reflect the sense of trepidation that has only grown, the sense that the bright promise of an improving future, or even a stable present, has faded for many Americans.

I should note an unhappy irony at work. While its healthy for playwrights to address economic inequality in the country, theater, Im sorry to say, practically qualifies as a luxury item. Tickets for Broadway shows can cost more than $100 apiece, and Off Broadway prices at the major institutions are not substantially cheaper.

People like those whose lives are being portrayed, with insight and compassion, in the plays Ive talked about probably couldnt afford to see them.",[]

Step off the office elevator and youre immediately hit with the smell: a cooking aroma, something warm and inviting (corn chowder? bread?) wafting from a spacious, open kitchen with a wall of Waterworks cabinets.









The lights are set to rainy-Saturday-at-home. Stocked metal bar carts line the back of a plush sofa in a lounge area. One woman conducts a work call inside the book nook, a free-standing four-walled room built within the space, with library shelves and a chocolate brown swivel chair that came not from Staples but Chairish.com, a vintage furniture site.

Indeed, the Chelsea headquarters of Food52, the online cooking community and e-commerce site, look less like an office than a cozy loft apartment. Which is the point.

The work space was designed by Brad Sherman, a Manhattan-based commercial designer who has developed a trademark style that blurs the line between home and office.

Mr. Sherman installs soft lighting, vintage midcentury furniture and fiddle-leaf fig trees. Or, as he did with the downtown office and showroom of Casper, the online mattress seller, he carves out discrete rooms, staging them with artwork and used books from the Strand to create the impression that someone lives there.

Photo

If your workplace is as comfortable and welcoming as your home, the thinking goes, you never have to leave.

A lot of start-ups cant afford the best young talent, Mr. Sherman said. So how do they attract it? With cool spaces.

Mr. Sherman, 30, has created cool homey spaces for several of the citys tech start-ups, including Sakara Life, an organic-meal delivery service; Jack Erwin, a direct-to-consumer mens shoe retailer; and Mobile Commons, a text-messaging platform for nonprofits to connect with donors.

Clients who have hired Mr. Sherman describe him as a budget-stretching magician, able to transform Ikea sawhorses and plywood slabs into chic work stations, or fashion an arty chandelier from exposed mattress springs and string lights.

We needed it to look presentable because we had customers coming in, said Philip Krim, the chief executive of Casper, referring to the apartment work space he hired Mr. Sherman to design. Brad was able to get the job done in a scrappy way that allows us to live on a start-up budget but have an office were very proud of.

Ariel Nelson, a co-founder of Jack Erwin, turned to Mr. Sherman after his friend Mr. Krim hailed the designer. The company had a nothing budget of 20 grand, all in, he said, for a 3,500-square-foot loft in SoHo. Mr. Sherman took control of the build-out, allowing Mr. Nelson to focus on building his company.

I was like, If you have a creative idea and it saves me money, go for it,  Mr. Nelson said. It was mostly all him.

The office-as-home concept has been perfected with Mr. Shermans latest finished project, Food52. Giving a tour of the space one recent afternoon, Mr. Sherman  handsome, floppy-haired, Midwestern friendly  pointed out the chrome and rattan rocker he found at Amsterdam Modern, a vintage store in Los Angeles, and paired with an Ikea coffee table.

Its about the mix, he said. I spent money where I thought it would improve the sophistication.

Merrill Stubbs, a co-founder of Food52, said she wanted a space that evokes hunger but is also soothing, super-functional as an office and also feels like a home. Because the staff members use their office for photo shoots, the test kitchen also had to feel warm and lived-in, in keeping with the brands focus on home cooks.

It was a high bar that Mr. Sherman exceeded. Everyone comments about how things are so pulled together and every inch is thought out, Ms. Stubbs said.

Isnt Ms. Stubbs concerned her employees will feel too much at home?

Were online and available all the time, she said. Giving people a place to relax or feel comfortable at the office is much needed for recharging.

Working with start-ups presents unique challenges, Mr. Sherman said, because often the clients lack both funds and office renovation experience but still have high expectations. And yet Mr. Sherman has delivered under those demands, again and again, becoming, as Ms. Stubbs put it, the go-to office designer for tech start-ups looking to make a statement.

It was a chance conversation with Ms. Stubbs three years ago that began his role as the tech start-up maestro.

At the time, Mr. Sherman was trying to start a design career in New York and working as a glorified receptionist at General Assembly, then a co-working space popular with start-ups, including Food52.

One day, Ms. Stubbs cut her finger and asked Mr. Sherman for an adhesive bandage; the two began talking about how Food52 had just signed the lease on its first office.

He said: Well, you know, I design office spaces in my real life. Id love to talk to you guys about your plans,  Ms. Stubbs said. We had no plans.

They also had no real budget: about $15,000 for 3,500 square feet. Still, that seemed like a fortune to Mr. Sherman, a graduate of Philadelphia University College of Architecture, where he earned a masters in sustainable design.

His previous job was at TerraCycle, a New Jersey-based waste solutions company. He helped design TerraCycles 20,000-square-foot office, for what he called an absolutely insane budget of $1 per square foot.

We used every single thing we could, Mr. Sherman said. The desks I built out of old doors. Some of the bases were built out of old plastic buckets that I just stacked and screwed into the desk.

That resourcefulness has served him well in working for start-ups. He handles not only the design but also oversees the contractors, shops for the furniture and fixtures, custom designs items he cant source (he made bed frames for Casper and recently started a furniture line) and has been known to screw in the electrical outlets on workstations himself.

To cut down on overhead, Mr. Sherman and his design partner, Nina Etnier, along with another employee, work out of his studio apartment in Greenwich Village, or set up shop in the unfinished offices of their clients.

Being the guy who can over-deliver on the cheap isnt the most lucrative path for a designer. But as Mr. Shermans firm is growing and maturing, so are his clients. Hes designing a new, much larger office for Casper, which has already outgrown its downtown space and turned to Mr. Sherman because, as Mr. Krim said, Brad knows our aesthetic and we know well get something really great.

Mr. Sherman persuaded Mr. Krim and his partners to lease a space in a building along Broadway, north of Union Square. The office, currently occupied by a brokerage firm, is run-down and man-cave-ish.

But as Mr. Sherman explained on a recent visit, he sees potential in the expansive northern and southern views, the skylight and the new HVAC system and other cost-saving elements already present.

His eyes lit up, appraising the potential.

First thing I look at is, What can I reuse? Mr. Sherman said, adding what may as well be his sales pitch. We can accomplish a lot more for a lot less.",[]

RUGBY, England  Patrick Derham remembers the moment in October 1973 when, age 14, from a troubled home and planning to join the navy, he saw the course of his life changed, rather miraculously, for the better.









Out of the blue, he was offered a free place at an expensive private school. He took it, went on to Cambridge University and then served as headmaster of two of Britains most famous educational institutions. He was never told how he had been selected for the scholarship, but he has since tried to repay that faith in his potential by bringing more students from disadvantaged backgrounds  including young black teenagers  to some of Britains most elite places of learning.

Few institutions better symbolize social stratification and privilege in Britain than its top independent schools, whose origins date back centuries in some cases. Their former students dominate many spheres of British life, and half the members of the cabinet were privately educated, including Prime Minister David Cameron, who attended the nations most exclusive academy, Eton College.

Critics blame this system for some of Britains social, economic and racial inequalities; argue that such schools impede mobility; and want them to do more for children from disadvantaged backgrounds to justify the tax breaks they receive.

Some schools, prodded by Mr. Derham and others, are doing just that: taking steps to further diversify their student bodies.

More and more of us are concerned by this polarization in society, Mr. Derham said in an office at Westminster School, where he is the headmaster. There is no point producing people who have only met people like themselves.

In 2003, in his previous post as headmaster of Rugby School, Mr. Derham helped set up a program called the Arnold Foundation, which provided free boarding places for teenagers recruited from disadvantaged communities. He forged links with a London club for Afro-Caribbean youngsters, called the Eastside Young Leaders Academy, which was started by a former prison officer, Ray Lewis, who was alarmed at the number of young black men ending up in jail.

Mr. Lewis had been inspired by a TV report about an academy in Baton Rouge, La., set up to improve prospects for young black men and influenced by Americas Prep for Prep, a program aimed at creating opportunities for black, Latino and Asian-American students.

Yet initially Mr. Lewis doubted that exclusive, expensive and traditional schools like Rugby were a place for any self-respecting black guy. It seemed absolutely preposterous, he said. Boarding school? All you ever heard about that was beatings and buggery.

Not only was he eventually convinced, but last year a student from Eastside, Michael Olorunlogbon, 16, became the 100th pupil to attend Rugby thanks to an Arnold Foundation scholarship.

Arriving at a school founded almost 450 years ago, with its quadrangles, cloisters and ivy-clad buildings, was slightly intimidating, Mr. Olorunlogbon conceded. But he now likes life here and thinks he is likely to make higher grades, secure a better university place and forge a brighter future.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The teachers have more time for you  there is a small student-teacher ratio at the school, he said in a large room next to the headmasters office. At home, there are more distractions. I work harder here than I would at home, definitely.

This is not always an easy adjustment, however. David Ejim-McCubbin, 23, said that when he went from a deprived district of London to Rugby School, he struggled to reconcile two astronomically different worlds.

I left one realm, as it were, to peek into one that was  I dont know how many  stratospheres above the one I was born into, said Mr. Ejim-McCubbin, who has since received a degree in law and a masters degree in legal and political theory. He now coordinates Eastsides scholarship program.

The transition was so difficult, he said, that in his first months at Rugby School only the lack of a train ticket home stopped him from quitting. Other students were welcoming, but he recalls being treated like a curiosity, and once being surrounded by a group and asked whether he had ever witnessed a stabbing. (He had not.)

And in a country where accent can still denote social class, his problems included the rather fundamental one of how to speak.

Photo

I wondered: Do I speak the way I normally speak, the slang, the colloquials? Do I do that at Rugby just because its me? Is it me? All these questions came into my mind, Mr. Ejim-McCubbin said. (He decided he could speak differently from the way he would at home, to make himself understood in a new environment, without being untrue to himself.)

The experiment at Rugby has spawned another program, SpringBoard, which places students from disadvantaged backgrounds in other boarding schools, including Eton.

All this has further stirred debate over the social effect of Britains private schools. Seen by supporters as beacons of excellence that drive up standards, they are blamed by critics for allowing well-heeled parents to opt out of state education, removing the incentive for it to improve.

Christine Blower, the general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, most of whose members work in state schools, argued that when exam results are adjusted for social factors, students in state schools succeed as well as their peers in independent schools.

All children and young people should have access to a good local school, irrespective of parental social class and disposable income, she added.

Peter Green, the current headmaster of Rugby School, said the school was now building on its history of charity, and adapting to modern times a long tradition of offering free places. For example, one of its best known historical figures, William Webb Ellis, who is credited with handling, rather than kicking, a ball here in 1823 and thus starting rugby football, was educated on a scholarship.

Nowadays, fees for a boarding pupil are around 33,000 pounds a year, about $46,000. When all free places and scholarships are included, Mr. Green said, 12 percent of students at Rugby pay nothing. He acknowledges that some Arnold Foundation students have had problems but said that, of more than 100, only two had left early.

Though candidates take an academic test to ensure they can cope, the idea is to take not just the very brightest, but also those who will benefit from boarding at the school, often because of their family situation.

We may not be able to help everybody, but at least we can help some people, Mr. Green said, adding that fee-paying students benefit from mixing with those from less privileged backgrounds. Rugby, he said, must not be an extremely wealthy cocoon.

At the Eastside Young Leaders Academy, in Londons Forest Gate district, the founder, Mr. Lewis, explained how he aimed to help black youngsters take control of their lives through activities ranging from meditation to military drills.

A charismatic, if controversial, figure  he resigned as a deputy London mayor in 2008 over allegations of financial irregularities, which he denied  Mr. Lewis conceded that some students were conflicted after attending elite schools, perhaps after visiting the homes of new, rich friends where the driveway makes your local park look like a garden.

We notice everything, from changes of accent to tastes, he said, adding that one girl, now attending a boarding school, does not like going home. Pointedly, her mother had described her child to Mr. Lewis as your white daughter.

Nevertheless, most matriculate successfully, he said, and for students like Mr. Olorunlogbon, the benefit will not necessarily be just academic.

He will improve his confidence, his competence and his capacity, Mr. Lewis said. I think he will start to believe that more is possible, and he will meet other people who are different to him, and therefore have an experience he would never have had if he had stayed around here.",[]

Neil Patrick Harris is collaborating with the producers behind the immersive theater spectacle Queen of the Night on a new, magic-themed nightlife project.

One of those producers, Randy Weiner  whose production credits also include Sleep No More and Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812  said in an interview that the currently untitled project with Mr. Harriss Prediction Productions was in the works, with an opening aimed for the fall. (Mr. Harris will not be performing in the show.)

Mr. Harris has performed magic at a variety of venues, including the Magic Castle in Los Angeles, where he served as president of the board. Mr. Weiner said the collaboration had come about casually. Mr. Harris wanted to work with him on an immersive theater project, he said, and Mr. Weiner reached out when he decided on a magic theme for his next one.

Details are scant but Mr. Weiner did say that the production, which has no opening date, would involve totally transforming 311 West 57th Street  which his company, Variety Worldwide, is to lease when the event space Providence leaves it this year. The site is the former home of the nightclub Le Bar Bat.

Magic is at the core of this venue for the production, Mr. Weiner said, adding that the space would be made to look like a mansion and that there would be dance, variety acts and one-on-one interactions. As with Queen of the Night, there will be a meal, which he said would be an unexpected culinary experience.

Mr. Weiner said he was in the final stages of securing collaborators for set design, choreography and cuisine. Workshops for the production are scheduled to begin this summer.",[]

MIAMI  Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said he had come to regret what became one of the most sensational moments of his campaign: his schoolyard taunting of Donald J. Trump.

Mr. Rubio said the episode  in which he ridiculed the real estate developer as small-handed, orange-faced and wimpy  upset his children and was something he would not do again.

At the end of the day, you know what? Its not something Im entirely proud of, Mr. Rubio said at a town-hall-style event for MSNBC that was taped on Wednesday here at Florida International University.

My kids were embarrassed by it and I, you know, if I had to do it again I wouldnt, Mr. Rubio added.

The question came from a young man in the audience who asked the senator bluntly, How can you sacrifice basic Christian principles with such personal and gratuitous attacks?

Pressed by the host, NBCs Chuck Todd, Mr. Rubio was more reflective than he tends to be in most public appearances, saying that he thought that Mr. Trump had denigrated the tone of the entire presidential race.

I dont want to be that, Mr. Rubio said, referring to someone who mocks and insults. If thats what it takes to become president of the United States, then I dont want to be president.

Mr. Rubio said he was not, however, embarrassed for attacking Mr. Trump on his business record, which the senator has said is riddled with instances of defrauding working-class people.

Not on the other charges, not on the other things, Mr. Rubio said. This time the stakes are not a worthless $36,000 degree at Trump University. The stakes are the greatest nation on earth.",[]
nytimes.com,2012-01-30 00:00:00,Celebrity Guest Solver Alan Zweibel,"['Doug Peterson', 'Deb Amlen']","Todd Heisler/The New York Times

TUESDAYS PUZZLE  One of the nice things about the Celebrity Guest Solver feature, other than giving me the opportunity to work with some truly brilliant minds, is that it gives me a bit of a break. A chance to put my feet up, if you will, and let someone else do the heavy crossword lifting for a change. Its asking a lot, because these are busy people who obligingly take the time out of their busy schedules to solve and write about the puzzle for your entertainment. And because they usually have a book to plug.

Ive found that one of the best times to approach people for a favor of this magnitude is when theyre bone-crushingly exhausted. This was pretty much the case with Alan Zweibel, who had just come off a national book tour with fellow humorist Dave Barry to promote their collaborative novel Lunatics, and since timing is everything, thats precisely when I hit him up. Its very hard to say no to something when youre not even sure what time zone youre in.

Im a fan and admirer of both writers, and I can tell you that not only is the book hilarious, but it will make an awesome movie. Lunatics is the laugh-out-loud story about two men of questionable sanity and widely differing outlooks on life who meet at a childrens soccer game and proceed to trigger a series of incidents that make them, among other things, wanted international terrorists and American presidential candidates.

You might know Mr. Zweibel as one of the original writers of Saturday Night Live, but he is also the 2006 Thurber Prize winner for his novel The Other Shulman and has won countless awards for his work in television, film and theater. The production hes proudest of, he says, is the family hes created with his wife Robin, which includes three children and two grandchildren.

Lets meet Mr. Zweibel and see how he did:

Alan Zweibels Solving Notes

I write. This is what I do. My job is to sit with down with my vocabulary, select words, and decide what order they should be placed in an attempt to keep someones attention and perhaps provide them with a laugh or two along the way. And while not as physically exerting as, say, sitting in a tollbooth and handing motorists their change, in its own way its exhausting work. Thats why, like any other person who taps laptop keys to make ends meet, the most creative thing this writer does on a daily basis is trying to figure out what to do instead of writing. My diversion of choice? Crossword puzzles. Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are best for me as I stand a fighting chance of completing them. Starting Thursday, however, its as if English is no longer my primary language. So what I sometimes do is purposely take five days to complete the Wednesday puzzle so Ill have something to divert my attention until the following Mondays puzzle comes out. At this very moment I am supposed to be working on the outline for the movie version of Lunatics, which is the new novel I co-authored with Dave Barry. Sales have been terrific, the reviews have been mostly enthusiastic, and our producers at Universal are eager to move forward especially because Steve Carell is attached to play one of the lead roles. So what am I doing instead? Trying to figure out one particular word thats been driving me insane since 6:00 this morning. 61 Down. Low-lying region. Its a four-letter answer. Heres what I do know. The first letter is the V from the word AVERAGE. The third letter is the L from ISABEL. The fourth is the E from STRIDE. So the second letter is the elusive one. And because it falls between the V and the L, unless the answer is the Slavic word for low-lying region, I can only assume that the letter Im looking for is a vowel. Six choices. A, E, I, O, U and sometimes Y. Now, the other thing to know is that this letter is also the one I need to complete 63 Across. Tart powdered drink preparation. And heres what have so far: LEMON_REMIX. So, one of those vowels will not only complete both words but the entire puzzle as well  leaving me looking for something else to do instead of working on this outline. Off the top of my head, I cant see it being the sometimes Y as it would give us VYLE and LEMONY REMIX. And while the second word could very well be an ill-conceived brand name, VYLE just looks too weird so I figure that this is not one of those times that sometimes Y gets pressed into service as a vowel. But now, Im stuck. Maybe if I go back to work on the outline Ill be able to readdress this with fresher eyes. O.K., its now 10 minutes later and Im now eliminating the I because I figure that vile already is a word. And though its possible it has two meanings, my gut tells me that the good folks living in that low-lying region would never raise their families in a place whose adjective form offers such a despicable version of whatever its describing. Back to the outline. Back to the puzzle and V_LE, where Im eliminating E from contention because even if VELE didnt look ridiculous, LEMONE REMIX more than makes up for it by looking absurd. Ditto for the U. Back to the outline. Back to V_LE and the two remaining candidates. A and O. Now, Ive seen the word vole before. In fact, Ive seen it as an answer in other crossword puzzles. Its an answer I usually come up with by default while filling in letters of other clues and then seeing that Ive also written the word VOLE, but have never bothered to look up its meaning. Could a vole be a low-lying region? On the other hand, I dont even know if vale is a word. I know that veil is. I also know that vail is. Is it possible that there are three (here comes a word I havent used since 4th grade) homonyms? Yet, vale is a mere one L and a Y short of valley, which is certainly a low-lying region. Could be. Could be. Once again, a quick glance at the horizontal word it intersects also offers no help as LEMONA REMIX is just as unfathomable as LEMONO REMIX. So, here I sit. Waiting for just one of the newscasters on MSNBC to use the word vale or vole in a sentence so Ill no longer be stuck in neutral and can continue with my Tuesday. Until then, if any of you would like to finish this movie outline I should be working on, I would really appreciate it.

I say the man deserves a huge round of applause. And a good nights sleep. Thank you, Mr. Zweibel.

nytimes.com,2016-02-25 00:00:00,Finding Oscar Moments From the Red Carpet to Backstage,"['James Estrin', 'Http Jamesestrin']","Monica Almeida, a New York Times staff photographer, has been photographing the Academy Awards since 1999 and is scheduled to cover her 17th Oscars on Sunday. Her conversation with James Estrin about covering the ceremony has been edited.

Q.

Tell me about your first Oscars.

A.

It was at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in 1999. I shot the red carpet, and that was it. I shot film and it wasnt a tight deadline. At that time, The Times would run the red carpet story the Tuesday following the awards.

Q.

What is the difference between 1999 and last year?

A.

The difference is the technology and new media. The fan base has always been there, but its even larger now because of the technology that lets people experience this on their phones. Theres an insatiable appetite for films and movie stars.

Q.

Now the Oscars photos are essentially broadcast live. You take a photo, and it ends up on the New York Times home page minutes later.

A.

Its gone from dropping film overnight and picking it up the next morning to transmit, to running memory cards to an on-site editor to beat the closing time for the next days paper. When the first wireless transmitters came out, we started using them. We work under an extremely tight deadline on East Coast time.

Josh Haner made all the difference when he devised an ingenious system where every single frame we shoot is transmitted immediately to the editors in New York. They are actually seeing the pictures in real time. They caption them with the names of the stars and the designer and post them on the web.

Photo

Q.

You work on a lot of serious, in-depth stories. Yet these award shows are among the most popular slideshows we do.

A.

Yes. The Oscar slide shows get the most views of any shows all year, which is quite amazing. Last year, it got over three million views over all. But do you want to hear something incomprehensible to me? The red carpet slide shows for last months Golden Globes got 13 million page views. And thats pretty much somebody posing in an evening gown. But we were faster. We were beating the wires. They were still dealing with on-site editors.

Q.

What is involved in shooting the red carpet?

A.

We have more access now so its gotten much more interesting and challenging. It used to be all about logistics  setting up days in advance to make sure all that technology works.

I have shot every position, from the red carpet to the photo room, where there are bleachers full of hundreds of photographers screaming at the winners when they come to pose for pictures; to a position inside of the theater, which is essentially what is seen on television.

Once I got the backstage position in 2014  and along with that the ability to move around on the red carpet  I could roam, take pictures, observe and work the light. Youre not in one position waiting for something to happen in front of you. You can actually start to take real pictures. The first year, I felt like a kid in a candy store.

Q.

And how did this happen?

A.

It took many years of asking. Only a handful of photographers are granted that access, and the biggest news and entertainment organizations are represented. The New York Times is one of them, and our reach has grown tremendously, especially the last few years, through our website and social media.

Photo

Q.

Whats it like to be in the bleachers?

A.

You get into your position in the photo room and everybodys dressed in formal attire. You wait for the winners to come in with their awards and when they do the whole room just goes crazy. Theres a stage thats set up and they pose with their statues.

You just try to capture whatever moment you can with somebody standing in front of you posing.

Q.

And the other photographers screaming in your ears.

A.

Yes, but sometimes that might work to your advantage if youre sitting next to somebody who gets the winners attention and they kind of look your way. Im not inclined to scream at people. Its just pandemonium.

Then the celebrity walks away and everything quiets down. The next one comes and the room erupts again. It can be entertaining, but also sort of a sensory overload at times.

Im at my best when Im like the only photographer around. And so this is quite the opposite. The red carpet positions are pretty much the same. Essentially youre stuck in a tiny position waiting for somebody to walk by and pose and you try to make visual sense. You want to make a clean image, but you want to make an interesting one. Sometimes youre a little limited and they breeze past you.

Photo

Q.

Are you taking note of the clothes or are you just trying to make a sharp head-to-toe image?

A.

A little bit of both. There are some dresses that do really stand out. Now, being able to roam on the carpet, you can be a lot more discerning. You can follow a person or gown that looks really great. When youre in position you really have to get it while theyre there. Its like shooting theater or sports. It takes a lot of technical prowess  you really have to be on top of it. You have to capture that moment. Once theyre gone, theyre gone.

Q.

Half of Americas watching whats happening onstage. Whats it like backstage?

A.

Its really quite impressive and a little intimidating at first. There is so much activity going on in a crowded, confined space. Im fairly new to it and there are great photographers like Al Seib of The L.A. Times who have been shooting backstage for a long time. I learned a lot from them.

I use flash sparingly and shoot with fast primes because if youre shooting into a black hole it doesnt always look good and it creates a big disturbance. Ill raise my ISO as high as 6400, and work with the light thats there.

There are all the stagehands and different sets coming in and moving out at a very fast pace. And you have to stay out of the way of the performers, musicians, presenters and stage managers. You dont want to interfere with their flow but you still want to get your pictures. So its kind of an intricate dance, knowing when to step in  and knowing when to step out.

Q.

What have been your most memorable Oscar moments?

A.

Backstage, when Lupita Nyongo won, she had a big smile on her face and then she came out and she was just so quiet (Slide 10). She just stood there like she was just trying to take it all in, but it was just such a quiet moment. I mean, theres so much excitement and activity going on all the time, and I was just there, shooting, and it was dark.

Q.

As photographers we see so many famous people, presidents and stars, that we have been somewhat inoculated against being impressed. And then every once in a while theres someone youre impressed by.

A.

The most obvious pictures are of the famous people onstage. But I have to remind myself to resist the urge to blast away when I see a familiar face and to look for something that is interesting in that moment, even if its an expression or a gesture.

In some ways its like shooting politics. I went to Nevada for the caucuses, stayed for a week and flew back on Wednesday to go straight from the airport to the Oscars venue for the first walk-through. So I went from one American ritual to another.

Photo

Q.

How are they similar and how are they different?

A.

Well, there are the obvious differences: One group of people is dressed much more elegantly than the other.

The similarities are that these are rituals the American public feels that it has a vested interest in. And that dominate our television screens and social media. People can get very passionate about entertainment and politics.

Q.

Theyre both theater.

A.

The challenging part of both is finding the real human moments in between the staged moments  finding something that looks different from what everybody else is shooting. I mean not only the angles, but also the little off-moments. Like the workers who are behind the scenes carrying the big Oscar statues around.

Q.

Did you watch the Oscars when you were growing up?

A.

Absolutely.

I love movies. The town I grew up in  a small suburb east of L.A.  had a drive-in that played all the first run movies. I saw all the movies of the 70s there with my parents: The Godfather, The Exorcist, Jaws, even Carnal Knowledge. We went to the movies every single week. That was a big part of my life growing up. I always watched the Academy Awards. The Oscars were a special occasion when I could stay up late and watch the show with my parents. I never dreamt that I would get so close to the actual awards ceremony.

Q.

So I wonder whether the 8-year-old Monica, what she would have thought about the fact that you are now backstage.

A.

Actually the 40-something Monica would be pretty impressed, after all the years of shooting from all the other positions.

I remember watching in the living room with the family. I remember the streaker one year, and when Marlon Brando, sent the Native American woman (Sacheen) Littlefeather to decline his award. I remember Jane Fonda. Its a reflection of society and the times.

Thats whats going on this year, too. I remember the palpable elation when Denzel Washington and Halle Berry won the Best Actor and Best Actress awards the same year, in 2002.

So its interesting to see the controversy going on now and how different people are responding to it. As gilded and removed as it is from reality, the Oscars cant avoid being a reflection of our society as well.

nytimes.com,2014-03-15 00:00:00,Celebrity Guest Solver Suzanne Whang: It's Better This Way,"['Deb Amlen', 'Jeremy Newton']","SUNDAYS PUZZLE  Well, I dont have to say very much today, because Suzanne Whang, stand-up comedian, actress and host of HGTVs House Hunters for 10 years, is going to tell you about her experience solving todays crossword puzzle.

More importantly, you know how I always encourage people to talk about what the puzzle brings out for them? Youre going to read a surprising and very touching twist at the end of Ms. Whangs write-up, and I promise you that neither of us thought of this when I scheduled her for todays post. Thats all Im going to say. Im just glad things are working out for her, because we need more bright lights like her in the world.

When my friend Elayne Boosler told me that she was a celebrity guest crossword solver for The New York Times, I plotzed (Koreans are the Jews of Asia.) I blurted out, You WERE? What exactly does that MEAN? I want to do that!!

Ive been in love with crossword puzzles for as long as I can remember. And lately, heres how it works. Every time I get on an airplane from L.A. to New York City, as soon as I get through security, I go straight to the nearest newsstand and I buy USA Today, The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times and a bottle of water. I head to my gate and then proceed to do what would appear to be an odd ritual to anyone who cares about whats going on in the world.

First, I find the section of each newspaper that has the crossword puzzle. I remove those sections, and I give away the rest. Then I open each section to the page with the crossword puzzle. First, I carefully fold backward at the main vertical seam, then backward at the main horizontal seam, and then I create a new vertical fold so that now all thats visible is the puzzle itself. Then I put the puzzles in order of increasing difficulty: USA Today, then The Los Angeles Times, then The New York Times. If its a Monday, I can sometimes get all three puzzles finished before the plane takes off. If its a Saturday, I will most likely not finish the New York Times puzzle by the time I land in New York, and Im furious that its so freakin difficult.

I use pen. It has to be a Pilot Precise pen, in black, blue or purple. Its the only pen for me. It gushes with ink. It glides. It makes writing a pleasure. The only problem is that these pens sometimes explode in the airplane, leaking ink everywhere. But I digress.

The only exception to my folding ritual is when its a Sunday, which means that the holy grail of puzzles is in The New York Times Sunday Magazine. Ahhhh. Itll be close to the last page. And its on smooth magazine paper. And there will be some sort of theme for me to figure out, so its a puzzle within a puzzle. And its bigger than the other puzzles (21 x 21 instead of 15 x 15). And I love it so. And I dont want your help until Ive done everything in my power to solve it on my own. Once, on an airplane, the person sitting next to me just decided to tell me the answer to 7 down. Unsolicited help. Horrifying. I

felt so violated, I needed a Silkwood scrub-down.

I emailed Deb Amlen, introducing myself, hoping I was enough of a celebrity to be considered for this highest of all honors, pitching myself as if it were more important than anything else I had done in my 25-year show biz career. When I got her email saying that she knew who I was and yes I could be a celebrity guest solver, I squealed with glee. When she gave me a choice of what day of the week Id like to solve, well, that was easy. Sunday!

Most of my friends dont do crossword puzzles, and they dont understand my obsession with them. They also dont understand why I dont want crossword puzzle books, and I dont want to do crossword puzzles online. This is a visceral experience that requires pen and paper, and it has to be in a newspaper, not in a book. Its more special when youre doing the puzzle in todays paper. And the puzzles in The New York Times, thanks to Will Shortz, are the most elegant. There is a sweet spot between a clue being too easy and being impossible to figure out, and Mr. Shortz manages to make sure to create that perfect balance. Well, with the exception of Saturdays. Grrr.

One of my favorite documentaries is Wordplay. Much like a support group meeting, it was wonderful to not feel like such a weirdo for loving crossword puzzles this much. Jon Stewart loves crosswords, too? Yay!

When I printed out the Sunday puzzle Id be solving, the first thing that occurred to me was, Im seeing this puzzle before the rest of the world! Wow! The second thing that occurred to me was, My father is going to LOVE reading this piece. I got my father into crossword puzzles many years ago. But I got my love of the English language from him.

O.K., lets get to this puzzle. After wondering about the significance of the title, I notice the four circles in the squares of 1 Across, and the four circles in the squares of 119 Across. What is that? A word within a word? Hmm.

I usually begin puzzles by looking through the clues for anything with a fill-in-the-blank. Im not sure why I do this, but I do. Perhaps in my experience, Im often able to solve those clues easily. 62 Across, ______ good cheer! I write in BE OF.

I write in all capital letters. Not sure why, its just what Ive always done. I wonder why it doesnt say (two words) in the clue. There was a time when the clues would tell us if the answer was more than one word. Im mildly annoyed.

117 Across, The ______ Project (Fox comedy). MINDY! 2 Down, ______ de la Societe. I think its ILES; thats one of those crossword puzzle answers that I only know from doing crossword puzzles. Like knowing that a jewelry case is an ETUI. 15 Down, Whack-_____ Well, its gotta be A-MOLE. 66 Down, _____ and Thummim (sacred Judaic objects) Darn you, Jeremy Newton and Will Shortz. Grrrrr. I rarely know world history or ancient terms for anything. Or the Latin words for anything.

Now, whats the theme of this puzzle? 23 Across, *He bested Leonidas at Thermopylae. Oh, come ON. Nobody knows that. And why is there an asterisk before the clue?

Here are my favorite clues. 1 Downs Something dirty kept in a cell? It took me a while, but I finally realized it was SEXT. Fantastic. 57 Down, Loud beast heard in the theaters. Huh? Godzilla? King Kong? Those dont fit. Then I got the across answers that showed me the first two letters of the answer were MG. Theres no word that starts with MG. If its a Scottish word, it would be MCG. Then I realize. Its the MGM LION.

Woo hoo! Im so pleased with myself now. 7 Across, Touching words? Eulogy doesnt fit. And theres a question mark, so theres something punny going on.

Oh! BRAILLE! Love it. 73 Down: Theyre 18 to 21. What could that possibly mean? I cant get past these numbers referring to a persons age. Then I finally realize its referring to the letters of the alphabet. RSTU. Im in heaven.

I get that 31 Across is FOURXFOUR, and that 49 Across is THE WINTERX GAMES, and then I see the clue for 16 Down. Its the key to this puzzle! In both of these starred clues, the answers contain the letters RX, which means prescription. And now Im on my way. Figuring out the theme to a Sunday puzzle is what I would call a wordgasm.

As soon as I figure out the theme, I have to leave the house to go to a meeting. Im in my car, and I notice this license plate right in front of me. PARIS RX. I get chills. I recently married a man whom Ive been friends with and secretly in love with for 20 years. Turns out he was secretly in love with me, too, and he chose to tell me. We want to go on a honeymoon to Paris, when we can afford it. And then RX, the theme of this puzzle is right after that? Paris prescription, indeed.

I get that 1 Across is SICK OF, with SICK being inside the four circles, so I look at the four circles at the bottom right and wonder if those would contain the letters WELL. The clue is Thrive, so I write in DOWELL. Now the title makes sense. ITS BETTER THIS WAY. We begin with SICK and end with WELL.

This theme is poignant for me. In the last eight years, I had breast cancer three times, because like most Asians, I am an overachiever. Yay! The third time it metastasized to Stage 4, and I was given six months to live. But I reversed the disease, reclaimed my health, and am now cancer-free. I used Western medicine, Eastern medicine, holistic, alternative, illegal and revolutionary treatments. I came out of the cancer closet and started asking for (and receiving) help and love. My house became Grand Central Love Station. I felt like Jimmy Stewart at the end of Its a Wonderful Life. I changed my nutrition and started meditating. And now I laugh, I bask in the present moment, and I overflow with gratitude. Every day feels like a bonus round. I wake up so grateful to be alive. Im not just a survivor, Im a thriver. And that today I get to be the celebrity guest solver for the New York Times Sunday puzzle is yet another miracle. The only thing that could top this would be for my name to be the answer to a New York Times crossword puzzle clue.

In a random house in America: Hey, sweetie, whats a 12-letter-word for a crazy Asian?",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"After Living Brazils Dream, Family Confronts Microcephaly and Economic Crisis",['Simon Romero'],"IPOJUCA, Brazil  They were young and relishing Brazils version of the American dream: buying a car, joining a church, starting a family.









With millions of others, they had climbed into the countrys expanding middle class. They had even moved into California, a neighborhood of strivers who had left the big, impoverished city nearby.

It was that magical moment when everything seemed possible, said Germana Soares, 24.

Then, in the sixth month of Ms. Soaress pregnancy, the couple discovered how quickly their fortunes, like those of their nation, could change. A routine exam showed that their son weighed much less than he should. Doctors worried that he, like hundreds of other Brazilian babies born in recent months, had microcephaly, an incurable condition in which infants have abnormally small heads.

The doctors peppered her with questions about the Zika virus, which she had contracted early in her pregnancy. Her husband, Glecion Amorim, 27, quickly spiraled into worry. Ms. Soares put on a brave face and prayed, trying to stay positive.

Then another shock: Mr. Amorim, a welder riding Brazils push into the top ranks of global oil producers, was fired with hundreds of others. The enormous shipyard where he built oil vessels was teetering along with Brazils scandal-plagued oil industry.

In the span of a few weeks, the entire arc of their lives had changed. All the crosscurrents punishing Brazil  corruption, the countrys worst economic downturn in decades, the fall of millions of middle-class people into poverty, the Zika epidemic and the surge of microcephaly cases stalking the northeast  were suddenly lashing at the door of their cookie-cutter two-bedroom home with a Chevy compact in the driveway.

I thought Hawaii would be wonderful to see, Ms. Soares said, rattling off a list of dreams the couple had sketched out, until recently. All those big plans are in the past. My priority has to be caring for my special boy.

Their struggle offers a small glimpse into the thousands of Brazilian families now faced with the prospect of raising a disabled child in poverty in the wake of the Zika epidemic.

Researchers still cannot say with certainty whether the virus causes microcephaly in infants, but at least 641 Brazilian babies have been born with the condition since October  a sharp increase detected by doctors in recent months  and the authorities are investigating 4,222 other cases, largely here in the countrys impoverished northeast.

Newfound Security

Ms. Soares and Mr. Amorim thought they had finally escaped the hardships of life in nearby Recife when they moved into California around the start of the decade. Those were the boom years, when tens of thousands of workers swarmed the Port of Suape, a sprawling industrial site built to help propel Brazil into the elite ranks of the worlds oil-producing nations.

Huge deep-sea oil discoveries and the opening of a new agricultural frontier on the edge of the Amazon rain forest had catapulted Brazil onto the global stage, positioning it to satisfy Chinas demand for commodities. Brazilian officials built concrete canals in drought-stricken backlands, railroads through the hinterlands and lavish stadiums for the World Cup soccer tournament.

Demand for workers was so intense that Mr. Amorims employers offered him a two-bedroom house, one of nearly 800 designed almost identically in this company town.

At one point, there were a thousand buses a day here transporting workers, said Aldo Amaral, 44, the president of the union representing laborers at the port complex. It was a boom that was supposed to last decades.

Ms. Soares and Mr. Amorim embraced it fully. When Brazils currency surged, their combined income reached the equivalent of almost $40,000 a year. They installed a large flat-screen television in their living room, joined an evangelical Christian congregation, hired a photographer for their wedding, traveled by motorcycle to idyllic beaches and even flew on vacation to Fernando de Noronha, a Brazilian archipelago in the Atlantic that few people in the world ever get to see.

We even had health insurance that gave us access to private hospitals, Ms. Soares said, lamenting her current reliance on Brazils public health system, often characterized by horror stories about neglect by doctors and shortages of beds that force patients to sleep in the corridors. It was the perfect time for us to have a baby.

A Sudden Blow

Ebullient when Ms. Soares became pregnant, the couple hosted a cha de revelacao, a party to reveal the babys sex, and announced to friends and relatives that they were expecting a son. They tried to remain hopeful even after doctors raised the possibility during Ms. Soaress pregnancy that their son might have microcephaly. They thought about opening a store selling baby clothes with the modest severance package Mr. Amorim had received after losing his job at the shipyard.

Photo

Then, on Nov. 27, Guilherme was born. At first, doctors said the baby seemed fine. The news elicited cries of joy among relatives in the waiting room, and a celebration of hugs and impromptu dancing that resembled a Carnival street party, Ms. Soares said.

But a nurse returned with an update. Something appeared to be wrong when they measured Guilhermes head. The circumference was 32 centimeters, the threshold for microcephaly classification at that time. A hush set over the hospital room as family members carefully tapped the word microcephaly into the search engines of their smartphones.

I heard the number 32, and I began to cry, Mr. Amorim said.

Doctors kept Ms. Soares and Guilherme hospitalized for a week as they carried out tests. Scans confirmed that Guilherme had brain damage associated with microcephaly.

The blow led the couple to rethink everything. Ms. Soares had been so buoyant after learning she was pregnant that she left her job as a real estate agent, planning to dedicate herself instead to raising their child on her husbands salary. But after he lost his job, the two found themselves in the whirlwind of Brazils economic crisis. More than six million Brazilians have slipped from the middle class into poverty since 2014, according to economists at Bradesco, one of Brazils largest banks.

Instead of opening a clothing store, as they had envisioned, Mr. Amorim invested in something more affordable: a dune buggy. Each day, he drives to Porto de Galinhas, a nearby area of resorts where he tries to lure vacationers to take beach tours. In a good month, he makes about $625. Altogether, he said, the family will be lucky if their annual income reaches $7,000.

I have to keep a smile on my face and be friendly despite all the thoughts swirling in my mind, Mr. Amorim said. Im the only one now earning money, and its my responsibility to put food on our table every day.

Ms. Soares said she was slowly realizing that she might never be able to hold a regular job again, given the time needed to care for many children with microcephaly, who often develop problems like speech impediments, hearing loss and learning delays. Guilherme, she said, has already started having muscle spasms, which doctors say are a predictor of convulsions later in life.

He cries so much and needs so much love that I cant just leave him with someone, she said.

I used to think of myself as an independent woman, she added, pausing to look out the window. But that phase in my life is finished. I cant go back to work.

A Daily Grind

Ms. Soares leaves home a couple of times each week for appointments with doctors in Recife, awaking with Guilherme at 5 a.m. to board a van provided by municipal officials to transport patients. Driving their car is out of the question, since each trip to Recife and back consumes about $25 in gasoline, an expense far beyond their reach.

Cruelly, their move into California, which once seemed to trumpet their ambitions for independence, now feels isolating. While Mr. Amorim scours the beaches for clients, a family member from Recife occasionally visits Ms. Soares and Guilherme. Still, relatives have their own jobs and families, so she spends many of her days alone with her son. On a recent Saturday afternoon, their flat-screen TV was tuned in to a skateboarding event in Rio de Janeiro featuring cheerful competitors from around Brazil.

I dont know if my son will ever be able to do anything like that, she said.

Ms. Soares tries to maintain a semblance of normalcy. Embroidered elephants, hippos and lions adorn the walls of her sons room under the words Guilhermes Safari. A mosquito net envelops his crib, reflecting the couples newfound awareness of viruses like Zika, dengue and chikungunya.

With so many other mothers who have recently given birth to babies with microcephaly, Ms. Soares keeps informed about the condition on WhatsApp, the Internet messaging service that is a sensation around Brazil. They trade updates about Zikas spread, information about microcephaly, reports that the authorities may provide subsidies of about $220 a month to poor families with microcephalic babies, and even the occasional joke to lighten up the mood.

One of the mothers in Salvador, 420 miles south of Recife, has begun composing poems about microcephaly that she distributes among the WhatsApp group. One of her writings, Microcephaly Is Not the End, resonated so much with Ms. Soares that she recites it when the mood in her house starts to darken:

Do you know what prejudice is?

Its something that wont affect us

Because we are here

To fight for our angels

Trudging Forward

Mr. Amorim says he is too busy trying to make ends meet to dwell on their misfortune. When he gets home from work, he surfs the web for welding jobs, wondering whether it makes sense to apply for openings in distant Mozambique, a Portuguese-speaking country in southern Africa.

Despite the findings of dozens of medical tests, he said he still held out hope that Guilherme does not have microcephaly, pointing out that his head circumference is at the upper limit of the range for the condition.

Its not that I dont accept him, he said. But in my mind, he is normal.

While adapting to the challenges and costs of raising Guilherme, the couple are also trying to stave off eviction. The shipyard is trying to repossess their house on the grounds that Mr. Amorim did not work long enough to take full ownership of the property. The couple have joined dozens of other families in a lawsuit, claiming that Brazils real estate laws allow them to stay in their homes.

Built in less than a decade, their subdivision and surrounding areas of Ipojuca already exhibit the strains of age.

Some in the California subdivision have put up towering walls around their homes to protect against break-ins. Motorists navigate through potholes on streets buckling under the equatorial sun. Graffiti tags on some homes speak to the fraying of the neighborhoods aspirations.

From their porch, Ms. Soares and Mr. Amorim can glimpse the flickering of the flare stack at the oil refinery in the Port of Suape that cost nearly $20 billion to build, about eight times original estimates. Like so many other ambitious projects begun in Brazil during the boom, it was never completed.

RE: N.Y.P.D.









Saki Knafo detailed the struggle of Edwin Raymond, an N.Y.P.D. officer who thought he could change the department from the inside but instead became the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit brought by 12 minority officers contending that racially based arrest quotas have persisted throughout the department.

What a well-written and riveting article about Edwin Raymond. Thank you for telling his story and shedding light on what he is trying to do. I found myself enthralled, impressed and furious all at the same time. Raymond is brave and driven; we need more men and women like him serving our city. Its a shame the N.Y.P.D. is caught in its own backward ways and is not more willing to champion change, especially as we continue to see the stressed and violent relationship between the police and citizens across this country. I hope Edwin Raymond will prevail and that his story inspires others to speak the truth and champion their cause in the hope of making New York City, and this country, a better place. Hannah Grace Miles, New York

As racial relations continue to be at the forefront of discussion over police interaction with members of the community, it is imperative to acknowledge accountability on both ends. The police departments approach to building trust among black and Hispanic New Yorkers by recruiting more minority police officers is offensive and does not address the underlying issues.

Minority members of the community are both consciously and subconsciously distrustful of policemen because of the undeniable history of prejudice practiced toward them. The recruitment of minority policemen into poor, minority neighborhoods only represents a lack of awareness and a refusal to acknowledge the unfair treatment of minorities within the criminal-justice system. Jasmine N. Jones, New York

The Edwin Raymond article made my blood boil after reading about the unjust and sclerotic bureaucracy thrown against a black police officer of exemplary integrity and dedication to his oath as a guardian of the public. If a cop like Raymond is barred from serving the public effectively, no system from the departments executive suites will make any difference in relations with the community and its residents views toward cops.

Yes, Officer Raymond, you are correct: The system needs to change, and what you are doing is not only right, it is in the interest of millions of law-abiding New Yorkers. History makes clear that change hardly ever comes easily, but courageous people give us hope and engineer change.

I come from a long line of New York cops, beginning with my grandfather and continuing with my father and my uncle. I dont know about my grandfather, who died in 1922, but my father and uncle were blatant bigots. (My father argued with me 48 years ago about this countrys need for George Wallace as president, but Im glad to say his views moderated significantly before he died.) Racism was pungent then; it still stinks. Richard J. Olive, San Rafael, Calif.

Saki Knafos profile of officer Edwin Raymonds desperate push to bring some reform to the N.Y.P.D. was yet another harsh reminder of how entrenched racist oppression is in America. Sadly, the racism even infected the article. Casually referring to Chancellor Williamss The Destruction of Black Civilization as a work of Afrocentric history diminishes by pigeonholing. If someone were reading J. M. Robertss celebrated History of the World, would The Times have tossed off a reference to it as a work of Eurocentric history? I strongly doubt it.

The destruction of black civilization, principally at the hands of Europeans, is history. It is thus both morally and factually correct to cite it as world history. Neil Hartbarger, Silver Spring, Md.

RE: ON MONEY

Adam Davidson considered the effect of technological advances on the improvement of an average persons material condition, citing the economist Robert Gordons claim that there have been just a handful of truly transformative innovations in the past 200 years.

While I agree with Adam Davidsons skepticism regarding the pessimistic conclusions in Robert Gordons book, I was amazed by his comment that no presidential candidate in 2016 is offering an expansive, optimistic vision of the future. As a political junkie who has been looking for a candidate in this cycle who reflects my hope for economic progress, I have been strongly attracted to Marco Rubio largely because of his frequent espousal of just such a possible future. While I have not yet decided to support him, he articulates some of the same points that Davidson made, so I can only conclude that Davidson was unfamiliar with his economic arguments or rejected him because of other aspects of his political philosophy.

Situated on a narrow barrier island, Shishmaref was founded over 400 years ago as a seasonal fishing settlement. Cold weather and natural ice barriers used to protect the shore, but now the municipal village, home to some 600 residents, faces the immediate threat of inundation.

A recent study noted that Alaskas glaciers have lost some 75 gigatons of ice every year from 1994 to 2013. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, Alaska has been heating up twice as fast as the national average over the last 50 years, and the rising temperatures melt sea ice and thaw permafrost along the coast.

Frozen ice used to form natural barriers that protected Shishmarefs shores from powerful storm surges in autumn. But rising tides now threaten the remainder of an eroded coastline.

We hear about climate change and we hear about foreign countries like Moldova or some such island that is sinking and its all very remote and nebulous, Mr. Taradji said. The Alaska folks are here in the United States. They are folks on our team that are immediately threatened. Its not something that is going to happen in several generations, it is something that is happening to them right now as we speak.

Photo

Residents of Sishmaref were so alarmed by the tides that in 2002 they voted overwhelmingly in favor of relocation. Yet few have budged. Mr. Taradji went there to photograph how the villages residents are coping with climate change, staying at the local high school because he said it was the only building with running water.

After talking to the residents, whom he described as divided between elders and a new generation, he didnt find much urgency about the need to move.

I felt a sense of what can we do about it?  he said. A sort of resignation and wait-and-see attitude and hoping for the best from the older people I spoke with. There are not many options. Moving costs money, and the situation is a Catch-22 sort of thing.

Photo

Mr. Taradjis project is centered on people. Each day he would wake up, have breakfast with the schoolchildren, then walk around the village and ask people if he could photograph them.

I had seen many photos of the falling house and the erosion and videos about the erosion, he said. I wanted to show what it is all about. Erosion without people being affected is irrelevant. I wanted to show the people who are actually impacted by climate change.

He photographed 26-year-old Andrew Ningealook, a lifelong resident of Shishmaref, breaking the ice to dip his fishing net underneath (Slide 1). He photographed the mayor, Howard Weyiouanna, at home as he was getting ready to attend a City Council meeting. He photographed residents playing bingo, which he says is a favorite  if expensive  pastime, in which players can win as much as $1,000.

Funds are still needed for relocation. Although the Army Corps of Engineers has taken steps to set up a rock revetment, it is only a temporary solution, and the government has not decided on the villages new location.

Additionally, moving could cost hundreds of millions of dollars, an obstacle for other threatened villages in Alaska, too.

Mr. Taradji said part of the resistance to moving is that Shishmarefs residents have ancestral and cultural ties to the land.

They have their own culture and art and ways to work the food, he said. Its understood, for example, the way they work the seal oil is the best. So all this is threatened by the fact that their home will disappear in a near future.

Kurt Sutter swung the ax on his own series, opting to end The Bastard Executioner after its debut season, which concluded on Tuesday.

The show runner announced the end of the FX show, a swords-sandals-and-revenge drama set in 14th-century Wales, in an ad that appeared in outlets including Variety and The Hollywood Reporter. It read, in part: The audience has spoken and unfortunately the word is meh. So with due respect, we bring our mythology to an epic and fiery close.

The show was Mr. Sutters followup to Sons of Anarchy, his popular motorcycle gang drama that ran on FX for seven seasons.

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Mr. Sutter acknowledged the complexity and expense of shooting a period drama in Wales, with elaborate sets and horses.

But the bottom line was the bottom line: The show ended because it did not draw enough ratings. It debuted in September to around four million viewers but lost roughly half of its audience within six weeks.

I dont want to write something that nobodys [expletive] watching, he said.

The decision to end the show was made in consultation with John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX Networks, but the timing and delivery of the cancellation announcement was Mr. Sutters call. The advertisement, which thanks the cast and crew members, was about letting folks know what a great experience I had, and how proud I was of them, Mr. Sutter told The Hollywood Reporter. He notified them in advance, he said.

Executioner starred the Australian theater actor Lee Jones as a former soldier and farmer impersonating a punisher, for a variety of reasons. There was also a mystical plot involving rival religious sects. I think the mythology was a little too dense for some people, Mr. Sutter said in the interview. Theres a glut of period pieces on right now, and Im sure timing has something to do it.

Mr. Sutter is developing a Sons of Anarchy spinoff about the Mayans, a rival gang in the show, among other projects.

Mr. Sutter also let fans know the show was ending via an Instagram post that read, in part: The final episode of The Bastard Executioner. Truths revealed. Love professed. Limbs severed. Bloody good end.",[]

I say, The doctors told me there is nothing they can do, it is inoperable and incurable,  says Wanda N., who is 50 and in hospice care at home in New York with metastasized colon cancer. When I tell people, I use the same words the doctors used to tell me. You might not have time or energy to formulate the exact right phrasing  but you are not obliged to be the town crier, spreading the news of a terminal diagnosis. Dont feel the need to announce your situation over and over again, says Wanda, who has told only a handful of people, including her father, a cousin and a few women from her Army veterans group. Some she told in person, others by phone or text.

Though everyone eventually dies, few know how to talk about the end of life. People dont know what to say, Wanda says. Theyre afraid. Be prepared for strange and stilted reactions. Some want to believe in a fix and will give you unsolicited health tips. (Dont eat sugar. Avoid gluten.) You can ignore their suggestions but acknowledge the heart underlying them. People may offer to pray for you. Prayers are good, but maybe what I need is someone to listen, Wanda says. For that type of engaged listening, you may need to seek out a professional, like a trained social worker or a psychiatrist. Sometimes people who know about your condition  those you tell will tell others  will pretend your situation does not exist. Or weirder still, they will temporarily forget. To all appearances, Wanda looks healthy, and occasionally the reality of her health slips peoples minds.

Know that these might be profoundly lonely, vulnerable months, when you need to conserve your energy. But in order for people to be there and provide help, you need to tell them. Dont expect others to step up, but give them a chance to. Wanda fondly recalls when a friend, unasked, bought her groceries and another friend delivered them to her apartment. Sometimes what you need, she says, is very small: someone to walk with you for five minutes outside the hospital in the sun.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,How Trump Could Be Blocked at a Contested Republican Convention,"['Larry Buchanan', 'Alicia Parlapiano']","Mr. Trump could lose support as delegates become free to vote as they please.

Most states bind their delegates to candidates based on primary results. But most delegates are released if no candidate wins a majority in an initial vote at the convention, so those who were bound to Mr. Trump could shift their support. This scenario is less likely if Mr. Trump is close to 1,237 delegates, or if he continues to face a split opposition.

First vote At least 5 percent of delegates are not bound to candidates and can vote as they please from the outset. Needed to win 95% bound to a candidate 5% unbound Did one candidate get a majority of delegates? Yes. Thats it. Hes the nominee. No. Move on to a second vote with some new rules. Second vote After the first round of voting, more than half of all delegates, from more than 30 states, become free. 43% bound to a candidate 57% unbound Did one candidate get a majority of delegates? Yes. Thats it. Hes the nominee. No. Move on to a third vote with some new rules. Third vote Many states with a large number of delegates (like California, with 172) release them before the third vote. 19% bound to a candidate 81% unbound Did one candidate get a majority of delegates? Yes. Thats it. Hes the nominee. No. Move on to a fourth vote with some new rules. This could go on for a while, but its very unlikely. It would be difficult to get through more votes without one candidate receiving a majority, because many states release their delegates early if candidates withdraw from the race or do not meet a certain vote threshold on the floor, preventing those with low support from remaining in contention.

An eight-state rule could come into play.

Currently, in addition to securing a majority of delegates, a candidate is required to win more than 50 percent of delegates in at least eight states to secure the nomination. Mr. Trump has already done so in five.

However, this rule, or any other, could be changed before the voting begins, putting candidates who do not win a majority in eight states into contention.

The people who are selected as delegates in the first place will be key.

Because delegates are free to vote for their candidate of choice once they are unbound, Mr. Trump and some of the other candidates have already begun organizing their supporters to get as many allied delegates as possible selected.",[]

Common-Sense Policing









Re Making policing safer for everyone (Opinion, March 3): It was heartening to read Chuck Wexlers and Scott Thomsons ideas about common-sense reforms to protect police officers and the civilians they encounter. Their reference to de-escalation tactics employed by the police in Britain demonstrates a welcome desire to bring those techniques to American communities for the benefit of all.

But their arguments, which focused largely on knife-wielding criminals, failed to draw the critical conclusion from the British example: The police in Britain can take the time to patiently de-escalate tense situations because they almost never encounter a gun-wielding civilian. If civilians didnt have access to such lethal weapons, the police would have the time and space to do their job properly, with far less fear for their own lives. Common-sense gun-control measures were passed in Britain in the 1980s and 1990s. Its time for the United States to follow suit.

Saving the Planet

Re Planet on the ballot (Paul Krugman, March 1): I enjoyed the column but could not help but find a fly in the ointment. There is a notional inaccuracy in maintaining that the fate of the planet is at stake. The Earth has survived the impact of large asteroids, years of total darkness and several ice ages. It will surely survive man-made global warming, as it has survived catastrophes of even greater magnitude. It has existed for billions of years, and it could surely last for another few billion, even if mankind manages to make it uninhabitable for humans or other life forms. What is at stake right now is not the fate of the planet but the fate of humanity.

Science and Sexual Harassment

Re Why women quit science (Review, March 5): As a scientist and the father of two daughters who hopes that all women interested in STEM will be able to pursue a scientific career, I read the article with great interest. But to my disappointment, its conclusion is flawed.

The central thesis is that science and academia are rife with sexual harassment and that women are quitting their positions mainly to stop being harassed. However, it is well known that sexual harassment exists everywhere, not just in STEM. If the author were correct, women would also be quitting their positions in commerce, law, the arts, sports, manufacturing, teaching, medicine, etc. But thats not the case. The proportion of women in professional occupations has been increasing for decades.

The only way to defend the authors argument would be to demonstrate that in science, in particular, there is either a higher incidence of sexual harassment, or that women scientists are more vulnerable to predatory males than in other professions. I doubt very much that that is so. All people  women as well as men  are equally dependent on the bosss good will, whatever their profession.

Merkels Next Job?

Re Why Angela Merkel could lead the U.N. (Opinion, Feb. 17): The United Nations is passing through an existential crisis, its wings clipped by its largest donors, like the United States and Russia. Unless the organization is freed from its shackles, it will be difficult for any secretary general to function independently.

Its true that Angela Merkel would be an ideal candidate to head the United Nations, considering her contributions to the European Union and her stupendous efforts to address the refugee crisis in the face of strong opposition in Germany. However, her successes are mainly due to the tremendous good will she enjoyed in that country. The question is whether the United Nations will provide a platform for her to make independent decisions, without being unduly influenced by the members of the Security Council, who have maintained a virtual grip on the organization.

THURSDAY PUZZLE  Heres what can happen when your mother eagerly signs you up for music lessons when youre a child and you dont pay attention: You grow up to be a crossword puzzle blogger, responsible for explaining the puzzle to a large number of people, and then you wind up solving  or rather, not solving  a crossword that incorporates music notation theory as part of the theme. Its like one of those stress dreams we all have, but this is for real.

Somewhere in Florida, my mother is laughing her behind off.

This is as good a time as any to admit to you that I had to look at the answers to crack the theme. That is not as bad as it sounds; who amongst us has not revealed an answer here or there? No one, thats who, and that is a good lesson for all you beginning solvers out there. Dont feel that you cant take a peek if you think youll learn something from it. That knowledge is stored away for the next time you will see it in a puzzle. Streaks be damned. [Cleans off the remains of the tomatoes thrown at me.]

Sidenote: I originally thought this puzzle was going to be a commentary about footballs DEFLATEGATE and that the black squares in the lower center of the grid represented goalposts. You see how misdirected you can get on a Thursday?

Anyway, if, unlike me, you did not fall asleep in music theory class, you will recognize that there are supposed to be two musical notes in three of the squares of Andrew Zhous mirror symmetry puzzle. Each note is used once: one note for the Across entry and one note for the Down entry. For example, at 16 Across and 6 Down, we have the respective entries MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY and THE SHARPER IMAGE. Where the two entries cross, we have the two rebus elements: F NATURAL going across and E SHARP going down.

And because you havent had enough agita for the day, all of the notes are different. If you are solving this on the web or in our app, please note that the accepted entries are supposed to be either the entire entry (either Across or Down) or the first letter. So, for 16 Across and 6 Down, the accepted answers should be F NATURAL, F, E SHARP or E.

As a public service, I would like to present you with the six theme entries:

16A/6D: MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY / THE SHARPER IMAGE

65A/53D: LOOKING SHARP / GET A FLAT

66A/55D: DEFLATEGATE / CARD SHARP

In addition, Mr. Zhou has thrown in some long Downs that highlight the theme, MUSICAL NOTE and TWO TONE CARS (sort of). For my money, One added to the staff? also wins Clue of the Day.

Constructors Notes:

A couple of months back, Evan Birnholz espoused his theory that music and crossing words have much to do with one another. Ive always thought that a good crossword works like a piece of Bachian counterpoint, in which both the vertical (harmony) and the horizontal (melody) are required to maintain absolute integrity. In that spirit, todays puzzle puns in the form of ENHARMONIC spellings, wherein the same sounded pitch (in equal temperament) is notated in two different ways. I hope it offers a significant contribution to the canon of musical puns, which includes beloved classics like, If you dont C-sharp, youll B-flat. Heres to a music-filled Thursday!

And that is why I failed to solve todays crossword puzzle, Officer. Please dont tell my mother.

We just have to move on to the Friday puzzle with this song:

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Biden Condemns Palestinian Violence in Implicit Rebuke to Abbas,['Isabel Kershner'],"JERUSALEM  Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.s two-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories was expected to be one of public pleasantries and private talks on regional energy and a new military aid package for Israel. Instead, he stepped into a bloody maelstrom.









In an unusually stinging critique on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said the United States not only deplored the recent wave of Palestinian attacks, including the fatal stabbing attack that killed an American graduate student soon after Mr. Biden landed, but America also condemns the failure to condemn these acts. It appeared to be a veiled reference to the silence of President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, whom Mr. Biden was scheduled to meet hours later.

Mr. Biden made the pointed statement as he stood beside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, one day after a Palestinian man fatally stabbed Taylor Force, 28, an American combat veteran and a first-year M.B.A. student at Vanderbilt University, and wounded several other tourists and Israelis.

Let me say in no uncertain terms: The United States of America condemns these acts and condemns the failure to condemn these acts, Mr. Biden said, adding: This cannot be viewed by civilized leaders as an appropriate way in which to behave.

Mr. Netanyahu said that unfortunately President Abbas has not only refused to condemn these terrorist attacks, his Fatah party actually praised the murderer of this American citizen as a Palestinian martyr and a hero.

Palestinian leaders blame growing popular anger over Israeli policies and the lack of any formal peace process for the violence.

What is happening today is a Palestinian reaction to Israels occupation and the lack of any political horizon, Hanna Amira, a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, told Voice of Palestine radio before Mr. Bidens meeting with Mr. Abbas in the West Bank city of Ramallah.

Mr. Bidens visit came against the backdrop of simmering tensions between the government of Mr. Netanyahu and the White House: Mr. Netanyahu canceled a meeting with President Obama and there are unresolved differences over a new Memorandum of Understanding for military aid for Israel, potentially worth more than $40 billion over 10 years.

The package is viewed as a way to compensate Israel after the United States pressed for the nuclear deal with Iran over Israeli objections. But there are gaps between Washington and Jerusalem over the amount of aid and other issues, and Mr. Netanyahu recently suggested that he might prefer to wait for the next president. Mr. Biden urged the Israelis to sign the memorandum while Mr. Obama was still in office, the Israeli news media reported, citing unidentified Israeli officials.

Israeli experts say that both sides now have an interest in wrapping up the deal as soon as possible, citing American budgetary constraints that are unlikely to change and the volatile situation in the Middle East.

A new administration will take many months until people get settled into their offices, said Zalman Shoval, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, and there is always an element of continuity anyway.

Mr. Biden said that the Obama administration had done more to help bolster Israels security than any other administration in history, and that it was committed to ensuring that Israel can maintain its qualitative edge militarily and will have the resources to do so.

The spike in deadly attacks in recent months, including multiple stabbings Tuesday night along a seaside promenade in Jaffa, where the American graduate student was killed, highlighted the tense environment that exists in the absence any political negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Israelis fear that the lack of diplomacy could push Mr. Obama to lay down the outlines of an agreement for the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel in the final leg of his term without talks.

The status quo has to break somewhere along the line, in terms of a two-state solution, Mr. Biden said in Jerusalem, cautioning that security measures alone would not stop the violence.

Even though it may be hard to see the path ahead, we continue to encourage all sides to take steps to move back toward the path of peace, he added.

Mr. Netanyahu made it clear that he did not think this was the time to advance Palestinian statehood, citing the persistent incitement in Palestinian society that glorifies murderers of innocent people and calls for a Palestinian state not to live in peace with Israel, but to replace Israel.

Palestinian shootings and knife attacks continued on Wednesday. Two Palestinian men in a car fired shots in a Jerusalem suburb, according to the police, then drove to a bustling thoroughfare outside the Old City, where Israeli police officers fatally shot them. A resident of East Jerusalem was also badly wounded. Soon after, a teenage Palestinian assailant tried to stab Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint in the occupied West Bank and was killed at the scene.",[]

Thousands more from around the world tuned in to livestreams and watched as the distant daytime skies darkened.

Those who viewed the event from places like Indonesia or Micronesia saw the moon completely engulf the sun  a moment known as totality  and caught a rare glimpse of the stars roaring corona. They also saw what looked like a diamond ring when light from the sun flickered from behind the moon in the seconds before and after totality.

When the moons shadow swept across the Pacific Ocean, it also created partial eclipses visible from India, Cambodia, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Myanmar and other South and Southeast Asian countries. Here are some images from the spectacle:

Photo

About a week before he used the national political stage to ask viewers to think about Donald Trumps finger size, Marco Rubio told the audience during another recent Republican presidential debate to Google Donald Trump and Polish workers. They did.

The worry is no longer about who controls content. It is about who controls the flow of that content.

Rubio wanted voters to see news stories about Trump illegally hiring undocumented Polish workers more than 35 years ago to demolish a building to make way for Trump Tower. Searches for those terms, and the fraudulent Trump University, shot way up. It was like a public version of the now ubiquitous phenomenon of everyone whipping out smartphones to verify a disputed fact at a party or meeting. Not that it did much good in this case; as numerous commentators have noted, Trump and many of his supporters dont seem particularly worried about minor annoyances like facts. (For the record, PolitiFact, which checks the veracity of politicians statements, judged Rubios charge to be half true.)

Nonetheless, Rubios Google gambit and Trumps (non)reaction to it, reveals an interesting, and troubling, new change in attitude about a philosophical foundation of democracy: the ideal of an informed citizenry.

Political thinkers have long claimed with Jefferson that, An educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free people. The idea is obvious: If citizens are going to make even indirect decisions about policy, we need to know the facts about the problem the policy is meant to rectify, and to be able to gain some understanding about how effective that policy would be. In the larger sense, if we are going to decide who runs the country  and we are, if you think the electoral college allows for that  we need to know the facts about the candidates records.



This is one reason philosophers have always been worried about the ebb and flow of information, and who controls it. Plato argued in The Republic that the fact that democracies couldnt control that flow and point it toward truth was one reason they often dissolved into tyranny. In a different vein, Noam Chomsky argued in the 1980s that consent was being manufactured by Big Media  large consolidated content-delivery companies (like this newspaper) that could cause opinions to sway one way or the other at their whim. Knowledge is power; capture it and you capture power in a democracy.

Now in print The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments An anthology of essays from The Timess philosophy series, published by Liveright.

The political importance of information  and the fear that it can be manipulated  has not changed. What has changed is how we are informed about politics or anything else, or how we arent. The Big Media that worried Chomsky 30 years ago is largely a thing of the past; many of the largest newspapers are gone, and others are shadows of their former selves. In the halcyon early days of the Internet, when we began excitedly exploring the information Garden of Eden, still free of the shadow of social media, it was easy to think that knowledge itself had become democratic, and that Platos worry had at last been shown to be bankrupt. But the worry hasnt gone away  it has just changed form.

The worry is no longer about who controls content. It is about who controls the flow of that content. It is no coincidence that we are now seeing Big Data companies like Facebook sponsor presidential debates. Nor is it a coincidence that people are increasingly following the election on social media, using it both as the source of their information and as the way to get their view out. Consent is still being manufactured, but the manufacturing is being done willingly by us, usually intended for consumption by other people with whom we already agree, facts or no facts.

It really isnt a surprise that Rubio would ask us to Google for certain facts; thats how you and I know almost everything we know nowadays  it is a way of knowing that is so embedded into the very fabric of our lives that we dont even notice it. What else could Rubio ask us to do to fact-check Trump? We used to say that seeing is believing; now Googling is believing.

Of course, in many ways following that norm  Google it!  can help us realize the Jefferson ideal of an informed citizen I sketched above. That ideal, recall, emerges out of the simple fact that reasonable action requires knowledge, and reasonable political action requires political knowledge. And Google places more politically important information at our fingertips than ever before. So if the ideal of being informed means having more information available for uptake, there is a case for saying that we are now closer than ever to realizing that ideal. That is behind the thought, commonly voiced in the early part of this century, that the Internet has democratized knowledge.

The Internet is both the worlds best fact-checker and the worlds best bias confirmer  often at the same time.

The problem of course is that having more information available, even more accurate information, isnt what is required by the ideal. What is required is that people actually know and understand that information, and there are reasons to think we are no closer to an informed citizenry understood in that way than we ever have been. Indeed, we might be further away.

One reason for thinking so is that searching the Internet can get you to information that would back up almost any claim of fact, no matter how unfounded. It is both the worlds best fact-checker and the worlds best bias confirmer  often at the same time. Group polarization on the Internet is a fact of digital life. Liberals friend liberals and share liberal-leaning media stories and opinions with them; conservatives friend conservatives, and do the same.

And the flow of digital information is just as prone to manipulation as its content  even when that flow is directed at an audience larger than our own immediate circle. Take an example: Search for what really happened to the dinosaurs and one of the top results is likely to be from a site called answersingenesis.org  not, I suggest, a good source of information on the T-Rex. But it illustrates how canny use of search engine metrics can be used to push an agenda. No wonder Trump and his followers on Twitter immediately shrugged off Rubios inconvenient truths; there is nothing to fear from information when counterinformation is just as plentiful.

Thats why the real worry here isnt about the regrettable if obvious fact that citizens are less informed than our ideals demand. Nor is it simply the amusing specter of candidates shouting competing Googling instructions at the audience like so many carnival barkers. The real worry concerns our faith in the ideal of an informed citizenry itself. That worry, as I see it, has two faces.

Related More From The Stone Read previous contributions to this series.

First, as Jason Stanley and others have emphasized recently, appeals to ideals can be used to undermine those very ideals. People on both the left and the right tell one another that the information is right there; people just arent paying attention to the facts (Google it!). The very availability of information can make us think that the ideal of the informed citizen is more realized than it is  and that, in turn, can actually undermine the ideal, making us less informed, simply because we think we know all we need to know already.

Second, the danger is that increasing recognition of the fact that Googling can get you wherever you want to go can make us deeply cynical about the ideal of an informed citizenry  for the simple reason that what counts as an informed citizen is a matter of dispute. We no longer disagree just over values. Nor do we disagree just over the facts. We disagree over whose source  whose fountain of facts  is the right one.

And once disagreement reaches that far down, the daylight of reason seems very far away indeed.

nytimes.com,2011-06-26 00:00:00,Monday: Celebrity Guest Solver Joel Stein,"['Joseph Samulak', 'Deb Amlen']","Administrivial Disappearing Comments Update: My apologies for the disappearing comments. Ive found them, and wouldnt you know, theyre always in the last place you look. A new system had been put in place and it was sending some of the comments on walkabout. After an epic battle, in which I wielded both power tools and my magic bullet-proof bracelets, that system has been shut down, so we should be back to normal. Thank you for your patience.

MONDAYS PUZZLE  When I started the regular Celebrity Guest Solver feature here at Wordplay, my intent was twofold: I simply wanted to bring something special to the blog, but I also wanted to show people who are afraid to tackle The New York Times crossword that even people of note can have trouble with it, yet with enough support, encouragement and a certain amount of threatened public humiliation, they, too, could work the puzzle. And without fail, they have all come through brilliantly for me. No one will ever accuse these people of not having a rocking sense of self-preservation.

That is also mostly the case with todays Celebrity Guest Solver, TIME magazine contributor Joel Stein. When I first approached him, Mr. Stein seemed a bit nervous about being able to do the puzzle, as he isnt a regular solver. I do find it interesting, though, that he jumped on the chance to be a guest blogger, and I dont even think its because the man is habitually desperate for attention and owes me money. No, I would like to cling to the belief that he, like much of humanity, appreciates the challenge of climbing new mountains and that pushing the limits of what we can do is what separates us from the other species. Plus, its an easy way to pay off a debt.

Even so, Mr. Stein is one funny attention-mongerer. Not only did he supposedly survive being fired twice in one day by Martha Stewart at the beginning of his career (or so people used to say; now he claims they made that up and that the woman is far too busy canning jelly to fire someone more than once), but he has also graced VH1s I Love Whatever Decade You Tell Me I Love. In the midst of all this, he still finds time to write some pretty hilarious stuff and he would also like me to mention that he once taught a humor-writing class at Princeton. Yes, the University.

Todays puzzle is a debut by Joseph Samulak, and hopefully you wont be dizzied by it: the circled letters not only mix it up, but they also appear to go around like the wheel on a cassette tape, dont they? In fact, thats exactly what Mr. Samulak has intended, and he reveals that at 37 Across with the entry MIX TAPE. Not only that, but the four entries that contain the circled letters are all new entries. Well done, Mr. Samulak.

You can read more about Mr. Stein at his Web site, but before we run out of space, I will turn it over to him:

Joel Steins Solving Notes

I did not expect this rush of power. When I agreed to attempt to solve this puzzle, I had no idea I would be getting it early. Embargoed. Not for publication. I had something all the New York Times puzzle-solvers wanted: A puzzle days before it came out.

I get to see screenings of movies weeks early and get sent books months before their publication date. But this was better. This was something I could use to taunt my friends who do the N.Y.T. crossword puzzle.

My friends who do the N.Y.T. crossword puzzle are horrible people. (No theyre not; hes just bitter because he didnt finish the puzzle.  D.A.) They are people who like to think and be challenged and spend their free time improving themselves instead of watching TV, searching for porn and checking how many friends they have on Facebook. They are superior people. And now they would suffer.

My friend Matt Selman once met a postdoc English student who, when Matt told him he writes for The Simpsons, instantly said he didnt watch TV. When Matt asked what he worked on, and the guy said he just wrote a book about Thomas Pynchon, Matt got to say, I talked to him on the phone today, since hed just recorded Pynchon for the show. (Full story here: http://techland.time.com/2009/09/08/true-tales-of-conversational-vengeance/).

Thats how I felt e-mailing the embargoed crossword puzzle to all of my horrible friends. I was saying, I write a juvenile sophomoric column, largely about my penis, and, for this, I got the N.Y.T. crossword puzzle before you.

Heres what I didnt figure:

People who do the N.Y.T. crossword puzzle are not status-desperate like me. They get their satisfaction from being intellectually superior. So instead of being impressed, my high school friend Art Chung smugly e-mailed me less than ten minutes after I sent it to him and said, Done. 7 Across is something we used to do in high school. My smug friend John Sellers simply said, Mondays are too easy. My mother-in-law, Hope Barry, smugly said, Do you need help???? You know Im there for you. Worse yet, Dan Okrent  who is in that smug movie about crossword puzzles that I refuse to see  sent me back a smug form e-mail saying he wasnt checking his inbox because he was at some smart people place like Marthas Vineyard or Davos or the Constitutional Convention.

I have not finished the puzzle. I dont know who Robin Hoods compadre is, who the tiger in The Jungle Book is or the five-letter word that means Brilliance that probably starts with an EC and ends with AT. And Im not asking any of those people who e-mailed me. Thats what they want. And Im well aware that all the stuff I dont know is from books meant for children. I get it. I dont need Jeff Foxworthy to point it out.

It took me 30 minutes to not finish this puzzle. All I learned is that oxen wear YOKEs and that people in New York put sour cream on their TACOS, which is disgusting.

I dont know why some NFL linemen are RGS or what that means. I dont know why the letters T A P and E are in circles. Im guessing the puzzle-writer is trapped somewhere and is trying to send me a secret message about his location. Which I dont care about. Hes probably smugger than Okrent.

O.K., theyve all come through brilliantly for me except for Joel Stein. Thanks for playing anyway, dude. And you still owe me.

nytimes.com,2015-04-05 00:00:00,"The Sympathizer, by Viet Thanh Nguyen",['Philip Caputo'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The more powerful a country is, the more disposed its people will be to see it as the lead actor in the sometimes farcical, often tragic pageant of history. So it is that we, citizens of a superpower, have viewed the Vietnam War as a solely American drama in which the febrile land of tigers and elephants was mere backdrop and the Vietnamese mere extras.









That outlook is reflected in the literature  and Vietnam was a very literary war, producing an immense library of fiction and nonfiction. Among all those volumes, youll find only a handful (Robert Olen Butlers A Good Scent From a Strange Mountain comes to mind) with Vietnamese characters speaking in their own voices.

Hollywood has been still more Americentric. In films like Apocalypse Now and Platoon, the Vietnamese (often other Asians portraying Vietnamese) are never more than walk-ons whose principal roles seem to be to die or wail in the ashes of incinerated villages.

Which brings me to Viet Thanh Nguyens remarkable debut novel, The Sympathizer. Nguyen, born in Vietnam but raised in the United States, brings a distinct perspective to the war and its aftermath. His book fills a void in the literature, giving voice to the previously voiceless while it compels the rest of us to look at the events of 40 years ago in a new light.

But this tragicomic novel reaches beyond its historical context to illuminate more universal themes: the eternal misconceptions and misunderstandings between East and West, and the moral dilemma faced by people forced to choose not between right and wrong, but right and right. The nameless protagonist-narrator, a memorable character despite his anonymity, is an Americanized Vietnamese with a divided heart and mind. Nguyens skill in portraying this sort of ambivalent personality compares favorably with masters like Conrad, Greene and le Carre.

Duality is literally in the protagonists blood, for he is a half-caste, the illegitimate son of a teenage Vietnamese mother (whom he loves) and a French Catholic priest (whom he hates). Widening the split in his nature, he was educated in the United States, where he learned to speak English without an accent and developed another love-hate relationship, this one with the country that he feels has coined too many super terms (supermarkets, superhighways, the Super Bowl, and so on) from the federal bank of its narcissism.

The narrators acrobatic ability to balance between two worlds is his strength and weakness, as he makes clear in his opening lines:

I am a spy, a sleeper, a spook, a man of two faces. Perhaps not surprisingly, I am also a man of two minds, . . . able to see any issue from both sides. Sometimes I flatter myself that this is a talent, he continues, but I wonder if what I have should even be called talent. After all, a talent is something you use, not something that uses you. The talent you cannot not use, the talent that possesses you  that is a hazard.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

And a hazard it proves to be.

The protagonists narrative, which takes the form of a confession written to a mystery man known as the commandant, begins in the final days of the war, as Communist forces close in on Saigon. The narrator is aide-de-camp to the general (one of several characters who, like the narrator, is never identified by name), the chief of South Vietnams National Police and, with it, of Special Branch, the secret police.

But the narrator is also a mole, a Communist undercover agent assigned to keep tabs on the general and Special Branchs activities. His closest friend is Bon, an assassin with the C.I.A.s Phoenix program, a genuine patriot who volunteered to fight after Communists murdered his father for the crime of being a village chief. The narrators North Vietnamese handler, Man, is also an old chum. Indeed, the narrator, Bon and Man were high school classmates, who in their youth melodramatically swore allegiance to one another by becoming blood brothers. This complex relationship, with the narrator in the tenuous middle, riven by conflicting loyalties, is a recipe for tragic betrayals, and those come, one after the other.

Working through a C.I.A. spook named Claude, the narrator dispenses liberal bribes to engineer an air evacuation to the United States for the general, the generals wife and their huge extended family. Bon is also to be lifted out with his wife and child. The narrator wants to stay and take his place in a reunified Vietnam, but Man, convinced that the general and his cohort will plot a counterrevolution from abroad, gives him a new mission that is an extension of his old one: Your general isnt the only one planning to keep on fighting, he explains. The wars been going on too long for them to simply stop. We need someone to keep an eye on them.

Nguyen presents a gripping picture of the fall of Saigon, its confusion, chaos and terror, as the narrator flees with the others under a storm of shellfire from his Viet Cong and North Vietnamese comrades. Bons wife and child are killed before their plane takes off, giving him two more deaths to avenge.

This rich narrative stew is assembled in the novels first 50 pages, then set on a low simmer. From that brief, intense beginning we proceed to a picaresque account of the narrators experiences as a refugee-cum-spy in Los Angeles. He lands a clerical job with his former professor, has an affair with an older Japanese-American woman and sends messages to Man (written in invisible ink) via an intermediary in Paris. Here the novel becomes both thriller and social satire. If you like your humor written in charcoal, this is the funniest part of the book, though its occasionally spoiled by zingers that belong on The Daily Show more than they do in a serious novel.

The narrators espionage activities lead him to make a foray into the movie business. He is hired by a director, the auteur (who bears a resemblance to Francis Ford Coppola), to round up Vietnamese in a Philippine refugee camp to work as extras in his film (which bears a resemblance to Apocalypse Now). Nguyen adroitly handles the shifting tones of these episodes, now hilarious, now sad, as the narrator tries to do what Nguyen has done: de-Americanize the portrayal of the war. But, unlike Nguyen, he fails.

Thereafter, the books mood darkens. The narrator falls into a web of deceit and treachery spun by his dual role and the schisms in his soul. Mans suspicions prove accurate: The general and some other die-hards, guilt-ridden for not fighting to the death, bored with their mediocre lives in the States (the general has become owner of a liquor store), plot a counterrevolutionary invasion with the help of a right-wing congressman.

The narrator assists in the planning, while sending reports to Man. However, to avoid having his cover blown, he is compelled to take part in two assassinations. One victim is an ex-Special Branch officer, the crapulent major, the other is a Vietnamese journalist at a California newspaper. The descriptions of the murders are tense, psychologically complex, riveting. The narrators conscience becomes as torn as the rest of him. Remorse over the crapulent majors death was ringing me up a few times a day, tenacious as a debt collector, he thinks.

(A parenthetical quibble. Good as it is, The Sympathizer is sometimes marred by overwriting. Lines like this  The waiters arrived at that moment with the solemnity of Egyptian servants ready to be buried alive with their pharaoh, platters with the main courses propped on their shoulders  appear a bit too often.)

The general eventually assembles a ragtag army of former South Vietnamese soldiers, armed and funded by the Americans. Man, kept abreast of the scheme, orders the narrator to remain in the States even as this army heads back to Asia, but he is once again rent by divided loyalties. He feels he must go to save Bon, his blood brother, from dying in what hes sure will be a suicide mission. He finds himself caught in his familiar dilemma, with no idea how I would manage to betray Bon and save him at the same time.

The blood of friendship is thicker than the water of ideology. The narrator joins the generals army. What happens to it is predictable; what happens to the narrator and Bon is anything but. I dont want to give anything away, except to say that in its final chapters, The Sympathizer becomes an absurdist tour de force that might have been written by a Kafka or Genet.

As that narrative unfolds, the protagonist makes several startling discoveries, among which is the identity of the commandants own boss, the commissar. Under interrogation, the narrator goes temporarily insane; but in his madness he achieves a new mental clarity. He sees that the revolution for which hes sacrificed so much has betrayed him and everyone who fought for it  as revolutions are prone to do.

Even the people who call the shots must admit that the fruits of victory are rotten, and the narrator in turn must recognize this joke, about how a revolution fought for independence and freedom could make those things worth less than nothing.

But that revelation produces an insight that saves him from complete despair: Despite it all  yes, despite everything, in the face of nothing, he writes at the end of the confession that is this book, we still consider ourselves revolutionary. We remain that most hopeful of creatures, a revolutionary in search of a revolution, although we will not dispute being called a dreamer doped by an illusion. . . . We cannot be alone! Thousands more must be staring into darkness like us, gripped by scandalous thoughts, extravagant hopes and forbidden plots. We lie in wait for the right moment and the just cause, which, at this moment, is simply wanting to live.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,A Brief Visit With My Inner Diesel,['Jon Caramanica'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In the back of the new Diesel flagship on Madison Avenue, near the jeans bar, which breaks down the companys offerings into various cuts (Slim? Sure. Tapered? Fine. Carrot? Ummmmmm.), there is a small museumlike display paying homage to the brands long-running wrestling match with denim.









Here are clothes from the 1980s and 1990s, ones in which the fabric is manipulated, distressed, cut up, accessorized, pushed to its emotional breaking point (if denim had a heart). You look down from these pieces, encased in glass on the wall, to the Diesel jeans of today and find that the war on denim is very much alive.

In fairness, we are in an era of distressed jeans, when the average pair has sacrificed 20 to 40 percent of its front material, leaving a topographic map of cutouts and frayed edges. In the space of the last decade, we have gone from utilitarian denim to premium denim to art denim.

Or at Diesel, all of these things at once, together, and manque.

In the 1990s, Diesels Lexington Avenue location was an amusement park of European slickness, moto kitsch and soft fashion aspiration. The brand offered a starter kit for those ready to graduate from streetwear or, you know, regular clothes, but not ready to submit to adulthood. Babys first tight-cut shirt almost certainly came from Diesel. Same for babys first treated denim.

Photo

Back then, Diesel made clothing for wayward foreign exchange students spending their parents money on bottle service and foam parties. Now, though, Nicola Formichetti is in charge. He has been the brands artistic director since 2013. By all accounts, he has a sense of humor, of color, of freedom.

And yet Diesel remains irreparably Diesel. I made my way there one recent afternoon, a field trip into the heart of gaucheness. If there was ever a right day to wear my black En Noir x Gap hooded jacket made of waxed denim and leather, this was it.

What I found was a Madison Avenue store with West Eighth Street soul. The brand remains committed to its middle station, with selections that feel like shrugged-off takes on whats happening farther up Madison: a Chelsea boot with a vertical zipper right through the elastic pulls ($290); a not-wholly-unappealing ivory patchwork sweater described on the label as being made with Italian Yarn ($198); a perforated black leather jacket with a loud sweatshirt-ish lining ($698); some sort of studded dog tag ($105).

The eyebrow arching extended even to the Diesel Black Gold collection, the companys premium line, which included a 13-pound heavily studded motorcycle jacket ($6,750) suitable for, perhaps, Flo Rida or John Cena or some other musclebound entertainer who needs to telegraph the most fashionable menace possible.

Back at the jeans bar, things were much the same. Our grandchildren will taunt us as the generation that allowed our jeans and our sweatpants to become one: Was everyone that lazy, Grandpa?

No, we werent. I tried on a couple of pairs to remind myself of my belief system, like a Bernie bro watching a few minutes of Fox News. The beige pair  $278!  made my unstubby legs look stubby indeed. The gray pair had biker-pants accents and hospital-scrubs fit.

But things got more complicated with the more familiar denim (the companys coin-pocket label is so familiar, it even adorns iPhone and iPad cases). It turns out the carrot pair fit beautifully; a pair in a dark, chalky gray ($198) was eminently appropriate.

And then I tried on one of the more molested pairs, with abrasions all over and black denim patches sewn into blue denim gaps. I looked ... good? The same went for a gray leather jacket in a finish that recalled acid-washed denim ($998) that I selected off the rack for its humor value and found myself unexpectedly attracted to.

Photo

All of us, we know there is a slightly tacky version of ourselves lurking within, an identity that a few wise turns in life have prevented us from having to own. Call it your inner Diesel: not a place I could live, but I didnt mind visiting.

Besides, sometimes that inner voice delivers surprise.

Years and years of experience fiddling with denim means youre likely to stumble upon new tricks before anyone else. There, in the front of the store, as part of the Diesel Black Gold collection, was such an item: a pair of preposterously long jeans, designed to scrunch and gather not just around the ankle, but up the full length of the leg ($450).

One of the mannequins wore a black pair. The legs looked like stacks of thin cookies. I felt compelled to try on a pair.

They were difficult to maneuver, both a logistical nightmare and almost an avant-garde disruption. They made Vetements sail-size clothes look eminently reasonable. They were so skeptical about form that they verged on Kawakubo territory.

They suggested expertise, and whimsy, and confidence  the product of a crafty veteran who has tried everything else, and then tears up the old playbook and tries to write a new one.",[]
nytimes.com,2015-04-10 00:00:00,"Lena Hall Rocks Out at, Yes, the Reserved Cafe Carlyle",['Stephen Holden'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Early in her Cafe Carlyle show on Wednesday evening, Lena Hall produced a tambourine and remarked that she might be the first performer to shake such an instrument in this staid cabaret, which until recently had avoided booking rock performers. But appearances there by Debbie Harry and Buster Poindexter, who have done good business, have signaled that the walls are crumbling.

Ms. Hall, who won a Tony in 2014 for her portrayal of Yitzhak in the Broadway revival of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, is an all-out rocker in the Robert Plant vocal tradition with strong echoes of Hearts Ann Wilson. Paradoxically she exhibited the discipline of a Broadway performer who doesnt miss a note. Despite the feral cries that came out of her, at no point in her show did you feel that she was pushing the boundaries and surrendering control. The personality behind the wild woman pose was polite but warm.

Therein lies the contradiction of rocking out in New Yorks most elegant supper club. As uninhibited as a performer pretends to be, the gracious environment in which well-dressed patrons play kissy-kissy serves as a behavioral brake. Her excellent band, led by Watt White on guitar and featuring John Deley on keyboards, Lee Nadel on bass and Brian Fishler on drums, played music that was impeccably arranged but scaled down.

Eardrums would not be shattered. There was not the remotest possibility of clothes being shed and tables overturned.

The far-reaching program concentrated on songs associated with the likes of Jack White, Led Zeppelin, Tori Amos, Talking Heads, Queen, Nirvana, Elton John, David Bowie, Paul McCartney, Hozier and Erykah Badu. For the quietest selection, the Blind Faith ballad Cant Find My Way Home, Ms. Hall peeled off the rough vocal edges to adopt a sweeter sound, but the plaintive wail of Steve Winwoods original vocal was absent. For all her attitude, Ms. Hall conveyed little strong emotion beyond a desire to demonstrate an impressive vocal expertise.",[]

When I moved to Brooklyn in 1999, Id never heard of Greenpoint  a working-class Polish community out past Williamsburg with questionable subway access  before the apartment broker sold me on it. My landlords lived upstairs, among clear vinyl tablecloths and a shrine to Pope John Paul II. I ate bigos, a savory, tart stew cooked so long that its many meats fell to nearly spreadable shreds, and incredibly cheap pirogi in fluorescent restaurants, where I would laugh in amazement at how much pork and potatoes five bucks could get you. I walked around my new neighborhood, looking into shops filled with sacks and sacks of rye bread and hundreds of sausages dangling in the windows, wondering how long it would take me to learn all their names.









I wanted to be a part of the community, to integrate, but I never became anything more than an interloper. The cold looks I sometimes got on the street confused and bothered me, until I realized that I wasnt just a new neighbor, that by paying more in rent than the families around me, Id made living in Greenpoint just that much more expensive for them. I realized those fluorescent dining rooms were populated mostly by single men, men whod left their families back in Poland while they tried to make some money in America. I realized that, when I was amused by those massive plates of food, Id never really thought about how hungry Id be if I spent the day building furniture, or moving it, as many of them did. By the time I moved away a couple of years later, I hadnt learned the names of any of the sausages.

So I was glad, a few weeks ago, when Monika Woods showed me how sweet her life in the old neighborhood had been. Woods also landed in Greenpoint when she first arrived in New York City, about half a dozen years after I left. With her stylish, oversize glasses, she might also be taken for an outsider. But she moved to the neighborhood because she was born in Poland and missed hearing strangers talk to one another in Polish; because the first restaurant she went to used the same plates her grandmother kept in Poland.

Woods agreed to show me how to make her moms bigos, and we ambled to her favorite meat market. Walking the main drag of Manhattan Avenue, she pointed out the places that always transported her back to Poland: an entire shop devoted to her favorite brands of Polish candy; a storefront completely obscured by its selection of Polish bottled waters; a store that carried Polish beers that are hard to find even in Warsaw. She pointed to a liquor store that once featured live bunnies and chicks in an adorable Easter window display. Shed come back a few weeks later and asked what happened to them. To eat, she remembers the owner saying, with Old World matter-of-factness.

But her Greenpoint is changing, in the way I think my old neighbors feared. The candy shop now sits empty, for rent. The restaurant that had her grandmothers plates closed; next door is a new location of an Anthony Bourdain-approved Chinese noodle shop. When we walked by a hip new restaurant, the kind whose dishes feature swooshes of purees and swipes of sauce, we noticed an odd postscript on the menu: Owned and operated by residents of Greenpoint.

The story of gentrifying communities is always about the dynamic between the new and the old, the outsiders and the insiders, but that friction is palpable when you feel as if you need to stake your claim to the neighborhood on your restaurants menu. Its funny, Monika said. I moved away a few years ago, but now, when I come back with my baby and go to a cool coffee shop, the people look at me like: Great. Here come the stroller people. There goes the neighborhood. 

Inside the Polam International Meat Market, though, you could easily be convinced that nothing had changed on these blocks for decades, and that nothing should. There were curtains of smoked sausages, tray upon tray of unidentified cured, smoked, roasted, poached, emulsified, rolled, cased, cubed, caul-fatted meats. Its a museum of meats, and just 20 minutes inside the store will leave your clothes smelling of salt and smoke for hours. That old pang of wanting to know what all this stuff was hit me, and when the kindly counterwoman offered to slice some chicken-and-parsley sausage for me, I thought it might not be too late to start finding out.

We bought ribs and wonderfully smoky kielbasa, and, back in my kitchen, Woods showed me her mothers method for a bigos that marries butter-soft cabbage with the tense pop of sausage in its skin. Hours later, I supped on silky broth rich with fat and gelatin, kept lively by tart sauerkraut and the sweet, almost floral taste of caraway. What should have served eight was just enough for my brother and me. Woods didnt have any, though  it turns out that she doesnt eat meat. But she wanted to show me what a proper bigos is like, from the inside.

You go to Indiana, its hard to imagine you wont run across a basketball court. Theyre like Starbucks there, only it may be easier to get a seat at Starbucks.

Indiana is known as a place where basketball is sort of like the sport, said Michael E. Keating, a photographer. Its kind of like the religion. If basketballs a religion, then the gymnasiums  theyre the places where people worship. Theyre the churches, the temples.

For the past several years, Mr. Keating and his colleague Chris Smith have crisscrossed the state, traveling more than 10,000 miles and photographing more than 100 school gymnasiums. There is no lack of choices. People in Indiana, as anyone who saw the 1986 movie Hoosiers knows, view basketball the way Southerners view football. Texas can keep its Friday night lights. Nine of the countrys 10 biggest high school gyms, the photographers say, are in Indiana.

They both say the appeal is not really the basketball. Were there for everything that surrounds the game, Mr. Keating said.

Mr. Smith said, We like to have people in the gyms. But for the photographers, its fine if it is just a practice or even a graduation. When there was some kind of activity, he said, the gyms kind of came to life.

Photo

The project began when Mr. Smith ran across a hand-tinted photograph of his father in an old team photograph and wanted to learn more. A longtime commercial photographer who also teaches photography to college students, he reached out to Mr. Keating, who had retired from The Cincinnati Enquirer after decades as a general assignment photographer. Both men are 63.

Their backgrounds are reflected in their approach to their work. Mr. Keating, Mr. Smith said, is drawn to emotion, while he tends to try to capture something a little less fleeting. Each has learned from the other.

I envy how he sees, Mr. Keating said. Because my whole training, my whole emphasis for so long was on a moment.

Getting good shots can be challenging, in part because the light in gyms is not always cooperative, Mr. Smith said. And lets face it: Not every church is Chartres, and not every gym is inspiring.

Some gyms, Mr. Keating said, choosing his words with a diplomats care, just are not interesting.

But for these two photographers, a dull gym is the exception.

Donald Trump seemingly had a tough week. He faced an onslaught of attacks from his competitors, Mitt Romney and outside groups. He suffered an upset loss in Maine and nearly lost Louisiana and Kentucky, two states where he was expected to fare well. Polls showed him slipping nationally.









But the results on Tuesday suggest that Mr. Trump remains in a strong position, at least as long as the field remains divided. He carried Michigan and Mississippi by healthy margins and later won in Hawaii.

His opposition did not become as strong as he might have feared after Ted Cruzs performance on Saturday, either.

The results look a lot more like the race we had on Super Tuesday: a double-digit advantage for Mr. Trump, who holds an edge in a three-way race, rather than the close race suggested by new national polls.

Trump Holds

After a barrage of attacks, tight races last weekend and weak national polls on Tuesday, Mr. Trump faced a question: Was he fading?

His strong finish Tuesday night was a clear answer: No.

Photo

In Michigan he currently holds 37 percent of the vote, neatly in line with the 36 percent of the vote we estimated he would receive based on the results on Super Tuesday.

Mr. Trump has 47 percent of the vote in Mississippi, well above the 42 percent we had estimated. (One caveat: Theres reason to think 42 percent was a low estimate. Other models based on Super Tuesday results suggested Mr. Trump should have received around 45 percent of the vote.)

We had him at 26 percent in Idaho, and he wound up with 28 percent. He won the Hawaii caucus with 46 percent of the vote with 60 percent of the precincts reporting.

These figures are consistent with Mr. Trump holding around 38 percent of the vote nationwide, with a comfortable lead over Mr. Cruz. It looks nothing like the much-discussed NBC/WSJ poll Tuesday, which showed Mr. Trump leading by just three points with 30 percent of the vote.

Kasich and Cruz Gain, at Rubios Expense

Marco Rubio cleared 18 percent of the vote in every primary state on Super Tuesday.

He hasnt reached that number since.

With virtually no one noticing, his support seemed to collapse ahead of the contests on Saturday, and Tuesdays races confirmed it.

Mr. Rubio won just 5 percent of the vote in Mississippi and 9 percent in Michigan  his two worst showings in a primary this cycle. Its even worse than his result in New Hampshire, right after a terrible debate performance and in a much larger field.

Both John Kasich and Mr. Cruz benefited  but who benefited most depended on the location. They appear to be divvying up the Rubio vote by ideology and region, with Mr. Cruz consolidating conservative voters in the South and Mr. Kasich gaining among more moderate voters in the North.

The result was that Mr. Cruz fared quite a bit better in Mississippi  along with Louisiana on Saturday  than he did in neighboring Alabama on Super Tuesday. He also won the Idaho primary later Tuesday night.

But Mr. Cruz did not make nearly as many gains in Michigan. There it was Mr. Kasich who benefited most from Mr. Rubios voters, who are presumably more moderate than they are in the South. Mr. Kasich wound up in a tough fight for second place.

It sets Mr. Kasich up to fare well in his home state of Ohio next week, where polls show a tight race.

The Challenge for Anyone but Trump

The results since Super Tuesday suggest that Mr. Trump holds around 38 percent of the vote nationally, a number that could allow him to amass a majority of delegates in a three-way race.

But they also suggest that he really does have a ceiling: His support hasnt increased, even as other candidates have left the race or faltered. The polls say the same thing.

The collapse of Mr. Rubio makes it even harder to imagine that hell manage to squeak out a win in his home state, Florida, where polls have consistently shown Mr. Trump with a lead.

Mr. Kasich might win Ohio, but even if he does, Mr. Trump could amass a majority of delegates without it. Mr. Trump could conceivably benefit if Mr. Kasich stayed in the race, by preventing Mr. Cruz from consolidating the anyone but Trump vote.

Even if Mr. Kasich loses Ohio, he might still stay in the race. His strength in blue states suggests he could be a more formidable challenger to Mr. Trump in many of the states that remain than Mr. Cruz, who has struggled to compete outside the South and conservative caucuses. It also seems unlikely that Mr. Kasich would leave the race if Mr. Rubio did, since there would be a large opening among well-educated, relatively moderate Republican voters.

But even the exit of Mr. Rubio would not necessarily be enough for Mr. Kasich to overtake Mr. Trump in the relatively blue states that remain. For instance, Mr. Kasich and Mr. Rubio did not combine to win as many votes as Mr. Trump did in Michigan.

The results, in other words, point toward a three-way race in which Mr. Trump might still have a narrow edge.",[]

Terence Blanchards jazz-inflected opera, Champion, based on the true story of a boxer who threw a fatal punch after being taunted about his sexuality by a rival, and Jake Heggies Dead Man Walking, based on Sister Helen Prejeans memoir about working on death row, will be staged next season at Washington National Opera, the company announced Tuesday.

Its season will begin Sept. 22 with James Gaffigan, the chief conductor of the Lucerne Symphony Orchestra, making his company debut leading a production of Mozarts The Marriage of Figaro. The bel canto tenor Lawrence Brownlee will star in Donizettis The Daughter of the Regiment, Ermonela Jaho and Hei-Kyung Hong will alternate in the title role of Puccinis Madame Butterfly and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the Supreme Court will join the companys artistic director, Francesca Zambello, for an evening exploring justice at the opera.

The Kennedy Centers season will also feature the Mariinsky Ballet dancing Alexei Ratmanskys The Little Humpbacked Horse, San Francisco Ballet performing Christopher Wheeldons Cinderella, visits by New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theater and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and two evenings programmed by Justin Peck and Misty Copeland.

In Noah Baumbachs recent movie, While Were Young, Josh and Cornelia, aging Generation X Brooklynites (played by Ben Stiller and Naomi Watts) who are desperately trying to reclaim their youth, are struck by what passes for home decor in the Bushwick loft of their new, painfully on-trend young friends Jamie and Darby (Adam Driver and Amanda Seyfried).









Along with the familiar hipster household cliches (the electric typewriter, the wall of vinyl records), the young couple proudly displays a Reagan-era library of movies on VHS tapes, along with a shelf of music cassettes.

Its like their apartment is full of everything we once threw out, Cornelia says with an air of wonder.

The tech detritus of the 1980s and 90s is finding a second life as a new generation of artists, designers and geek-nostalgists is repurposing the early-digital-era flotsam of its youth as art, home decor and jewelry, along with plenty of irony-laced kitsch.

Think of it as the next evolution of retro-chic style. Self-conscious analog style may have owned the last decade, at least among tastemakers in shuttle-loomed denim with their vintage phonograph players, typewriters and mechanical watches.

Photo

But as the children weaned on Nintendo and Napster mature to the point that they suffer occasional fits of cultural nostalgia, the disposable plastic junk of their youth may finally be ready to have its due.

Were just to the point where we can look back at the VHS tape and realize how cool it was, said Erika Iris Simmons, a 31-year-old Chicago artist who works under the name Iri5, fashioning portraits of luminaries like Jimi Hendrix and Marilyn Monroe not with a brush, but with swirls of tape from old audio and VHS cassettes.

To Ms. Simmons, cassette tape recalls a more physical, tactile association that children of the 80s and 90s once had with their gadgets; she remembers knowing how to blow into her Nintendo game cartridge just so, to get it working when it would not load. We all have that shared experience of interacting with the technology that you dont get to know with MP3s, she said.

In a similar vein, Chris McCullough, 40, a Los Angeles architectural designer who creates art for his spaces, renders portraits of cultural icons like James Brown using audiocassettes like mosaic tiles. Not only are discarded cassettes inexpensive and abundant, he said, but they resonate with audiences his age.

Cassettes represented the first popular portable music medium you could share and personalize yourself, Mr. McCullough said, before services like Spotify made music ever disposable.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

(While cassette tapes are technically analog, they reached their cultural zenith in the early digital era of the 80s, just as PCs were entering the mainstream.)

Old Nintendo peripherals themselves can also function as art, or at least eye-catching home decor. Jeff Farber of Oshkosh, Wis., sells pop-art-style desk and floor lamps fashioned from vintage PlayStations and Nintendo 64s and the like on his Etsy shop Woody6Switch, which are intended to celebrate an era when gadgets, even cheap plastic ones, had a certain staying power.

When I was a kid, technology advanced much more slowly than it does today, Mr. Farber, 36, said. Like a beloved pet, you took care of it and it gave you joy and entertainment for many, many years.

By contrast, he added, todays technology advances and upgrades are so fast that a device you buy today can become virtually obsolete in a matter of months, so there is no real time to fall in love with it the way you could in those golden years of video game infancy.

There is certainly no shortage of the stuff. As the life cycle of the average electronic gadget shrinks to a virtual eye blink, the mountains of electronic trash continue to rise, expected to surpass 70 million metric tons this year, from about 19 million in 1990, according to a 2014 report by Step, a United Nations-affiliated sustainability initiative. Except in unusual cases  like the story last month about a Bay Area woman dumping a rare Apple I computer from the 1970s worth $200,000, apparently by accident, at a recycling facility in Milpitas, Calif.  few look at that trash heap and see treasure.

But that has started to change. While some regard the so-called upcycling of old gadgets into picture frames or planters as an ecological gesture, others see it as a celebration of shared technological heritage.

Jake Harms, 31, who lives in Hildreth, Neb., started a business recycling old iMacs into aquariums and desk lamps in 2007 after a boss directed him to toss an outmoded iMac G3.

The candy-colored, egg-shaped desktop computer, introduced in 1998 as one of Steve Jobss first iconic pieces during Apples late-90s comeback, seemed too lovely to toss, Mr. Harms reasoned. So after some online research, he decided to turn it into a computer fish tank (a longstanding hobby for some techies), and has since sold more than 1,000, he said.

To Mr. Harms, the iMac is functional art, like a classic car. And just as a 1960s Ford Mustang may not make an ideal daily drive but is great for a weekend cruises, an old computer may not run current software, but make some modifications and it makes a pretty sweet aquarium or lamp, he said.

Apple products created early in the reign of Jonathan Ive, the companys design guru since 1996, are a natural for reuse as household objects since many were hailed as classics from the outset. For example, Lonnie Mimms, a Georgia real estate executive who owns a collection of vintage computers he values at more than $1 million, recently staged an Apple Pop Up Museum in a former CompUSA store near Atlanta.

Other die-hards have fashioned discarded eMacs into pet beds, G4 towers into mailboxes, G5 towers into outdoor benches and G4 Cube computers into tissue boxes.

The customer base for these upcycled products tends to be narrow and self-selective.

Theyre geeks, theyre nerds, said Rob Connolly, a retired Floridian who, with his partner, Rita Balcom, makes intricate wall clocks and desk clocks out of old hard drives and motherboards. A few years ago, for example, their company, Tecoart, which sells on Etsy and Amazon, filled an order for 2,400 such pieces from Google, which passed them out as employee incentive awards, he said.

Not surprisingly, these techie hobbyists share their passion in online communities. One of the more popular forums is a D.I.Y. tech blog run by Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories, a family company in Sunnyvale, Calif., that produces open-source hardware. The site features tutorials on making earrings out of linear regulator chips, wine charms from capacitors and a wooden footstool in the shape of a classic 555 integrated circuit chip from the 70s.

Most of us are deep in the maker communities, said Lenore Edman, a founder, so these items are symbols of both our history and our knowledge.

Repurposed tech peripherals are also finding a higher-brow, arty audience.

Retro ironists who wish to express their tech nostalgia may consider the Pixelkabinett 42, a sleek handmade reinterpretation of the classic 80s arcade game cabinet by the Swedish artist Love Hulten. The limited-edition console contains a vintage computer board and costs about $4,200.

I want to push gaming into a new context, making the arcade cabinet an artistic equivalent to the painting on your wall, Mr. Hulten, 31, said.

Video games from the Fast Times at Ridgemont High era can also be found at major museums. Starting July 10, the Brooklyn Museum will present Deluxx Fluxx Arcade, an electric Kool-Aid urban-art reinterpretation of a Missile Command-period video arcade by Faile, a Brooklyn-based art duo formed by Patrick McNeil and Patrick Miller, and Bast, another New York artist.

This latest iteration of the installation, which has also been shown in London and Miami, is part of a larger Faile show at the museum, and comprises 14 vintage game cabinets painted in collaged imagery and Day-Glo patterns, and reprogrammed with smirky, interactive games that satirize gentrification, pollution and parking in Brooklyn.

In the past, the artists have described the piece, which was shown at Art Basel Miami Beach in 2013, as a reflection of the art worlds fixation on ideas of relational aesthetics and democratization.

But there is an undeniable element of Gen X nostalgia at work, too.

It celebrates and builds on the loss of these somewhat sacred spaces we found growing up going to arcades at the mall, Mr. Miller, 39, said. You could be a hero or a villain in these spaces and be transformed in the games before walking back out into the normal, and sometimes boring teenage, world.",[]

Though you can still see the recesses in the walls where the hinges of the portals once hung, the Venice ghetto has not been a prison since Napoleon seized the city and tore down the gates in 1797. Today, no barrier or signpost marks where Venice ends and its ghetto begins. Cross a canal on an arched bridge, duck through a sottoportego (an alley tunneling through a building), disappear down a vent in the urban fabric  you come and go just like everywhere else in the maze of this island city.









But linger long enough in the Campo di Ghetto Nuovo, the generous, frayed, tree-flecked plaza that anchors this corner of Cannaregio (the quiet northwest quadrant of the city) and youll feel the wall of the past closing in. Half a millennium of history does not transpire without stamping the soul of a place.

Established by decree of Doge Leonardo Loredan on March 29, 1516, the Venice ghetto was one of the first places where people were forcibly segregated and surveilled because of religious difference. The term itself originated here; the area had been used as a foundry (geto in Venice dialect) and over time the neighborhoods polyglot residents corrupted the word to ghetto.

I traveled to La Serenissima in December to see how the city was gearing up for the anniversary of the establishment of the ghetto. A major exhibition called Venice, the Jews and Europe: 1516 to 2016 (on view from June 19 to Nov. 13) was being planned for the Ducal Palace, and during the last week of July, Shakespeares Merchant of Venice will be staged (in English) for the first time in the confines where its most hallucinatory scenes take place. Venice being Venice, there will also be glittering parties, celebrity-filled fund-raisers and fancy dress galas, starting with the invitation-only performance of Mahlers First Symphony at La Fenice opera house on March 29.

But in the course of my visit, what I became most curious about was the mood of the current Jewish community of 450 people. Venice is such an impossibly beautiful fantasy, it seems astonishing that ordinary people, Jews among them, actually live there. How, I wondered, did deep-rooted Jewish families feel about their past  and future  in this ancient, vulnerable city?

My first answer came inside the humble, rectangular sanctuary of the circa-1532 Scuola Canton, one of five synagogues still standing in the ghetto. The synagogues are open to the public only as part of guided tours offered by the Jewish Museum of Venice, and that morning just three of us (two other Americans and I) had signed up for the 10:30 tour in English. We were standing with our guide, Silvia Crepaldi, admiring the golden spiraling tree-trunk columns that support the arch over the bimah (podium), when the subject of rising sea levels came up.

The city will be empty before it sinks, Ms. Crepaldi said ruefully. Venice is shrinking before our eyes.

The urban exodus of both Jews and gentiles has been going on for some time, though the pace has accelerated in recent years.

When the ghetto was at its height in the 17th century, 5,000 Jews from Italy, Germany, France, Spain and the Ottoman Empire carved out tiny, distinct fiefs, each maintaining its own synagogue, all of them crammed into an acre and a quarter of alleys and courtyards. Confinement was a burden, but it also provided an opportunity for cultural exchange unparalleled in the diaspora. As Jan Morris, a Venice devotee and one-time resident, writes in The World of Venice, the city was a treasure-box full of ivory, spices, scents, apes, ebony, indigo, slaves, great galleons, Jews, mosaics, shining domes, rubies, and all the gorgeous commodities of Arabia, China and the Indies.

Photo

Jewish merchants and bankers were vital to the flow of these commodities, but as Venice declined, the Jewish presence dwindled. By the outbreak of the Second World War, Jewish Venice had shrunk to 1,200 residents. Today, with the citys total population hovering around 58,000 (down from 150,000 before the war), there are about 450 Venetian Jews left, only a handful of them residing in the ghetto.

So now the ghetto is just a shell? I wondered aloud as Ms. Crepaldi led us across the campo, over a bridge, down a street of intriguing-looking shops, and into a tighter, grimmer square (the Campiello delle Scuole or little square of the synagogues), flanked by the two Sephardic scuole.

The answer to my question was revealed inside one of these: the sumptuous Scuola Grande Spagnola (Great Spanish Synagogue), possibly the work of Baldassare Longhena, the renowned 17th-century architect of Santa Maria della Salute. After we had gazed our fill at the elliptical coffered ceiling and the black-columned pediment that frames the ark of the covenant; after we had craned our necks to glimpse the cherry wood balustrade and diamond-hatched panels that screen the upstairs womens gallery; after our eyes had bathed in the silver gleam of candelabra and the soft glow of crimson-curtained bottle-glass window panes, Ms. Crepaldi pointed to the brass plaques affixed to the pews. These are the names of families who pay to rent their own bench sections, she told us. These families still pray here. This synagogue is used in summer, and in winter they switch to the Scuola Levantina because its heated. The Venetian Jewish community may be small, but its still strong.

Calimani and Sullam  two of the surnames inscribed on those plaques  appeared in tiny letters by the buzzer I pressed at 10 oclock the next morning. Riccardo Calimani, the esteemed historian of Italian Jewry and the author of a book about the Venetian ghetto, had given me very precise directions to his home off the Strada Nuova (a rare rectilinear thoroughfare stocked with shops catering more to residents than tourists).

What Mr. Calimani had neglected to say in his email is that he lives in a palace: a light-bedazzled, soaring-ceilinged, art- and book-lined Renaissance suite overlooking the Grand Canal. As he ushered me into his princely study, the ample, urbane Mr. Calimani struck me as a kind of latter-day Jewish doge.

My fathers family arrived in Venice from the north of Italy in 1508, he said, slowing his Italian down to a tempo I could follow. My ancestor Simone Calimani was the author of a trattato morale [moral treatise], printed in the 18th century when Jewish publishing was flourishing here. My grandfather was the cantor in the Scuola Levantina, even though our roots are not Levantine but Italian and German. The Venetian history of the Calimani family, I realized, coincides almost exactly with the history of the ghetto.

The palace belongs to his wifes family, the Sullams, Spanish Jews who took refuge in Venice after the expulsion from the Iberian Peninsula at the end of the 15th century. I knew, from reading Mr. Calimanis The Ghetto of Venice (1988), that Italian and German Jews, the first and poorest to settle in Venice, had been consigned to selling rags and running pawnshops, while the great merchants of Venice were later arrivals from Spain and the Levant.

With tantalizing fragrances wafting out of the hidden kitchen and the velvety light of winter burnishing thousands of leather spines, I could practically taste the history that had made this room possible. The palace may be extraordinary, but the convergence of cosmopolitan currents in the Calimani/Sullam household is quintessentially Venetian.

Photo

Their families abandonment of the ghetto is also typical. As soon as the ghetto was abolished in 1797, Jews with means fled the high-rise tenements  the tallest buildings with the lowest-ceilinged apartments in Venice  for more elegant, and spacious, parts of the city. But the ghetto remained the anchor of Venetian Jewry. Since travel by gondola was deemed permissible on the Sabbath, the observant had no trouble floating back each week to pray at the scuola of their choice.

Today, the Jews of Venice, though still a proud (if dispersed) community, are invisible. (The black-garbed Hasids you see in the campo are not Venetian but followers of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement who have resettled here from other parts of Europe and the United States.) Mr. Calimani, like every local Jew I spoke to, said he moves unremarked in and out of Jewish circles. The Venice ghetto, he told me, was always more open to the city than the Roman ghetto, which was beset by the conversion mania of the church.

The dispersal of the community had the unexpected benefit of sending me into unfamiliar neighborhoods in pursuit of interviews. I had been in Venice twice before, but far from growing accustomed to its gorgeous strangeness, I found it endlessly fascinating just to thread the maze, and inevitably get lost in it, on my way to appointments.

The Airbnb my wife, daughter and I rented just off Campo SS. Giovanni e Paolo  the heart of Castello, a still quasi-authentic quarter of working families, schools, neighborhood bars and the municipal hospital  is perhaps half a mile as the crow flies from the flat of Donatella Calabi, a professor of urban history who curated the exhibition Venice, the Jews and Europe: 1516 to 2016. But even though Ms. Calabi had emailed me a map with arrows pointing the way, it still required several forays across the nearby Campo Santa Maria Formosa before I hit on just the right calle (street in the Venetian dialect).

No matter; it just gave me more angles from which to admire this perfect urban plaza with an austere whitewashed church rising in the center and a perimeter of magnificently crumbling palaces now occupied by restaurants, hotels, banks and the delightful 16th-century house-museum of the Fondazione Querini Stampalia.

As we sat by the windows of her top-floor apartment watching the dome of San Marco go gray against the December dusk, Ms. Calabi spoke with animation of the coming exhibition at the Ducal Palace. The ghetto provided an incredible occasion for cultural exchange she said, and the exhibit will focus on that exchange within the ghetto itself, between the ghetto and the city, and with the rest of Europe. Artworks including Carpaccios Predica di Santo Stefano (St. Stephens sermon) on loan from the Louvre, virtual reconstructions of the ghetto in various periods, and sacred books will conjure up the rich complexity of this exchange.

Ms. Calabi became more somber when the conversation turned to the present. Renaissance scholar Francesco Sansovino wrote that for the Jews, Venice was quasi una vera terra di promissione  practically a true promised land, she said. But today Jewish Venice is a small community within a small city. The 500th anniversary is an occasion not to celebrate  you dont have a festival for a ghetto  but to commemorate. An unbroken stretch of 500 years of history will not happen again soon.

I heard similar sentiments voiced later in the week at a packed meeting of an informal discussion group that gathers at intervals to consider issues pertinent to Venetian Jewry. The members had assembled that night in a pretty little house on a canal in Cannaregio near the Gesuiti Church, a Baroque pile that presides over a quarter once inhabited by artisans and artists (Titian and Tintoretto among them). My Italian, though not quite up to the rapid flow of ideas, was good enough to register the passion and erudition that these 30 or so men and women brought to a discussion of their deeply rooted community.

Amos Luzzatto, an esteemed Venetian-Jewish intellectual and the past president of the Jewish Community of Venice, was present, and we chatted for a few minutes about the small Jewish cemetery on the Lido, the beit midrash (study room) named for his family that is still in use in the ghetto, and the book by his renowned ancestor Rabbi Simchah Luzzatto that I had spotted in the Jewish Museum.

I didnt have a chance to ask Mr. Luzzatto how he felt about the state of the ghetto today, but as I picked my way back to SS. Giovanni e Paolo through deserted echoing alleys and over black filaments of water, I thought of a comment he had made in a recent interview posted on YouTube: The ghetto today belongs to the city of Venice  it does not belong to the Jews. The ghetto has become part of the panorama of Venice.

The panorama was its most ravishing the day I met Venices head rabbi, Scialom Bahbout, for lunch in the campo. Maybe it was the dazzle of another clear December day or the adrenaline of the holidays (Hanukkah was ending, Christmas still a week away), but the campo, which had struck me as rather forlorn on prior trips, now looked like a stage set waiting for a play. (In fact, this summers production of The Merchant of Venice will be staged right here, notes Shaul Bassi, a professor at the University of Venice who is spearheading the production.)

Mothers pushed strollers in and out of shadows cast by the teetering ghetto skyscrapers. Booted and scarfed Venetians clicked their heels across a bridge and disappeared into the inviting trattorias that line the fondamenta (bank) of the Rio della Misericordia canal. A small knot of tourists hovered by the entrance to the Jewish Museum, a charming warren of rooms stuffed with precious objects and books (and slated for a major makeover later this year under the aegis of Venetian Heritage, an international organization dedicated to preserving the citys cultural riches). I had just enough time before lunch to duck down an alley and browse the elegant Judaica pieces in glass and gold at Arte Ebraica Shalom.

The one jarring note was the makeshift police booth at the far end of the campo. Though there have been no attacks here, the booth is staffed around the clock by Italian police, rarely seen elsewhere in Venice, and the Jewish community has brought in its own private Israeli security guard. The juxtaposition of the armed police and the two Holocaust memorials (a series of bronze reliefs on either side of the Jewish old-age home that encloses one side of the campo) is apt. During the Nazi occupation, some 250 Venetian Jews, including its beloved chief rabbi Adolfo Ottolenghi, were seized from the ghetto and elsewhere in the city and sent to Auschwitz and a Trieste concentration camp. Eight returned.

The conversation touched only briefly on the Holocaust in the course of my leisurely lunch with the rabbi at Ghimel Garden, the popular kosher restaurant that opened recently beside the old-age home. Davide Federici, a local journalist, and the Venetian sculptor Giorgio Bortoli were present, and Rabbi Bahbout, who is highly regarded after two years in the community, seemed entirely in his element as the talk rambled around art, politics, history, cinema and food.

Did you know sarde in saor  sweet and sour sardines, a ubiquitous winter appetizer in Venice  is typically Jewish? the rabbi asked as the first round of plates appeared beside our glasses of prosecco. I was aware of the influence of ancient Jewish recipes on Roman cuisine, but it never occurred to me there was anything Jewish about the food of Venice, where shellfish (not kosher) figures in so many dishes. Id also never seen an Orthodox rabbi sipping prosecco.

By the time the pasta arrived, the conversation had moved on to the rabbis dream project: a Jewish university in Venice. The challenge today is to sustain the vivacity of our culture and carry it into the future. What better way than with an international Jewish university? In Venice today, conservation tends to dominate other concerns  but what we really need is to construct the next 500 years.

The rabbis American-born wife, Lenore Rosenberg Bahbout, joined us for pinza, a thrifty confection of stale bread and spice. We were chuckling about all the celebrities (Barbra Streisand, Donna Karan, Diane von Furstenberg, Barry Diller) whom Toto Bergamo Rossi, the charming director of Venetian Heritage, had tapped to fund the ghetto restoration project. Its wonderful, said Mrs. Bahbout. But it would be even more wonderful if this money could be used to restore the soul of the ghetto.

I contemplated the soul that Saturday morning, my last in Venice, at the Shabbat service in the Scuola Levantina. The high, dim sanctuary was about a quarter full, perhaps 40 men scattered around the benches that ran the length of the room between the massively carved bimah and the red-curtained ark of the covenant, with 15 or so women peering down at us from the upstairs gallery.

Photo

Id been in Venice less than a week, but already I recognized faces  Paolo Gnignati, the current president of the Jewish community; Elly, the strapping Israeli security guard who had warned no cellphones  theyre Orthodox! before letting me enter the synagogue; and of course Rabbi Bahbout, distinguished and elegant in his fedora as he chanted the Sephardic liturgy.

Every Venetian I spoke to, Jew and gentile alike, had expressed deep pessimism about the citys future. But as I sat in this sacred space in the hushed, carless city, listening to the Hebrew prayers and Italian murmur, I felt reassured, not discouraged, by the evidence of time. Since the ghetto was first established, doges, merchant princes, Shylock, Napoleon, the Austrians, the Nazis have come and gone (and in Shylocks case, will soon return). Through that half-millennium of history, Jews have gathered on Sabbath mornings like this one at the serene cusp of winter to pray and gossip in the Venice ghetto.

IF YOU GO

The website of the Jewish Community of Venice, veniceghetto500.org/?lang=en, has the latest information about events planned for the anniversary year. The Venetian Heritage Council, vh-council.org, is in charge of the coming restoration of the Jewish Museum and the ghetto synagogues.

Venice, the Jews and Europe: 1516 to 2016 will be on view at the Ducal Palace (veniceghetto500.org/la-mostra/?lang=en, Piazza San Marco) from June 19 to Nov. 13. Tickets are 19 euros (about $20) and can be purchased online.

The Merchant of Venice will be performed outdoors in the Campo di Ghetto Nuovo on July 26, 27, 28, 29, and 31, with a rain date on Aug. 1. The production, in English, is being staged through a partnership between Compagnia de Colombari theater company (colombari.org/#!home/c1pbl) and CaFoscari University of Venice. For tickets and further information, see themerchantinvenice.org.

The Jewish Museum of Venice is open from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Oct. 1 to May 31 and until 7 p.m. from June 1 to Sept. 30. Hourly guided tours of the synagogues (in Italian and English) start at 10:30 ( museum admission is 4; museum and synagogue tour is 10). The museum also offers tours of the Jewish cemetery on the Lido, with advance booking. Closed Saturdays and Jewish holidays. For more information, museoebraico.it/english/museo.html.

The Kosher in Venice website, kosherinvenice.com, lists kosher restaurants, hotels and food shops in the ghetto, including Ristorante Ghimel Garden, the recently opened Giardino dei Melograni guesthouse, and Panificio Volpe Giovanni, a bakery and grocery.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Hopping Freight Trains With the Dirty Kids,['Rena Silverman'],"If you combine the tinge of loneliness in Jimmie Rodgerss Waiting for a Train with the outcast mentality of Bob Dylans I Am a Lonesome Hobo, you might understand the millennial hippiedom of a group called Dirty Kids. Theyre not a band, but a self-proclaimed set of countercultural vagabonds: a new wave of nomadic, homeless youth traveling state to state hitchhiking, sleeping in cars and hopping on freight trains.

Last autumn, Emily Kask, a photojournalism student at Western Kentucky University, took a semester off to document  and become  part of the Dirty Kids family.

I had to panhandle, I had to eat out of Dumpsters, said Ms. Kask, 21. Everything that they had to do to survive, I had to do the same thing, too. They didnt cut me any excuses because I was a college kid or a journalist.

Her project started with a search for subjects on Hippie Hill in Christiana, Tenn., where the homeless can find temporary housing, comradeship and free expression. Contacts there led Ms. Kask to Southern Illinois, where she attended a rainbow gathering, a traveling convention that aims to inspire peace, love and community among multigenerational hippie types. It was there that she met Bambi, then 20, who had left her suburban home in North Carolina for the open road.

We were both kind of the same age, young women, Ms. Kask said. So I kind of felt at ease with her.

Photo

Bambi, who preferred to be identified by only her street name, had just parted ways with another group and was getting ready to learn how to hop freight trains with her friend Travis Sauter. Ms. Kask asked if she could come along. They agreed, and Ms. Kask drove them to Kentucky.

On arrival, Mr. Sauter, 41, was arrested over a prior panhandling incident, but Bambi and Ms. Kask continued with a new friend, Matt Johnson, or Smerph, who grew up in a family of train riders. He taught them the moves. Later the group met up with others, including Deverayn Armstrong, 26, who had been in and out of foster homes before taking to riding the rails.

Ms. Kask hopped on her first freight train  a gondola car full of scrap metal  near Bowling Green, Ky. She and the others got off in Nashville, about 65 miles away.

That is an exhilarating feeling, jumping on a train, Ms. Kask said.

Shooting it was a different story. She tried to use her Nikon D4 or smaller Fuji, but in the end many of her train photos were shot with her iPhone for safety.

Photo

There are two ways to get on a train, she said. You can either get on a side off or hop on the fly. When youre siding off, the trains going to stop for a little bit. That is the easiest way to get on. When youre hopping on the fly, you are going to wait for the train to slow down to a speed where you can get on. Thats different for everybody. I wouldnt be able to do it more than a couple miles per hour, but there are some kids who can do it up to 10.

Train hopping is hardly new to American society. Even before the Great Depression (think John Steinbecks Of Mice and Men), there was the post-Civil War railroad scene when war veterans, westbound drifters or migrant workers headed across the country via freight train.

I think it is absolutely this wild revolution, Ms. Kask said of the Dirty Kids. I think its this blend of these Great Depression train riders and the hippies of the 60s and 70s, and, I think its come to blend together with the millennials.

Mark Mattson, a neuroscientist at the National Institute on Aging in Maryland, has not had breakfast in 35 years. Most days he practices a form of fasting  skipping lunch, taking a midafternoon run, and then eating all of his daily calories (about 2,000) in a six-hour window starting in the afternoon.

Once you get used to it, its not a big deal, said Dr. Mattson, chief of the institutes laboratory of neurosciences. Im not hungry at all in the morning, and this is other peoples experience as well. Its just a matter of getting adapted to it.

In a culture in which its customary to eat three large meals a day while snacking from morning to midnight, the idea of regularly skipping meals may sound extreme. But in recent years intermittent fasting has been gaining popular attention and scientific endorsement.

It has been promoted in best-selling books and endorsed by celebrities like the actors Hugh Jackman and Benedict Cumberbatch. The late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel claims that for the past two years he has followed an intermittent fasting program known as the 5:2 diet, which entails normal eating for five days and fasting for two  a practice Mr. Kimmel credits for his significant weight loss.

Photo

Fasting to improve health dates back thousands of years, with Hippocrates and Plato among its earliest proponents. Dr. Mattson argues that humans are well suited for it: For much of human history, sporadic access to food was likely the norm, especially for hunter-gatherers. As a result, weve evolved with livers and muscles that store quickly accessible carbohydrates in the form of glycogen, and our fat tissue holds long-lasting energy reserves that can sustain the body for weeks when food is not available.

From an evolutionary perspective, its pretty clear that our ancestors did not eat three meals a day plus snacks, Dr. Mattson said.

Across the world, millions of people fast periodically for religious and spiritual reasons. But some are now looking at the practice as a source of health and longevity.

Valter Longo, the director of the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California, initially studied fasting in mice that showed that two to five days of fasting each month reduced biomarkers for diabetes, cancer and heart disease. The research has since been expanded to people, and scientists saw a similar reduction in disease risk factors.

Dr. Longo said the health benefits of fasting might result from the fact that fasting lowers insulin and another hormone called insulinlike growth factor, or IGF-1, which is linked to cancer and diabetes. Lowering these hormones may slow cell growth and development, which in turn helps slow the aging process and reduces risk factors for disease.

When you have low insulin and low IGF-1, the body goes into a state of maintenance, a state of standby, Dr. Longo said. There is not a lot of push for cells to grow, and in general the cells enter a protected mode.

Critics say that health benefits or not, various forms of intermittent fasting are too impractical for most people.

The 5:2 diet, for example, advocates eating without restrictions for five days and then consuming just 500 calories  roughly the equivalent of a light meal  on each of the other two days of the week. Another regimen, called alternate-day fasting, involves eating no more than 500 calories every other day.

A third regimen, which Dr. Mattson follows, is known as time-restricted feeding. The idea is to consume all of the days calories in a narrow window, typically six to eight hours, and fasting for the remaining 16 to 18 hours in a day. Studies of time-restricted feeding practices in both animals and humans have suggested that the practice may lower cancer risk and help people maintain their weight.

The scientific community remains divided about the value of intermittent fasting. Critics say that the science is not yet strong enough to justify widespread recommendations for fasting as a way to lose weight or boost health, and that most of the evidence supporting it comes from animal research. Advocates say the body of research on intermittent fasting is growing rapidly and indicates that the health benefits are striking.

The 5:2 diet, in particular, is backed by promising studies that show that it lowers weight and improves blood sugar, inflammation and other aspects of metabolic health, said Joy Dubost, a registered dietitian and a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the countrys largest organization of dietitians. She noted that fasting isnt appropriate for pregnant women, people with diabetes and people on medications.

Most people who do this understand that its not about binge eating, Dr. Dubost said. But they like that it gives them the freedom not to worry about calories, carbs and other restrictions on days when theyre not fasting.

Krista Varady, an associate professor of nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago, has studied the effects of alternate-day fasting on hundreds of obese adults. In trials lasting eight to 10 weeks, she has found that people lose on average about 13 pounds and experience marked reductions in LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, triglycerides and insulin, the fat-storage hormone.

Dr. Varady found in her research that intermittent fasting was easiest when people ate a moderately high-fat diet and were allowed to consume up to 500 calories on their fasting days. In her studies, 10 percent to 20 percent of people usually find the diet too difficult and quickly stop. Those who stick with it typically adjust after a rocky first few weeks.

Weve run close to 700 people through various trials, Dr. Varady said. We thought people would overeat on their feast days to compensate. But people for some reason, regardless of their body weight, can only eat about 10 or 15 percent more than usual. They dont really overeat, and I think thats why this works.

In 2011, Dr. Mattson and his colleagues reported a study of the 5:2 program that followed 107 overweight and obese women. Half of the subjects were assigned to eat no more than 500 calories each on two consecutive days each week. A control group was assigned to follow a low-calorie diet.

After six months, both groups had lost weight. But the intermittent fasting group lost slightly more  about 14 pounds on average  and had greater reductions in belly fat. They also retained more muscle and had greater improvements in blood sugar regulation.

Dr. Mattsons interest in intermittent fasting grew out of work on animals that showed that alternate-day fasting protected mice from strokes, Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease, and consistently extended their life spans by 30 percent. Dr. Mattson and his colleagues found that alternate-day fasting increased the production of proteins that protect brain cells, enhancing their ability to repair damaged DNA. Fasting, he said, acts as a mild stress that makes cells throughout the body stronger, shoring up their ability to adapt to later insults.

In this way, intermittent fasting is like exercise, which causes immediate stress and inflammation, but protects against chronic disease in the long run. Eating fruits and vegetables may have a similar effect. While very large doses of antioxidants can cause cancer in humans, moderate amounts of exposure can make cells more resilient, Dr. Mattson said.

There is overlap between the way cells respond to exercise, to fasting, and even to exposure to some of the chemicals in fruits and vegetables, he added.

Dr. Mattson is now starting a rigorous clinical trial of people 55 to 70 years old who are prediabetic and at high risk for developing Alzheimers disease. He plans to study whether intermittent fasting may slow cognitive decline.

Dr. David Ludwig, a professor of nutrition at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, said one benefit of fasting is that it forces the body to shift from using glucose for fuel to using fat. During this process, the fat is converted to compounds known as ketones, a clean energy source that burns more efficiently than glucose, like high-octane gasoline, Dr. Ludwig said.

The same process, known as ketosis, occurs when people go on extremely low-carb, high-fat diets. Dr. Ludwig said ketones seem to have unique effects on the brain. High-fat diets, for example, have been used for years to treat people who suffer from epileptic seizures.

There are extensive reports of children who had debilitating seizures who were cured on ketogenic diets, Dr. Ludwig said. If it benefits the brain to prevent seizures, then maybe it benefits the brain in other ways.

Dr. Ludwig noted that the long-term effectiveness of fasting had not been well studied. He cautioned that for many people, fasting is simply too difficult and may slow metabolism. A potentially more practical approach is to limit sugar and other processed carbohydrates, replacing them with natural fats, protein and unrefined carbohydrates, he said.

It takes a very disciplined person to skip a couple meals every day, he added.

But Dr. Mattson, who has been skipping meals for decades, said the adjustment to skipping breakfast and lunch was a lot like the change that occurs when a couch potato starts exercising.

If youve been sedentary for years and then you go out and try to run five miles, youre not going to feel very good until you get in shape, he said.  Its not going to be a smooth transition right away. It takes two weeks to a month to adapt.

Phys Ed Gretchen Reynolds on the science of fitness.

Some forms of exercise may be much more effective than others at bulking up the brain, according to a remarkable new study in rats. For the first time, scientists compared head-to-head the neurological impacts of different types of exercise: running, weight training and high-intensity interval training. The surprising results suggest that going hard may not be the best option for long-term brain health.

As I have often written, exercise changes the structure and function of the brain. Studies in animals and people have shown that physical activity generally increases brain volume and can reduce the number and size of age-related holes in the brains white and gray matter.

Exercise also, and perhaps most resonantly, augments adult neurogenesis, which is the creation of new brain cells in an already mature brain. In studies with animals, exercise, in the form of running wheels or treadmills, has been found to double or even triple the number of new neurons that appear afterward in the animals hippocampus, a key area of the brain for learning and memory, compared to the brains of animals that remain sedentary. Scientists believe that exercise has similar impacts on the human hippocampus.

These past studies of exercise and neurogenesis understandably have focused on distance running. Lab rodents know how to run. But whether other forms of exercise likewise prompt increases in neurogenesis has been unknown and is an issue of increasing interest, given the growing popularity of workouts such as weight training and high-intensity intervals.

So for the new study, which was published this month in the Journal of Physiology, researchers at the University of Jyvaskyla in Finland and other institutions gathered a large group of adult male rats. The researchers injected the rats with a substance that marks new brain cells and then set groups of them to an array of different workouts, with one group remaining sedentary to serve as controls.

Some of the animals were given running wheels in their cages, allowing them to run at will. Most jogged moderately every day for several miles, although individual mileage varied.

Others began resistance training, which for rats involves climbing a wall with tiny weights attached to their tails.

Still others took up the rodent equivalent of high-intensity interval training. For this regimen, the animals were placed on little treadmills and required to sprint at a very rapid and strenuous pace for three minutes, followed by two minutes of slow skittering, with the entire sequence repeated twice more, for a total of 15 minutes of running.

These routines continued for seven weeks, after which the researchers microscopically examined brain tissue from the hippocampus of each animal.

They found very different levels of neurogenesis, depending on how each animal had exercised.

Those rats that had jogged on wheels showed robust levels of neurogenesis. Their hippocampal tissue teemed with new neurons, far more than in the brains of the sedentary animals. The greater the distance that a runner had covered during the experiment, the more new cells its brain now contained.

There were far fewer new neurons in the brains of the animals that had completed high-intensity interval training. They showed somewhat higher amounts than in the sedentary animals but far less than in the distance runners.

And the weight-training rats, although they were much stronger at the end of the experiment than they had been at the start, showed no discernible augmentation of neurogenesis. Their hippocampal tissue looked just like that of the animals that had not exercised at all.

Obviously, rats are not people. But the implications of these findings are provocative. They suggest, said Miriam Nokia, a research fellow at the University of Jyvaskyla who led the study, that sustained aerobic exercise might be most beneficial for brain health also in humans.

Just why distance running was so much more potent at promoting neurogenesis than the other workouts is not clear, although Dr. Nokia and her colleagues speculate that distance running stimulates the release of a particular substance in the brain known as brain-derived neurotrophic factor that is known to regulate neurogenesis. The more miles an animal runs, the more B.D.N.F. it produces.

Weight training, on the other hand, while extremely beneficial for muscular health, has previously been shown to have little effect on the bodys levels of B.D.N.F., Dr. Nokia said, which could explain why it did not contribute to increased neurogenesis in this study.

As for high-intensity interval training, its potential brain benefits may be undercut by its very intensity, Dr. Nokia said. It is, by intent, much more physiologically draining and stressful than moderate running, and stress tends to decrease adult hippocampal neurogenesis, she said.

These results do not mean, however, that only running and similar moderate endurance workouts strengthen the brain, Dr. Nokia said. Those activities do seem to prompt the most neurogenesis in the hippocampus. But weight training and high-intensity intervals probably lead to different types of changes elsewhere in the brain. They might, for instance, encourage the creation of additional blood vessels or new connections between brain cells or between different parts of the brain.

So if you currently weight train or exclusively work out with intense intervals, continue. But perhaps also thread in an occasional run or bike ride for the sake of your hippocampal health.

nytimes.com,2015-12-17 00:00:00,Lanvin and Alber Elbaz: The Story of a Breakup,['Vanessa Friedman'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Even in a world inured to designer change, no one expected this.









Not the editors and retailers and friends who sat front row at the Lanvin womens wear show in Paris last October applauding the crisp tuxedo day looks, the shimmering jewel-toned cocktail frocks. Not Fashion Group International, a prominent industry organization that bestowed upon Alber Elbaz, the Lanvin artistic director, their Superstar Award three weeks later. Not Meryl Streep, who handed him his award while wearing Lanvin, noting, if what youve made me feel over the years is multiplied by all the other women whose lives youve enhanced, I think you should get this every year. And most all, not Lanvins own employees, many of whom cried when they got the news.

No one expected on a Wednesday morning in late October that Mr. Elbaz would be sitting at his home in Paris reading a letter from Lanvin telling him not to come into the office, because he had been fired.

And no one expected that not long after, the storied brand of Lanvin, the oldest French fashion house in continuous existence, would be in court, engaged in a very public airing of its dirty laundry.

I have never heard of anything like it, said Julie Gilhart, an independent consultant and former fashion director of Barneys.

The company is breaking up into two camps: the management on one side, the works council, the studio and the ateliers on the other, said a recently dismissed manager who would speak only on condition of anonymity because of pending legal action against Lanvin.

An erstwhile happy fashion marriage between a designer and a proprietor has turned into a very ugly divorce. And, like many divorces, it is now being played out in court  in this case, the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris, where on Wednesday, Judge Penelope Postel-Vinay ruled on an emergency procedure brought by management.

Lanvin executives had accused the Comite dEntreprise, a works council that functions as an intermediary between employees and executives, of abusing the internal communications network, fomenting unrest since Mr. Elbazs departure, and groundlessly alerting the board of directors to concerns about the company situation, especially its financial situation, and requesting an independent audit, and asked that such actions be halted. The judge found that the works council had behaved within its rights on the first two points and that the court did not have jurisdiction to suspend the right to alert. She further fined the company 3,000 euros, or about $3,285, and instructed them to pay all legal fees for the works council, though she did not grant the 20,000 in damages it had requested. Both sides (confusingly but not surprisingly) claimed a measure of victory.

Mr. Albaz and Lanvin executives all declined to be interviewed. But the public nature of the case means that, while this year alone has seen a plethora of designer moves  including Alessandro Michele replacing the fired Frida Giannini at Gucci and Peter Dundass jump from Pucci to Cavalli  the situation at Lanvin has lifted the mink-trimmed silk charmeuse skirt of fashion, exposing the costs of such changes for everyone involved: protagonists, employees and even consumers.

Everyone should pay attention, said Ralph Toledano, the chief executive of Puig fashion division and, as the former chief executive of Guy Laroche, the man who took Mr. Elbaz to Paris from New York in 1996, to be creative director of Laroche. It is a story of exactly what should not be done.

It is a story, mostly, about relationships  between individuals, between corporate and creative  and about the gap that can exist between public perception and private reality.

There is a truism in the fashion world that the most successful companies are built on a designer-chief executive pairing: Pierre Berge and Yves Saint Laurent, Valentino and Giancarlo Giammetti. This evolved, as fashion industrialized and globalized, into a team of creative director and chief executive officer(think Tom Ford and Domenico de Sole), watched over by the benevolent (or not so benevolent) eye of a majority shareholder, and became the model for the revival of fashion brands like Celine and Louis Vuitton. That was how Lanvins once-upon-a-time began.

The fairy godmother was Shaw-Lan Wang, a Taiwan-based Chinese-born former media mogul, who was part of a consortium that bought the then-largely wholesale men's wear and fragrance business of Jeanne Lanvin S.A. from LOreal in 2001, quickly taking control. That was when Mr. Elbaz, the former creative director of Yves Saint Laurent  fired from his post after three seasons when Gucci Group bought the company  asked for a meeting. It is time to awake the sleeping beauty, Madame Wang told Mr. Elbaz, according to a 2009 profile in The New Yorker. She cast him as her prince.

We were really starting from scratch, said Natasa Cagalj, currently creative director of Ports 1961, who worked closely with Mr. Elbaz at Lanvin from 2001 to 2005. We could hardly get any models for the first show. We joked we would have to get people off the streets of Paris.

By the second season, however, everything had changed. Mr. Elbaz began to establish the signatures that became trademarks of the house (as well as inspiring multiple copycats), from exposed zippers in the back to grosgrain ribbon trim and a love of what Virginia Smith, the Vogue market director, fashion and accessories, called a sense of imperfect beauty; the appreciation of the humanity found in a frayed edge. The press flocked in. Its one of the few shows I remember people practically dancing in their seats and clapping their hands, Ms. Smith said.

Paul Deneve, the president of Nina Ricci, joined as managing director in 2006 (previously Madame Wangs son had held that position), and they began to build the business. People would fight to get the brand in their stores, said Cecile Andrau, the sales director at the time, who eventually became executive vice president for Lanvin Inc.

Retailers bought it not only for their stores, they bought it for themselves: Marigay McKee, the former chief merchant of Harrods, says she has at least 10 black dresses in her closet; Ikram Goldman, the owner of the eponymous Chicago boutique, who bought the brand from Mr. Elbazs first season, said she also made purchases for my archives.

It was mesmerizing how fast that brand grew, Ms. Gilhart said. Barneys, she added, did our first million-dollar trunk show with Lanvin. They became an anchor brand on the second floor. The other anchor was Azzedine Alaia.

But that doesnt mean it was easy. Alber was a total workaholic, Ms. Cagalj said. The first to come, the last to leave. He cant stand mediocrity, and he was always challenging you. He called it Ping-Pong: the constant back and forth with the studio.

Bruno Frisoni, creative director of Roger Vivier, who worked with Mr. Elbaz during two seasons at Yves Saint Laurent (and worked at Lanvin in the 1980s, before Mr. Elbaz), had similar memories. He is exhausting to work with, he said. He never agrees to anything until the last minute, because of his level of perfectionism and passion. He gives you notes and notes and notes, not drawings or silhouettes, and can talk for hours about images and ideas.

Yet at the same time, the intensity was balanced by a humanity, Mr. Frisoni said. Mr. Elbaz was famous for sending flowers on birthdays, on births of babies, after funerals. He treasured the atelier, and they knew it, said Ms. Cagalj. Indeed, they stayed with him: In his speech at the FGI awards dinner, Mr. Elbaz referenced a seamstress who had recently retired at 61  after joining Lanvin at 17.

Love is a word that comes up a lot in relationship to Mr. Elbaz. Though fashion is famously fond of a comeuppance and a sotto voce aside, it is almost impossible to find someone with a negative experience with Mr. Elbaz. Mr. Toledano said he resigned a few months after Mr. Elbaz left Guy Laroche for Y.S.L. because: When you are in love with someone and he or she drops you, you cant fall immediately in love again. You need time.

Ms. Cagalj says he taught me design was an emotional process. Mr. Frisoni, describing a Lanvin show he attended, said: You could see he loved people, loved women, loved fashion. How could you not love Alber?

But love did not characterize every relationship at Lanvin. Fissures had begun to appear in the relationship of Mr. Deneve and Madam Wang. In 2007, reportedly without telling Mr. Deneve of her plans, she sold the perfume business to Interparfums. In January 2009, Mr. Deneve left  after diverging opinions.

It was the beginning of a pattern that would repeat itself: Disagreement would not be tolerated. Those who did, left. Or were asked to leave.

Mr. Deneves replacement, Thierry Andretta, former chief executive of Moschino, focused on changing the wholesale and retail balance of the brand and opening stores, doubling the revenues in four years from approximately 120 million to about 240 million, before leaving in 2013 for personal reasons widely attributed to disagreements over strategy.

And though for years they seemed to have a warm relationship, developing a famous routine in which at the end of every show, after bowing to the crowd, Mr. Elbaz would bow to Madame Wang personally, and she would give him a kiss and a bouquet of flowers, now he, too, is gone because of a disagreement over strategy.

The word that comes up most often when associates are asked to describe Madame Wang is autocratic. Fashion houses are not democracies, of course, and Madame Wang is Lanvins majority shareholder; she owns the last word. Still, it is striking that, over the years, the strategic disagreements all seemed to turn broadly on the same point: an alleged reluctance on the part of Madame Wang to invest in the business, whether by putting cash back into the company after selling off assets or opening it up to investment from the outside.

Though she accepted a silent minority shareholder in Arpege, the company that owns Lanvin, in the form of German investor Ralph Bartel in 2009 (he now owns 25 percent and has a seat on the Lanvin board), and gave Mr. Elbaz some shares in her own Luxembourg-based holding company, Bluewater Investment (reportedly the indirect owner of Arpege, though the company declined to comment on the relationship), she maintained a tight hold on Lanvin. Everyone tried to buy it, Mr. Andretta said. She simply refused. In her way, she is very passionate about the company.

Charles-Henry Paradis, a member of the communications team and the representative of the employees on the Comite dEntreprise and to the board, said: She is a very proud woman. She would see selling as an admission of failure.

But in order to grow, Ms. Gilhart said, You have to feed the machine. Valentino and Brunello Cucinelli, two companies Mr. Andretta characterized as of comparable size during his tenure, have continued their upward trajectory in part by bolstering their balance sheets, thanks to both the acquisition by the Qatari royal family and a public offering.

Mr. Andrettas successor was Michele Huiban, the former finance chief, who had been hired under Mr. Deneve and promoted by Madame Wang to deputy director general under Mr. Andretta. Unlike her predecessors, Ms. Huiban had almost no profile in the fashion community, but was seen as an extension of Madame Wang, a former executive said. Her appointment coincided with a difficult financial period for the brand. Revenue and net profit fell in 2013 and 2014, and according to an internal announcement, there was a loss of 2.5 million in net profits projected for 2015  the first since 2007.

Lawyers for Lanvin disputed claims that this was an issue in court, saying that the company is on a solid financial footing, and pointing to the fact Madame Wang is trying to buy back the Lanvin name and distribution rights in Japan as proof.

In an internal memo shown to The New York Times, the financial difficulties were attributed to the general geopolitical situation, lack of creative energy and the absence of a meaningful accessory business.

Though Lanvin had notable success with items like the ribbon-trimmed sneaker (worn by Michelle Obama, among many others) and the ballet flat (worn by Angelina Jolie), as well as tulle-covered pearls and other costume jewelry, Lanvin remained a heavily ready-to-wear business. Mr. Paradis said that today the balance is 60 percent ready-to-wear, 40 percent accessories. Lanvin does not officially release such numbers, though another insider said the division could be as extreme as 80/20.

It is true that I cant recall a specific bag that broke through, Ms. Smith acknowledged, though I remember there were many good ones.

Photo

In a letter written to both the management and employees, Mr. Elbaz said that it was lack of an articulated strategy and investment that was responsible for the stagnation, a view supported by many employees, Mr. Paradis said. And both Mr. Andretta and Ms. Gilhart say that every time they asked Mr. Elbaz to design an item for commercial needs  more jackets, say, or long dresses  once they had explained why the market needed the product, he was happy to comply.

Whichever side is right, it is not unusual in situations like this  falling sales, corporate change  for the designer or the chief executive to take the fall. In June, for example, after the fourth consecutive quarter of falling sales, J. Crew fired its head of women's wear, Tom Mora. Last year, after an extended sales decline, the chief executive and creative director of Gucci were both fired. But, in part because of Mr. Elbazs talent and charisma, the industry as a whole was so invested in Lanvins happy ending, no one imagined it would happen to him.

Maybe he didnt, either, as he began to voice his belief that the brand needed to accept further outside investment and articulate a concrete management strategy; Lanvin executives allege that he tried to sell his shares in Bluewater without telling Madame Wang, and then pressured her to sell her own holdings. Lanvin became, according to numerous employees, a tense building in which to work. Last year, 65 people  almost 20 percent of the work force  left. (The companys lawyers characterized this as normal industry attrition.) Earlier this year, Hania Destelle, communications director for 21 years, who was known as being very close to Mr. Elbaz, was fired.

At the last show, Madame Wang and Mr. Elbaz did not exchange their customary kiss, despite the fact that many retailers thought it was the best show the designer had produced in seasons. Indeed, Selfridges began buying the brand again after dropping it in 2013, according to Judd Crane, the stores director of women's wear and accessories.

In October, the employees discovered that Mr. Elbaz had been fired when he called his assistant to ask her to pack up his office because he was not allowed back in the building. (His partner of over two decades, Alex Koo, is still director of merchandising; he also was not available for an interview.) At a large meeting later the same day, Ms. Huiban officially informed them of the decision to end Mr. Elbazs contract, while many present chanted his name. Things escalated from there.

The Comite dEntreprise said they did not get satisfactory answers to the questions of why Mr. Elbaz had been fired and what the strategy was for the companys future (and their emails to Madame Wang asking her to return to Paris to address the company in person were not answered), so they took their cause public, speaking on a French radio station about their concerns. Management said the employees were refusing meetings; the employees said the same thing. The works council posted a letter from Mr. Elbaz defending himself on a message board, to the displeasure of management, who viewed the council as partisans of Mr. Elbaz. The works council then asked for an independent audit. The next stop was the Tribunal.

The question is: What happens now? Ironically (or perhaps purposefully), celebrities have been wearing the brand on the red carpet at an almost unprecedented rate, with Cate Blanchett, Michelle Dockery, Ms. Streep and Adele all modeling Lanvin in public in the weeks since Mr. Elbazs ouster.

In an internal email seen by The New York Times, Lanvin management said it would not pursue the court case any further, and hoped to engage in more constructive dialogue with the employees. It is unclear what direct financial impact Mr. Elbazs ouster will have on the company, as the works council believes the company could owe him from 20 million to 40 million in severance, according to a statement from their lawyer in court, a figure denied by the Lanvin lawyers (Mr. Elbaz was not a full-time employee of Lanvin, but rather contracted to them as a creative consultant via his own company, AEK Designs, and his current contract was due to end next year). In terms of perception, the company lost half its value when Alber left, said Ralph Toledano.

Before he was fired Mr. Elbaz, had hired Chemena Kamali from Chloe as womens design director; she arrived three days before he was ousted, and is currently in charge of creating the pre-collection with the studio team, to be shown in January. Lucio Finale has been brought in to focus on accessories. (Lucas Ossendrijver will continue to design the mens wear collection.) Head hunters report feelers have been put out by employees on the corporate side looking for other job prospects. Last week, a long-term member of the studio, was suspended for being uncooperative and allegedly undermining the new studio director, charges he denied.

Whats clear is whatever the brand is after Alber, it has to be something different, said Mr. Andretta. Names that have surfaced as possibilities for the artistic director position include the buzzy British designer Simone Rocha and the Chinese designer Huishan Zhang.

As for Mr. Elbaz, though rumors flew when he left that he would go to Dior (which had lost its designer, Raf Simons, only a week before Mr. Elbaz was fired), that speculation has died down. Though he recently joined Instagram and has posted pictures of himself with Bono, who dedicated the song Beautiful Day to him during a November concert in Paris, Mr. Elbaz has kept a low profile, and is said to be pondering his options. After being fired from Saint Laurent, he spent a year in the wilderness, questioning his commitment to fashion, but this time he is said to be planning to return. He does not have a noncompete with Lanvin.

Maybe hed want his own house, said Kim Hastreiter, co-founder and editor of Paper, who has known Mr. Elbaz since before he moved to Paris (and who played percussion along with the band Pink Martini at his Lanvin 10th anniversary party, where he serenaded guests with Que Sera, Sera). He remains a Lanvin board member. Though there was a directors meeting scheduled for this week, it has been postponed until after the holidays because Mr. Bartel could not attend.

Retailers are taking a wait-and-see approach. I am scheduled to schedule an appointment to see the pre-collection, said Ms. Goldman. But I dont need more brands. I need continuity, loyalty, consistency  not labels. I cant keep bringing strangers into the beds of my consumers and expecting them to fall in love over and over again. Its unreasonable.",[]

Bob Dylan is on the move yet again, with a new album and tour.

After returning from a series of concerts in Japan in April, Mr. Dylan, 74, will embark on a 27-date American tour in June and July, in support of a coming album, Fallen Angels, according to a brief announcement on Mr. Dylans website on Monday.

The tour, featuring Mavis Staples as the opening act, will start with two shows at the Chateau Ste. Michelle Winery in Woodinville, Wash., on June 4 and 5, and continue through July 17, with a performance at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford, N.H. The tour will include a stop on July 8 at the Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, where Mr. Dylan last played on Aug. 28, 1965. Tickets for the shows will go on sale at various times, with the first of them selling on Friday.

Mr. Dylans website gives little information about Fallen Angels, even a release date. The album is his first since Shadows in the Night, a year ago, with covers of traditional pop standards associated with Frank Sinatra, including Im a Fool to Want You  one of the very few songs in which Sinatra has a writing credit. One perk: for most shows, customers buying a pair of tickets will get a redemption code for the CD, the announcement said.

Some sleuthing fans, looking at recent statements from Dylan collaborators like the producer Daniel Lanois, have surmised that Fallen Angels will be another standards record. The title, for one thing, may be a reference to the 1945 film noir Fallen Angel by Otto Preminger, who also directed Sinatra in The Man With the Golden Arm. (Whats a new Dylan announcement without some mystery?)

Last week, it was revealed that Mr. Dylans vast personal archives of lyrics, correspondence, audio tapes and films were being acquired by a group of institutions in Tulsa, Okla., and would become available for scholarly study after about two years of cataloging and digitization.",[]

PARIS  The French Culture Ministry announced on Wednesday that Guy Cogeval, the president of the Musee dOrsay in Paris since 2008, would be reappointed to his post  but for only one year rather than the expected three.

In a statement, the ministry praised Mr. Cogeval, who is also the head of the Musee de lOrangerie across the Seine, noting that he had helped to develop and renovate the Musee dOrsay and that recent exhibits there, like one on the artistic depiction of prostitution, had been met with repeated critical and public success.

But Mr. Cogevals governance came into question last month when half a dozen curators at the Musee dOrsay anonymously contacted the newspaper Le Monde to oppose his reappointment, arguing that he was neither physically, nor psychologically, nor scientifically able to run a museum of this stature.

Mr. Cogeval, 60, suffered a stroke in 2014. The anonymous curators said his health problems had left him unfit to manage the museum, calling his decision-making irrational and his programming extremely fluctuating.

Several high-profile curators have recently left the institutions under Mr. Cogeval, including Sylvie Patry, who left the Musee dOrsay last November to become chief curator and deputy director for collections and exhibitions at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia.

In an open letter addressed to Le Monde, Mr. Cogeval dismissed the anonymous criticism as rumors fostered by rivals vying for his job and denied the stroke had left him impaired.

Although the statement did not specify why Mr. Cogevals term would only last for only one year, the ministry said he would step down in March 2017 to head a center dedicated to the study of a movement of painters known as Les Nabis, which he specializes in.",[]

Angela Dimayuga, the executive chef at Mission Chinese Food in Manhattan, spooned salmon roe and rare beef into what she called baller lettuce cups.

Bill Telepan sweated through his T-shirt, fending off Wylie Dufresne, who snatched a few cubes of potato Mr. Telepan was frying in olive oil to go with slices of dry-aged rib-eye.

By virtue of his appetite, his fame and the kind of mind that can keep track of an 80,000-record vinyl collection, Mr. Thompson in the last few years has crept into the white-hot center of a food world that is itself moving toward the center of pop culture.

He doesnt cook much himself, although he grew up with a grandmother devoted to Sunday supper. Rather, he aspires to become to food what Gertrude Stein was to art, a culinary catalyst whose parties mix the creative and the powerful against the backdrop of cooking. In these discussions and a book to be released next month, Mr. Thompson continues to mine a favorite topic: the mechanics of creativity.

The job is not all indulgence. His favorite dish at the salon was a South African malva pudding with blood orange sherbet put together by Jessica Koslow of Sqirl in Los Angeles. But it was the first time I had sugar in, like, five weeks, Mr. Thompson said.

He had been on a cleanse, which involved a lot of cabbage soup, in an effort to get his frame under 330 pounds. Based on my physical look, he said, you can tell that food and me have been friends for a long time.

The chefs at the salon said that musicians tend to have terrific appetites, and that the bridge Mr. Thompson is building between food and music makes sense. There is no difference between the music you listen to and the food you eat, Mr. Samuelsson said. The emotions are the same. They are both a narrative.

Mr. Thompson has been a presenter at James Beard awards ceremonies and has been a Top Chef judge. Hes the guy Chris Rock calls to find out where to eat. His culinary exploits are sent out to his 3.6 million Twitter followers and the 25,000 people who have discovered his Questlovesfood Instagram account. When he spreads his wings over food-related charity events, he can help raise hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Anthony Bourdain calls him a fully made member of the chef mafia, but Mr. Thompson thinks thats overblown. He doesnt want to be another celebrity trying to extend his brand into food. Im very leery of my entry into the fraternity or sorority of these people, Mr. Thompson said.

In 2013, he opened a little food stand in Chelsea Market with the restaurateur Stephen Starr, who like Mr. Thompson is from Philadelphia. Mr. Thompson is a drummer, so they served fried chicken drumsticks. It was the food version of a rap battle between him and the chef David Chang. The bigger point, though, was to prove he was serious.

I dont want to be perceived as someone who just bought my way into this world or used my currency as a means to get in, Mr. Thompson said in an interview. Like, I had to throw them proof.

After seven months, the stand was losing money and closed. After the restaurant went down, it was sort of like, What should our next move be? he said. So the food salons started.

The idea came from something he used to do with the Roots, the neo-soul hip-hop band he founded in 1987 with Tariq Trotter, the musician known as Black Thought. They made their record company add a food budget to pay Philadelphia chefs to prepare meals for social gatherings of musicians.

We would eat and the musicians would set up and wed start writing music, Mr. Thompson said. Thats how the bands breakthrough album, Things Fall Apart, was born in 1999.

His food obsession became more serious in 2009, when the Roots became the house band for Late Night With Jimmy Fallon. (Mr. Thompson and the band have stayed on with Mr. Fallon since he took over The Tonight Show in 2014.)

I was counting the pros and the cons of having the Late Night job, and one of the big pros was just the amount of chefs who were at our disposal, Mr. Thompson said. It was like, Oh man, I am eating a sandwich Martha Stewart just brought in.

The job has also made it harder to fight his weight. For his birthday in January, cakes poured in from all over. Tastykake even made a delivery. They are my kryptonite, he said. The scariest thing about being here at 30 Rock is that if I mention something, a lifetime supply of it will show up.

The seminal moment in his food education came after he watched the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi and then traveled to the basement of an office tower in Tokyo to eat at the hands of the films sushi master, Jiro Ono.

Once I saw his commitment, I realized that I needed to work harder myself, he said. The visit led to a book, Something to Food About: Exploring Creativity With Innovative Chefs, which Clarkson Potter will publish in April. Written with Ben Greenman, co-writer of the Questlove memoir Mo Meta Blues, its based on lengthy interviews with 10 chefs.

Is this drive for perfection necessary for creative people, Mr. Thompson asks in the new books introduction, or is it just something that happens to creative people whether its necessary or not?

One may legitimately ask if the world needs another book examining the creative mind of the chef, but in the hands of Mr. Thompson, its a fresh ride.

He discusses race and poverty with Donald Link in New Orleans and the compromises that come with cooking in Americas culture of instant gratification with Dominique Crenn in San Francisco. He visits Nathan Myhrvold, an author of Modernist Cuisine, in Seattle, and asks Michael Solomonov, Philadelphias impresario of Israeli food, what it was like to work at his dads Subway restaurant in Israel.

The poet Elizabeth Alexander, who seemed surprised and delighted to be at the food salon last month, said she was looking forward to reading the book. She perhaps understood more than others at the party the deep link between cooking and other creative pursuits.

Her recent memoir, The Light of the World, uses food memories and recipes to explore her grief over the sudden loss of her husband, a chef and painter.

Chefs, she said in between bites of a baller lettuce cup, are just like any other artists: They are obsessive weirdos in the same way.",[]

You go to Indiana, its hard to imagine you wont run across a basketball court. Theyre like Starbucks there, only it may be easier to get a seat at Starbucks.

Indiana is known as a place where basketball is sort of like the sport, said Michael E. Keating, a photographer. Its kind of like the religion. If basketballs a religion, then the gymnasiums  theyre the places where people worship. Theyre the churches, the temples.

For the past several years, Mr. Keating and his colleague Chris Smith have crisscrossed the state, traveling more than 10,000 miles and photographing more than 100 school gymnasiums. There is no lack of choices. People in Indiana, as anyone who saw the 1986 movie Hoosiers knows, view basketball the way Southerners view football. Texas can keep its Friday night lights. Nine of the countrys 10 biggest high school gyms, the photographers say, are in Indiana.

They both say the appeal is not really the basketball. Were there for everything that surrounds the game, Mr. Keating said.

Mr. Smith said, We like to have people in the gyms. But for the photographers, its fine if it is just a practice or even a graduation. When there was some kind of activity, he said, the gyms kind of came to life.

Photo

The project began when Mr. Smith ran across a hand-tinted photograph of his father in an old team photograph and wanted to learn more. A longtime commercial photographer who also teaches photography to college students, he reached out to Mr. Keating, who had retired from The Cincinnati Enquirer after decades as a general assignment photographer. Both men are 63.

Their backgrounds are reflected in their approach to their work. Mr. Keating, Mr. Smith said, is drawn to emotion, while he tends to try to capture something a little less fleeting. Each has learned from the other.

I envy how he sees, Mr. Keating said. Because my whole training, my whole emphasis for so long was on a moment.

Getting good shots can be challenging, in part because the light in gyms is not always cooperative, Mr. Smith said. And lets face it: Not every church is Chartres, and not every gym is inspiring.

Some gyms, Mr. Keating said, choosing his words with a diplomats care, just are not interesting.

But for these two photographers, a dull gym is the exception.

THURSDAY PUZZLE  Heres what can happen when your mother eagerly signs you up for music lessons when youre a child and you dont pay attention: You grow up to be a crossword puzzle blogger, responsible for explaining the puzzle to a large number of people, and then you wind up solving  or rather, not solving  a crossword that incorporates music notation theory as part of the theme. Its like one of those stress dreams we all have, but this is for real.

Somewhere in Florida, my mother is laughing her behind off.

This is as good a time as any to admit to you that I had to look at the answers to crack the theme. That is not as bad as it sounds; who amongst us has not revealed an answer here or there? No one, thats who, and that is a good lesson for all you beginning solvers out there. Dont feel that you cant take a peek if you think youll learn something from it. That knowledge is stored away for the next time you will see it in a puzzle. Streaks be damned. [Cleans off the remains of the tomatoes thrown at me.]

Sidenote: I originally thought this puzzle was going to be a commentary about footballs DEFLATEGATE and that the black squares in the lower center of the grid represented goalposts. You see how misdirected you can get on a Thursday?

Anyway, if, unlike me, you did not fall asleep in music theory class, you will recognize that there are supposed to be two musical notes in three of the squares of Andrew Zhous mirror symmetry puzzle. Each note is used once: one note for the Across entry and one note for the Down entry. For example, at 16 Across and 6 Down, we have the respective entries MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY and THE SHARPER IMAGE. Where the two entries cross, we have the two rebus elements: F NATURAL going across and E SHARP going down.

And because you havent had enough agita for the day, all of the notes are different. If you are solving this on the web or in our app, please note that the accepted entries are supposed to be either the entire entry (either Across or Down) or the first letter. So, for 16 Across and 6 Down, the accepted answers should be F NATURAL, F, E SHARP or E.

As a public service, I would like to present you with the six theme entries:

16A/6D: MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY / THE SHARPER IMAGE

65A/53D: LOOKING SHARP / GET A FLAT

66A/55D: DEFLATEGATE / CARD SHARP

In addition, Mr. Zhou has thrown in some long Downs that highlight the theme, MUSICAL NOTE and TWO TONE CARS (sort of). For my money, One added to the staff? also wins Clue of the Day.

Constructors Notes:

A couple of months back, Evan Birnholz espoused his theory that music and crossing words have much to do with one another. Ive always thought that a good crossword works like a piece of Bachian counterpoint, in which both the vertical (harmony) and the horizontal (melody) are required to maintain absolute integrity. In that spirit, todays puzzle puns in the form of ENHARMONIC spellings, wherein the same sounded pitch (in equal temperament) is notated in two different ways. I hope it offers a significant contribution to the canon of musical puns, which includes beloved classics like, If you dont C-sharp, youll B-flat. Heres to a music-filled Thursday!

And that is why I failed to solve todays crossword puzzle, Officer. Please dont tell my mother.

We just have to move on to the Friday puzzle with this song:

A FIVE-BEDROOM VILLA ON A CANAL









$4.695 MILLION

This four-year-old house on Grand Cayman Island, in the 52-acre gated development of Vista del Mar, is on a canal leading into the North Sound. It is about a 15-minute walk from crescent-shaped Seven Mile Beach and adjacent to the Cayman Islands Yacht Club, said Malin Ratcliffe, the owner-broker of West Indies Brokers Real Estate, which has the listing. The two-story white concrete home, about 9,000 square feet on a 0.58-acre lot, has a Caribbean-style limestone finish halfway up the lower level and a red tile roof. There are five bedrooms and five and a half baths, and furnishings are included in the asking price.

A grand staircase with a limestone facade leads up from the front lawn and turns at a landing toward a covered porch and a 12-foot-high arched mahogany front door.

With the main living areas on the second floor, the house enjoys canal and North Sound views, year-round breezes and very advantageous additional protection during hurricane season, Ms. Ratcliffe said.

A small foyer opens onto a grand hall with a coffered ceiling. This room and the dining room to its left have white Egyptian stone floors inlaid with hardwood. The rest of the house also has Egyptian stone floors. Beyond the dining room is the kitchen, a breakfast nook with a love seat and a 48-inch round mahogany table, a family room and two bedrooms with en-suite baths. A white wood bar is to one side of the grand hall.

The kitchen has twin center islands topped with Carrara marble, two Viking refrigerators with freezer drawers, a Viking gas range, a pot filler, an electric oven, a warming drawer, a microwave, a dishwasher and a ceramic double sink.

Open to the kitchen, the family room has a coffered ceiling, turquoise walls and accordion glass doors leading to a covered porch overlooking an inground pool, a large gazebo that serves as an outdoor living room and cocktail lounge, the canal and North Sound.

You can really take the inside out and the outside in when you open those doors, Ms. Ratcliffe said.

A study, a guest bath and the master suite are to the right of the grand hall. The master bedroom has a four-poster bed and a coffered ceiling. A door leads to the porch.

The master bath is tiled with Carrara marble and has a whirlpool tub and a separate walk-in shower. A double vanity has a Carrara marble countertop.

Downstairs, a three-car garage leads to the first-floor foyer, an elevator, a powder room, a laundry room and a staircase with a wrought iron railing to the second floor. The open layout downstairs incorporates a media room, a playroom, a billiards room and a game room opening to a covered patio with a heated whirlpool tub.

Two downstairs bedrooms share a bath. All the bedrooms have ceiling fans; the house has five air-conditioning zones.

Mature redwood, almond, mango and royal palm trees dot the lawn.

Behind the gazebo, a slip on the canal accommodates a 20-foot boat.

A dedicated slip for a 65-foot boat is at the Vista del Mar marina next door. There is also a tennis court in the development, which has about 27 homes. Restaurants, beach bars, shopping, resorts, hotels and spas are within walking distance on the nearby Seven Mile Beach corridor. Golf courses are also nearby. Owen Roberts International Airport is a 20-minute drive.

MARKET OVERVIEW

With about 58,000 residents, Grand Cayman, at 76 square miles, is the biggest of the three Cayman Islands, which are a British Overseas Territory in the western Caribbean.

The islands economy lags two to three years behind that of the United States, said Sheena Conolly, the broker-owner of Cayman Island Sothebys. Accordingly, 2011 and 2012 were tough years for the Cayman Islands.

The turnaround began in 2013. During the last nine months, the market has been extremely buoyant, Ms. Ratcliffe said. We are seeing a definite uptick. With inventory falling, the buyers market of the last few years is giving way to a sellers market.

Rentals and tourism are also up. The volume of transactions has gone up 90 percent in the last 12 months, Ms. Conolly said. Price points are shifting up.

The biggest increase was on Seven Mile Beach, where prices for condominiums range from $500,000 to many millions, Ms. Conolly said. In other beachfront areas, prices start at $350,000. Prices for canalfront, beachfront or oceanfront single-family homes begin at around $2 million, she said.

Along Seven Mile Beach, condominiums in buildings ranging from three to 10 stories are often bought for investment and rented out. Canalfront single-family homes are typically primary residences for executives from nearby George Towns financial center, or vacation homes for buyers with a penchant for deep-sea fishing or sailing.

WHO BUYS ON GRAND CAYMAN

People from 130 countries live and work here, Ms. Conolly said. Its very diverse and dynamic.

At least 75 percent of buyers come from the United States and Canada, Ms. Ratcliffe said, in addition to a smaller number from Europe and South America. Snowbirds living near cities in the United States with direct flights are prevalent among home buyers.

BUYING BASICS

Foreigners are welcome to buy real estate in the Cayman Islands, as long as they provide satisfactory due-diligence paperwork to comply with our money laundering legislation, said Ian Jamieson, a lawyer based on Grand Cayman. Potential buyers need to supply proof of identity along with references from a bank or similar financial institution plus references from a professional like a lawyer or an accountant.

Financing of up to 90 percent of the purchase price is available to qualified buyers.

There is no title insurance here in Cayman, so it is advisable to have an attorney represent a buyer in a transaction from the outset, not just at closing, Mr. Jamieson said. Lawyers review and investigate the title, handle the closing and register the transaction and buyer information with the governments Lands and Survey Department.

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Warhol and Avedon Form an Unlikely Tandem in London,['Farah Nayeri'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

LONDON  If his diaries are any indication, Andy Warhol had little affection for Richard Avedon. In an entry from December 1976, Warhol recalled running into a woman they both knew at a dinner party in New York.









We talked about how horrible Avedon is, Warhol wrote. She said he gets what he wants out of a person and then drops them. I agreed and then everybody screamed at me that I do the same thing.

Whatever their animosities, Avedon and Warhol are being posthumously paired in an exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery here. The show, which runs through April 23, presents 33 Warhol silk-screens and 22 Avedon works (including a single series of 69 portraits) dating from the 1950s to the 1990s.

At first glance, they form an awkward tandem, as towering figures in separate artistic disciplines.

But they had similar backgrounds and early career trajectories. Born five years apart in the 1920s to East European immigrant families, they got their starts in the New York fashion world, both working for Bonwit Teller and Harpers Bazaar. Although their paths then diverged  Avedon shifting from fashion photography to portraiture and Warhol becoming a painter and filmmaker and a Pop Art stalwart  they moved in the same New York circles, often portraying the same people.

Photo

The Gagosian is illustrating that overlap, eager to present the two men as equals who documented similar themes from different angles, thrusting aside hierarchical distinctions between painting and photography. The exhibition also has a commercial logic: It presents the work of two hugely famous artists, one of whom (Avedon) has the advantage of being relatively affordable.

The majority of the Avedons and a number of the Warhols are for sale, with prices that Gagosian says range from the tens of thousands to the millions of dollars.

The idea for a combined exhibition came up in 2011 after the Avedon Foundation  a nonprofit organization that owns Avedons photographs, negatives and archives and raises money through print sales  made the Gagosian its exclusive representative. The gallery thought of twinning Avedon with an artist to change peoples ideas about photography and the standing of photography in the world, said Kara Vander Weg, a director of the Gagosian in New York.

Mark Francis, a Gagosian director in London who previously steered the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, described both artists as recording angels of their period.

Its impossible to understand the visual world of today without either one of them, Mr. Francis said. So I dont think were trying to force a relation between them, either historically or iconographically.

The first room of the exhibition plays on the theme of power. On the main wall is Avedons The Family from 1976, a group of 69 portraits of American establishment figures including President Gerald Ford, Senator Edward M. Kennedy and his mother Rose Kennedy , and a young Donald Rumsfeld, a briefcase tucked under his arm. Hanging on other walls are Warhol portraits of personalities from the period, including Mao Zedong and the shah of Iran with his wife and sister.

A radically different family appears in the next room, in Avedons sprawling triptych Andy Warhol and Members of the Factory (1969). Warhol lurks in the corner of the image, while his disciples, five of them nude, take center stage. He reappears on the wall across  in the famous Avedon portrait of his scarred torso, taken in 1969, a year after he survived an assassination attempt. Other Warhols in the same room depict the artists Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring and the drag queen Wilhelmina Ross.

Photo

Death is evoked in the next gallery. Surrounding Warhols Last Supper (1986) are silk-screens of a skull and a gun, and a bewigged self-portrait. They are interspersed with Avedon portraits of the authors Samuel Beckett and Truman Capote, of the two killers depicted by Capote in his book In Cold Blood, and of a melancholy Marilyn Monroe.

The last room is a celebrity potpourri. There are Warhol silk-screens of a mourning Jacqueline Kennedy, of Liza Minnelli, Elvis Presley and Monroe. Avedon is represented by portraits of Mrs. Kennedy in happier times, Audrey Hepburn and a playful Charlie Chaplin.

Donna De Salvo, a deputy director of the Whitney Museum who curated Tate Moderns 2002 Warhol retrospective, and who is staging one at the Whitney in 2018, described Avedon and Warhol as a provocative pairing but a valid one, though she had not yet seen the Gagosian show.

Avedons work to me was always on this fine line between fashion and high art, and thats the line Warhol walked as well, Ms. De Salvo said. She noted that the two artists did in fact share a medium: Warhol would be inconceivable without the photographic image. Its so deeply embedded.

She described Avedon as a giant of photography who was a worthy exhibition companion for Warhol. In any event, nobody can diminish Warhol: You can put him with just about anything, she said. He becomes a great foil to play off.

In London for the opening was the Avedon Foundations executive director, James Martin, who was Avedons studio assistant before his death in 2004. He described the photographer as extremely demanding  a demanding that was absolutely invigorating and horrifying at the same time. You wouldnt want to mess it up.

Mr. Martin, who also was Avedons darkroom technician, said it sometimes took more than a dozen versions of a print to satisfy him. This needs to be more dramatic, Avedon would respond at first, Mr. Martin recalled. When the next version was shown to him, he would say, Well, maybe youve captured the ear. Match the rest of the print with the drama of that ear.

Despite the challenges, Mr. Martin said he missed having Avedon around, including for the installation of this show.

There is a burden that I have of no longer having his voice there to steer the ship, he said. What I miss is the certainty that he would take into all these decisions that were faced with.",[]

Bob Dylan is on the move yet again, with a new album and tour.

After returning from a series of concerts in Japan in April, Mr. Dylan, 74, will embark on a 27-date American tour in June and July, in support of a coming album, Fallen Angels, according to a brief announcement on Mr. Dylans website on Monday.

The tour, featuring Mavis Staples as the opening act, will start with two shows at the Chateau Ste. Michelle Winery in Woodinville, Wash., on June 4 and 5, and continue through July 17, with a performance at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford, N.H. The tour will include a stop on July 8 at the Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, where Mr. Dylan last played on Aug. 28, 1965. Tickets for the shows will go on sale at various times, with the first of them selling on Friday.

Mr. Dylans website gives little information about Fallen Angels, even a release date. The album is his first since Shadows in the Night, a year ago, with covers of traditional pop standards associated with Frank Sinatra, including Im a Fool to Want You  one of the very few songs in which Sinatra has a writing credit. One perk: for most shows, customers buying a pair of tickets will get a redemption code for the CD, the announcement said.

Some sleuthing fans, looking at recent statements from Dylan collaborators like the producer Daniel Lanois, have surmised that Fallen Angels will be another standards record. The title, for one thing, may be a reference to the 1945 film noir Fallen Angel by Otto Preminger, who also directed Sinatra in The Man With the Golden Arm.

Many conservatives believe that the Republican Party needs an overhaul.









Im not saying someone shouldnt blow up the Republican Party. Im saying that that someone shouldnt be an unprincipled imposter, David Harsanyi wrote last month in The Federalist, an arch conservative publication.

The impulse to blow the whole thing up has been out there for a while, but politicians whose skill we may have underestimated were able to hold the Republican coalition together. Whatever else you say about him, Mitt Romney won more than 60 million votes in 2012.

But this years campaign is the culmination of a shift in the composition of the Republican electorate that has been underway for some time.

Tom Davis, who served as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee from 1999 to 2003, argued in an interview that the Republican Party has been losing voters among whites elites in Northern suburbs while gaining ground in the heartland, from Appalachia to struggling towns and counties like Fall River, Mass., Atkinson County, Ga., and Macon County, Tennessee, where Donald Trump recently won primary contests by huge margins.

After the Bush administration, Davis said, with two unpopular wars and a financial meltdown, there was nothing left, the party was a shell. They destroyed it.

By the standards of contemporary ideological conviction, Davis, now the rector of George Mason University, is a moderate Republican.

Tony Fabrizio, a Republican campaign strategist, is well to Daviss right, but he has a complementary analysis:

For a while the base of the G.O.P. has been far closer to where Trump is on the issues than their leadership. The base of the G.O.P. has never really been true free-traders, theyve always been fair traders, the leadership of the party wants to embrace some form of amnesty for illegals, the base of the party does not.

This intraparty rift between the more traditional Republican voters who favor free trade and international goals and the ascendant protectionist and nationalist wing has fomented what we are seeing today with Trump, Fabrizio said.

The Republican Party, as it was, has gone into retreat even as it struggles to maintain control. The steady abandonment of norms and standards  the pro forma observance of which was once considered essential to the political process  has reinforced this development.

In National Review, Andrew McCarthy argues that cultural rot has infected the Republican electorate:

What is the natural progression from turning the campus and pop culture over to Amerika-hating radicals, to the vigorous years-long media defense of Bill Clintons right to turn the White House into a cathouse, to the inability of a father to watch baseball with his young son at one oclock on a Sunday afternoon without being ready to address erectile dysfunction? It is the cretinous Donald J. Trump campaign.

McCarthy, a former assistant U.S. attorney, continued:

Donald Trump is not the cause of deterioration in our politics. He is the effect of deterioration in our culture.

Tom Davis similarly noted that the shift of the Republican base to more working class white communities has changed the cultural character of the Republican electorate. Republican voters are now more guttural, as Davis put it, more comfortable with Trumps boastful, violent rhetoric and less connected to the cosmopolitan, modulated language of suburbia.

The deterioration of popular culture is a fact of life, as anyone who watches television knows. Politicians, of necessity, treat the electorate in much the same way corporations view the marketplace: failure to meet the customers needs, desires and values is a sure path to political suicide or corporate bankruptcy.

To the degree that Trump represents a substantial and growing sector of the Republican electorate, his success so far is the natural result of the primary process, not a corruption of it.

Some conservatives have trouble accepting this. Trumps brawling, blustery, mean-spirited public persona serves to associate conservatives with all the negative stereotypes that liberals have for decades attached to their opponents on the right, Michael Medved, the conservative talk show host, wrote in National Review in January:

Trump is the living, breathing, bellowing personification of all the nasty characteristics Democrats routinely ascribe to Republicans.

In an email, Jonah Goldberg, a senior editor at National Review and a columnist for the Los Angeles Times, expressed his concerns.

On one hand,

my own position is that this is a matter of honor and integrity now and that I cant belong to a party led by Donald Trump. But more practically I think that if the G.O.P. makes this joke its leader, it will do enormous and probably permanent damage to the party.

At the same time, Goldberg notes, a lot of the blame for the emergence of Trump lies with party elites who have failed to respond to issues raised by younger, reform-minded conservatives:

People like Ramesh Ponnuru, Yuval Levin, Arthur Brooks, Bob Doar et al. have been proposing everything from child-tax credits to apprentice programs, and they were criticized as social engineers, liberals, RINOs, etc. by self-appointed purists. Now, many of those same purists are swooning for Trump. Larry Kudlow is backing a protectionist! Jerry Falwell, Jr. is backing a Caligula!

Trumps direct appeal to racial and ethnic resentment  of Hispanics and Muslims, for now  has made him the most disruptive force in presidential politics since the emergence of Gov. George Wallace of Alabama in the 1960s and 1970s. Wallace, more than anyone else, amplified the salience of race in American politics, which led to the abandonment of the Democratic Party by white Southerners and spurred a Republican realignment of the region.

You could make a case that the politics of rage has gone from George Wallace, morphed into Nixon and the southern states strategy, then Gingrich and his merry band, into Fox News/Limbaugh/Tea Party Republicans, Larry OBrien III (a son of Lawrence Francis Larry OBrien, who was John F. Kennedys chief political strategist) wrote me, adding

Its not quite linear, but is Trump a sea change, a big leap, or merely the next iteration?

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Jack Shafer, writing for Politico, also points to the parallel between Wallace and Trump:

In 1964, during the presidential campaign, Maryland Sen. Daniel Brewster called Wallace a professional liar, a bigot and an aspiring dictator and a certain enemy of the Constitution of the United States. My, how that sounds familiar.

While Wallace used race to force a major restructuring of both the Democratic and Republican Parties, Trumps populism is driving a wedge into the heart of the Republican Party.

The alliance of the business wing of the G.O.P. and the working-class wing is already fractured, Heather Richardson, a professor of history at Boston College, emailed in response to my inquiry:

Trump is simply reflecting what poor voters already know: that they have been sold a bill of goods. They respond to his naked hatred of people of color and women because that is the language and the argument they have known their whole lives, but they also like his apparent attacks on the people who betrayed them.

Still, in political terms, the question is: Does Donald Trump represent a legitimate expression of the peoples will? Is his rise a manifestation of justifiable resentment among less privileged whites at their neglect by higher caste Republican leaders?

Dean Baker, a liberal economist, contends in an email that the Trump phenomenon opens future opportunities for a new populist politics. The big question, Baker writes,

is whether such a politics will be a dead end that tries to set the clock back by being a white peoples populism  treating African Americans, Hispanics, and other ethnic/racial groups as the enemy. Or whether it will be a forward thinking approach that formulates an economic policy designed to reverse the enormous upward redistribution that has been engineered by the leadership of both political parties over the last three and half decades.

Trumps nativist appeal will strengthen the anti-immigrant wing of the Republican Party. This success will mute the call of Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, to seek votes from the growing Hispanic population.

Regardless of the final outcome, Trump has proven that the traditional Republican Party has lost influence, so much so that a demonstrably duplicitous public figure, a man seemingly without conscience, can take the lead and hold it at least into March.

Trumps liabilities were put on full display before the 16.9 million viewers who watched the March 3 debate in Detroit, the most revealing (if least enlightening) confrontation of the campaign.

Despite that, Trump easily won the Michigan primary on Tuesday, a key test of the candidates strength in the rust belt. He won an outright majority in Mississippi and increased his lead in the delegate count overall.

Trump had already revealed the vulnerability of both the Republican Party and the conservative movement, institutions that together claimed the presidency in seven of the ten elections between 1968 and 2004.

He has reconvened the largely passive silent majority  the Reagan Democrats and the angry white men of past elections  and turned it into a renegade force that has rebelled against its marginal status in the Republican coalition.

How the Republican Party deals with this insurgency will define much of American political life this year, on into 2018 and 2020. If by popular acclaim Trump is legitimated, the party will be forced to acquiesce. But looked at another way, it no longer matters whether Trump wins the Republican nomination. His emotional baggage and his political doctrine have already had an incalculable impact, and it is not a force for good.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-02-25 00:00:00,Lessons From Game Theory: What Keeps Kasich in the Race?,['Kevin Quealy'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The Republican establishment has a problem. It is headed for a car crash.









With Jeb Bush out of the Republican presidential race, the two remaining mainstream candidates  Marco Rubio and John Kasich  are living out an issue studied for decades in game theory. Game theorists might call the G.O.P. predicament an anti-coordination game or even a volunteers dilemma. But most of us might call it by a more familiar name: chicken.

Although Mr. Rubio is the obvious establishment favorite, leading Mr. Kasich in national polls, prediction markets and delegate math, the two are splitting some votes. To have his best chance against Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, Mr. Rubio needs Mr. Kasich to drop out. The longer both candidates remain in the race, the worse it is for both of them. Its safe to assume neither would like to see Mr. Trump get the nomination.

In An Essay on Bargaining, a classic paper from 1956, Thomas Schelling lays out several strategies that may be useful for both Mr. Kasich and Mr. Rubio. Here, we focus on three: commitment, promises and threats. As Richard Thaler, the behavioral economist at the University of Chicago, explained, the strategies can be applied to anything: health care, nuclear deterrence, the last piece of pizza.

Mr. Kasichs first option, of course, is to stay in the race. But he could go further, by committing to stay in no matter what. In a classic game of chicken between two drivers rushing headlong toward each other, this strategy is like removing your steering wheel, leaving you no choice but to drive straight toward your opponent.

Mr. Kasich could defend this choice by pointing to his obstacle-strewn but possible path to the nomination. He might point out that only a tiny fraction of Republican delegates have been allocated; he might note that he could pick up many of Mr. Bushs voters; he could hope for another robotic debate performance from Mr. Rubio or even an implosion from the Trump or Cruz campaigns.

This series of events is unlikely, of course. It doesnt matter how long Mr. Kasich actually intends to stay in the race. All that matters is whether Mr. Rubio believes he will do so. (If youre going to remove your steering wheel, make sure the other driver sees you do it!) The more believable the commitment, the stronger his negotiating position for the far more effective strategy in brinkmanship games: cutting a deal.

Side deals, bargains or promises are the way negotiations actually get done. In a 1984 paper on the private supply of a public good, the economists Christopher Bliss and Barry Nalebuff wrote that binding agreements combined with side payments can always produce a superior outcome to brinkmanship.

Some deals are obvious; the best such deal would be a spot on the presidential ticket, which Mr. Rubio could offer Mr. Kasich in exchange for dropping out  provided he becomes the nominee, of course. (A simple Google search of Rubio Kasich side deals produces no shortage of opinions on the matter.)

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

There are other potential promises. It might take the form of a concession on another matter  Mr. Rubio could promise to adopt or address some of Mr. Kasichs issues, which would allow Mr. Kasich to end his campaign and claim a small victory. In the book Prisoners Dilemma, William Poundstone suggests that the best solution to a game of chicken is one that allows the losing party to give in while still saving face. He noted its role in bringing a peaceful end to the Cuban missile crisis.

Regardless of the details, the quality of the deal depends on how much a Kasich exit matters to Mr. Rubio. The more crucial his exit, the stronger any promise is sure to be.

There is a third strategy available to Mr. Kasich, which takes the form of threats. Here, Mr. Kasich might insist on a promise or concession from Mr. Rubio; if he doesnt get it, he could threaten to support a different candidate, like Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz. That move wouldnt serve shared establishment interests, but if the threat had the potential to damage Mr. Rubio enough, it could be a useful bargaining chip. Being crazy is a strategy, but only if your opponent actually believes it, Mr. Thaler said. Of the three strategies described here, this seems least likely.

Two external factors complicate this matter further.

Part of the reason this dilemma exists in the first place is that mainstream Republicans lack the unity or influence to compel any cooperation. After the New Hampshire primary, one Republican likened the battle among mainstream candidates to a hockey fight: The gloves are off and the refs cant get in the middle of it. Thats exactly right.

If establishment Republicans had a clear, unimpeachable leader who was not a participant in the race, that person might be able to compel a candidate to drop out and support whomever the party determined to be strongest, allowing candidates who quit to save face by saying they did it for the good of the party. At the moment, no such leader exists for mainstream Republicans, resulting in a tragedy of the commons-like failure of collective action.

Second, this is a game thats played just once. The chance to be your partys nominee for president comes along only every four or eight years, even for the very luckiest candidates. If the candidates lived in a universe in which they could run for president hundreds of times, they might agree that, on average, their shared interests were better served by cooperating. Once in a while, Mr. Kasich might try to win the contest outright against long odds, but, on average, he would probably agree that cooperating, including alternating victories, was the best way to serve his and Mr. Rubios shared interests. Game theory shows that in iterated dilemmas, played many hundreds or thousands of times, cooperation is a very stable strategy  one reason it is so common in nature.

But this is not an iterated dilemma. Its a one-time-only dilemma with a tremendous payoff for the winner. As much as Mr. Kasich might think about his legacy, the good of the party or even his own chances in 2020 or 2024, the future is very far away.

Ultimately, they risk an outcome neither he nor Mr. Rubio wants. As Daniel Diermeier, the dean of the public policy school at the University of Chicago, notes, A very important lesson of game theory is that sometimes the world is a grim place.",[]

WASHINGTON  The Secret Service on Tuesday night arrested a man suspected of shooting a pastor in Idaho after the man traveled here and threw unidentified objects over the White House fence, a spokesman for the Secret Service said in a statement.

Ths suspect, Kyle A. Odom, was arrested by uniformed officers for the Secret Service on the south side of the White House complex. Officials said the material thrown over the fence had been determined to be nonhazardous.

Officials quickly learned that Mr. Odom was accused by Idaho law enforcement officials of attempted murder in the shooting of the Rev. Tim Remington, who was shot six times Sunday outside his church in Coeur dAlene, Idaho.

Odom was arrested on the outstanding warrant, and he was transported to the Metropolitan Police Department for processing, the Secret Service said in a statement. The U.S. Secret Service, through its Washington Field Office and Spokane Resident Office, is coordinating with the Coeur dAlene Police Department.

Mr. Remington, who on Saturday led a prayer at a campaign rally for Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican presidential candidate, was recovering at a hospital on Tuesday and had regained consciousness, The Associated Press reported.

After the shooting, the A.P. reported, several news outlets received letters purporting to be from Mr. Odom that contained references to President Obama, members of Congress, members of the Israeli government and an official at the church with which Mr. Remington is associated.

The A.P. said Mr. Odom is a former Marine who has a history of mental illness. The news service said that he served in the Marines from 2006 to 2010 and had received an Iraq Campaign medal and other awards. According to the A.P., Mr. Odom was able to board a plane in Boise despite the fact that the authorities in Idaho had issued a warrant for his arrest after the shooting.

I think everyone can breathe a good sigh of relief that at least this part of the case has come to a conclusion, Lee White, the police chief in Coeur dAlene, told The A.P.

The Secret Service referred further questions about Mr. Odom to the Coeur dAlene police department.",[]

Donald Trump is a walking political science course. His meteoric rise is lesson No. 1 on leadership: Most voters do not listen through their ears. They listen through their stomachs. If a leader can connect with them on a gut level, their response is: Dont bother me with the details. I trust your instincts. If a leader cant connect on a gut level, he or she cant show them enough particulars. Theyll just keep asking, Can you show me the details one more time?









Trumps Republican rivals keep thinking that if they just point out a few more details about him, voters will drop The Donald and turn to one of them instead. But you cant talk voters out of something that they havent been talked into.

Many have come to Trump out of a gut feeling that this is a guy who knows their pain, even if he really doesnt. Many of his supporters are from the #middleagewhitemalesmatter movement, for whom the current age of acceleration has not been kind and for whom Trumps rallies are their way of saying Can you hear me now? and of sticking it to all the people who exploited their pain but left them behind, particularly traditional Republican elites. They are not interested in Trumps details. They like his gut.

And no wonder. Those G.O.P. elites sold their own souls and their party so many times to charlatans and plutocrats that you wonder when its going to show up on closeout on eBay: For sale: The G.O.P. soul. Almost empty. This soul was previously sold to Sarah Palin, the Tea Party anarchists, Rush Limbaugh, Grover Norquist, the gun lobby, the oil industry, the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson and Fox News. Will bargain. No offer too low.

Normally smart people, like Mitt Romney, discarded all their best instincts to suck up to this ragtag assortment of self-appointed G.O.P. commissars, each representing a different slice of what came to be Republican orthodoxy  climate change is a hoax; abortion, even in the case of rape or incest, is impermissible; even common-sense gun laws must be opposed, no matter how many kids get murdered; taxes must always be cut and safety nets shrunk, no matter what the economic context; Obamacare must be destroyed, even though it was based on a Republican idea; and Iraq was a success even though it was a mess.

The G.O.P. became an accretion of ideas that ossified over the years without the party ever stopping to ask afresh: What world are we living in now? What are the dominant trends? And how does America best exploit them by applying conservative values and market-based solutions?

The cynicism of todays G.O.P. could not have been more vividly displayed than when Marco Rubio, John Kasich (a decent guy) and Ted Cruz all declared that they would support the partys nominee, even if it was Trump, right after telling voters he was a con man. No wonder so many Republicans are voting for Trump on the basis of what they think is in his guts. All the other G.O.P. candidates have none.

But even if his support is weakening, Democrats take Trump lightly at their peril. He is still sitting with three aces that he hasnt played yet. They could all come out in the general election.

One ace is that if he wins the nomination he will have no problem moving to the center to appeal to independents and minorities. He will have no problem playing the moderate unifier  and plenty of people will buy it, saying: Why not give him a chance? He says he can make us winners. Sure, Mexico will have to pay for that wall, Trump will say, but it will be in installments. Deport 11 million illegal immigrants? Cmon, dont you know an opening bid on an immigration bill when you hear one? Ban all Muslims? Well of course we cant ban a whole faith community, but Trump will vow to be much harder on visas from certain countries. Have you never read The Art of the Deal?

His second ace is that given the position he staked out on terrorism, if, God forbid, there is a major terrorist attack on our soil between now and Election Day, Trump will reap enormous political benefits. Watch out. Ive seen how one well-timed terrorist attack tilted an Israeli election.

His third ace is that he will indeed go after Hillary Clinton in ways you never heard before and that will delight and bring back a lot of disaffected Republicans, whose hatred of Hillary knows no bounds. Did you hear what Trump said about Hillary last night? That she was Bills enabler! Finally! I will vote for him just for that. Again, beware.

But Trump is also holding two jokers with those aces. One of the lessons I learned covering the Middle East is that the only good thing about extremists is that they dont know when to stop  and in the end, they often do themselves in. See: Saddam Hussein.

Trump has already gone places no candidate ever has, even telling us he has a big penis. One day he may go too far (if he hasnt already) and sever his gut connection with voters. Trumps other joker is that among those attracted to his gut are racists and fascists with a taste for violence at his rallies. One day they may go too far and do something so ugly, so brownshirt, it will also turn people off to his gut.

In short, only Trump can trump Trump. Dont count on it, but dont count it out.",[]

The steaks in a presidential election have never been higher.









After his victories in the Michigan and Mississippi Republican primaries on Tuesday night, Donald J. Trump held a news conference at his golf resort in Jupiter, Fla., in which he briefly turned cable news networks into his own personal warehouse club. With the usual row of United States flags was a display table of products: Americas brand alongside Mr. Trumps, not necessarily in that order. There was Trump Water, wines from Trump Winery and, above all, a bloody heap of steaks.

It was the most brazen display of meat in an American presidential campaign since last Thursdays Republican debate.

On a literal level, Mr. Trumps prime-time infomercial was a rebuttal to, and a taunt at, Mitt Romney, who, in a broadside last Thursday, had painted him as a business failure. After some opening remarks about the days vote and his immigration proposals, Mr. Trump turned to Job 1: defending his brand. I built a great, great company, Mr. Trump said. You have the water. You have the steaks. He added, You have the wines and all of that.

There was something atavistic about the exhibition. Mr. Trump was a chieftain demonstrating his potency with a flourish of baksheesh. (He offered reporters there a free bottle of wine.) He was a Bronze Age ruler displaying trophies to his challengers. Look on my works, ye Mitt, and despair!

Were the Trump Steaks the same product Mr. Trump once sold through the Sharper Image catalog? Was the magazine he brandished the same one Mr. Romney cited as a failure? Apparently not, but then again this contest, if not Mr. Trumps entire career, has been about appearance versus reality, or the ability of appearances to create their own reality.

Branding, Mr. Trumps specialty, is the capitalist version of transubstantiation. The businessman-celebrity bestows his blessing on a humble slab of meat and lo, it becomes a Trump Steak. The word made flesh, water and wine  from a candidate who once referred to the New Testament book as Two Corinthians. It was like the wedding at Cana meets the miracle of loaves and fishes, had they been catered by Ruths Chris.

The event also proved, again, Mr. Trumps ability to lease news network airtime rent-free. The cable news networks stuck with his remarks even as returns came in from a nail-biter of a Democratic primary in Michigan and that partys front-runner, Hillary Clinton, gave her own speech.

Given that Mrs. Clinton was on her way to a surprise loss in Michigan to Bernie Sanders, Mr. Trump may have run welcome interference for her. Nor was Mr. Trump the only candidate on Tuesday engaging in visual branding. Mr. Sanders gave brief remarks in front of what looked like someones wooden backyard deck, a few campaign placards tacked up behind him  the image contrasting his campaign against Mrs. Clintons more traditional political theater, his populist roughage against Mr. Trumps Vegas rib-eye buffet.

In part, Mr. Trumps extended airtime once again owes to his decision to hold news conferences on election nights, rather than making a standard speech. By taking questions after his remarks, he guarantees the cameras stay on him longer.

But theres also the now-familiar rubbernecking effect, the sense that  even as he rambles on about his poll numbers and his golf courses and his theory of never settling lawsuits  he might just say something wild. That, again, is where the steaks come in. Mr. Trump has a knack for creating just enough bizarre spectacle that newsroom producers feel it would be televisual malpractice to cut away.

And in the meantime, there was the image of him, surrounded by the products that sent the gut message he wanted to convey: success, luxury, abundance. Attack the authenticity of Donald Trumps steaks all you want, with as many facts as you like. He will still be there, selling the sizzle.",[]

Harold H. Saunders, a diplomat who helped draft the Camp David peace accords between Israel and Egypt in 1978 and helped negotiate the release of American hostages from the United States Embassy in Tehran in 1981, died on Sunday in McLean, Va. He was 85.









The cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, Carol.

Mr. Saunders served under six presidents, including Richard M. Nixon, for whom he shuttled among Middle East capitals with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger in the 1970s.

Mr. Saunders was an indispensable member of the Middle East team who was especially important in emphasizing the psychological and moral dimensions of problems, Dr. Kissinger said on Wednesday.

Hal was imperturbable, Gary G. Sick, a former colleague, wrote in All Fall Down: Americas Tragic Encounter With Iran, published in 1985.

He had looked disaster in the face in one negotiation after another over more than two decades and had concluded that despair was an emotion the negotiator could ill afford, Mr. Sick wrote. As he told his staff on many occasions, Our job is to take a 10 percent chance of success, try to turn it into a 20 percent chance, and hope for a break.

Mr. Saunders was credited as one of the architects of the Camp David accords, which President Jimmy Carter had midwived and which led to a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. Mr. Saunders had reportedly hoped to extract more concessions from Israel.

He was also the leading adviser to Deputy Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher, the Carter administrations chief negotiator during the Iran hostage crisis, in which revolutionaries seized the embassy and held 52 people hostage for 444 days to try to force the United States to return the deposed shah from New York, where he was being treated for cancer.

Harold Henry Saunders was born on Dec. 27, 1930, in Philadelphia to Harold M. Saunders, an architect, and the former Marian Weihenmayer, a jewelry designer.

He graduated from Princeton University in 1952 with a bachelors degree in English and received a doctorate in American studies from Yale University. After serving in the Air Force as a lieutenant and as an analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency, he joined the National Security Council staff in 1961.

Mr. Saunders was named a deputy assistant secretary of state in 1974, then director of the State Departments Bureau of Intelligence and Research, and served as assistant secretary for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs from 1978 to 1981.

After leaving government, he wrote several books about diplomacy, was associated with the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution, and was director of international affairs at the Kettering Foundation, a research group dedicated to furthering democracy.

His first wife, the former Barbara McGarrigle, died in 1973. In addition to his wife, the former Carol Jones Cruse, he is survived by a son, Mark; a daughter, Catherine; a stepdaughter, Caryn Hoadley; three grandchildren; and two step-grandsons.

In 1980, after the United States voted to support a United Nations resolution condemning the establishment of Israeli settlements on the West Bank of the Jordan River, Mayor Edward I. Koch of New York branded Mr. Saunders and four other American diplomats members of an Arabist gang of five who, Mr. Koch said, were in a position to do great damage to Israel.

Mr. Carter immediately repudiated the vote. (He said it had resulted from a miscommunication.)

Mr. Saunders later said that he had come to realize how difficult it would be for Israel to withdraw from the occupied West Bank. But while deploring violence, he often argued, as he did in an Op-Ed article for The New York Times, that the Palestine Liberation Organization belonged at the negotiating table and that the U.S. remains committed to a Jewish state  but to one sharing Palestine with its Arab neighbors, not dominating all of it.

Mr. Saunders was credited by a number of colleagues with adopting (many say originating) the phrase peace process for Mr. Kissingers efforts in the Middle East. He defined the term for William Safire, the On Language columnist for The New York Times Magazine, as encompassing a full range of political, psychological, economic, diplomatic and military actions woven together into a comprehensive effort to establish peace between Israel and its neighbors.

He later came to the conclusion, though, that not every comprehensive solution could be imposed by government. Asked by The Times as the millennium approached to name the new era, he suggested The Citizens Century.

An era has begun in which governments face more and more problems they cannot deal with, he explained. Citizens outside government increasingly have an opportunity to fill that void.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,The Presidential Plot Thickens,"['Gail Collins', 'Brooks Gail Collins', 'Arthur C']","Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Arthur Brooks: Hi, Gail. What a week, right? No huge surprises on Super Tuesday, as Trump increased his plurality with wins in a majority of states. Thursdays Republican debate was yet another dumpster fire of insults and name-calling.









But then the plot thickened. On Saturday, Cruz had massive wins in Kansas and Maine, and only narrowly lost to Trump in Kentucky and Louisiana. As of now, Cruz is closely trailing Trump in the delegate count  Trump is up 384-300. Rubio is a distant third at 151.

The Democrats, on the other hand, have gotten enviably boring. At this point, the Clinton campaigns grim march to victory is looking inevitable, right?

Gail Collins: Arthur, I have already admitted that the Hillary-Bernie battle has ceased to be all that thrilling. Really  issues, issues, issues. Yawn. Im sure the Democrats wish they could have all the excitement and color of Donald Trump stomping toward the nomination over the still-struggling bodies of the most hated man in the Senate and an increasingly juvenile Floridian whos terrified hell lose his own state.

Arthur: Youre a regular Don Rickles today. Next youll call John Kasich a hockey puck.

Gail: Show respect. Kasich beat Marco Rubio for third place in Maine. And hes promised that if hes elected hell reunite Pink Floyd.

Arthur: Well, reuniting Pink Floyd could be a controversial policy. Theyre foreigners and will take the jobs of hard-working American rock musicians.

I wanted to ask your thoughts on an under-reported factoid that caught my eye this week: Sanders actually took a slightly larger percentage of Democratic votes cast on Super Tuesday than Trump took on the Republican side (39 percent versus 38 percent). They were dead even in places like Virginia and Massachusetts. Yet the media reported Super Tuesday as a humiliation for Bernie and a huge, huge win for Trump.

I continue to maintain that Trumpmania is as much a press phenomenon as a popular phenomenon, and supply is in large part creating its own demand. What do you think?

Gail: The press hardly made him up. In fact, speaking on behalf of the political writers of America, I would like to point out that 99 percent of us totally discounted his candidacy until he started to climb in the polls.

Arthur: Youre right, almost everybody discounted his candidacy at first. But the media covered him like the O.J. trial. During one window last summer, he was given 78 percent of the primetime CNN coverage of all the Republican candidates. That was seven times the total airtime for the next closest contender. This amounted to a de facto press blackout on everyone else. Kind of amazing that Cruz or Rubio could get any traction at all.

Gail: Bottom line from the last week is that Cruz will probably be the last non-Donald standing. I know you dont take sides in these matters, but you know a lot of serious, establishment Republicans. What fills them with more horror  Nominee Cruz or Nominee Trump?

Arthur: Well, I think the term establishment is increasingly problematic now that it is used to describe Tea Party favorites like Senators Mike Lee and Ben Sasse. But to answer your question without picking sides myself, I have heard many on the center-right say they would prefer Cruz. The chief reason they give is the Supreme Court, where Cruz has won five cases. Those who support Cruz feel that he can be counted on to make appointments in the Scalia mold. And there is no fear that he might nominate Judge Judy.

Heres something I always meant to ask you. As a loyal fan of your regular column, I sense that you were a bit more optimistic about some of the mainstream Republican candidates early on, but then soured on all of them. What happened?

Gail: Optimistic is a term I would never use about this group. But it is true that early on I was impressed by the fresh faces on the Republican side. Fresh faces was obviously not a great Democratic plus factor.

Then it turned out all the fresh faces were terrible candidates. Just take the way Marco Rubio turned into a Trump Mini-me  the man who gave the Republican campaign the new theme of undersized genitals. Geesh.

Arthur: As the father of multiple teenagers (pray for me), I am not going to defend silly name-calling. But I cant agree at all that Rubio is a Trump clone. Like or dislike him, he is a serious candidate with a lot of policy ideas. And as far as I know, theres no Rubio University, Rubio Palace or Rubio Steaks.

Gail: Im not totally sure if Marco had ever been offered a chance at a line of steaks, hed have turned it down. This is not a guy who should be looking to do battle about personal finances.

Arthur: Who among us would turn down a fabulous line of steaks bearing our name? I think Brooks Steaks has a nice ring to it. Although I dont really eat that stuff, and also everyone would think it was David Brooks. So scratch that. But sorry  go on.

Gail: Well see what happens in the Florida primary, but Im betting we wont have Marco to kick around much longer.

You know, theres more to this story than a lack of quality opposition to Trump. The Republicans have also lost contact with their people. The degree of alienation between the party and its voters is way, way more than on the Democratic side.

Arthur: Again, not so sure I agree here. Its hard to find a young Democrat who doesnt have a jaundiced view of the Clinton coronation process. Sanders is a reaction against the party establishment and has the same level of support as Trump.

Gail: Totally different. Sanders has a well-formed ideology thats perfectly consistent. His big targets are Wall Street and its big campaign donors, which is hardly foreign material within the Democratic Party. And while its true that a lot of young people are not thrilled by the idea of another Clinton in the White House, I dont think Ive met any who wouldnt come out to vote for her against Trump or Cruz.

Imagine what the Republicans would give now for a completely qualified, mainstream leading contender, whatever the downside.

Arthur: I admire your mainstreaming of Bernie, but I continue to maintain that hes mostly a protest vote. His ideology is indeed consistent  with Eugene V. Debs and other 1920s socialists. I hear his pick to replace Scalia would be the French economist Thomas Piketty. O.K., I just made that up for effect. But still.

As to everyone voting for Clinton over Trump, its sort of notable that erstwhile Democratic candidate Jim Webb this week said he wouldnt vote for Hillary Clinton, but he wouldnt rule out voting for Trump. Whether or not this would ever really happen, its kind of a striking statement, right?

Gail: Jim Webb is  I dont know. A guy who always thought he was a bigger deal than reality suggested. Now in such a deep sulk that hes looking for the most shocking thing he can say to get attention. Anybody who desperately wants publicity is going to announce for Donald Trump. If youre a Dancing with the Stars also-ran trying to rekindle a career, chances are your publicist is not going to urge you to endorse Marco Rubio.

Arthur: Before we finish, I want to get your prediction on whats about to happen in the Republican Party. What do you think are the odds that no one wins a majority of delegates and we wind up with an open convention in Cleveland?

Gail: Every political writer goes to bed at night and dreams of an open convention. Wed be breaking the news about sudden movement in the Nebraska delegation and the whole world would be hanging on every word. So I am definitely in favor, but sort of dubious that it will happen in the real world.

But youre way better at numbers than I am. Whats your bet?

Arthur: Lots and lots of unhappy Republicans are hoping for this, but I think you are right  it is still a pretty remote possibility. The winner-take-all primaries on the 15th make it more likely that even a candidate with considerably less than a majority of votes gets more than 50 percent of the delegates at the convention.

But if its Trump, what then? Heres a multiple-choice quiz for you:

Republicans fall in line and support Trump; the party fractures, with a big percentage overtly disavowing their nominee and staying home; a movement takes shape to start a new party or support a third-party candidate; we all wake up and say, I had the weirdest dream last night.

Gail: Well, if theyre going for C, theyd better get their act together and start collecting signatures this weekend. Since Trump has virtually no personal convictions when it comes to the issues, I can imagine him sewing up the nomination and then coming out with a traditional, responsible-sounding platform that would give some of the Republican mainstream cover.

Arthur: Plus, free steaks for everybody!

Gail: Can I throw a rhetorical question at you? Republican leaders like Mitt Romney who are suddenly standing up to Trump  where were they two months ago? Arent they a little late to the fair?

Arthur: I think they just didnt believe that Trump was an authentic threat, and didnt want to alienate his supporters unnecessarily. It kind of reminds me of what my Democratic friends explained to me when Al Sharpton  who they privately felt was a polarizing, negative figure  was briefly running for president in 2004.

Gail: The idea that a blast from Mitt Romney is going to mute the Trump boom at this point in the game is pretty hilarious. I am tempted to say that Romneys only chance of having an impact would be to tie Donald to the roof of his car.

Arthur: Ha. So much for your promise to retire Seamus the Irish setter.

I doubt Romney expected to move the race, but Im sure he felt it was the right thing to do to speak up publicly about what he sees as a major threat to his party and country. Perhaps it came too late, but at least he went on record with his views.

So what can we expect in the coming week? We hear from Michigan today, but afterward, the primary schedule gets remarkably quiet. Well have to content ourselves with returns from the Guam primary on Saturday. Also, I hear the District of Columbia holds its Republican caucus in Room 308 of the Capitol Hilton, if anyone shows up. Last I heard, the D.C. Republican Party membership was down to approximately eight.

Gail: As Guam goes, so goes the nation. And this week, weve got debates! Dems on Wednesday, Republicans on Thursday. All signs point to a boring, issue-oriented exchange on the Democratic side while the four guys in suits bring thrills, chills and lots of insults. Its like a PBS round-table discussion on campaign finance versus a Don Rickles Celebrity Roast. So lucky for the G.O.P. to be on the exciting end of everything, hehehehe.

Arthur: I think youre right that theres an exciting week ahead for the Republicans, but my spider sense tells me that it will be something more substantial than chair-throwing at the debate. Stay tuned.",[]

Season 2, Episode 7, Williams and Walker









Several significant things happened in Friday nights episode of The Knick, titled Williams and Walker. Lucy Elkins and Henry Robertson finally had sex. Thackery separated the conjoined twins Nika and Zoya. Gallinger reached his lowest point yet, sabotaging Edwardss surgery on D.W. Garrison Carr. The famous vaudeville duo of Bert Williams and George Walker entertained the swells at the gala benefit for the new uptown Knickerbocker Hospital.

But the real stars were Steven Soderbergh and his camera. Mr. Soderbergh (serving as his own cinematographer) opened the gala sequence with a continuous two-and-a-half-minute shot through a series of grand spaces that was showy but undeniably impressive. The camera followed two couples  the Edwardses, Algernon and Opal, and Bertie Chickering and his date, Genevieve Everidge  across a foyer and through a door into a ballroom, where it rose fluidly to survey the dancers, then slowly backed away in a different direction, into a corridor where it picked up Herman Barrow and Captain Robertson.

It changed direction again to follow them back to the foyer, where it rose and did a complete 360-degree circle around the clustered Robertsons and Showalters before once again slowly backing up, across the room, until Lucy and Henry walked in front of it, waving to the other Robertsons who were now in the distance. It was the kind of bravura moment Mr. Soderbergh indulges in every once in a while, as if to say, Yeah, its TV. So what? Planning and rehearsing that one shot must have taken as much time as some television shows devote to filming an entire episode.

Back to those other things that happened. There were actually two initial sexual experiences depicted in the episode. Chickering and Everidge were first, and their coupling was as playful and jittery as the Elkins-Robertson pairing was calculated and practiced. Literally practiced  Lucy sat in on a session between Ping Wu and one of his prostitutes, even offering Wu her unstockinged foot as a sexual aid.

Thackerys revolutionary surgery on the twins was a little anticlimactic  it was at best the third story line in the episode. Still unsure of himself, he snorted cocaine, swigged turpentine and made a late-night, pre-op visit to the grave of Sonya Smyslov, the little girl whose death haunts him (so much that he paid $65 for an imposing headstone). As the jangling metallic noises on the soundtrack grew louder, Thack reached into his pocket for a fix but then decided to call Abigail instead. The cure for addiction apparently isnt lobotomy or hypnosis, its having the woman you love say she believes in you. Now riding high, he went into his showman mode and successfully separated the twins before a packed gallery, though not before summoning Henry Robertson to record the operation on his new motion-picture camera. Afterward the always curious Thackery asked about the mysterious substance used to record the images, and was told it was a new invention called celluloid.

Cornelia Robertson finally got more than a few minutes onscreen, and her investigation of the health inspector Speights murder actually took an interesting turn  she determined that the skullduggery by which sick immigrants were snuck into the country (rather than sent back to Europe) was being initiated by her own familys shipping company. Later her creepy father-in-law walked in on her when she was in her robe, but rather than make advances, he berated her for wasting her time on Speight when she should be doing her duty to the Showalter family by getting pregnant. Then things got worse: her husband, Phillip, told her that her father was in debt to his father, and that she needed to go along with his fathers wishes or see her father ruined.

And then there was poor Algy Edwards, dumped on by everyone in sight. (1) Carr, with Opals support, forced Edwardss hand and got himself admitted as the hospitals first black patient (not counting those Edwards secretly treated in the basement). Thackery, who hadnt yet asked the hospitals board about admitting African-Americans, threw up his hands and said, You fight this alone. (2) After the gala, Opal confronted Captain Robertson about Edwardss role at the new hospital, and it was clear from his non-answer that Algy might not have any role. (3) Edwardss showcase, the hernia surgery on Carr, was ruined when Gallingers doctored curare caused Carr to stop breathing and lose his pulse. Gallinger then leaped to the rescue, correctly diagnosing the condition (which he had caused) and successfully blaming it on Edwards. The episode ended with Edwards trying to figure out what had happened  you suspect he will turn the tables on Gallinger before the season ends  and being comforted by Opal, who told him, in words freighted with meaning, Youre going to have better days.

A quick note on Williams and Walker, whose blackface minstrel-show act didnt appear to unduly offend even the proud Opal. They were the leading black performers of their day, popularizing the cakewalk dance and billing themselves as Two Real Coons  the phrase used by Herman Barrows wife when she introduced them  to distinguish themselves from the many white vaudevillians who wore blackface.

Let us know your thoughts about Williams and Walker. A question for discussion: will Lucy Elkinss bold strategy to win Henry Robertson prove effective, or will Cornelias warning about the difference in their stations  I dont want you to be crushed  be prophetic?",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,The Echo From Amazon Brims With Groundbreaking Promise,"['Farhad Manjoo', 'State Of The Art']","Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Many of the worlds largest technology companies have spent the last five years searching in vain for the holy grail, a machine to succeed the smartphone as the next must-have gadget.









They have made digital watches and fitness trackers, all manner of computerized glasses and goggles, and more doodads to plug into your TV than there are shows to watch on it.

Yet at the moment, the most promising candidate for the Next Great Gadget isnt made by Apple, Google, Facebook or Microsoft. Instead, it is the Echo, a screenless, voice-controlled household computer built by Amazon  a company whose last big foray into consumer electronics, the Fire Phone, was a humiliating flop.

This time it may be different. A bit more than a year after its release, the Echo has morphed from a gimmicky experiment into a device that brims with profound possibility. The longer I use it, the more regularly it inspires the same sense of promise I felt when I used the first iPhone  a sense this machine is opening up a vast new realm in personal computing, and gently expanding the role that computers will play in our future.

What is most interesting about the Echo is that it came out of nowhere. It isnt much to look at, and even describing its utility is difficult. Here is a small, stationary machine that you set somewhere in your house, which you address as Alexa, which performs a variety of tasks  playing music, reading the news and weather, keeping a shopping list  that you can already do on your phone.

But the Echo has a way of sneaking into your routines. When Alexa reorders popcorn for you, or calls an Uber car for you, when your children start asking Alexa to add Popsicles to the grocery list, you start to want pretty much everything else in life to be Alexa-enabled, too.

In this way, Amazon has found a surreptitious way to bypass Apple and Google  the reigning monarchs in the smartphone world  with a gadget that has the potential to become a dominant force in the most intimate of environments: our homes.

If all this sounds over-the-top, read some of the reviews. On Amazons site, the Echo has racked up more stars than an Oscars party. Amazon doesnt release sales numbers, but the company is investing big in Echo. It ran Super Bowl ads to push the device and last week it unveiled two new versions of the machine. One is a portable version of the Echo and the other is meant to plug into existing speaker systems.

Scot Wingo, the chairman of ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce consulting firm, said the early signs suggested that the Echo was on a path to become Amazons next $1 billion business.

Its one of the most sold-out things that I see on Amazon, Mr. Wingo said. Its an unusual thing for Amazon to be out of something, but for the Echo, its usually in stock just for a couple weeks before it goes out of stock for a few days  so it feels like theyre having trouble making enough of the devices. Mr. Wingo noted the Echo, which Amazon sells for $180 only through its own site, was selling for $200 to $300 on eBay.

When the Echo was introduced in a goofy video in late 2014, on the heels of the failure of the Fire Phone, it was widely ridiculed. The Echos utility was not obvious, and in its earliest incarnation, it seemed a bit of a ditz. But there are a couple of reasons it has earned such raves from users.

First, its simple to learn, and its voice-recognition capabilities are more intuitive than those of many other vocal assistants (like Apples Siri or Google Now). More than that, it keeps gaining new powers.

During an interview at a media event last week, Dave Limp, Amazons senior vice president for devices, said the company created the Echo because it had seen interesting possibilities arising out of advances in microphone technology, speech recognition and cloud connectivity. Amazons engineers spent years perfecting the devices unusual capabilities. Unlike competing assistants, the Echo can be activated hands-free from far across the room (Siri only works from a couple of feet away), and it can decipher your voice in noisy environments, even when its playing music.

Amazon also worked to make sure the device responded very quickly. Early on in the product, to play music took eight or nine seconds, and its just unusable when its like that, Mr. Limp said. Now its often 1,000 milliseconds or 1,200 milliseconds.

The speed makes a crucial difference. Compared with the trudge of chatting with Siri, speaking to Alexa feels natural, closer to speaking to a human than a machine  and even when it gets your request wrong, which in your early days with the device will happen often, it doesnt feel like you have paid a huge penalty for trying.

More important, just like the early iPhone, Amazon has managed to turn the Echo into the center of a new ecosystem. Developers are flocking to create voice-controlled apps for the device, or skills, as Amazon calls them. There are now more than 300 skills for the Echo, from the trivial  there is one to make Alexa produce rude body sounds on command  to the pretty handy. It can tell you transit schedules, start a seven-minute workout, read recipes, do math and conversions, and walk you through adventure games, among other possibilities.

Makers of digital home devices like Nest are also rushing to make their products compatible with the Echo. Alexa can now control your Internet-connected lights, home thermostats and a variety of other devices. Hardware makers can also add Alexas brain into their own devices, so soon you wont need an Echo to consult with Alexa  you could find it in your toaster, your refrigerator or your car.

Amazons open-platform strategy for the Echo calls to mind Amazon Web Services, its multibillion-dollar cloud business that also came out of left field to best competitors. It is patterned very much off of the successful formula that A.W.S. uses, Mr. Limp said.

The Echo also ties in to Amazons main business, its retail store. When you tell it to reorder popcorn, it gets your order through Amazon, of course. Still, Mr. Wingo noted that Amazon had so far kept the platform relatively open  other retailers and product manufacturers are free to build their own apps that will allow for interactions with their stores.

The Echo is far from perfect. It still gets queries wrong and it still feels like its missing potentially useful features. Mr. Limp concedes this. Amazons teams keep working to add new tricks to the Echo, he said. The device also faces limited retail distribution  its unusual enough that it would benefit from being displayed on shelves, but Amazons retail rivals are unlikely to stock it anytime soon. (Some analysts have speculated that Amazons retail plans may be an effort to show off its hardware.)

Amazon would be wise to step on the gas because while the Echo has no direct competitors, a few may be emerging. Among them is SoundHound, a start-up that has been working on voice-recognition for more than a decade, which is now offering hardware makers access to its service. Within the next year, according to the company, lots of gadgets will be using SoundHounds software to talk to users.

Do you want that? As I argued recently, the F.B.I.s battle with Apple over encryption should prompt deep questions about a future of Internet-connected devices spread around our homes. Amazon has strong privacy protections in the Echo. It doesnt stream anything without the wake word and it has a physical mute button that electrically disconnects the microphone but, as with all groundbreaking technology, there is no doubt we are entering new territory here.

Yet, the Echo is so useful it may be worth the gamble. Many in the industry have long looked to the smartphone as the remote control for your world. But the phone has limitations. A lot of times fiddling with a screen is just too much work. By perfecting an interface that is much better suited to home use  the determined yell!  Amazon seems on the verge of building something like Iron Mans Jarvis, the artificial-intelligence brain at the center of all your household activities. Who could say no to that?",[]

nytimes.com,2016-02-26 00:00:00,Review: Prodigals by Greg Jackson Skewers the Elite,['Dwight Garner'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The writing in Greg Jacksons first book of stories, Prodigals, is so bold and perceptive that it delivers a contact high. You know from the first pages that, intellectually, youve climbed into a high-performance sports car. Only one question remains: Will the author smash it into a tree?









Mr. Jackson is a student and a satirist of elite lives. His characters are filmmakers and architects and writers and tennis pros, some of them newly released from one of those prestigious East Coast schools whose graduates are cagey about where they went. A few are flourishing; others hang on by a fingernail.

Most are in their late 30s and approaching reckonings of various sorts. There are flashbacks to slightly earlier times, when there was indiscriminate sex and cocaine inhaled from the keys of ecologically responsible cars.

The micro-details of previous lost weekends pile up: We smoked cigarettes and joints, sucked on lozenges lacquered in hash oil. We tried one anothers benzos and antivirals, Restoril, Avodart, Yaz, and Dexedrine, looking for contraindications. We ate well: cassoulets, steak frites, squid-ink risotto with porcini, spices from Andhra Pradesh, Kyoto, Antwerp. Of course we drank: pure agaves, rye whiskeys, St-Germain, old Scotch. Two women are said to be so oppressively hip there are about four square blocks in the world where they can exist.

Photo

Clearly, Mr. Jacksons characters can sometimes be easy to dislike. They know this about themselves. This gives these stories some of their tang. No one is overly interested in being kind. When one man meets his wifes old friend, that friend looked me over like a rental billed a notch or two above its class.

These characters play rough, and for keeps. We grow into our toughness like snakes, one of them thinks, molting hope. They are past embarrassment. Their plain-spokenness gives Mr. Jacksons dialogue a lot of topspin. One woman speaks for many of them when she comments, I cant be held responsible for every dreadful remark that escapes my mouth.

Mr. Jackson enters these worlds with wit and sympathy and a good deal of heart. In terms of the entitled milieu, you may sometimes feel you are reading a furious, Instagram-era updating of Ann Beatties short stories, which makes a certain amount of sense: Mr. Jackson was her writing student at the University of Virginia.

Theres also the crunch of writers like Ian McEwan and Martin Amis in Mr. Jacksons prose. Best of all theres that sense  only the excellent ones give it to you  that whatever topic the author turns his mental LED lights toward will be powerfully illuminated.

Im not sure Ive read a better description of what it feels like to drink two bourbons on an empty stomach than this one: That sunburnt feeling is moving inside of me, like light breaking in double time over the crops.

And Im not sure Ive read a better description of a certain kind of successful man in late middle age, the kind who is giving off the captured firelight of time spent in the timbered lodges of Jackson Hole and has the vital febrility of coronaries survived.

There is goose-pimpling writing about Terry Gross (demotic ur-parent, Catcher in the WHYY), envy (You need people well enough informed to understand just how enviable you are), and the odd poignancy of The New York Review of Books, which continued to devote such good minds and scholarship to what after five minutes in the desert sun, driving with the top down by imitation-adobe strip malls full of nail salons and smoothie shops and physical therapy outlets, was almost painfully irrelevant.

This collection is front-loaded; the best of these eight stories come early. One is about a young couple in France, visiting a reclusive tennis star and his wife. Another is about a man and his female therapist, who are forced to share a long car ride to escape New York City during a hurricane. Other stories deal with families, especially siblings. Mr. Jackson has a special interest in friends and lovers who meet again after years apart, so he can explore the gaps between what is and what might have been.

The later stories in Prodigals, on the figurative B-side, are more experimental and a bit less persuasive. One of them, appropriately enough, is titled Metanarrative Breakdown. Yet none are a waste of time. None are car crashes.

What makes these stories radiant, rather than merely prickly, is how invested Mr. Jackson is in peeling off the rind of life, in getting to the juice. For what if not pockets of intensity, one of his characters thinks, were we in the business of living?

If these people are often brash, well, they have observed that life gave its fruit to the bold, the unhesitant. There is no small talk. One character describes himself as a person who doesnt believe in rules or in standing on ceremony, lifes too strange.

When Mr. Jacksons characters cant (or wont) hold one another up, they find solace in stories. One man in extremis says: In the days that follow, it is books and books alone that make me not want to die.

This man discovers that literature was the only sort of arrival I could count on, an intimacy that wouldnt desert me, that didnt ask too much or fray fatally in the endless conflict of our competing needs, that permitted  or maybe simply was  the passage of experience back through us, our way of ravaging the endless ravishment of life.

The passage of experience back through us  thats a powerful line, and it represents what this young writer is capable of delivering, right now and, if fortune smiles, long into the future.",[]

SATURDAY PUZZLE  Roland Huget is back, and he says below that he might have filled his puzzle differently these days, compared with how he filled it when it was submitted. Thats reasonable. We all evolve over time. And at least Mr. Huget can claim to be the guy who first introduced BARE IT ALL in The New York Times crossword.

There is some less-than-desirable fill here, like ENOL, TALCUMS and ECH, but there is also some really good fill, like SILENT TREATMENT, ILL BE THERE (I defy you to fill that in without humming), NO SIREE BOB, CRIME SCENE, MENNONITE, PETER FALK, THE HEIRESS (great movie!), ARMWRESTLE, HERE AND NOW and I LOVE L.A. I enjoyed filling in JASMINE, but had never heard of it referred to as the name of a color. I drink JASMINE tea, though and, come to think of it, it is sort of a pale yellow. Live and learn.

There was a lot of good cluing in todays puzzle, but the one that nearly made me do a spit take was 38 Acrosss Bush native to the South, for JEB. It just sits there so quietly, waiting to be discovered, and of all the ways to clue JEB, that misdirection is the last way I would have expected to see it. Very clever.

Lets check in with Mr. Huget:

Constructors Notes

This is my third crossword in The New York Times. From now on, Ill stop keeping count in the constructor notes. The crossword we see before us is actually the third version that was submitted using this grid skeleton. I recall several aborted attempts at this grid before I completed a fill that I felt comfortable in submitting, in the summer of 2013. It was rejected, and from that effort only HERE AND NOW made its way into the final version, although not in the same word slot. The second version was submitted in late 2013, just when I was starting to get the hang of crossword construction. It too was rejected, but the top and bottom stacks and the vertical SILENT TREATMENT got a thumbs-up. The final version, incorporating these elements, was completed in June of 2014, and was accepted for publication in September of that year. Its interesting to revisit an early construction that one hasnt seen in a while. Thankfully, there arent any entries here that make me cringe, but my style definitely has changed since this puzzle was produced. More than I realized, this puzzle is tailored to the over-50 crowd. I hope younger solvers arent put off by that. My favorite clues are 26A: MENNONITE: [One speaking the language Plautdietsch] and 56A: ARM WRESTLE: [Try to win hands down?]. I cant claim credit for either.

Its official: The shirt that turned the actor Colin Firth into a heartthrob  and helped fuel the continuing global Jane Austen pandemonium  is coming to the United States.

The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington confirmed that it has secured a loan of the billowing white shirt worn by Mr. Firth in an indelible scene in the 1995 BBC mini-series of Pride and Prejudice.

It will be on view starting in August as part of the exhibition Will & Jane: Shakespeare, Austen, and the Cult of Celebrity, alongside relics including a bundle of wood collected at Shakespeares birthplace, a bottle of Austen-inspired Bath Gin (tagline: Gin of a different persuasion), and Will and Jane action figures.

In the scene, Mr. Firth, playing the aloof Mr. Darcy, dives into a pond and emerges with the garment molded to his strapping physique.

The Regency wet T-shirt moment appears nowhere in Austens novel, but it has inspired homages like the 12-foot fiberglass-coated Darcy that temporarily rose out of a London pond in 2013 and a photo re-enactment by Benedict Cumberbatch, done as a charity fund-raiser, that caused heart palpitations across the Internet in 2014.

The shirt seemed like a celebrity object that demonstrated the kind of fun that people have with Austen as an author, said Janine Barchas, a University of Texas English professor who is a curator of the show with Kristina Straub of Carnegie Mellon University. It exemplifies the kind of play that is central to our whole exhibition.

The Shirt, as the exhibition label will call it, belongs to the British costume supply house Cosprop, which said it received several requests a year for Mr. Darcys garments. (Like Rin Tin Tin, the Shirt was actually played by several shirts, given the need for a dry one before each take.) And no, you cant rent it to wear, say, to your prom.

The costumes hired from Cosprops exhibition department are for display purposes only and must not be worn at any time, a representative said by email.

A half-serious proposal to keep the shirt wet and molded to its display dummy by using misters like those in grocery store produce sections was deemed curatorially unsound, Ms. Barchas said. But outside the protective glass case, the library is bracing for a humid reception.

We will be giving the Folger some Windex, to be used in what we anticipate will be a daily wiping-down of lipstick marks, Ms. Barchas said.",[]

PARIS  Firing an employee in France often means a court date, months of hearings and hefty payouts under the countrys 3,400-page labor code. Employers hate the thick book.









But workers  those lucky enough to have a job  love it. On Wednesday, thousands went into the streets across France to protect it, demonstrating against a new government plan to make firings slightly easier and Frances trademark shortened workweek slightly longer.

Nothing for years has so revived labor tensions  or divided the Socialist Party  as the governments plan to reform the voluminous labor code, removing, ever so slightly, a few layers of worker protection.

Desperate to reduce a near-permanent unemployment rate of more than 10 percent, the Socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls has risked taking a delicate paring knife to the Bible-thick labor code, a step that members of his party consider a heresy.

In doing so, Mr. Valls and his tiny reform faction have revived a conflict over labor overhauls that has already played out elsewhere in Europes left, but that has tormented the French Socialists ever since they took power in 2012.

Continue reading the main story Todays Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Mr. Valls says he is determined to fix a broken French system that has left employers so fearful of long-term hires that 90 percent of jobs created in France last year were unstable, poorly paid and short term.

You engage yourself practically for life when you sign a contract, said Francois Asselin, a businessman who heads the confederation of small- and medium-size companies in France.

When you want to lay off an employee there is considerable legal and financial risk, he said. In France, to lay someone off, youve got to be totally documented, so you wont be accused of an abusive firing. 

Mr. Vallss departures from leftist orthodoxy, however, run the risk of breaking his own Socialist party.

Why are they doing this one year away from the election, groaned Catherine Lemorton, a Socialist parliamentary deputy, in an interview Wednesday. This law which offends so much of our electorate, or whats left of it?

Mr. Valls, pugnacious and combative, boxes in his spare time, and the law was introduced with characteristic brusqueness and little explanation. The reaction has been explosive.

For weeks the Socialist partys rank and file has cried betrayal. Hundreds of thousands have signed an online petition demanding that the government scrap its plan. Deputies in Parliament have revolted. The unions  its a return to the 19th century, grumbled one leader  have vowed to kill the plan.

One of the leading Socialist lights, the mayor of Lille, Martine Aubry, who wrote Frances 35-hour workweek as a government minister, wrote a furious editorial in Le Monde declaring: Not this, not us, not the Left!

On Wednesday, as the government hunkered down to ponder its dwindling options, thousands of demonstrators  workers, union officials, students  poured into the streets of the countrys cities.

The student mobilization against the plan was especially strong.

That kind of society, we dont want anything to do it! read one of the student demonstration banners at the Place de la Republique in Paris.

This baffled government officials, who said the plan was developed with students in mind, to open up more long-term employment and diminish exploitative short-term jobs.

They want to make us Kleenex employees, throwaway employees! said Patricia Deschamp, an Air France worker handing out leaflets at the big demonstration near the employers federation here on the Left Bank.

We have minimal security now, and we will have even less after, she said.

Yet the agitated crowds were in the streets for a level of protection far higher than in many developed countries and against a change that even its defenders characterized as no more than mild.

The main provision puts a cap on payouts to laid-off employees, based on seniority. Labor court judges would not have near-limitless discretion to award huge payouts.

Equally infuriating to the unions, the law defines more precisely when a company can invoke economic reasons to justify layoffs. Workers who refuse to go along with temporary workload increases in the event of increased business could be laid off, too.

It will simplify the procedures to layoffs, said Philippe Aghion, a Harvard economist who is French and who lectures at the prestigious College de France. You wont have to go through endless judicial procedures. There will be less discretion for the judges. Now, there is enormous discretion on the amount.

The uncertainty factor is a killer for hiring, the business owners say. All we are asking for is a limit on the ceiling, said Mr. Asselin, whose company is a leader in the restoration of Frances historic buildings.

Now, there are no limits, he said. Sometimes the fines are so big they endanger the employer. So today, it is risky to hire people.

The unions here, keen to protect their already-employed members, speak relatively little about the ranks of the unemployed. Yet many economists contend that the French level of protection for workers is poisonous to the job market.

There is a large body of evidence that increasing levels of protection for existing workers is detrimental to the labor market, particularly on weaker categories of workers, the young and women, said Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, a French economist who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley.

If we want to address the fact that its a labor market that excludes many, many people from a decent level of job protection by forcing them into short-term jobs, we have to address these conditions, he said. The current administration has accepted this perspective.

France, however is a difficult country to reform, as Mr. Aghion and others pointed out. Cultural shifts like those proposed by the current government always bring people into the streets.

We are a country of revolutionaries and conservatives, at the same time, said Marc Lazar, a historian at the Institut dEtudes Politiques. Playing into this is the French lefts deep attachment to advances acquired in the past, Mr. Lazar said.

The prevailing sentiment is that you shouldnt touch the labor code, because we prefer equality to liberty, protection to adventure.",[]

A new study suggests that women with asthma exposed to air pollution, even before conception, significantly increase their risk of delivering a premature baby.

Researchers studied 223,502 pregnancies among 204,175 women in 19 hospitals across the United States, gathering data on air quality in each region.

The study, in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, found that all women with asthma were more likely than those without to deliver preterm. But there were significant increases in preterm birth in asthmatic women exposed to air pollution, including traffic-related pollutants.

Air pollution also appeared to take a toll even before conception. Asthmatic women exposed to pollutants in the three months before conception were at a 28 percent higher risk for preterm birth than women without asthma exposed at the same time in the same conditions.

Thats a window that hasnt been studied before, said the lead author, Pauline Mendola, an epidemiologist with the National Institutes of Health. We saw the increase for both groups, but it was much higher for women with asthma.

Air pollution may be unavoidable, but Dr. Mendola said that pregnant women should avoid outdoor activity when pollution levels rise.

The Environmental Protection Agency issues air pollution advisories when conditions are bad, she said. Theyre not specifically for pregnant women, but pregnant women with asthma should be particularly aware of them.

TUESDAY PUZZLE  This was a straightforward circled-answer puzzle with a good number of long clues for early in the week  potentially slow going for a new solver, but the corners used crossword standards like ASSUAGE, THANE and UPROOT that you will encounter again. Odd little semi-words like AHH, URL and SLR contributed to the challenge here.

For some reason, I knew OTTO PREMINGER had directed Anatomy of a Murder. Right away and right across the middle, then, my answers spread quickly in all directions. I cant for the life of me remember seeing the movie itself, but, like most of us, I did go through a Jimmy Stewart phase so it could have happened. I registered otter at that point, but the nature of the beast didnt become clear until I got MINUTE STEAK. SETTHETABLE and FUSEBOX came fairly easily after that.

The spelling and definition of MESHUGA sent me to the archives and the Internet, because I had heard and spoken so many variations and it looked funny on paper, but that is The New York Times-ordained spelling, so that was something I learned today, my bubelehs.

David Steinberg corroborates my findings, and, as it turns out, I did get lucky with that Jimmy Stewart thing:

Constructors Notes:

I constructed this puzzle just over a year ago. At the time, I was making almost all themelesses, so I decided to construct a themed puzzle for the sake of variety. Im not sure where the inspiration for this puzzle came from, but I was fortunate to find just enough types of fur to scrape together a theme set. Interestingly, both OTTO PREMINGER and OTTO KLEMPERER wouldve worked for the center theme entry  I chose OTTO PREMINGER because I felt he would be more familiar to early-week solvers. I settled on this grid pattern because I wanted to give solvers something a little different from the several theme entries with a pair of long downs structure used in most themed 1515 crosswords these days. I personally use the traditional layout the majority of the time, but when I end up with a theme set that I could go a different direction with, I like to switch things up. The 74-word grid with all the 7s was definitely a challenge, but I was pleased to work in MESHUGA, JUNIPER and BLASTER. Keeping the less savory bits to a minimum was significantly harder, but Im pleased with how the fill turned out over all (with the exception of NATALE, which the Tuesday solver in me is grumbling about!). I hope you enjoy my puzzle. One of the R.A.s in my dorm just started solving The New York Times crossword  as of right now, he only attempts Mondays, so Im hoping this puzzle will persuade him to graduate to Tuesday!

It is Science Times Tuesday, and I was reminded by this puzzle of the Russian Fox experiment, a decades-long project that dissipated along with the Soviet Union, but still pops up on nature shows and in genetics classes. An attempt was made to breed foxes that were less aggressive and less inclined to bite their captors on a fur farm; the result was a complete and rapid domestication, and the new, sweeter foxes proved more lucrative as exotic pets for the ultrarich than fabric for same.

Lucky little critters. Although, you never know...

It was, they both acknowledged, an unlikely romance: Margaret Lavigne and Chris Plum had met, fallen in love and married at a long-term acute care hospital in Connecticut, where they continued to live, both of them using wheelchairs because of muscular dystrophy.

Yet the marriage flourished in the time they had together, and they let it be widely known, as the subjects of Good Night Margaret, an 11-minute video documentary produced in 2014 by The New York Times. In the video, Ms. Lavigne and Mr. Plum spoke candidly about living with a disability, in their cases caused by muscular dystrophy, a group of inherited diseases that result in progressive muscle weakness.

Ms. Lavigne, who spent much of her life working on behalf of people with disabilities, died on Feb. 29. She was 44.

The two met in 2011 shortly after Mr. Plum moved into the Hospital for Special Care in New Britain, Conn., which treats critically ill patients, many of whom have few prospects for improvement.

Mr. Plum said he worked up the nerve to ask her out about a year later. They spent their first date in a private area of the hospital watching the movie Fantastic Mr. Fox and eating takeout Chinese food.

Continue reading the main story Video

In 2013, they were married. Everybody wants the one, Ms. Lavigne, known as Muffi, said in the documentary. I did not expect to find him here, of all places.

Before her condition required more care, Ms. Lavigne lived in Rockville, Md., a suburb of Washington, for 13 years. She worked for United Cerebral Palsy as well as for the Presidents Committee on Employment of People With Disabilities, according to an obituary written by her family. She also testified for a presidential commission on consumer protection and quality in the health care industry.

Ms. Lavigne later enrolled in a masters degree program in architecture at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to focus on design in public buildings and housing, Mr. Plum said. But she fell ill about halfway through the three-year program and withdrew, moving into the Hospital for Special Care in 2008.

She had to make a very big transition from the big independent disability rights movement, where the idea of living in an institution is objectionable, Mr. Plum said.

Ms. Lavigne was born on March 12, 1971, in Concord, Mass. She was 7 when she learned she had muscular dystrophy.

My parents never considered me having a disability, and I didnt either, she said in the documentary. You learn to have a little tougher skin, but thats a lifelong journey for anyone.

Besides her husband, she is survived by her parents, Debora and James Lavigne; a sister, Laurie Kerr; and her grandmother, Nancy M. Lauriat.

Ive had people ask me, Do you ever wish you could walk again, or not have the disease? Ms. Lavigne said in the film. But if Ive got Chris, Id take it.",[]

PARIS  The final day of Paris Fashion Week brought epic thunderstorms and a shower of actresses, models and singers onto the Louis Vuitton front row.

There was Jaden Smith, son of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith and the star of the recent Louis Vuitton womens wear campaign, alongside the actresses Lea Seydoux, Jennifer Connelly and Alicia Vikander, still riding high after winning her Oscar last month and clad in Vuitton, of course. Karlie Kloss was a catwalk spectator for once, while Selena Gomez, the pint-size pop star and a favored face of the brand, was a little concerned about her straight locks as she sat waiting for the show to begin.

Selena, did you survive the deluge on your way in?

Well, I did, but Im a little concerned about my hair. Its super curly naturally, and Im surprised it hasnt frizzed up around my ears. I keep trying to surreptitiously check it is staying put.

What have you been doing since you arrived in Paris?

Mainly in the studio and rehearsing for my upcoming tour. This is my only fashion week show. And then Im off to London for more music projects.

Are there any traditions in Paris that you uphold?

Yes. I go to my favorite Chinese restaurant, its called Dave on the Rue de Richelieu, and the food is absolutely sensational. I go and eat there every time Im in the city. Its divine.

Wearing Louis Vuitton?

A Manhattan jury convicted Elliot Morales of murder as a hate crime on Wednesday in the fatal shooting of a gay man in the West Village nearly three years ago.









The jury of four men and eight women deliberated for two days after two weeks of emotional testimony in State Supreme Court, during which Mr. Morales represented himself and took the witness stand to declare he was not prejudiced toward gay people. Murder as a hate crime carries a minimum sentence of 20 years to life, five years more than a second-degree murder conviction.

Mr. Morales shook his head in disbelief and muttered under his breath as the jury foreman read the verdict sheet: guilty on all counts.

Several witnesses testified they saw Mr. Morales pull a silver revolver and shoot Mark Carson in the face after an argument during which he called Mr. Carson and his friend, Danny Robinson, faggots and gay wrestlers.

Mr. Morales denied that his motive had been bigotry and said he was bisexual. He claimed he acted in self-defense because he felt he was about to be attacked by Mr. Carson and Mr. Robinson. He said he raised his gun and fired after he saw Mr. Robinson pull what looked like a black pistol from his pocket. I just reacted, he said during his closing argument. This was not a deliberate act.

Continue reading the main story Video

But prosecutors argued that Mr. Morales, 36, had started on a violent, antigay tirade 15 minutes earlier when he burst into the Annisa Restaurant on Barrow Street, brandished his weapon and threatened a bartender, using antigay slurs.

That confrontation had started when a restaurant employee chastised Mr. Morales, who had been drinking heavily all day, for urinating in the street in front of the business, witnesses said.

A few minutes later on Avenue of the Americas, Mr. Morales encountered Mr. Carson and Mr. Robinson, two gay men from Brooklyn who were out on the town on a warm Friday night. As he passed them, Mr. Morales called the men gay wrestlers, Mr. Robinson testified. Mr. Carson spun on his heel and confronted Mr. Morales.

It was an explosive moment. Mr. Carson, 32, was a Brooklyn native, outgoing and proudly open about his sexuality, who worked at a gelato kiosk in Grand Central Terminal. Mr. Morales was from the Lower East Side of Manhattan, unemployed, broke and sleeping on a friends couch in Queens. He was armed with a .38-caliber revolver he said he wanted to sell. He had served 11 years in prison for a robbery during which three women were bound with duct tape, choked and assaulted with a pipe.

Spewing antigay insults, Mr. Morales dared Mr. Carson and Mr. Robinson to come around the corner onto Eighth Street to settle their differences, Mr. Robinson testified. They followed him, thinking it was a bluff.

There, just after midnight on May 18, 2013, in the shadow of a closed bookstore, Mr. Morales shot Mr. Carson while Mr. Robinson was on the telephone with the police, witnesses said.

This was bigotry, and this was unjustifiable rage, the lead prosecutor, Shannon Lucey, said in her summation. The defendant was able to shoot Mark Carson over nothing because Mark Carson was nothing to the defendant. Mark Carson was nothing to the defendant but a subhuman fag.

In his testimony, Mr. Morales said that he had had sexual relationships with transgender men; he called one of his longtime sexual partners as a witness. I, Elliot Morales, am not a bigot, he said. I dont hate gays.

But Ms. Lucey noted that he never took transgender men he slept with on dates or walked in public with them. The defendant is self-loathing; he wants no one to know or to see who he is, she said. He has a lot of self-loathing issues, and that came out when he saw Mark Carson and Danny Robinson being who they are.

When he was tackled by an officer and arrested a few minutes after the shooting, Mr. Morales said, I shot him because he tried to act tough. Then, as another officer turned on his video camera, Mr. Morales laughed maniacally and said, Diagnosis dead, Doctor.

One juror, who insisted on anonymity to protect his privacy, said no one on the panel bought Mr. Moraless claim he had acted in self-defense. Most of the discussion, he said, had been about whether Mr. Morales had singled out Mr. Carson because he was gay or for some other reason.

The juror, a financial services employee from the Upper East Side, said he was convinced that Mr. Morales acted out of prejudice because he seemed intent on attacking gay men the night of the shooting, starting with his belligerent antigay threats at the Annisa Restaurant.

Later, Mr. Morales not only used gay slurs in his argument with Mr. Carson, but also pointedly asked him if he was with Mr. Robinson just before pulling the gun, the juror said. He was kind of categorizing people, he said.

A second juror, a health care worker from the West Village who also declined to be named for privacy reasons, said the panel did not give much weight to Mr. Moraless argument that he was not a bigot because he had slept in secret with transgender women. I think we all felt he had some serious screws loose, she said.",[]

WHAT are the best mobile games to play these days? I decided to find out recently when a train I was riding came to an unexpected stop between two stations and there was no cellphone signal. That meant no Internet for distraction, no Twitter or Spotify to while away the time.









Fortunately, I had just downloaded some new iPhone games that have attracted a lot of attention. So during the train delay, I tested how the games measured up to their hype.

Photo

First up was The Swords, a gesture-based game that may remind people of Fruit Ninja, a game where you slash up a lot of fruits. In The Swords, you also have to swipe the screen to cut through fast-moving targets.

The game has a story line: You follow a sword master as he learns his craft, dealing with ever more difficult opponents and learning new moves. When you swipe at your phones screen to move your sword, you paint shapes in black ink to intercept the advances of your red-inked enemies. Each level requires more speed and more dexterity in swipes. Between levels, you see beautiful drawings that advance the sword masters story.

The Swords, which is $3 on iOS, is fast-paced but doesnt feel frantic. As I played, it relaxed me.

After some time, with my train still looking as if it wasnt going anywhere, I clicked on Dreii, which costs $4 on iOS and Android.

Photo

This is a physics-based puzzle game with abstract graphics. Theres no clock, and not much on screen other than a few minimalist graphics. By tapping here and there, you grab white building blocks with your character and drag them around in a gravity field. Then you stack the blocks to hit a pulsing target and move on to the next level.

Dreii may sound simplistic, but it is fascinating and the momentum quickly builds as new block shapes are introduced and targets prove harder to reach. Each puzzle piece moves and drops into place with little difficulty, and the lovely sounds add to this experience.

Dreii also has some advanced group-playing tricks, uniting you with other players from across the Internet to complete different goals.

The two games were so much fun that eventually, as my train moved, I searched for more to play. That led me to Rayman Classic, which is $5 on iOS. A huge success on Atari and PlayStation consoles in 1996, Rayman  an adventure game following the character Rayman  is now a mobile app.

Photo

Its makers have captured the look and feel of the original game without messing with the recipe much. Raymans graphics are classically blocky, and the gameplay is based on two-dimensional platforms and ladders, with jumping, collecting tasks and a mazelike path. Even the soundtrack will take you back to 1996.

Rayman was always fun to play and its characters were likable. You do need to perfect your timing, and learn to jump your character onto just the right pixel. I found it a lot of fun.

Ive also been playing Final Fantasy IX on my phone. The game is worth mentioning because it is such a huge contrast to my other favorite mobile games. Originally a console app, Final Fantasy IX for phones and tablets is a sophisticated role-playing fighting game with a mythlike story line and all the usual features like learning new abilities and scenes that move the plot along.

This 16-year-old game looks great today because its graphics have been updated. Its controls have also been adapted for touch screens. You can expect to spend many hours immersed in this app. But its expensive: Final Fantasy IX costs $21 on iOS and Android.

The annual Games Developers Conference is later this month, so the media spotlight may fall on Xbox, PlayStation and PC gaming. But as I found during my delayed train journey, games on phones remain innovative, fun and within easy reach at all times.

Mark Mattson, a neuroscientist at the National Institute on Aging in Maryland, has not had breakfast in 35 years. Most days he practices a form of fasting  skipping lunch, taking a midafternoon run, and then eating all of his daily calories (about 2,000) in a six-hour window starting in the afternoon.

Once you get used to it, its not a big deal, said Dr. Mattson, chief of the institutes laboratory of neurosciences. Im not hungry at all in the morning, and this is other peoples experience as well. Its just a matter of getting adapted to it.

In a culture in which its customary to eat three large meals a day while snacking from morning to midnight, the idea of regularly skipping meals may sound extreme. But in recent years intermittent fasting has been gaining popular attention and scientific endorsement.

It has been promoted in best-selling books and endorsed by celebrities like the actors Hugh Jackman and Benedict Cumberbatch. The late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel claims that for the past two years he has followed an intermittent fasting program known as the 5:2 diet, which entails normal eating for five days and fasting for two  a practice Mr. Kimmel credits for his significant weight loss.

Fasting to improve health dates back thousands of years, with Hippocrates and Plato among its earliest proponents. Dr. Mattson argues that humans are well suited for it: For much of human history, sporadic access to food was likely the norm, especially for hunter-gatherers. As a result, weve evolved with livers and muscles that store quickly accessible carbohydrates in the form of glycogen, and our fat tissue holds long-lasting energy reserves that can sustain the body for weeks when food is not available.

From an evolutionary perspective, its pretty clear that our ancestors did not eat three meals a day plus snacks, Dr. Mattson said.

Across the world, millions of people fast periodically for religious and spiritual reasons. But some are now looking at the practice as a source of health and longevity.

Valter Longo, the director of the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California, initially studied fasting in mice that showed that two to five days of fasting each month reduced biomarkers for diabetes, cancer and heart disease. The research has since been expanded to people, and scientists saw a similar reduction in disease risk factors.

Dr. Longo said the health benefits of fasting might result from the fact that fasting lowers insulin and another hormone called insulinlike growth factor, or IGF-1, which is linked to cancer and diabetes. Lowering these hormones may slow cell growth and development, which in turn helps slow the aging process and reduces risk factors for disease.

When you have low insulin and low IGF-1, the body goes into a state of maintenance, a state of standby, Dr. Longo said. There is not a lot of push for cells to grow, and in general the cells enter a protected mode.

Critics say that health benefits or not, various forms of intermittent fasting are too impractical for most people.

The 5:2 diet, for example, advocates eating without restrictions for five days and then consuming just 500 calories  roughly the equivalent of a light meal  on each of the other two days of the week. Another regimen, called alternate-day fasting, involves eating no more than 500 calories every other day.

A third regimen, which Dr. Mattson follows, is known as time-restricted feeding. The idea is to consume all of the days calories in a narrow window, typically six to eight hours, and fasting for the remaining 16 to 18 hours in a day. Studies of time-restricted feeding practices in both animals and humans have suggested that the practice may lower cancer risk and help people maintain their weight.

The scientific community remains divided about the value of intermittent fasting. Critics say that the science is not yet strong enough to justify widespread recommendations for fasting as a way to lose weight or boost health, and that most of the evidence supporting it comes from animal research. Advocates say the body of research on intermittent fasting is growing rapidly and indicates that the health benefits are striking.

The 5:2 diet, in particular, is backed by promising studies that show that it lowers weight and improves blood sugar, inflammation and other aspects of metabolic health, said Joy Dubost, a registered dietitian and a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the countrys largest organization of dietitians. She noted that fasting isnt appropriate for pregnant women, people with diabetes and people on medications.

Most people who do this understand that its not about binge eating, Dr. Dubost said. But they like that it gives them the freedom not to worry about calories, carbs and other restrictions on days when theyre not fasting.

Krista Varady, an associate professor of nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago, has studied the effects of alternate-day fasting on hundreds of obese adults. In trials lasting eight to 10 weeks, she has found that people lose on average about 13 pounds and experience marked reductions in LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, triglycerides and insulin, the fat-storage hormone.

Dr. Varady found in her research that intermittent fasting was easiest when people ate a moderately high-fat diet and were allowed to consume up to 500 calories on their fasting days. In her studies, 10 percent to 20 percent of people usually find the diet too difficult and quickly stop. Those who stick with it typically adjust after a rocky first few weeks.

Weve run close to 700 people through various trials, Dr. Varady said. We thought people would overeat on their feast days to compensate. But people for some reason, regardless of their body weight, can only eat about 10 or 15 percent more than usual. They dont really overeat, and I think thats why this works.

In 2011, Dr. Mattson and his colleagues reported a study of the 5:2 program that followed 107 overweight and obese women. Half of the subjects were assigned to eat no more than 500 calories each on two consecutive days each week. A control group was assigned to follow a low-calorie diet.

After six months, both groups had lost weight. But the intermittent fasting group lost slightly more  about 14 pounds on average  and had greater reductions in belly fat. They also retained more muscle and had greater improvements in blood sugar regulation.

Dr. Mattsons interest in intermittent fasting grew out of work on animals that showed that alternate-day fasting protected mice from strokes, Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease, and consistently extended their life spans by 30 percent. Dr. Mattson and his colleagues found that alternate-day fasting increased the production of proteins that protect brain cells, enhancing their ability to repair damaged DNA. Fasting, he said, acts as a mild stress that makes cells throughout the body stronger, shoring up their ability to adapt to later insults.

In this way, intermittent fasting is like exercise, which causes immediate stress and inflammation, but protects against chronic disease in the long run. Eating fruits and vegetables may have a similar effect. While very large doses of antioxidants can cause cancer in humans, moderate amounts of exposure can make cells more resilient, Dr. Mattson said.

There is overlap between the way cells respond to exercise, to fasting, and even to exposure to some of the chemicals in fruits and vegetables, he added.

Dr. Mattson is now starting a rigorous clinical trial of people 55 to 70 years old who are prediabetic and at high risk for developing Alzheimers disease. He plans to study whether intermittent fasting may slow cognitive decline.

Dr. David Ludwig, a professor of nutrition at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, said one benefit of fasting is that it forces the body to shift from using glucose for fuel to using fat. During this process, the fat is converted to compounds known as ketones, a clean energy source that burns more efficiently than glucose, like high-octane gasoline, Dr. Ludwig said.

The same process, known as ketosis, occurs when people go on extremely low-carb, high-fat diets. Dr. Ludwig said ketones seem to have unique effects on the brain. High-fat diets, for example, have been used for years to treat people who suffer from epileptic seizures.

There are extensive reports of children who had debilitating seizures who were cured on ketogenic diets, Dr. Ludwig said. If it benefits the brain to prevent seizures, then maybe it benefits the brain in other ways.

Dr. Ludwig noted that the long-term effectiveness of fasting had not been well studied. He cautioned that for many people, fasting is simply too difficult and may slow metabolism. A potentially more practical approach is to limit sugar and other processed carbohydrates, replacing them with natural fats, protein and unrefined carbohydrates, he said.

It takes a very disciplined person to skip a couple meals every day, he added.

But Dr. Mattson, who has been skipping meals for decades, said the adjustment to skipping breakfast and lunch was a lot like the change that occurs when a couch potato starts exercising.

If youve been sedentary for years and then you go out and try to run five miles, youre not going to feel very good until you get in shape, he said.  Its not going to be a smooth transition right away. It takes two weeks to a month to adapt.

How could narrators so prodigal in their empathy originate in the brain of that withholder? So muses the unnamed woman who speaks to us in Elizabeth Tallents story Narrator, which comes near the end of her enchanting new collection, Mendocino Fire. That withholder is a famous writer, sprawled on the steps of the stairwell at a welcome get-together for students in the creative writing program at Berkeley, and she has just watched him be flamboyantly rude to two young female admirers. Having thought highly of his novels, the new student has imagined the great man must have a radiance and generosity of spirit that are clearly not on offer. She feels betrayed.









But she has no idea how small and mean this famous writer will get, nor how quickly he will ensnare her in a sexual obsession that will reach its nadir when she steals a snapshot of his ex-girlfriend, a beautiful Chinese woman who rejected him. To keep it handy if she needs to make herself feel bad, she slips it into her copy of Middlemarch. Since the famous writer isnt a fan of George Eliot, she convinces herself that the immense sanity of Middlemarch made it a safe haven for the stolen photograph. Whenever I went back to Eliots novel, I imagined the magnanimous moral acuity with which the narrator would have illumined a theft like mine, bringing it into the embrace of the humanly forgivable while, at the same time  and how did Eliot manage this?  indicting its betrayal of the more honorable self that, in her narrators eyes, I would possess.

This offhand tribute to the genius of Eliots narrative prowess, delivered by an unnamed character writing in her own defense, is a move of breathtaking boldness, inviting a comparison that risks being invidious. The narrator maintains that if George Eliot were telling her story, it would be a better one! I confess that I immediately took Middlemarch down from the shelf to see if I agreed. Then I went skimming back through Tallents stories with a keener eye for her strategy.

Of the 10 stories, eight have third-person narrators, and one, an academic tale entitled Eros 101, is written in the form of a Q. and A. Although the narrators tend to stay close to one character, the subjects of the stories range widely, one might even say wildly, and they announce their concerns in the first sentence. Tabriz, which details the breakdown of a marriage after the husband brings home a valuable rug he found in a rubbish heap, begins this way: David Merson, heartsore in the way of old activists, a stooped, unkempt 48, leafs through his so-called love life for precedent and finds none. Never Come Back, a hair-raising tale of a fathers fixation with his sons girlfriend, opens with a straightforward statement of the case (This was his life now, his real life, the thing he thought about most: His boy was in and out of trouble and he didnt know what to do) and ends with a tantalizing nonconclusion (He knew enough not to go after them. He knew enough not to go after them yet). The final story, Briar Switch  in which an estranged daughter, desperate to reach her dying fathers bedside, manages to fly into an airport during a blizzard and rent a car  starts with a question and answer that toll like a death knell through the ordeal to come. Sure you want to go out in that? the rental agent asks. Frustrated by his slowness and deliberation, she insists, Im sure.

Such examples demonstrate how immediately engaging these stories are. Theres an overseeing, orchestrating voice, outside the characters but close enough to hear their thoughts. Though Northern California is often the locale, theres a lot of variety in socioeconomic status: It seems unlikely that these characters would ever get together in the same room, even by invitation. A fisherman, an eco-activist, a Virginia Woolf scholar, a refugee artist whose father was murdered by a firing squad, a mill worker, a young tree-sitter who has been living in a giant redwood for 143 days  all are presented from a vantage point both intimate and direct, with their courage and foibles and weaknesses intact.

The startling perceptions that slip out in the urgency of a moment are dissected on the scene. When the youthful tree-sitter misses a step in her daily scramble from branch to branch, she realizes that within the singularity of the fall, time can be observed, it seems, both backward and forward. In life, its now clear, consciousness is always so pinned down, and time is so much bigger than that pinpoint known as I. Nate Dawe, the fisherman in The Wrong Son, burdened by an overbearing father and his own collusion in illegal abalone excursions, goes out for some hard fishing on his fathers boat, the Louise. He was alone, leaning to toss a bucket of refuse, when a wave lolloped into the bow and the Louise shrugged him into the sea. Battling the deep troughs of water, Nate finds himself for once wholly aligned with necessity, rejoicing in the clear, clear light of live or die.

At a dinner party in Eros 101, Clio, the Virginia Woolf scholar, recognizing that shes being heartily seduced by a new colleague who will soon be up for tenure, is momentarily blindsided by this apercu: Clio is 42 to the others 20-something: fact. Fearful fact. Later in the story, when Clio fails to notice a diamond on her potential lovers ring finger, the reader is advised that since she is only a character, much of her own story is lost on her.

In The Narrator, the young writer wonders how George Eliot managed to draw characters who are at once both pardonable and blameworthy. She has hopes that this prowess has something to do with a writers radiance and generosity of spirit. But the ability to create characters who force us to withhold judgment and leave us gasping at their absolute, solid reality isnt the result of any special kindness or goodness on the part of the author. The magnanimous moral acuity Tallent claims for Eliot is a condition of philosophical distance, hopeful yet fearful, the kind that arises in old marriages after many years of deep commitment and, above all, close attention. Its not affection or defensiveness that can blast a character into the readers life. Its not pity or pitys upscale cousin, compassion. Its not even love. Beware of the writer who says, I love all my characters.

Its beyond love. Its knowledge. Thats what George Eliot had and so, Im pleased to report, does Elizabeth Tallent. It doesnt matter if shes a good person, or even a nice one. (I dont know her. I hope shes nice.) When a writer can tell a story as beautifully, as thoroughly and with as much knowledge as Elizabeth Tallent possesses, no one should care.",[]
nytimes.com,2013-04-27 00:00:00,Celebrity Guest Solver Elayne Boosler: Soft T's,"['Deb Amlen', 'Patrick Berry']","SUNDAYS PUZZLE  Ive written a few times about the Extremely Spunky Border Terrier who lives with me as the brains behind the Wordplay organization, and its rare to find someone who loves dogs even more than I do. I think Ive finally met my match in Elayne Boosler.

Ms. Boosler is known to us as a very funny comedian, yet she is so much more. In the 1980s, she successfully financed her own special at a time when women were not able to secure comedy specials on cable television, blowing the doors open for female comedians on cable TV. She has performed for people as varied as former president Bill Clinton and Queen Elizabeth II of England, and she has moderated a Democratic presidential candidates debate on C-SPAN for the National Organization for Women. Nearest to her heart, I believe, is her passion for promoting animal adoption, which primarily manifests itself in her activity with Tails of Joy, a nonprofit organization that raises funds for rescuers all over the country and beyond. Ms. Boosler is appearing as a regular on John Fugelsangs Current TV show, Viewpoint.

I see Soft Ts and my head takes off: Whats the formula? THs? Missing Ts? Soft tease  Gypsy Rose Lee? Softees  Snuggle Bear, Pillsbury Dough Boy, tissues, Mr. Softee, your grandma? If it wasnt The New York Times, it might be actresses who havent had implants. I always try to figure out the formula before looking at any clues. Its hard enough to write good jokes, but to construct a crossword containing twisted punch lines that surprise and delight, well, mad props. Any time I dont see the end of a joke coming, I doff my cap. Doff is such a crossword word, isnt it?

You can also usually count on STEN, E.L.O., ENO (the most famous musician in crossword history after ONO), either SSE or NNW (Im never good with directions), some state south or east of some other state, NONA Hendryx instead of Jimi, and either ETA or ETD. If they sold little crossword survival kits, those words would be included, along with coffee, a pen, and noise-canceling headphones. I cant work a crossword with any media on in the background. I cant come up with words while hearing words.

What I enjoyed about solving this puzzle was of course the wordplay of theths for ts, as Im a huge mangled language fan. Blame the Marx Brothers. I loved how beautifully the puns lent themselves to the clues. Once I got the formula, I had a lot of fun guessing the answers before checking the clues that led to them. I left four blank squares in this puzzle, as I dont know who Athena turned into a spider (ARACHNE) crossing a central Swiss canton (URI), though I feel I should. Im thinking by next Wednesday I will come back and just be able to write them in.

Ive been in about 45 newspaper crossword puzzles, mostly The New York Times. Funny Boosler. I dont flatter myself that its anything more than the puzzle creators trying to dupe the public with my Y, as opposed to Ela-I-ne. Ill take it, although on the last International Womens Day I was crossed by Golda Meir. Friends will excitedly say, Wow!! Youre 18 down!! But I know in my heart of hearts, real fame will only come when one day, the puzzle says, 62 Across. See 18 Down.

Years ago, I was negotiating to be in a Broadway show. We were far apart on money, when the big New York producer said to me, Frankly, I dont really even know who you are. That Sunday, I was in the New York Times crossword puzzle. I got the salary I asked for. I may owe you guys a commission.

Two years ago, I was having eye surgery. I was terrified. That morning I was in the New York Times crossword puzzle. I brought it into surgery and wrote across the top, Dear Dr. Devgan, please take very good care of 22 Across. He was delighted. I can see!

I absolutely love crosswords, Scrabble, word puzzles. My husbands one night off from the marriage list is Claudia Schiffer. Mine is Will Shortz. And Sandy Koufax, but I digress.

Im dyslexic. As a child riding in the car, I spelled my first word like this: Bar. R-A-B. Bar. I can sing backwards any song you can name, which once came in very handy while speaking to an assembly of fifth graders who wanted none of me until I had them shout out songs, after which they wouldnt let me go. I see everything backwards first, I can write upside down and backwards. I speak French, which means that my travel days are filled with French words backwards and forwards, followed by their English counterparts in every direction, after which they become the jumble, which I also do in my head without pen nor paper. Every day in Europe is exhausting for me. Rodney Dangerfield used to say to me, You have a very busy head.

For me, every crossword starts the same way. I look at 1 Across and then I do 1  4 or 5 Down in my head and so on, all through the puzzle. I use a pen and dont write anything down until I am sure of at least one solid letter. I love that when youve done all you possibly can, and finally walk away, your brain keeps quietly working on it, so that when you come back hours later you can just fill it all right in. I love that our brains quietly go about solving our problems while we consciously tend to other things. Ive also learned to accept imperfection, as in, there is usually one square in the puzzle that will remain blank. Whether its the second letter down of the blood of the Greek gods, or the second letter across of arsenic (rats bane), I never look words up. I accept that life is never neatly finished, that nothing is perfect, that things dont always fit, that you can always be better, that there is something to come back for. Of course Id rather solve it.",[]

On Thursday, we challenged Well readers to figure out the case of a 36-year-old man with a 20-year history of migrating joint pains along with other strange symptoms. Nearly 300 of you offered thoughtful suggestions of what he might have had. And one out of 10 of you were spot on.

The correct diagnosis is:

Ehlers Danlos syndrome

The first reader to correctly make this diagnosis was Bryley Williams, of New York City. She told me she knows nothing about medicine but found the answer on the Internet by investigating noninflammatory causes of joint pain and pneumothorax. All of the winners of this contest are extraordinary, but I think Ms. Williams may take the prize. She is 15 years old, a freshman in high school in New York City. Well done, Ms. Williams! Maybe you should consider a career in medicine once you graduate.

The Diagnosis

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or EDS, is a group of inherited disorders that affect the bodys connective tissues  the skin, muscles, tendons and ligaments that hold us together. Since the 1990s, the disease has been divided into six main types, depending on which connective tissues are most affected. Based on the gene study done in this patient, he was given a diagnosis of the least severe and most common variety, which primarily causes hypermobility of the joints as well as skin that is easily damaged and scars badly. EDS was probably recognized as early as 400 B.C., when Hippocrates noted that the nomads and Scythians had lax joints and multiple scars. This disorder came to more modern medical attention in the 17th century when, at a medical presentation in Holland, a Spanish sailor by the name of George Albes exhibited his remarkable ability to stretch the skin on his chest out an arms length. The first complete description of the condition was given by a Russian physician, Dr. A. N. Chernogubov, at the end of the 19th century. He presented a 17-year-old boy who suffered from recurrent joint dislocations and easily stretched and fragile skin. The boy had many scars resulting from minor injuries, because these patients do not heal normally. Based on these observations, Dr. Chernogubov predicted that the clinical manifestations were caused by an abnormality of the connective tissues. That report did not come to the notice of Western Europe for many years. So while the disorder still carries Chernogubovs name in Russia, in most places it referred to as EDS, after the two physicians who first characterized the disorder in Paris decades later: Dr. Edvard Ehlers and Dr. Henri-Alexandre Danlos.

How the Diagnosis Was Made

The patient, a 36-year-old man with a 20-year history of migrating joint pain, had been to dozens of doctors  internists, orthopedic surgeons, rheumatologists. All had examined him and seen nothing. Indeed, his last rheumatologist kept saying that she wanted to believe that he had this much pain but that she couldnt find anything physical to cause it. One orthopedist had asked him if his skin was particularly stretchy or if he was very flexible  obviously thinking of a diagnosis like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but the patient said no. He didnt think he was particularly flexible or that his skin was unusually stretchy. Later, once he had the diagnosis, he showed one of his doctors how he could move his thumb, and the doctor told him that he was popping it in and out of joint. And the geneticist told him that his skin was stretchy enough to fit the diagnostic criteria. Still, it all seemed normal to him. Not extraordinary in any way. Still, after 20 years of searching, the patient was finally willing to accept that he was just more prone to getting these pains. And he began keeping a list of the types of exercises or activities that seemed most likely to trigger the episodes of joint pain. His wife was unwilling to give up. She continued to search the Internet for answers.

Like Son, Like Father?

The final clue came not from the mans doctor but from his sons. The boy, age 11, went to see his pediatrician, Dr. Renee Brand, for his annual physical exam. He was tall and slender, like his father. He had a colt-like awkwardness about him, with arms and legs that looked just a bit too long to be well managed. And he had a stooped posture, as if he spent too much time gazing into a smartphone he didnt even have. Could he sit up completely straight? Dr. Brand asked. He couldnt, though he tried. Later the doctor asked him to bend over so that she could check his spine for scoliosis. He immediately flopped down, his chest almost touching his knees and his hands lying flat on the floor in front of him. Dr. Brand was surprised by this remarkable degree of flexibility. When the boy righted himself, she asked him to straighten his legs as far as they would go. When he did, his knees went well past straight, so that his legs bowed backward. Straightening his elbows produced a similar curve. I think maybe you should take him to see an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Brand suggested to the boys mother. Two weeks later the mom called Dr. Brand with a report. Shed taken the boy to see the surgeo,n and he had in turn recommended that she take him to see a geneticist. I thought so, replied Dr. Brand with satisfaction. Seeing how remarkably flexible the young man was, and how hard it was for him to stand up straight, Dr. Brand thought the boy might have a disorder known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

Getting a Diagnosis

After making the appointment with the geneticist, the boys mother sat down at the computer to read up on Ehlers-Danlos. As she read through the descriptions, she could definitely recognize her son. But in those pages she also recognized her husband. Joint pain, check; pneumothorax, check; osteoporosis, check; scoliosis, check. Ultimately this inherited disease was diagnosed in both father and son. Theres no cure for EDS, but its important to know that you have it. The son sees a cardiologist every couple of years, since EDS can lead to problems with heart valves and vessels. He was found to be at risk for a dangerous stretching of his aorta that, without repair, could lead to rupture. And both father and son now understand which exercises are going to be a problem for them  possibly causing joint dislocations or other musculoskeletal injuries.

A South Carolina high school teacher who says she was forced to resign after a student took her phone and circulated a nude picture of her has garnered the support of hundreds of students who signed a petition demanding she be reinstated.









The teacher, Leigh Anne Arthur, who had taught for more than a decade in Union County, which is about 70 miles northwest of Columbia, said she had left her phone on her desk and was out of the classroom when a 16-year-old boy took her phone. The phone was passed among several classes of students, and the photo  which Ms. Arthur said she had taken for her husband for Valentines Day  was copied and shared.

The Union County Schools superintendent, David Eubanks, said in an interview that Ms. Arthur shared responsibility for the episode because she had allowed students to use her phone in the past.

It became a regular piece of equipment that they used in that classroom, Dr. Eubanks said. Knowing that, why did she put that photograph on that cellphone?

He said the student discovered the photo on Feb. 18, a Thursday, and his office learned of the episode the following Monday from the director of the Union County Career and Technology Center, where Ms. Arthur taught an engineering course.

Ms. Arthur was confronted with the information on Tuesday, Dr. Eubanks said, and was told that she could either resign or face due process procedures. She tendered her resignation the next day, he said.

But Ms. Arthur said in an interview with a local CBS affiliate, The whole premise of my privacy being invaded is being ignored.

Ms. Arthur, who could not immediately be reached for comment, told a local NBC station that the student should be held responsible for his actions: He had to hit my apps button and to open up all my apps and then open my gallery.

She said that she had been forced to resign. But Dr. Eubanks said the resignation had been her choice.

The students online petition says: Leigh Anne Arthur is the victim of a blatant attack of her privacy. Personal photographs were illegally obtained by a student and were sent to other students in the school (Union County High). After being escorted off of school property, we (the students) are left to believe that she has been forced to, or given little choice but to resign.

As of 9 a.m. Thursday, the petition had more than 3,000 signatures.

On Wednesday, Ms. Arthur said that color copies of the picture were placed in her mailbox, according to the NBC affiliate. One had a handwritten message on the back of it. She called the Sheriffs Office.

The school district said that the initial episode was still being investigated. In a statement, Dr. Eubanks suggested that the student who had taken the phone may also be severely punished by law enforcement, as well as the school district.

I could care less about what kind of pictures she has on her cellphone, Dr. Eubanks said in the interview. But once students gain access to it, that becomes and still remains the big issue.

The superintendent said that his office had been inundated with calls from people disturbed by the episode, some of them coming from other parts of the country.

But he said any anger directed at his office was less upsetting than the fact that good students, good people will suffer from this.

Its going to affect the lives of several people, all because of her failure to properly supervise her class, he said.

Ms. Arthur said she knew who the student is but had forgiven him, according to the NBC station.

Hes 16, she said. Hes going to make stupid decisions. We all make stupid decisions when were 16.",[]

nytimes.com,2011-01-31 00:00:00,Tuesday: Celebrity Guest Solver Mollie Katzen,['Deb Amlen'],"Barbara Ireland/The New York Times

TUESDAYS PUZZLE  So, I was sitting here wondering how to introduce todays guest, when it occurred to me that what I needed was a really good segue. See if this works.

Ron and Nancy Byron have cooked up an especially fun puzzle for us today.

{Pause for effect}

Speaking of cooking, Id like you all to welcome our celebrity guest solver, the author of best-selling cookbooks Mollie Katzen, who wrote two of my favorite vegetarian cookbooks: the groundbreaking, original Moosewood Cookbook and The Enchanted Broccoli Forest. (She literally penned them: not only did she create the mouthwatering recipes, but she also illustrated them. And the books are almost entirely hand-lettered. Theyre beautiful.) Since then, Ms. Katzen has written nine other cookbooks, including three for children. She is currently at work on her twelfth book. If anyone can entice you to eat your veggies, Ms. Katzen can. Shes also hilarious and very honest about her solving experience. I know youll enjoy reading about it.

With the exception of the circles highlighting todays theme, this is a very straightforward Tuesday puzzle, heavy on the beverages (ODOULS, DADS Root Beer, and another that is a theme entry, so I wont give it away), which may account for Ms. Katzens relative discomfort in the early part of her solving experience. Ill let her explain:

Mollie Katzens Solving Notes:

I had never done a crossword puzzle before getting this fascinating assignment. I put that in quotes because over the years I had, once in a while, crept up to my mothers partially finished daily crossword  yes, in ink  while she would take a break (if she took a break or even a breath, she was that quick) and timidly ventured a word or two in very light pencil.

I also must disclose, in all fairness to myself, that I came to this with a small bit of general puzzle experience. Namely, I had been a true champ at finding the hidden items in those hidden pictures pages in Highlights magazine when I was in second grade. I found those very exciting, which might or might not say something about my childhood.

Moving along. So here I was with this Tuesday puzzle, and, still with a politely faint pencil, found myself glued to the chair for north of an hour. Is it oversharing to say I actually had to use the bathroom, but kept putting off getting up because I was so absorbed? I kept saying to myself, Just one more word, and Ill let me get up, but I was too enthralled. There were lots of three-letter quickies that were so fun: ECO, XED, I BE (as in May ___ excused?). Cool! This part was a blast, but then, I realized I had to face other clues requiring more spaces. Watery hue was one thing (yay, me!), but Pre-Russia int. economic coalition? (Is it me? Did I take the wrong courses in college?)

After an hour and a quarter, I had half of it done  in pencil so reticent, I could barely read what Id written. I decided to give it a rest until the following night, when I would be having dinner with a couple of my delightful and very articulate author friends. One of them, Marissa Moss (fluent in a ridiculous number of languages, and quick as lightning in most matters), was happy to help. Although I didnt appreciate her informing me that if its a Tuesday puzzle, its considered an easy one (thanks, pal!), I was nonetheless deeply impressed by her facility. She picked up a pen (dreaded ink!) and dashed off the other half of the puzzle in four and a half minutes flat. I tried to get a word in edgewise, but having blinked, I missed the chance. Being a charitable sort, she explained to me that years of doing the daily puzzle as part of her morning routine had conferred a fluency afforded by practice.

Nonetheless, I came away from this experience believing a) that my friend is a genius, and b) that it might indeed be meaningful (and someday  who knows, useful?) to ponder the fact that the actresses Garr and Hatcher share a first name, unusual spelling included. I stand enriched.

Thanks for playing, Ms. Katzen!

Every March, as St. Patricks Day approaches and Yeats and stout and the Undertones and other Irish matters are on my mind, I recall a conversation I often have. A friend is about to go to Ireland for the first time and asks me for recommendations. Inevitably, the first thing I say is: Dont skip the North.

This advice is usually met with skepticism. Memories of news about Northern Ireland during the Troubles  the 30-year period of conflict during which violence frequently flared up  still linger long after the Good Friday agreement of 1998, and many people remain wary of visiting. Thats a real shame, because Northern Ireland is home to some of that green islands most spectacular scenery, and its capital, Belfast, is among my all-time-favorite drinking cities.

Belfast is compact and brimming with distinctive bars full of character, particularly in the Cathedral Quarter, an arty district with St. Annes Cathedral at its heart. On a business trip in 2010, I was staying in the Quarter at the elegant Merchant Hotel, mostly because I had heard great things about its cocktail bar. I knew nothing about the Spaniard, a bar across the street from the Merchant, but decided to check it out. Appealingly cozy and dark, with most of its surfaces taken up by pictures and knickknacks, it felt like the sort of place where an unusually well-mannered pirate might make himself at home. I arrived with a sore throat, for which the quick-thinking barman prescribed an excellent hot whiskey (I later discovered the bars winning way with rum cocktails). A local woman  an off-duty constable  struck up a conversation. I mentioned that I was a writer, and she insisted that I next join her and her friends at the John Hewitt, a bar named for a Belfast poet and activist.

When we got there, a folk trio was playing, and playing well. A fire burned in a small hearth. I drank a pint of rich porter from a local brewery and was swept up in convivial chatter by everyone around me. Reading the fine print on the menu, I learned that the bar is operated by the Belfast Unemployed Resource Center and that its profits benefit the organization. I thought it was an ingenious model, and I knew the Hewitt would become a bar Id return to on every trip to Belfast.

I also return to the majestic Crown Liquor Saloon, a confection of ornate tile work, stained glass, high ceilings and intricately carved woodwork. The tough choice here is whether to belly up to the bar or try to claim one of the intimate snugs  private booths designed, it is said, for those who wish to drink discreetly.

I have wondered if the very things that put people off when I implore them to visit Belfast  the citys complex history and its enduring, though softening, scars  are what make the warmth and hospitality I have discovered in its bars not only surprising but also especially deep and affecting. Drink in Belfast. Youll have a great time. Youll meet great people. And give my best regards to all.

Recently, university researchers asked children and parents to describe the rules they thought families should follow related to technology.

In most cases, parents and children agreed  dont text and drive; dont be online when someone wants to talk to you. But there was one surprising rule that the children wanted that their parents mentioned far less often: Dont post anything about me on social media without asking me.

As in, no pictures of them asleep in the back of the car. No posts about their frustration with their homework. That victory picture after the soccer game? Maybe. The frustrated rant about the fight you just had over laundry? No way.

The answers revealed a really interesting disconnect, said Alexis Hiniker, a graduate student in human-centered design and engineering at the University of Washington who led the research. She, along with researchers at the University of Michigan, studied 249 parent-child pairs distributed across 40 states and found that while children ages 10 to 17 were really concerned about the ways parents shared their childrens lives online, their parents were far less worried. About three times more children than parents thought there should be rules about what parents shared on social media.

Sites like Facebook and Instagram are now baked into the world of todays families. Many, if not most, new parents post images of their newborn online within an hour of birth, and some parents create social media accounts for the children themselves  often to share photos and news with family, although occasionally in the pursuit of Instafame for their fashionably clad, beautifully photographed sons and daughters.

With the first babies of Facebook (which started in 2004) not yet in their teens and the stylish kids of Instagram (which started in 2010) barely in elementary school, families are just beginning to explore the question of how children feel about the digital record of their earliest years. But as this study, although small, suggests, its increasingly clear that our children will grow into teenagers and adults who want to control their digital identities.

As these children come of age, theyre going to be seeing the digital footprint left in their childhoods wake, said Stacey Steinberg, a legal skills professor and associate director of the Center on Children and Families at the University of Florida Levin College of Law. While most of them will be fine, some might take issue with it.

Some children and teenagers question both past and present sharing. I really dont like it when my parents post pictures of me on their social media accounts, especially after finding out that some of my friends follow them, said Maisy Hoffman, 14, an eighth grader who lives in Manhattan. I worry more about my dad. He doesnt always ask if he can post things, so I immediately turn away and ask if hes going to post it. Or Ill find out later because my friend saw something of me on his Instagram and Ill have to ask him to take it down.

Other parents can also present a problem for the child who prefers to control how she appears online. Wendy Bradford, a mother of three elementary-school aged children in Manhattan, said that when parent chaperones took pictures during a third-grade field trip to the zoo, her daughter hid when she saw the phones because she didnt want the pictures to be posted on Facebook with her in them.

Isabella Aijo, 15, a high school sophomore in Natick, Mass., said, I definitely know people who have parents who post things they wish werent out there. There was a girl in my eighth grade class whose mom opened a YouTube account for her in the fourth grade to show off her singing, she wrote to me in an email. Finally, on one of the last months of middle school, a peer played the song in class and almost the entire class laughed hysterically over it.

Those early posts from parents linger, not just online, but in our childrens memories  and the topics may be things we dont see as potentially embarrassing. The son of a friend (who asked that I not use her name) still brings up things she wrote about his picky eating when he was younger  years ago, she says.

But that kind of sharing  about food issues, potty training and tantrums  is exactly the kind of sharing that can be valuable. Children benefit from the community created when parents have the ability to share their stories, said Ms. Steinberg. Those posts about picky eating might have helped my friend find solutions, or a fresh wellspring of patience for a behavior her child would eventually outgrow.

When parents share those early frustrations, they dont see themselves as exposing something personal about their childrens lives, but about their own. As a society, says Ms. Steinberg, were going to have to find ways to balance a parents right to share their story and a parents right to control the upbringing of their child with a childs right to privacy.

Parents often intrude on a childs digital identity, not because they are malicious, but because they havent considered the potential reach and the longevity of the digital information that theyre sharing, said Ms. Steinberg.

In general, said Sarita Schoenebeck, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, who co-authored the research, both children and parents considered positive images, events and news more appropriate to share than negative ones. Parents can consider, too, the searchability and reach of the format (although those are always evolving). A frustrated tweet about a child who wont eat her cereal because its not in a red bowl is a lot less likely to resurface than a YouTube video of the resulting tantrum. Looking for advice or sympathy about a behavioral problem? Skip both the image, and your childs name, in a post to limit later searches.

At our house, I sometimes see the hesitation in my oldest son, who is 14, when I bring out the camera at a goofy moment, but we have a whole house rule: no sharing images of anyone else without their consent, ever. That trust means I get my candid shots, and he keeps his digital identity, whatever he eventually wants it to be, intact.

IN August 2009, I was betrayed by both my husband and my country.









A few months earlier I had left Iran  for good, perhaps, though I did not know it then. The government had harassed me for years for my work as a lawyer and a human-rights activist, and the threats against me had increased in the run-up to the presidential election that June. I took a vacation and, along with my younger daughter, Nargess, went to visit my older daughter, Negar, in Atlanta.

I usually spoke to my husband, Javad, two or three times a week, on appointed days. He had a SIM card for my calls, bought under someone elses name, to make it difficult for the authorities to trace.

One Monday, I wasnt able to reach him during our usual time. I wasnt unduly concerned. He often spent long weekends at our country house, where the reception was weak. But days passed, and there was no word from him. I finally called my sister in Tehran, Nooshin, and asked her to check on our apartment, but it was empty.

Then Nooshin called me to say that she had knocked again and found him at home. She said he had just returned from a trip, was unwell, and was going straight to bed.

The next day, Javad called.

Shirin? His voice shook.

Where have you been? Nooshin has been looking for you!

Shirin, I dont know if you can forgive me. I could hear him breathing shallowly.

Are you crying? My fingers flew to my throat. Whats happened?

Will you forgive me?

Javad, tell me first whats happened!

He began to explain, in a crushed, flattened voice, what had transpired in the nearly two weeks since we had last spoken. This is what my husband of 34 years relayed to me:

He had been feeling, in his words, very lonely and empty. One evening a friend of his, a Ms. Jafari, invited him over to her apartment.

Very unexpectedly, a mutual friend, Mehri, also stopped by. Javads voice dropped off.

Between Mehri and me ... a romantic relationship used to exist. But I had not seen her for a very long time. Years. We had stopped our relationship. But Ms. Jafari thought we should get back together. She kept pouring us more to drink and saying that we were both going through difficult times and could support each other. She kept stressing that now that my wife was gone, I was all alone and needed someone to show me some affection.

Apparently, at that point, this Ms. Jafari said she had an appointment and left my husband and the other woman alone.

Mehri started taking her clothes off, hugging me, saying how much she had missed me.

I said nothing.

Shirin, are you there? Are you listening?

I was not a suspicious wife. He had never raised questions about my male colleagues, and Id accorded him the same understanding. It had seemed to work for us, this mutual respect. Until now. I kept staring at the coffee table, with its magazines, a Rembrandt coaster; all of it looked the same as it had five minutes ago. How could it look the same?

Go on.

She kept touching me ... and I ... I succumbed ... We were embracing in the bedroom when suddenly the door of the second bedroom of the apartment burst open.

That was when an intelligence agent  a man I knew well, who had gone after my work for years  and two cameramen came in. They had recorded everything  the conversation, the whole event. They ordered Javad to dress, and in a few minutes the apartment was full of agents. Javad was handcuffed, blindfolded and pushed downstairs and into a car.

What happened to ... that woman? And your host? I tried to keep the rage out of my voice, but I couldnt bring myself to say her name.

They only arrested me. Im sure Jafari was cooperating with them. How else could they have set up all their equipment before I even got there? I cant really be sure about Mehri. All I know is they didnt arrest her.

Javad was taken to Evin Prison, where I had visited so many clients and where, nine years earlier, I myself had once spent 25 days, on a charge of disturbing public opinion.

Because he had been caught drinking alcohol, his bare back was lashed. Did the lasher hold a Quran under his arm, to prevent him from using too much force? I forgot to ask this.

And then they led him to a solitary confinement cell, perhaps only slightly bigger than a bathtub, and left him there for two days.

On the third day, two prison guards came. They blindfolded him again and led him to a sort of courtroom, where a bearded cleric, the judge, sat behind a wooden desk.

Javad later told me what the judge had said:

Ive watched the entire film. Theres really no room for denial. You are a married man and have committed adultery. According to Article 225 of the Islamic Penal Code, you are sentenced to death by stoning. The sentence will be carried out two days from now.

I want a lawyer, Javad said. Im not going to do anything without a lawyer.

A lawyer! the judge said, amused. What for? What is a lawyer going to say? We have a film of you, sir  your entire liaison is on camera! What kind of defense do you imagine you could mount? Just go. Go be ashamed of yourself, and spend your last two days repenting to God.

The trial took about 20 minutes. Iranian judges scarcely ever handed down stoning verdicts, but the situation seemed to require an especially horrific punishment. The real purpose of the arrest became clear a few hours later, when the intelligence agent who had arrested Javad, along with his boss, came to Javads cell.

I cant help imagining them standing over him, Javad unshaven, with dark circles under his eyes.

Now Ebadi can see the result of her activities, the agent told him grandly. I warned her so many times. So many times I told her, You need to shut up. But she never listened.

Javad had never been involved in my cases; he was not political. Why should I be responsible for what my wife does? he asked them. What kind of dirty games are you trying to play with me? Because of my wife, you harass me like this, in the name of Islam?

The agents eyes darkened. He lunged toward Javad, punching him, kicking him savagely.

Dont you dare ever mention Islam again, do you hear me? The word Islam is dirty in your mouth.

The intelligence agent said I had been proud; now I would see my weakness.

When Javad saw that pleading or protesting would only provoke more beating, he asked what it was they wanted.

For the first time, the agents boss spoke. He explained the problem:

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Advertisement Advertisement Continue reading the main story

If youre still defending your wife, it means youre her ally and collaborator. And you should be punished as such. If the truth is otherwise, you need to prove that to us.

All he had to do in order to gain his freedom was to read a short statement in front of a camera:

Shirin Ebadi did not deserve to receive the Nobel Prize. She was awarded the prize so that she could help topple the Islamic Republic. She is a supporter of the West, particularly America. Her work is not in the service of Iranians, but serves the interests of foreign imperialists who seek to weaken Iran.

He knew immediately he would do it. Surely, everyone would know that he had been pressured into saying those things.

And so the next day he shaved, showered and sat in a staged living room, with comfortable armchairs and a side table with a vase of plastic pink roses, and denounced me.

He told me all this, and it was bad enough. But what I heard next was worse. In order to overturn the stoning sentence for adultery, he and the woman he had slept with would have to go to a cleric for a certificate of temporary marriage, backdated by five years.

Javad was waiting for me to say something, but I was, for perhaps the first time in my life, unable to come up with a single thing. As a woman, a wife, I was sick with anger. He had betrayed me. But I was even more furious with the intelligence agents. They were prepared to do anything  crush peoples families, their marriages  to achieve their ends.

WHAT did they want from me? I didnt permit myself that thought very often. But it came careening into my head, and I wanted to run out onto the balcony and scream it. How much could they take away from one person? I had been the first female judge in Iran. After the Islamic Revolution, they took that from me. When I resurrected myself and built a human-rights center, they took that, too. With their violence and electoral fraud, I had lost my homeland. And now they had tried to take away my husband. I closed my eyes, wanting nothing but to go to sleep. But Javad was talking again, asking me  me!  for advice about his pending stoning sentence.

What do you think I should do?

I dont see any option but to do as theyve asked, I said. But, of course, only if ... that woman ... agrees.

Javad said he would try to contact her and would let me know what happened.

I waited to hear back. Moving around the apartment in Atlanta, I thanked God for small graces. That my daughters had been out when Javad called, and that they would  at least for a time  be spared knowing what had been done to their parents.

I swung between rage and guilt. It was my work that had caused this to happen to my husband. And yet was it not Javad who had betrayed me? But I was not in his shoes, isolated, away from my wife and daughters, vulnerable. I thought of telling him that he was not alone. That I knew of many cases where the Intelligence Ministry had done the same sorts of things to others, used sexual blackmail in order to force dissident politicians out of public life or simply to wound and silence critics. But knowing this didnt lessen my anger, and I doubted that it would lessen his pain.

A week later, Javad called and told me how things had gone. He had telephoned Mehri  he said her name, I did not  and she had agreed to go with him to see the cleric. As promised, the cleric had issued a backdated marriage certificate that showed them, at the date of filming, to have been sigheh, or temporarily married. Under sigheh, the duration of the marriage is determined in advance; it could be as short as an hour or as long as a decade. If a child is born, he or she is a rightful child, with all legal entitlements from both parents. When the sigheh expires, the couple should separate, unless the arrangement is mutually extended. The practice has existed for centuries but is shunned by younger and less traditional Iranians, who see it as an archaic religious loophole that effectively legalizes prostitution.

Javad had taken the certificate back to the court at Evin and paid a small fine. The punishment they had dangled over him, execution by stoning, the punishment they had used to force him to denounce me before the cameras, was null. But he had been required to turn over his passport and was barred from leaving the country.

In the days that followed, we talked several times. But I felt as though I was speaking to a stranger. Javad was broken, pleading during each conversation for me not to leave him. He sounded so unwell that regardless of my own feelings, I was worried for him. His denunciation of me had not yet been released, and the threat of it hung over our heads. He kept saying he wanted to see me and the girls, but it was impossible.

I tried to keep it from our daughters, but Nargess finally confronted me. She had overheard something Id said on the phone; she wanted to know what was happening.

After I told her, she just kept demanding: Why would he do such a thing and speak against you? Why would he go with that woman?

I decided to be frank. Nargess worked in The Hague, researching and documenting terrible atrocities. She needed to see how that work connected to what she was experiencing in her family. The field of human rights is not about pretty words; it involves the abuse of the vulnerable by those who wield power. That was the line that connected massacres in Sarajevo to atrocities in Sierra Leone to the systematic persecution of dissidents in places like Iran and Russia.

I told her that if she wanted to be a human-rights lawyer, she had to understand what that world involved.

Human beings are free, Nargess. But each individual has only a certain threshold for suffering. Your father couldnt take that kind of torture. This could have happened to any man, I said. This is something between him and me. But you have to look at it differently. You should be wondering why an intelligence agent was hiding with a camera in the second bedroom. Were the countrys problems resolved by determining who was cheating on whom? This was a trap they used against me, and that is how you must think about it.

It was a bitter lesson to impart to my daughter. More than six years later  after Javads denunciation of me was aired on television; after countless agonized phone calls; after we finally agreed to divorce  it is a lesson I am still learning myself.",[]

WEDNESDAYS PUZZLE  If you happen to be on Facebook, you know that you can express your approval of just about anything with the click of the LIKE button.

Wouldnt it be great if there were an I feel thankful button? Gratitude is an essential component of happiness, and I believe its important to acknowledge and express our gratitude on a regular basis. In fact, todays I feel thankful button clicks go to both the actor and writer Josh Radnor and to Will Shortz, our fearless puzzle master, for asking Mr. Radnor to be our guest solver.

Mr. Radnor plays the role of Ted on the CBS television series How I Met Your Mother, and in May, Mr. Shortz hilariously portrayed himself in the episode Robots vs. Wrestlers. After the cast crashes a highfalutin New York party where Mr. Shortz is among the guests, Teds intellectual snobbery ingratiates him with the highbrow crowd because a party isnt rocking until someone recites Dante in the original Italian, is it?

Now, Mr. Radnor makes his directorial debut with Happythankyoumoreplease, a film about gratitude, connection and love that opens March 4 in New York and Los Angeles, March 11 in San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas, and Phoenix, and expanding to other cities after that. He also wrote the screenplay and stars in it, so Im particularly thankful that he took the time out to solve Barry Silks very clever puzzle.

Oh, right. The puzzle. I thought this was a very nice Wednesday, with a cool theme that may not reveal itself entirely until you get to 54 Across. Be patient. Youre at least somewhat likely to get it. Having lived in New York City for most of my life, I got LEASH LAW right away, although I was held up momentarily by the fact that I can never predict which Mauna is needed.

Lets see how Mr. Radnor did. SPOILER ALERT: Mr. Radnor gives away far more than I normally do in a post (in fact, the theme is revealed), so if youre still solving, please wait until youre done to read his witty write-up:

Josh Radnors Solving Notes:

The crossword puzzle is a bit of a double-edged sword for me: I love doing it, but I often use it to avoid doing the things I really should be doing. (Weird meta-case in point: this morning, I delayed finishing this piece about solving the crossword puzzle by working on a crossword puzzle.) I started doing The New York Times crossword puzzle when I was 19, and there were years when I had to do the puzzle every day or I just didnt feel right. I have a freakish ability to stare at a tougher puzzle for an absurdly long time, but this tendency can also, if unchecked, get in the way of, you know, life. Nowadays, I try to limit myself to Sundays. Its an addiction, after all, and Ive had to manage it. As far as addictions go, though, its one of the more pleasant and least harmful ones to have.

So I generally scan all the clues very quickly for any gimmes, which is what I did on this one. The first five that popped out at me were all peoples names  ROONE Arledge, LON Chaney, IAN McShane, UMA Thurman, AXL Rose. It seems having a distinctive three-letter name pretty much guarantees crossword puzzle immortality. Im thinking of you, Emo Phillips and Yma Sumac. My first non-name was 62 Across, Russian pancakes (BLINI).

There are certain things I know only because I do crossword puzzles. For instance, there is absolutely no reason I would know that Ray KROC (43 Down) founded McDonalds were it not for crossword puzzles. (Ditto on a priests robe being an alb and fishermen being called anglers.) Arthur ASHE is a crossword regular, and he makes an appearance in this puzzle (37 Down, 1975 Wimbledon winner), as does ARLEN Specter (64 Across).

Some of the things I enjoyed in the puzzle: 1 Across and 9 Across, two great words: AGASP and ABHOR. One of the best-titled magazines Ive never read: UTNE reader (55 Down). I rather liked the clues for 65 Across (Its a plus, ASSET) and 45 Down (Watch a kitty, CAT-SIT.) One Down, Smart guys? took me a moment. I initially thought it was MENSA, but the question mark led me to ALECS.

The theme of the puzzle, OUTSIDE CHANCE was clever (well done, Barry C. Silk!). Twenty, 29 and 44 Across all split the word chance to flank the beginning and end of the answer: Big Bopper hit [(CHAN)TILLY LA(CE)], Barrier with a diamond pattern [(CHA)INLINK FE(NCE)], and the one that gave me the most trouble, Group overseeing Notre Dame Cathedral [(CH)URCH OF FR(ANCE)].

Ive long wondered why I enjoy the crossword puzzle so much (and when I say crossword puzzle, I mean the New York Times crossword puzzle  all other puzzles feel like imposters to me). I think it appeals to the part of my brain that longs for order  for everything to be, as Radiohead sings, in its right place. Writing and directing my first movie was, I realized, not unlike solving a crossword puzzle. Even though there are far more variables, there is something very puzzlelike in the construction of a movie. You can feel when a scene or line of dialogue is finally where it needs to be, and conversely, when it isnt. Directing a movie is intensely time-consuming, and Im getting set to direct my second one. Hopefully, Ill be able to limit my puzzle intake during the process. One day at a time.

Thanks for playing, Mr. Radnor, and thank you for helping me start a discussion about gratitude.

LONDON  The American promoter Charlie Stillitano could hardly have chosen a worse time to push for change in European soccer.









Stillitano, the chairman of Relevant Sports, runs summer tournaments called the International Champions Cup. It features elite soccer teams from Europe playing one another during their off-seasons in three different countries: the United States, Australia and China. Its novelty factor has drawn sold-out crowds and drummed up television and sponsorship money for, in effect, watching half-fit star players getting into shape for the coming season.

Europes best are coming, is the slogan on its website. Relevant Sports claims to have revolutionized the international soccer landscape by transforming the standard European club preseason tour into something remarkable: a competitive, world-class tournament.

Those words are like something from an old-school boxing promoter: The tournament features the heavyweights of the game, but it fails to mention that the teams are nowhere close to their peak when it comes to performance.

Last week, Stillitano met in London with executives of five English clubs: Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United. On satellite radio, Stillitano later talked about how those teams are the elite of the Champions League and, in his view, deserve permanent roles in the tournament and far more money.

Lets call it the money pot created by soccer and the fandom around the world, Stillitano said on a show on Sirius XM. Who has had more of an integral role, Manchester United or Leicester?

He acknowledged that Leicester Citys rise out of nowhere to lead the English Premier League this season is a wonderful, wonderful story. But, the promoter said, you have to look at it from Manchester Uniteds or Chelseas perspective.

Those teams are having a bad season (or several, in Manchesters case). They might not qualify for a place in the next Champions League and that, according to Stillitano, should not be allowed to happen. Essentially, he would want a tournament without relegation for the biggest clubs.

I guess they dont have a birthright to be in it every year, he said, but its the age-old argument  U.S. sports franchises versus what they have in Europe. There are wonderful, wonderful, wonderful elements to relegation and promotion, and there are good arguments for a closed system.

Is Stillitano really Silvio Berlusconi in disguise?

Nearly 30 years ago, when Berlusconis team, A.C. Milan, was ruling Europe, the Italian politician and club owner attempted to lead a breakaway of Europes richer clubs and close the door to any upstart from gate-crashing what is now the Champions League.

The word champion has become a misnomer. Nowadays, four clubs from England, Spain, Germany and sometimes Italy qualify  some, seemingly perennially  for the UEFA Champions League. The fact that A.C. Milan struggles now in Italy, or that both Manchester teams and Chelsea are suffering below-par seasons in England, is no reason to exclude them from the financial spoils of top European competition, according to the Berlusconi/Stillitano theory.

Over the weekend, Leicesters Italian coach, Claudio Ranieri, described that as anti-competitive, a proposal by the elite, for the elite.

You are afraid, Ranieri said. You are not strong. You should ask why is little Leicester doing better than us? Instead, you want to change the system because this year you are weak.

Beyond that, Stillitanos International Champions Cup is in danger this year of being pushed aside on two fronts. Starting in June, the Copa America Centenario, a special edition of the South American continental championship, will be played in 10 American cities to mark the events 100th anniversary.

The top South American players who normally would take part in the off-season tours by the big European clubs will instead be playing in the United States for their national teams.

In addition, the majority of the best European players will also be in action in June and July, when their national teams play in an expanded Euro 2016 tournament in France.

Barcelona is the champion of champions in world soccer at the moment, but it wont be traveling to Australia, China or the United States to play in the world-class I.C.C. this summer.

How could Barcelona take part? Its top three stars  Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez  will be playing for their countries at the expanded Copa America, while much of the rest of the team will be trying to defend Spains title at the Euro.

Barcelona will have a presence in the United States this summer. It will hold summer camps for children in nine cities as it increases its awareness abroad, the clubs president, Josep Bartomeu, told me on the same day in another London hotel just a few hundred yards from where Stillitano met with the club officials.

Bartomeu said then that his club, like all the rest, cannot ignore the rising popularity of soccer in the United States. But equally important, the club  the reigning Spanish, European and Club World Cup champion  appreciates that athletes do have a breaking point.

The off-season is when Messi, Neymar and their teammates can finally rest and recuperate and spend time with their families after a grueling nine-month season  or even undergo the surgeries needed to repair the damage taken from chasing so many trophies.

The schedules are too crowded already without further revolutionizing the international soccer landscape.",[]

PARIS  Sing, muse, of crinolines piled in layers, of blunt-cut bobs and Cupids bow lips?

Inspirations come in many forms during the fashion collections. It has been a surprise, though not an unwelcome one, to find that this season, an unexpected one joins their ranks: the fabulously eccentric fashion writer Lynn Yaeger, who watched her own avatars on the march from her place in the stands.

Ms. Yaeger, a fashion mainstay who wrote for decades for The Village Voice during its alterna-bible glory days and now contributes to Vogue, has a signature, unvarying style: an anachronistic little bob dyed flaming red, pyramidal layers of skirt and underskirt, the exaggerated lips painted a la Betty Boop, two traffic-light dots of rouge high on her cheeks.

During New York Fashion Week, early in the monthlong marathon of shows, a new model, Katie Moore, appeared with a bob cut almost exactly like Ms. Yaegers, and dyed tomato-red. W Magazine reported that the look was brand new; Guido Palau, the runway hairstylist, had cut what had previously been nearly waist-length corn-silk blond hair just before the shows.

With her new look, Ms. Moore opened the Alexander Wang show, a coveted get for models.

Its the Mamie Eisenhower bangs, Ms. Yaeger said with admiration. Most people wont go there.

At the Marc Jacobs show later in New York, the designer showed the oversize skirts in the inverted-top style Ms. Yaeger flatters. The similarity was not lost on her or her colleagues. Marc Jacobs was astonishing, Ms. Yaeger said in Paris. Yeah, it was flattering.

And, astonishingly, as fashion month wore on, so it seemed did little outcroppings of homage. Perhaps it was merely the acquisition of Yaeger-colored glasses, but one could see a bit of her style in the ever-enlarging ball skirts of the Undercover finale and even, too, in some of the ballooning pieces at Chloe. And Ms. Moore, the Lynn-alike model, had a banner season, walking major shows in London, Milan and Paris, including Moschino, Margiela and Balenciaga.

Ms. Yaeger was humble about the phenomenon, saying that she had no plans to alter her trademark style because of it.

I dont know why anyone would put anything else on a runway, she said. Nor could she fathom other styles off the runway. Did you notice some girls actually wear pants? she said. Ive never even seen pants for sale!",[]

Homeland

This was a very strange episode, wasnt it? The pacing off-kilter, the dialogue contrived, the background music oddly plaintive, and the characters both muted and, oddly, overdrawn  as though the regular actors had taken the night off and been replaced by a group of far less talented understudies.

The Walking Dead

Toward the end of this weeks The Walking Dead, Maggie, dejected and wandering through a sewer of waterlogged walkers and broken dreams, collapsed into an emotional heap of Glenn-grief, self-recrimination and anguished uncertainty. Read more...

The Affair

A full-floor aerie on the 30th floor of the Heritage at Trump Place on the Upper West Side, with ample outdoor space and far-reaching river, park and cityscape vistas, sold for $15,500,000 and was the most expensive closed sale of the week, according to city records.

The 4,673-square-foot apartment, PH-Suite 1, at 240 Riverside Boulevard, is one of two penthouse suites in the 31-story condominium, which is part of the 75-acre Trump Place-Riverside South development that extends from 72nd Street to 59th Street and borders the Hudson River.

The unit had been on the market since October 2014, when it was initially listed for $17.5 million, according to StreetEasy.com; the most recent asking price was $16.5 million. Monthly carrying charges total $16,179.

The sprawling home has four bedrooms and four and a half baths, as well as dining and living rooms, a library and a newly renovated chefs kitchen. There are two 31-by-7-foot terraces  one off the living room and another reached through a large reception hall  that provide stunning panoramic views of Riverside Park, the Hudson and city landscape.

The large master suite, which has views stretching from Riverside Park to the George Washington Bridge to Central Park, has a dressing room and an en-suite double bathroom with a whirlpool tub. The three other bedrooms have en-suite baths as well.

Two separate storage units were also included in the sale.

The buyer was identified in city records as Azimuth International Holdings. Michelle King of the Corcoran Group represented the seller, identified as Joel Vaturi.

The weeks runner-up, at $13,000,000, according to city records, was a four-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath apartment in a J. E. R. Carpenter-designed co-op building on the Upper East Side.

The unit, No. 6A, at 625 Park Avenue near 65th Street, also listed with Corcoran, carries $13,154 in monthly maintenance. It sold for $500,000 below its most recent asking price, according to StreetEasy.

The apartment offers many prewar flourishes: soaring ceilings, decorative moldings and an ornate coffered ceiling in the formal dining room.

There is an elevator landing that opens to a central gallery flanked by the living room, library and dining room, each with a fireplace. The corner master bedroom suite also has a fireplace, as well as a sitting room, dressing room and en-suite bath.

The buyer was Kurt Simon, the global chairman of mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase, and his wife, Katherine Simon; they were represented by Jaclyn Boulan of Stribling & Associates. The seller, a trust linked to Sy Syms, a pioneer discount retailer who died in 2009, was represented by Sharon Baum and David Enloe of Corcoran.

Around 11:30 p.m. on Oct. 10, 2012, a police officer in Nogales, Ariz., named John Zuniga received a call reporting suspicious activity on International Street, which runs directly alongside the Mexican border. Most of Zunigas calls involved shoplifters at the local Walmart or domestic-violence complaints, but he also worked as a liaison with United States Customs and Border Protection (C.B.P.). Though border security is the responsibility of the Border Patrol, the Nogales police can assist when illegal activity is happening stateside  if, for instance, drug smugglers have slipped over the fence and are making their way into Arizona.

For the past several decades, the population of Nogales has hovered around 20,000. The population of its Mexican sister city, also called Nogales, has grown in recent years to around 250,000. Depending on where youre standing, the abutting cities can start to seem like a single, sprawling Nogales; modest homes cover the surrounding foothills in every direction, and for years, locals referred to the region as a singular entity, Ambos Nogales  Both Nogales. A lot of us have families in Mexico, Zuniga, who grew up on the Arizona side and is 38, told me. I still remember, as a kid, youd have family members from over there suddenly show up at the house. You didnt ask any questions. People would just go back and forth. Immigration wasnt that big of a deal back in the day.

Photo

Things began to change after Sept. 11, Zuniga said, when border security became a political issue. Facing an electorate fearful about terrorism and angry about illegal immigration, Congress allocated $90 billion to border security over the next 10 years, which went toward 650 miles of new fence and, for C.B.P. agents, military hardware like drones, assault rifles and Black Hawk helicopters. The number of Border Patrol agents doubled during the second term of the George W. Bush administration, to 20,000 from 11,000. In 1995, the number of agents in C.B.P.s Tucson sector, which includes Nogales, was roughly 400; today, it has grown to more than 4,000. There are cameras everywhere  on towers near town, on drones, on the backs of flatbed trucks driven into the desert  as well as thousands of motion-detecting sensors, many of them hidden in rocks or buried in the sand.

The fence that now bisects Ambos Nogales cost about $4.14 million per mile to build, its height varying between 18 and 30 feet. It was installed in 2011, replacing a fence made of solid steel panels. Some Border Patrol agents prefer the new slat design, because they can look through the fence and observe activity on the other side. Slick anticlimbing plates lining the top increase the difficulty of scaling the wall, but it is by no means impossible. Undocumented immigrants and drug smugglers still manage to climb it every day.

Thats why the call Zuniga received in October 2012 was not especially remarkable. A Nogales police officer named Quinardo Garcia had arrived on the scene first and witnessed two men in camouflage pants and sweatshirts, with large taped bundles strapped to their backs, climbing the fence into the United States. Based on my training and experience, Garcia later wrote in his incident report, I identified the bundles as marijuana and immediately called out the incident to assisting graveyard units.

Garcia chased the men on foot, but they disappeared into an overgrown residential yard. Fearing an ambush, Garcia decided to wait for backup. Within minutes, Zuniga arrived, as did several Border Patrol agents. As they began to scope the area, Zuniga spotted two men scaling the fence back into Mexico. By the time I show up, theyre empty-handed, with nothing on their backs, he told me.

Police officers and Border Patrol agents refrain from climbing onto the fence themselves, for reasons of both safety and jurisdiction. I gave them numerous commands to climb down, Zuniga wrote in his own report. One of the men was having difficulty maintaining his grip and seemed on the verge of dropping back onto Arizona soil. I then heard several rocks start hitting the ground, Zuniga wrote, and I looked up, and I could see the rocks flying through the air.

So-called rockings are not uncommon occurrences at the border. The rocks are thrown from the Mexican side to distract agents and force them to take cover while smugglers pass contraband or make their escape. When its dark out and you dont know where theyre coming from, one agent told me, its a really tense situation.

What happened next remains contested. In their reports, Garcia and Zuniga claimed to hear gunfire but could not say where the shooting was coming from. I saw the rocks in the air and tried to take cover, Zuniga told me. I heard shots fired, but I wasnt sure who was shooting. The shots could have been from anywhere: behind me, from Mexico. I didnt witness the actual shooting myself.

In the days following the incident, C.B.P. issued only a terse statement. After verbal commands from agents to cease [assaulting the agents with rocks] were ignored, one agent then discharged his service firearm, it read. One of the subjects appeared to have been hit.

The subject who was hit was not one of the men who had been climbing the fence but a 16-year-old resident of Nogales, Mexico, named Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez, who was on the Mexican side of the border. He had been shot 10 times from behind; an autopsy later revealed that gunshot wounds to the head, lungs and arteries killed him. He was unarmed, carrying nothing but a cellphone. He collapsed on a sidewalk on Calle Internacional, in front of a doctors office, below a sign reading Emergencias Medicas. Six months later, you could still see the bullet holes in the wall. Someone had outlined them with a red marker.

The morning after the shooting, James F. Tomsheck arrived at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, the headquarters of United States Customs and Border Protection, and made his way to the briefing held each weekday for a dozen of the agencys top officials. Six years earlier, when Tomsheck was appointed head of the agencys Office of Internal Affairs, it felt like the capstone of a long and distinguished career. A stolid Nebraskan with a precise, nearly affectless manner of speaking, Tomsheck had spent his entire adult life in law enforcement, first as a police officer in Omaha, his hometown, and later as a Secret Service agent. He busted counterfeiters in Detroit, worked the presidential detail under George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton and eventually became a deputy assistant director of the entire Secret Service, where he oversaw half of its field offices. In 2006, he was recruited to C.B.P. by his former boss at the Secret Service, Ralph Basham, who had been appointed the C.B.P.s commissioner by George W. Bush.

In the early days of the Border Patrol, which was created in 1924, agents patrolled the border (primarily the northern border) on horseback. By 2012, the increasingly militarized agency held its morning briefings in a secure, windowless room in Washington known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or S.C.I.F., where electronic items are left at the door and classified information can be openly discussed. On Oct. 11, Tomsheck and his colleagues were informed that a teenage rock thrower had been killed by a Border Patrol agent in Nogales and that the shots had been fired in self-defense. Tomsheck told me that he was immediately suspicious of this official version of events. Border Patrol leadership, he said, had a well-established history of intentional misinformation. Having sat through these meetings for years, after every one of these shootings, theres an effort to spin and distort facts and obscure a clear understanding of what actually occurred.

Part of the problem was the many overlapping authorities. Tomsheck frequently found himself in an almost parodic bureaucratic scrum of competing government agencies. Within the Department of Homeland Security (D.H.S.), which absorbed various agencies into the newly created Customs and Border Protection agency after Sept. 11, the Office of Inspector General, known as D.H.S.-O.I.G., had right of first refusal when it came to taking the lead on investigations of officer misconduct. If D.H.S.-O.I.G. stepped away, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was second in line to investigate. Only if ICE passed would Tomshecks Office of Internal Affairs be able to take the lead on an investigation. Information sharing among the offices, according to Tomsheck, was minimal.

Outside D.H.S., the F.B.I. could run its own parallel investigations of Border Patrol misconduct. According to Tomsheck, however, the bureau was regularly being walled off by D.H.S.-O.I.G., which in many instances refused to share information and cooperate. Ronald Hosko, who served as assistant director of the F.B.I.s criminal investigative division from 2012 to 2014, described D.H.S.-O.I.G. as a troubled place that regarded sharing information as misconduct, adding that from his perspective, they fought us at every turn. I believe it was a deliberate attempt by senior people in D.H.S. and in the inspector generals shop to avoid cooperating with the F.B.I.

But Tomsheck was happy to work with the F.B.I., and his office had a dedicated liaison agent who reported to the bureaus headquarters daily. In the wake of the Nogales shooting, Tomshecks agents in the Tucson field office found that the official Border Patrol report was not consistent with the information they uncovered on the ground. That prompted discussion with the F.B.I. about how it seemed to be a problematic shooting, Tomsheck says.

Within a week of the incident, Tomsheck was at F.B.I. headquarters watching footage captured by the security cameras lining the border fence. According to him, the video very clearly shows the marijuana smugglers struggling to scale the fence, while the two Nogales police officers and a Border Patrol agent look on. (The footage has never been publicly released.) They do not appear to be displaying any concern for their safety whatsoever, Tomsheck says of the officers. There are no weapons drawn. People have their hands on their hips, standing there watching. If you were to give a title to the video up to that point, it would be: Its Another Day at the Border. 

Then a second Border Patrol agent arrives on the scene. Immediately after emerging from his vehicle, according to Tomshecks description of the video, the agent walks to the fence, pulls out his gun and begins firing. The agent did not interact with the other law-enforcement officers on the scene. He fired the round in chamber, all 12 rounds in the magazine, reloaded and fired at least one additional round, Tomsheck says. They seem absolutely shocked at first. Theres no audio, but theyre clearly thinking, What does he know that we dont?

Tomsheck says the footage he viewed demonstrated that Jose Antonio was certainly not throwing rocks at the time he was shot. He describes the shooting as the most egregious of any excessive-force cases hed seen at C.B.P. and says he felt angry and sickened. Even if he had been throwing rocks previously  its conceivable, but theres no evidence. But this was evidence of a Border Patrol agent shooting an unarmed boy. If charges werent brought against this agent, he thought, the message being sent would be, Its open season at the border.

On the morning of Oct. 11, 2012, just a few hours after Tomsheck learned of the shooting, Roberto Montiel was driving to court when he got a call from an old friend, Taide Elena. A native of Nogales, Ariz., Montiel served for 20 years as a Superior Court judge before opening a private criminal and family law practice. Elena, a Mexican immigrant like Montiels own parents, had worked for Montiels family for years as a housekeeper. My mother basically died in her arms, Montiel told me.

That morning, Elena was distraught. I need your help, she cried in Spanish. They killed Jose Antonio!

Elena was Jose Antonios grandmother. Though she and her husband had legally immigrated to the United States over 20 years ago, her sons family remained in Nogales, Mexico, in a barrio called La Capilla, the Chapel, about four blocks from the border. The neighborhood took its name from the white Spanish colonial church where Jose Antonio and his friends would play basketball. According to the boys family, thats what he was doing on the night of Oct. 10. When he turned onto Calle Internacional, he was walking to meet his older brother, Diego, who worked at a nearby Oxxo convenience store.

Beyond that, Elena later told Montiel, the family had very little information. They had been informed of the death by Mexican authorities, but no one from the United States had contacted them. The incident reports released by the Nogales Police Department listed a sole injured party by name: Tesko, the police dog who arrived at the scene with Zuniga. In his report, Zuniga claimed Tesko was hit by a rock.

It made no sense, Elena said. Her grandson had always been a good kid. Why would he be shot by la migra? When are they going to do something about this killing? she asked.

I explained to her how complex this was, because it involved two countries, Montiel recalls. He didnt know much about the history of cross-border shootings at the time, but he promised to find out if any criminal charges were being considered. Then he asked Luis Fernando Parra, a lawyer with whom he shares office space, to help with the case. Parra specializes in immigration law, and the two occasionally collaborate on international cases involving cross-border money laundering or domestic disputes.

Parra used his connections at the Mexican Consulate to obtain autopsy and ballistics reports from investigators. The findings were startling: Even if, as C.B.P. claimed, Jose Antonio had been throwing rocks at the agents  not an outrageous contention on its face, considering how much control the cartels hold over barrios like La Capilla, where scouts with walkie-talkies and binoculars monitor Border Patrol activity  the autopsy showed the bullet holes were angled from the back to the front, with entry points behind the auricle of the ear and in the posterior region of the neck, torso and deltoid. In other words, the shots had struck him from behind.

Before the autopsy report was publicly released, official accounts of Jose Antonios death had already begun to unravel. A person merely had to stand at the stretch of border fence where the shooting occurred and take in the view. That particular section of fence is 20 feet tall, but it sits on a rocky cliff, and the drop into Mexico from the base of the fence is another 25 feet. From Calle Internacional, hurling rocks over the top of the fence  or through the narrow gaps between the slats, which are only three and a half inches wide  would seem to be all but impossible. Its abundantly clear, Tomsheck, who eventually visited the site with the F.B.I., says, that there was no potential for Jose Antonio to have thrown any projectile from where he stood when he was shot that could cause injury on the U.S. side of the border, not even if he were a major-league baseball pitcher.

In the first months after Jose Antonios death, Parra and Montiel acted primarily in an advocacy role for his family, collecting information from authorities in Mexico, where a criminal investigation remains open, and passing it along to the United States Department of Justice. No lawsuit of any kind had been filed, but Parra told me he and Montiel absolutely had hope that there would be a criminal prosecution of the Border Patrol agent in Arizona.

Border Patrol agents are generally immune from the kind of transparency required of most state and local law-enforcement departments. A 2013 investigation by The Arizona Republic found that since 2005, C.B.P. agents had killed at least 42 people, a majority of them in the United States, but most of the agents identities had been kept secret, and the officers faced few, if any, public repercussions, even in cases in which the justification for the shooting seems dubious. Thirteen of the cases involved American citizens; at least three involved unarmed teenagers who were shot in the back.

From a legal perspective, the complexity of cross-border shootings confounded Jose Antonios case even further. Had the Border Patrol agent been in Mexico when he shot the teenager, he could have been arrested and tried by Mexican authorities; likewise, had Jose Antonio been standing on American soil, most legal scholars agree, he would have had constitutional rights. But the presence of the border fence created a strange extralegal limbo. A similar cross-border shooting took place in Texas in 2010, in which a Border Patrol agent named Jesus Mesa Jr. shot and killed a 15-year-old boy, Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca, who was accused of throwing rocks across the Rio Grande from Ciudad Juarez. In that case, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Hernandezs family had no grounds for a lawsuit because he was a Mexican citizen standing on Mexican soil and therefore not protected by the United States Constitution.

Lee Gelernt, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union who would eventually work with Jose Antonios family, notes that the Nogales shooting raises very, very big questions about the Constitution that the courts will have to resolve. It also raises even broader questions about what, exactly, our borders signify. From the beginning, the story upended the typical mysteries that surround a killing. Jose Antonios death was not the sort of whodunit that involved a search for a murder weapon, or poring over C.S.I. reports, or a hunt for an unknown perpetrator. Most of the important facts, including the identity of the Border Patrol agent who shot Jose Antonio, were known in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, at least by the authorities. Rather, the mysteries inherent in the case were territorial, jurisdictional and, ultimately, philosophical.

At Internal Affairs, Tomshecks duties included determining security clearances and investigating administrative misconduct. But he soon discovered that when it came to more serious infractions, particularly involving excessive use of force, his office held little real power. We had a mandate to hold the Border Patrol accountable but were given very few to no authorities to do that job, he told me. From Day 1, they aggressively resisted every effort.

Increasingly, Tomsheck found himself making better headway working with the F.B.I., where his work primarily involved corruption cases, assisting the bureau with investigations that eventually could be passed on to the Department of Justice. In 2007, working with the bureau, Tomsheck helped make a case against a Border Patrol agent named Eric Macias, who, using his badge to bypass airport security, boarded a domestic flight with five kilos of cocaine in his carry-on luggage. He eventually pleaded guilty to accepting bribes from drug smugglers and received a six-year prison sentence.

Tomsheck told me that he gave David Aguilar, then chief of the Border Patrol, a courtesy call to let him know Macias was going to be arrested. He expected appreciation, but Aguilar was furious. He said, You dont get this! We dont do what youre doing! We manage these problems. He told me that making these kinds of arrests causes embarrassment for the families of agents whove died in the field. (Aguilar declined to comment through a spokesman.)

By 2011, the sheer number of C.B.P. misconduct cases had become so glaring  an average of one C.B.P. officer was arrested every day between 2005 and 2012, 144 of them for corruption-level offenses  that C.B.P. redefined the way in which misconduct was categorized, Tomsheck said. Certain misconduct cases would be deemed mission-compromising and others non-mission-compromising; only the former would have to be reported to Congress.

John Sandweg, who joined Homeland Security in 2009, serving as senior counselor and acting general counsel under Secretary Janet Napolitano and later as acting director of ICE, confirms Tomshecks accounts of intra-agency jostling. A big source of tension, Sandweg said, was D.H.S.-O.I.G.s strong belief that C.B.P. Internal Affairs was violating protocol by passing leads to the F.B.I. instead of to the inspector generals office, adding that a massive backlog of corruption cases at D.H.S.-O.I.G. was a major concern for Napolitano. The backlog was inevitable, Sandweg says, after Congress doubled the size of the Border Patrol but never properly resourced D.H.S.-O.I.G. with enough investigators or funding. But Sandweg pushes back strongly against Tomshecks contention that he was stymied for political reasons. Thats a ridiculous allegation, he says. We were focused on ferreting out corruption cases, period.

Tomsheck was also concerned about the pace of the Border Patrols expansion. He believes it became impossible to properly screen all the new hires. When you double the size of an agency so quickly, you will get people who are minimally qualified, he says. I spoke with a former C.B.P. Internal Affairs investigator, E., who spent nearly two decades as a Border Patrol field agent in Texas and now works in corporate security. (He requested anonymity because his current position sometimes requires the help of old contacts at C.B.P.) E. also linked the hiring surge to problems at C.B.P.: Id see these chiefs Id known all my career, and theyd say, Weve got to take what they send us.  He continued, A lot of stuff was bypassed during the hiring surge. They were mandated to fill those numbers. And Border Patrol, being Border Patrol, said, O.K., bring it on.  In 2010, testifying before a Senate Homeland Security subcommittee, Tomsheck reported a staggering internal study: 60 percent of a pool of Border Patrol agents and customs inspectors who had been administered polygraph tests were deemed unsuitable for service.

Tomsheck thought many of the problems at C.B.P. could be attributed to the hiring of agents who had no law-enforcement experience. The new agents, Tomsheck says, were assured they were not law enforcement but part of a military agency tasked with securing the border. I heard people internally use the word cop in a derogatory way, which I took offense to. By the time I came to C.B.P., I had over 30 years of law-enforcement experience. I was a cop. But thats not what C.B.P. leadership led these people to believe. They came to believe they were not subject to the same constraints as the rest of law enforcement in the United States.

In one case from 2011, a Border Patrol agent fatally shot a 19-year-old American marijuana smuggler named Carlos LaMadrid four times in the back and thigh as he tried to climb over the border fence into Mexico from Douglas, Ariz. The agent, Lucas Tidwell, was never charged. The following year, a 37-year-old bricklayer named Guillermo Arevalo Pedraza was having a picnic in a park on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande when a Border Patrol agent in an airboat opened fire. C.B.P. later released a statement claiming the agents had been subjected to rocks being thrown at them, making no mention of the fact that Arevalo was shot and killed. No agents have been publicly disciplined. (C.B.P. would only confirm facts about its operations and would not comment on specific cases.)

E. has deep familiarity with the Arevalo case, including professional ties to members of the boat patrol, and he told me, Knowing the details  seven rounds, that distance, with no justifiable cause  its intent. He continued: Even if he couldve hurled that rock at that distance, for the agent to say he feared imminent bodily injury? If he did, he could have done something very simple: sat down. In E.s estimation, He was executed.

James Wong, who served under Tomsheck as deputy assistant commissioner of Internal Affairs from 2008 to 2011, previously worked as a state police officer in Louisiana. He not only confirmed Tomshecks recollections of the pushback against Internal Affairs investigations but also shares Tomshecks view that the militarization of the Border Patrol has taken officers into dangerous territory. When I started in law enforcement back in the early 70s, Wong told me, we learned very early on that you dont shoot a fleeing felon in the back, unless theyre shooting back over their shoulder or firing indiscriminately in front of them. To use deadly force just to prevent escape is illegal. The Border Patrol, on the other hand, has a viewpoint where they are on the front line defending the U.S. I have heard several Border Patrol agents say, We will never surrender a foot of U.S. soil  essentially, Ill never retreat. If you have that mind-set, that sets up potentially deadly confrontations. When he questioned agents about the use of deadly force in response to rockings, he said, the typical response was,  Youve never worn green, so you dont understand. The Border Patrol likened themselves to the Marine Corps. No offense  my son-in-law is a Marine. But if youre a law-enforcement agency, thats not what you should be modeling yourself after.

One afternoon last September, I visited the block of International Street where the shooting took place. A dog in front of a run-down house furiously tested its chain. Several of the fences bars had been tagged with stickers, each one about twice the size of a baseball card and illustrated, Shepard Fairey-style, with a portrait of Jose Antonio. The artist had painted the boys skin yellow, the shade of a butterscotch candy.

Id been standing at the fence for approximately 20 seconds when the first Border Patrol car drove slowly past me. About a minute later, a second Border Patrol vehicle pulled up nearby. An agent emerged, wearing a stiff green uniform, a flak jacket and a sidearm. Youre not allowed to pass anything through the fence, he told me. I held up my notebook and identified myself as a reporter. Looking dubious, he replied, If I see you doing anything, Im going to have to do something about it. I said O.K., and he returned to his truck, where he sat and watched me.

As I walked back to my rental car, the agent waved me over and asked what I was writing about. He was familiar with the case. Sad story, he said. Lowering his voice in a conspiratorial way, he added: Thing is? It was totally legit. He meant the shots. He wouldnt elaborate, only to say that hed had rocks thrown at him and that it was some scary [expletive]. Then he pointed out a section of fence down the street that he said was a popular climbing spot. Sure enough, when I went over to take a look, the rust color of the bars had been worn away by overuse, leaving vitiligous blotches of white.

Just beyond that section of fence, Jose Antonio lived in one of the older barrios of Nogales. When I visited the site of his death, at the corner of Calle Ingenieros (Engineers Street) and Calle Internacional, the bullet holes in the wall of the doctors office had been filled in, but posters featuring images of Jose Antonios face and the word JUSTICIA! were pasted to the wall. Though it was after 8 p.m., a group of kids wearing uniforms came walking past on their way home from school. (Because of overcrowding, students attend school in Nogales and other parts of Mexico in shifts.) One boy was holding a basketball; a girl strummed a ukulele.

Jose Antonio lived a short walk from the corner, at the top of a hill and across the street from a primary school. His familys home, surrounded by a variety of ramshackle dwellings, sits on a rocky outcropping, a couple of feet of which must be scaled to reach the yard, which is partly surrounded by a half-built cinder-block wall. Inside, in a modestly decorated living room with cracked plaster walls, a shrine had been erected atop an end table: a framed photograph of Jose Antonio at 15 surrounded by ceramic angels, flowers and religious candles. The photograph was the original image used by the poster artists. Jose Antonio seemed impossibly young, a crew-neck T-shirt visible beneath his striped polo shirt and a placid, searching expression on his face.

Araceli Rodriguez, Jose Antonios mother, was wearing a red blouse and jeans when I visited. (Jose Antonios family members all spoke in Spanish.) Her hair was pulled back, and her mouth remained fixed in a melancholy, anxious smile. She grew up in Navojoa, a small city not far from the Gulf of California coast. At 18, she moved to Nogales to join her brothers family and soon met her future husband, Roman Elena Zojo. She didnt want to talk much about him: They had four children together, but he was convicted in 1999 for his part in a kidnapping incident in which the victim died, and he spent 10 years in prison. The couple separated during this period. Not long after his release, he was found dead in Nogales, Mexico, a plastic bag over his head and a cardboard sign attached to his body referring to los bajadores of the area, the workers. News articles at the time of his death said he had been smuggling drugs and undocumented immigrants into the United States.

Jose Antonio was 13 when his father was murdered. He had visited him in prison on occasion but never got to know him very well. Supporting her four children as a single mother, Araceli had taken a job cleaning a bank in Navojoa, a nine-hour bus ride from Nogales. The two youngest children, both girls, lived with their mother, while the boys remained at the house in Nogales, looked after by Taide Elena and an aunt. Araceli said she spoke with her sons constantly and visited as often as she could.

Jose Antonios brother, Diego, 22, is tall and slender, with a wispy goatee. He sat on a kitchen chair, beneath a crooked door frame. Norteno music drifted up from the street below, through the tight mesh of a metal screen door pocked with larger holes. When I asked Diego what sorts of things he and his brother did for fun, his face reddened, and he began to weep.

It was six months after Jose Antonios death before a pair of assistant United States attorneys from the Department of Justice finally arranged to speak with Araceli and Diego. Parra said the interviews took place in a room at the main border-crossing station in Nogales. (Despite living so close to the fence and having family on the other side, none of the family members had ever been granted a visa or visited the United States.) It was pretty hard-nosed questioning, Parra, who was at the interview, said, but the family is absolutely sure Jose Antonio wasnt involved in anything.

The D.O.J. also interviewed witnesses in Mexico. A 34-year-old security guard named Isidro Alvarado told investigators he was walking along Calle Internacional about 20 feet behind Jose Antonio when two young people came racing past them and turned onto a side street. Seconds later, multiple shots rang out, and Jose Antonio fell to the ground.

Another witness, a local restaurant owner who lived across the street from the doctors office where Jose Antonio collapsed, was pulling into his driveway when he heard a commotion near the fence. He told investigators that he saw the smugglers trying to climb back into Mexico. Then, he said, four men on the Mexican side of the border threw rocks toward the fence and ran past his house. After that, he heard multiple shots. When the gunfire stopped, he went outside and saw Jose Antonios body.

After their interview, the Rodriguez family received no further word from the Justice Department. Parra and Montiel couldnt get any information, either  not about the status of the D.O.J.s investigation or even if a criminal case would ever be brought against the agent.

Unknown to Jose Antonios family, whose grief had been magnified by the silence of the United States government, the incident had roiled the Border Patrol. By late 2012, news reports about the shooting of Jose Antonio had increased scrutiny of the agency. Tomsheck had also been telling the acting deputy C.B.P. commissioner, Thomas Winkowski, that there was a use-of-force problem within the agency. In response to these external pressures, C.B.P. commissioned a study by the independent, nonprofit Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), which reviewed every incident between January 2010 and October 2012 in which a Border Patrol agent had used deadly force: 67 cases in all, 19 resulting in deaths.

The damning report, which was leaked in February 2014, described agents who intentionally put themselves into the exit path of suspects fleeing in vehicles, thereby . . . creating justification for the use of deadly force; in the case of rockings, the authors noted that too many cases do not appear to meet the test of objective reasonableness with regard to the use of deadly force. They recommended that C.B.P. train agents to de-escalate these encounters by taking cover, moving out of range and/or using less lethal weapons. The report also recommended that officers/agents should be prohibited from using deadly force against subjects throwing objects not capable of causing serious physical injury or death.

The report did not cite specific details, but certain of the fatal Border Patrol shootings covered by the investigators had long been public  and troubling. In 2010, Miguel Torres Vasquez, a Border Patrol agent in Douglas, Ariz., shot and killed a fleeing undocumented migrant named Jorge Alfredo Solis Palma; Vasquez claimed Palma had been throwing rocks. That same year, in Eagle Pass, Tex., a Border Patrol agent named Taylor Poitevent chased down a pickup truck being driven by Juan Mendez Jr., an 18-year-old American citizen. Mendez had been trying to drive away with 320 pounds of marijuana that had been smuggled across the Rio Grande; Poitevent fatally shot Mendez in the back after the pair came to blows on a residential lawn. The following summer, a Border Patrol agent, Dorian Diaz, shot and killed Jesus Yanez Reyes, an undocumented migrant; Diaz claimed Reyes was throwing rocks from a tree on the Mexican side of the fence, near the Tijuana-San Diego border. No criminal charges were ever brought against any of the agents.

By the time the report was leaked, Tomsheck had had a copy for a year. Many within the agency had dismissed it. The Border Patrol perspective was that many of the recommendations were not appropriate or valid, Tomsheck told me. I saw this as another example of the Border Patrol attempting to advance a pattern and practice that departed significantly from use-of-force policies common throughout U.S. law enforcement. But in May 2014, three months after the report leaked, a new C.B.P. commissioner, Gil Kerlikowske, released a revised use-of-force policy that incorporated a number of the reports recommendations.

The following month, Tomsheck received a letter from Kerlikowske that he says is known, colloquially, as a 3R. It forced him to resign, retire or accept a reassignment. He had had an inkling that he was going to be removed from his post at Internal Affairs. His constant clashes with C.B.P. leadership had made him deeply unpopular, and the PERF report had leaked after he had provided a copy, against the wishes of C.B.P. leadership, to D.H.S.-O.I.G. (Congress had been requesting copies from C.B.P. since the previous fall but had been given only summaries.)

Within an hour of receiving his reassignment letter from the new C.B.P. commissioner, Tomsheck saw that a story about his removal had appeared on the website of The Los Angeles Times. In it, a single unnamed senior official at Homeland Security was quoted as saying Tomsheck had failed to aggressively pursue abuse and excessive-force complaints.

I didnt see that coming, Tomsheck told me. Over a year later, he said that the accusation continues to haunt me. He vigorously denied the claims, which were subsequently picked up by news outlets across the country, including The New York Times. I think a very strong case could be made that no one was more aggressive than I was when it came to use-of-force issues, Tomsheck said. They were looking for a scapegoat to address the fact that they were responsible for egregious misconduct. Tomshecks contention has been publicly supported by former colleagues: his assistant James Wong; Ronald Hosko, the former assistant director of the F.B.I.s criminal-investigation unit, with whom he worked closely; and the former C.B.P. commissioner Ralph Basham.

Tomsheck also found his reassignment suspicious. His new position, executive director of national programs for C.B.P., had not existed until days before his reassignment was announced, and he found it unusual that he was placed within C.B.P., the agency with which he had been in a state of constant conflict while running Internal Affairs. I came to believe the position was created to warehouse and silence me, Tomsheck says.

After learning of his reassignment, Tomsheck filed a federal whistle-blower complaint, claiming that it was retaliation for his outspokenness about C.B.P.s problems with excessive use of force and corruption. The complaint became part of mediated settlement negotiations between Tomsheck and C.B.P. (which remain confidential).

In September 2014, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson gave C.B.P. Internal Affairs new authority to investigate criminal misconduct by agents and tasked Tomshecks interim replacement, a former F.B.I. agent named Mark Morgan, with reviewing all 67 shootings that appeared in the PERF report. Last June, an independent report commissioned by Johnson described Internal Affairs as woefully understaffed and recommended the agency be given the lead on investigations rather than D.H.S.-O.I.G. That same month, Morgans findings were released: According to the internal review, only four of the 67 use-of-force incidents merited further investigation.

As the two-year anniversary of Jose Antonios death approached, the lawyers advised his family to move ahead with their only other recourse for justice: filing a lawsuit against the Border Patrol agent who shot him. The case had to be filed as a John Doe suit, because the agent was still anonymous; C.B.P. had not even indicated if the agent had been removed from his post or disciplined at all.

Parra and Montiel asked the A.C.L.U. for help with the lawsuit, eventually partnering with Gelernt, who has been a human-rights observer at Guantanamo Bay and has argued before the Supreme Court. The constitutional question Jose Antonios case is raising  about the extent to which the Constitution applies extraterritorially  is one that the A.C.L.U. institutionally has been working on in various contexts, Gelernt told me. At some level, its just common sense and basic fairness that the law has to allow his family to bring this lawsuit. It cant be that a U.S. agent is going to put his gun through the hole in the fence and shoot at Mexican kids, 20 feet away, and therell be no ramifications. In a town where people are just necessarily walking along the border, there has to be some reciprocity of the rule of law. There cant be just a situation where everybody who lives in a border town, in Canada or Mexico, runs the risk of being shot, without any ability to vindicate their rights.

Because of the failure of the previous lawsuit filed in Texas by the family of Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca (which is being appealed), Gelernt understood that the case would be difficult  but also that, if a judge in the federal Court of Appeals allowed the lawsuit to move forward, it could set up a Supreme Court case, because two circuit courts of equal stature would have ruled in opposition on the same constitutional question. Rodriguez v. John Does was filed on July 29, 2014. At the time of the shooting, the agents and/or officers were not under threat by [Jose Antonio] or anyone else standing near him, the complaint read. J.A.s death was senseless and unjustified.

That November, Jose Antonios family members scored their first legal victory in the lawsuit when Raner Collins, a federal district judge in Arizona, ordered that the name of the Border Patrol agent be unsealed and released to the public. The agents name was Lonnie Ray Swartz. No other information, not even a photograph, was released, and Swartz did not appear in court. Nor did Araceli or Diego Rodriguez, who were still not allowed to enter the United States.

Judge Collins rejected Swartzs immunity claim seven months later, a ruling that directly contradicted the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which had found, in the Hernandez case, that the boys family had no constitutional grounds for a lawsuit. Collins, in his decision, noted that Jose Antonio was not suspected of, charged with or convicted of violating any law; that he was visible and not hiding; that witnesses stated that he did not pose a threat, but was peacefully walking down the street; that he was not a citizen of a country with which the United States are at war; and that upon information and belief, Swartz did not issue any verbal warnings before opening fire. Swartz has appealed the ruling.

Just as the civil case appeared to be moving forward, there was another surprise, one that many of the interested parties had nearly stopped expecting: In September, it was announced that Swartz had been indicted by a federal grand jury in Tucson for second-degree murder. According to the indictment, Swartz did with malice aforethought, and while armed with a P2000 semiautomatic pistol, unlawfully kill Jose Antonio. On Oct. 9, 2015  the day before the third anniversary of the boys death  Swartz appeared in a Tucson courtroom for the first time, the first Border Patrol agent to be prosecuted by the Department of Justice for a cross-border shooting. The Arizona Republic described him as a tall man with crew-cut red hair and a light red mustache. A Border Patrol union representative revealed that Swartz had been transferred to Nevada and that, in the wake of the indictment, he had been put on administrative leave.

Why now? Tomsheck, for one, had seen the evidence gathered by the F.B.I.  the videos, the autopsy report, the interview transcripts  in the immediate months after the shooting, all of which had been handed over to the Department of Justice. I dont understand why it took three years to indict, Tomsheck says. Collinss ruling, its toughness, may have ultimately played a role. He made it very clear that the civil case needs to proceed, but he went beyond just saying that, using very strong language to indicate this is clearly excessive use of force, Tomsheck said. At the end of the day, it might have created a scenario where, if they didnt criminally charge Swartz, there would have been a lot of explaining to do on the part of the Department of Justice.

The Border Patrol union released a statement saying it supported Swartz 100 percent. Swartz has pleaded not guilty. Collins has placed a protective order on the trial evidence, meaning that for now, the thousands of pages of documents and videos of Jose Antonios shooting submitted by the United States attorneys office will not be made public.

Jose Antonios family was elated by the indictment. Diego called the claims of rock throwing a bunch of lies. Elena said, Thats always an excuse that they use. He wasnt a hoodlum.

Elena would cross into Mexico regularly to visit her grandsons. The night before Jose Antonio died, he walked her back to the border checkpoint. He was a good kid, she said. He was focused. He had goals. She had already bought him the oversize watch he wanted for Christmas, even though it was only October. She ended up placing it inside his coffin.

Araceli and her children were given permission to attend the indictment, and they entered the United States for the first time. In court, seeing Swartz, Araceli said she was struck by his size. He was a massive, large man, she said. She couldnt understand how a man that size could have felt endangered by her son. She didnt look him directly in the face, and he never looked in the familys direction. She doesnt want to see any of the video or photographic evidence of her sons death. I want to remember my son as he was when he was alive, she said. She plans to attend all the future hearings, anything that requires the presence of that man in court. The next hearing is scheduled for this month.

Wiping away tears, Araceli had told me when I visited her at her home: There are times when were bad and we start thinking about Jose Antonio, and we kind of make believe that hes still around. Because its unreal that hes not.

It must be difficult to be asked to conjure a portrait of a lost child, to fix in time a person on the verge of growing up; inevitably, such efforts will feel woefully incomplete. According to his family, Jose Antonio was reserved. He preferred cloudy days. Diego used to tease him for crying during The Lion King. Jose Antonio knew his brother could be squeamish and a bit of a hypochondriac, and once tricked him into climbing out of a swimming hole by saying, It looks like your eyes are about to pop out! How long have you been in there? He had a girlfriend. He chided his brother for having his arm tattooed and refused to get any ink himself, out of fear it might hurt his chances to join the military when he turned 18, a plan he had made with a group of friends. For the same reason, he was determined to finish high school. He had been forced to temporarily drop out because his family couldnt afford to pay tuition. The Monday after his death, he was scheduled to return to class.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,2 Baltimore School Officers Arrested in Assault on Teenager,['The Associated Press'],"Two police officers for the Baltimore schools have been arrested after the release of a cellphone video showing one of them slapping and kicking a teenager while the second officer stood by.

One officer, Anthony Spence, 44, was charged with second-degree assault, second-degree child abuse by a custodian and misconduct in office in the episode, which occurred March 1, according to a statement by the Baltimore police. Officer Spence posted bond and was released Wednesday.

The second officer, Saverna Bias, was charged with second-degree assault and misconduct in office. She also posted bond and was released, according to court records.

In the video, an officer, who was later identified as Officer Spence, can be seen slapping and kicking the teenager.

Officer Spence acknowledged in a conversation with The Associated Press on Friday that he was the subject of a criminal investigation into the actions captured on cellphone video last week at the Reach! Partnership School.

Right now Im the bad guy, he said. He referred questions to his lawyer, Michael Davey, who did not immediately respond to a phone call Wednesday morning.

The school district has its own police force separate from city police. The Baltimore City Police began a criminal investigation into the incident at the school after the eight-second clip surfaced.

School officials initially said that the officers had responded to a reported intruder, and that the young man in the video was not a student. On Friday, the school system said in a statement that he was believed to be a student on the schools roster. The young mans lawyer, Lauren Geisser, says he is a 10th-grader.

On Monday, the chief executive of Baltimore City Schools, Gregory Thornton, met with parents to discuss the video and said he would review training and selection of school police officers.",[]

PALATINE, Ill.  Gov. John Kasich of Ohio suggested on Wednesday that the Republican contest was now a three-man race among Donald J. Trump, Ted Cruz and himself, casting aside Marco Rubio as he talked about his competition.

Mr. Kasich, at a town-hall-style meeting in Lisle, Ill., told the crowd that about half the delegates were still up for grabs, and that he, Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz were dead even going into the last half of this whole match.

So dont be thinking its over yet, Mr. Kasich said.

Mr. Kasich, unlike Mr. Rubio, has yet to win a nominating contest. Later, speaking to reporters after a town-hall-style meeting here in Palatine, Mr. Kasich insisted he would win his home state on Tuesday. Illinois also votes that day, and Mr. Kasich spent Wednesday campaigning in the Chicago area.

Everybody is saying now, except for a handful of people, that John Kasich is surging, Mr. Kasich said, without specifying who holds that view. And Im beginning to surge because for the first time in this campaign, people are finally beginning to hear my message.

The Kasich campaign has embraced an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday that found Mr. Trump, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Kasich and Mr. Rubio bunched up among likely voters in states that have not yet held their nominating contests.

I dont mean to say anything to disparage Marco, Mr. Kasich told reporters. But what I will say is, its starting to turn our way.

He also made clear that he was not suggesting that Mr. Rubio leave the race.

I would never do what other people say  somebody ought to drop out or not drop out, he said. Im just talking to you about what the numbers look like today, because anybody whos in this race should decide on their own what they want to do.

As for Mr. Kasichs path forward, his analysis was strikingly rosy, given his performances to date.

His best showing on Tuesday was in Michigan, where he had spent considerable time. But he still failed to win second place, finishing slightly behind Mr. Cruz and well behind the states winner, Mr. Trump. Mr. Kasich ended up claiming about 24 percent of the vote, and he won 43 percent of those who decided which candidate to vote for in the last week, according to exit polls.

Mr. Kasich portrayed his finish in Michigan as an impressive achievement, citing earlier poll numbers that had put his support in the single digits. He said he went from obliterated, where everybody counted me out, to effectively tying Mr. Cruz.

They call it the Kasich surge, and I would agree with that, he said. If the primary had been a day later, he said, God knows what would have happened.",[]

Gallery,['Su Wu'],"When Hauser Wirth & Schimmel acquired its new space, a former flour mill in L.A.s Arts District, it was already remarkably painted  with graffiti. There are a lot of places that people would consider dodgy, but where people have created work that requires craft and commitment, even though they know theyre going to put it up and itll be gone, says Steve Grody, the street art historian who worked with Hauser Wirth & Schimmel to identify the works. But the murals painted on the buildings walls arent going anywhere  in fact, the gallery commissioned the artist Kim West to expand upon her dreamlike mural on the old warehouses exterior.

The factory complex on a two-and-a-half acre city block was once known to tagging crews as a place to piece in peace. Thanks to a relative lack of patrol, it has been covered with unsanctioned murals over the years  with layers upon layers of activity that sometimes spiraled into little battles in which they disrespected each others work, says the gallerys senior director Stacen Berg. One such wall will eventually overlook an edible garden that will supply an on-site restaurant opening in the summer. We want it to be recognizable as our building. But then it was also: What is a complete work, that is still intact enough that it seems worth hanging on to? Berg says, referencing also architectural details dating from the 1890s to the 1990s, when the abandoned factory was a hot spot for graffiti. Were trying to keep the history of the building alive, without being overly nostalgic.

Whitewashed walls may be a renovation trope, but just as the last Hauser & Wirth outpost in Somerset basked in the rolling farmland, the preserved tags here provide a visual trace of the always grittier past. Brass knuckles and marijuana frame the downtown skyline and classic gangland block lettering on a wall covered by the crew Out for Action, a.k.a. One Fallen Angel. (Not every piece could be saved: A code-violating fence tagged by the artist Mister Cartoon, whose smaller lines are tattooed on such hip-hop luminaries as Dr. Dre and Beyonce, was removed per the city.) A new piece in full-wall scale, across from the sculpture atrium, is the gallery artist Mary Heilmanns largest work ever executed, of an abstract crashing wave. You can walk in this neighborhood, which you cant in a lot of other parts of L.A., and we wanted to integrate that and open it up, so people can cut through, Berg says, standing in view of several murals, in a public walkway that traverses the length of the space. Maybe they never go into the galleries, but they still interact with something, even if theyre just on their way to get coffee.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,What It Takes for This Actor to Wear That Red Speedo,['Kate Taylor'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Alex Breaux faced a twofold challenge in portraying Ray, a champion swimmer in the dark and twisty Red Speedo at New York Theater Workshop. He had to look convincing as an aspiring Olympian who spends the whole show in the swimsuit of the title. And he needed to, well, play dumb  at least outside the water, where his character is caught up in a doping scandal that could derail a lucrative future.









He applied his background as an athlete to both.

Six-foot-three and slim, Mr. Breaux, a 30-year-old former Harvard University wide receiver, was in good shape when he was cast in Lucas Hnaths play last fall  he has taught spinning seven mornings a week since he was in graduate school at Juilliard  but he said he didnt want audience members to have to suspend any disbelief.

So he undertook a grueling exercise and diet regimen that has dramatically reduced his body fat while giving him an extremely defined chest, back and washboard abs. He acknowledged losing more weight than he intended  he wouldnt say what he weighs now  but said he feels satisfied with the look he has achieved for the role.

Photo

As for why Ray seems dense, Mr. Breaux noted that athletes who have to do a very repetitive movement over long periods  running or rowing or swimming  need to be able to get into a Zen-like state.

To rip Ray out of the flow zone, out of that spaciness, and then start peppering him with questions, as his brother does, youve just changed the rules of engagement for him, and of course hes going to come across as inarticulate, Mr. Breaux said.

Critics have praised the play and his performance, with Charles Isherwood of The New York Times writing: It takes a very smart actor to play dumb as well as he does.

Indeed Mr. Breaux  yes, its pronounced BRO  doesnt agree that Ray, who spends large chunks of the play staring at the middle distance, absent-mindedly munching carrots, is unintelligent. Hes very articulate under water, physically  hes a genius, he said.

Mr. Breaux himself was animated and energetic during an interview last week, which seemed incredible after he admitted that during previews he was getting only three to five hours of sleep a night.

He is remarkably earnest. To not succumb to the constant rejection an actor experiences, he posts motivational quotes around his room, like Love your guts and Want is more popular than work.

He was born in Richmond, Va., but grew up mostly in Oakland, Calif. He described his family as sports-oriented and not artistic at all. He played football in high school and was the homecoming king. His coach and English teacher, Jamie Donohoe, with whom he is still close, said he had imagined that Mr. Breaux might ultimately have some kind of job on the business side of sports, doing that hustle, where he could use that creative mind of his, but also that charm and that work ethic.

His freshman year at Harvard, he got a lot of playing time at wide receiver. In a dazzling moment, he scored a touchdown that tied The Game with Yale late in the fourth quarter. Harvard won in three overtimes, and his picture appeared in Sports Illustrated.

As a sophomore, Mr. Breaux was majoring in economics, with plans to work after graduation at an investment bank when, on a whim, he went to see a play at the American Repertory Theater. He had never really been interested in theater, he said, which at the time he associated mostly with big Disney musicals.

But this sounded different. It was bobrauschenbergamerica, by Charles Mee and the SITI Company, an absurdist collage of vignettes. A marching band came onstage at one point, he recalled. A pizza delivery man confessed to a triple homicide.

In a talk after the performance, he asked an actress who had recited a monologue while consuming an entire birthday cake if she ever worried she would choke.

Photo

She was like, I pretty much choke on the cake every night, he recalled. And I loved that.

Mr. Breaux cherished football, he said, in part because the experience of catching a pass was like knowing youre about to get in a car crash, but you dont know from which direction or how heavy the impact. It felt to him like the cast of bobrauschenbergamerica was doing something similarly dangerous and daring.

He began auditioning for student productions, but didnt get any roles until his junior year, when he was cast as Father Flynn, the priest who may or may not have molested a boy in Doubt. His senior year he played Joe Pitt, the closeted Mormon lawyer, in both parts of Angels in America.

He still played football, so he would go to practice, then run  without showering  to rehearsal. Halfway through the year, he decided he would be unfulfilled working in finance and turned down a job he had accepted at Barclays. He auditioned for Juilliard and was accepted.

Ellen Lauren, the actress who had talked about choking on the cake, became one of his teachers.

Shortly before he graduated, he was cast in the Broadway revival of Tom Stoppards The Real Thing, directed by Sam Gold, in which he played the boorish young Scottish soldier, Brodie.

I made sure I was incredibly rude, cocky and generally misbehaved while in the room, Mr. Breaux said of his auditions for the role.

Mr. Hnath and Lileana Blain-Cruz, the director of Red Speedo, both said they were impressed by how much work Mr. Breaux had done before his audition, especially concerning the playwrights language and punctuation, which is very specific. (The scripts opening pages define the differences among ellipses, a line break and a dash in terms of how they should affect an actors delivery.)

Then there was his experience on the field.

At one of the callbacks, I just remember he spoke really eloquently about being an athlete, Ms. Blain-Cruz explained. He just spoke about the kind of high that you get when youre constantly working your body and it puts you in a certain state, and I thought that was really helpful in thinking about Ray.

In the last year, Mr. Breaux has shot two independent films that have not yet been released: Bushwick, an action movie set in the near future, about a second American civil war, in which he gets beaten up by Dave Bautista, the professional wrestler turned actor; and Katie Says Goodbye, in which he plays a long-distance trucker with a debilitating stutter, who asks out the title character. Its a rare, sympathetic, nonbloody role for Alex Breaux, Mr. Breaux said.

He is auditioning for other film and TV jobs and also revising a pilot about college football. He wrote, directed and acted in a short film, Hotline, about a combat medic home from Afghanistan who is contemplating suicide. He has also written a screenplay based on Pat Conroys memoir, My Losing Season, about his senior basketball season at the Citadel during the Vietnam War.

Mr. Breaux doesnt know what his next job will be after Red Speedo, which is scheduled to run through April 3. But he has envisioned the blowout meal hell eat, at his favorite restaurant, the Cheesecake Factory, when hes done. There his favorite dessert, the 1,400-calorie Lindas Fudge Cake, awaits.",[]

Well Family Welcome to Well Family, Wells new home for news about parenting, child health and relationships plus advice from our experts to help every family live well. Sign up for our Well Family newsletter.

When I look out into my classroom, and take the emotional temperature of my students, Im usually checking for engagement. I want to make sure they feel supported, are interested in the lesson at hand, and that the lesson is relevant to each student.

But happiness? I stopped looking for happiness long ago. I see it periodically, when the conditions are perfect, and the stars align just so. When happiness strikes in my classroom, I relish it as I would any other rare anomaly, like thundersnow or a two-faced calf. Regular sightings, however, seem too much to hope for given the inhospitable climate in many American classrooms.

Emma Seppala, however, the author of The Happiness Track, and science director of Stanford Universitys Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education, has not lost hope. Dr. Seppala admits that yes, happiness can be a rare beast in our classrooms, but we can create and protect learning conditions in which happiness can flourish.

Happiness, Dr. Seppala explained in an email, is not something we can afford to lose at home or in our classrooms, as it forms the very foundation of deep, meaningful learning. Happy kids show up at school more able to learn because they tend to sleep better and may have healthier immune systems. Happy kids learn faster and think more creatively. Happy kids tend to be more resilient in the face of failures. Happy kids have stronger relationships and make new friends more easily.

Unfortunately, we put our childrens happiness at risk when we model what Dr. Seppala calls the myths of success: the belief that success is inextricably tied to stress and anxiety, perseverance at all costs, avoidance of personal weakness, and a myopic focus on cultivating expertise in a specialized niche.

We may tell kids that we want them to be happy, and that we care about their learning more than we care about their grades, but when we model the myths of success in our own lives, they know the truth. Perpetuating these myths, whether through our words or actions, undermines the very happiness and learning we claim to value.

If we truly want to cultivate happiness in our homes and schools, we cant just pay it lip service. We must model behaviors that, according to Dr. Seppala, make us happier, healthier and more productive.

Live in the moment. Rather than encouraging children to live from one to-do item to the next, help them focus and enjoy whatever activity they are engaged in now. Research shows our minds wander off task 50 percent of the time. Yet when our mind wanders, we have more negative emotions. While a little bit of stress about the next to-do can serve as a motivator, long-term chronic stress impairs both physical health and intellectual faculties such as attention and memory, Dr. Seppala said in an email.

Model resilience. While we cant often change the work and life demands our children face in their lives, we can help them train their nervous systems to be resilient, and to thrive in the face of difficulties and challenges, Dr. Seppala said. Talk about how you have overcome challenges, model healthy resilience, and help kids find respite from the pressures of achievement. Techniques such as meditation, yoga and breathing exercises help your children rest their minds and bodies, and allow them to recover from the physical and emotional damage stress can impart.

Manage your energy. While negative emotions can be damaging to kids mental and physical health, our societys penchant for constant, high-intensity positive emotions takes a toll as well. Western societies value excitement and other high-intensity positive emotions over low-intensity positive emotions such as calm. While theres nothing wrong with excitement and fun, children need to know how to balance excitement with the ability to calm down and function from a centered, peaceful place, saving precious mental energy for tasks that need it most, Dr. Seppala said.

Do nothing. Taking time off to disconnect and relax focus helps promote kids creativity and insights, Dr. Seppala wrote. Children need time for idleness, fun and irrelevant interests, and as research shows C.E.O.s currently value creativity higher than any other trait in the incoming workforce, it behooves you to let your kids relax and access their inner inventor.

Be kind to yourself. While its good to strive for improvement, excessive self-criticism can backfire, and become self-sabotage. Self-criticism maintains focus on the negative, leaving kids anxious, afraid of failure and less likely to learn from mistakes. Self-compassion, however, improves childrens ability to excel in the face of challenges, to develop new skills and to learn from their mistakes.

Be kind to others. Research shows that people who are supportive and compassionate toward others are more successful. Fortunately, Dr. Seppala said, Children are naturally compassionate and kind; we simply need to protect these traits.

Children should not be surprised by joy. If they are, the responsibility for its absence lies at the feet of parents, teachers and administrators who have pushed happiness out of its native habitat to make room for the toxic, invasive species of anxiety, stress and fear.

nytimes.com,2014-09-22 00:00:00,Gary Hewitt's Numberplay Comment Enhancer,['Gary Antonick'],"The New York Times Numberplay blog, like many blogs featured in The Times online, offers a terrific way to connect with a community of passionate and articulate readers from around the world. Numberplay conversations are a lot like those youd find gathered around any blog, with a couple additional features: The conversations are about math, which means formulas may be sprinkled into the mix, and theyre also highly collaborative.

Fortunately, Numberplay reader Gary Hewitt has developed a tool  the Numberplay Comment Enhancer  to support these distinct requirements. If you already use the tool, you probably find it indispensable. If you dont yet use it (or havent tried all of its cool features), heres a short introduction.

Before activating the Enhancer, a blog post and its related comments will look a bit like this:

Photo

The Enhancer turns the post and comments into this:

Photo

Added features are:

1. A text search box

2. A graphical summary of the ongoing conversation

3. Numbered comments, rendered TeX and displayed images

To activate the Enhancer, load a Numberplay posts comments and then click the word Enhancer found near the end of the post.

To generate the graphical summary, just hit the green Graph Navigation box next to the search box. This graphical view shows a dot for every comment left during the week (larger dots mean longer comments), connections between comments (created when a comment refers to a previous comment by number), and recommended comments (circled by dark rings).

TeX is the ubiquitous way to create math symbols and formulas on the web, and a major reason for using the Enhancer is to convert expressions like $a,b,c,...$ into a, b, c, ... Although its not necessary to use TeX when entering comments in Numberplay, the basics are easy to learn and there are plenty of resources online.

That concludes this short introduction. Enjoy the Enhancer! If you have any questions or suggestions let me know. Just send an email to gary.antonick@NYTimes.com.",[]

TUESDAY PUZZLE  This was a straightforward circled-answer puzzle with a good number of long clues for early in the week  potentially slow going for a new solver, but the corners used crossword standards like ASSUAGE, THANE and UPROOT that you will encounter again. Odd little semi-words like AHH, URL and SLR contributed to the challenge here.

For some reason, I knew OTTO PREMINGER had directed Anatomy of a Murder. Right away and right across the middle, then, my answers spread quickly in all directions. I cant for the life of me remember seeing the movie itself, but, like most of us, I did go through a Jimmy Stewart phase so it could have happened. I registered otter at that point, but the nature of the beast didnt become clear until I got MINUTE STEAK. SETTHETABLE and FUSEBOX came fairly easily after that.

The spelling and definition of MESHUGA sent me to the archives and the Internet, because I had heard and spoken so many variations and it looked funny on paper, but that is The New York Times-ordained spelling, so that was something I learned today, my bubelehs.

David Steinberg corroborates my findings, and, as it turns out, I did get lucky with that Jimmy Stewart thing:

Constructors Notes:

I constructed this puzzle just over a year ago. At the time, I was making almost all themelesses, so I decided to construct a themed puzzle for the sake of variety. Im not sure where the inspiration for this puzzle came from, but I was fortunate to find just enough types of fur to scrape together a theme set. Interestingly, both OTTO PREMINGER and OTTO KLEMPERER wouldve worked for the center theme entry  I chose OTTO PREMINGER because I felt he would be more familiar to early-week solvers. I settled on this grid pattern because I wanted to give solvers something a little different from the several theme entries with a pair of long downs structure used in most themed 1515 crosswords these days. I personally use the traditional layout the majority of the time, but when I end up with a theme set that I could go a different direction with, I like to switch things up. The 74-word grid with all the 7s was definitely a challenge, but I was pleased to work in MESHUGA, JUNIPER and BLASTER. Keeping the less savory bits to a minimum was significantly harder, but Im pleased with how the fill turned out over all (with the exception of NATALE, which the Tuesday solver in me is grumbling about!). I hope you enjoy my puzzle. One of the R.A.s in my dorm just started solving The New York Times crossword  as of right now, he only attempts Mondays, so Im hoping this puzzle will persuade him to graduate to Tuesday!

It is Science Times Tuesday, and I was reminded by this puzzle of the Russian Fox experiment, a decades-long project that dissipated along with the Soviet Union, but still pops up on nature shows and in genetics classes. An attempt was made to breed foxes that were less aggressive and less inclined to bite their captors on a fur farm; the result was a complete and rapid domestication, and the new, sweeter foxes proved more lucrative as exotic pets for the ultrarich than fabric for same.

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"Introducing Matthew Zapruder, the Magazines New Poetry Editor",['Matthew Zapruder'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Matthew Zapruder is the new poetry editor for the magazine, succeeding Natasha Trethewey in this annually rotating position. His first selection, You Throw a Stone by Juan Felipe Herrera, appeared in the March 6 issue.

As I started to choose the poems that will appear each week in The New York Times Magazine over the next year, I imagined who might be reading them. I thought about how life is already so complicated and busy, and how, on Sunday mornings, people might want to just sit and drink coffee and quietly move through the paper. I thought that people might turn the page and see a poem and say: Oh, no. Something else I have to do. Except for the crossword, I thought I was safe.

For most of my life as a poet, I have been thinking about this very moment, when a poem enters into someones life. Most of the time, this happens in expected situations: a classroom, a wedding, a funeral. Maybe we have even chosen to pick up a book of them. But I believe that poems are meant to be a part of our lives. They are made up of our language, reconfigured and rearranged to make our minds move in different directions than they ordinarily would. At their best, they make something close to a waking dream.

Its great to have the chance to put poems in front of people in the midst of what they are otherwise doing. I like the idea that someone would turn the page of the magazine and see a poem, and that those words in the poem would have a chance to follow up on, refract, amplify, reconfigure the language of culture and news. The poem gets a chance to exist in a place that is not isolated or rarefied. It gets to be a part of life, and we get to read it that way too.

Poetry is in fine shape now, as it has always been, even though there is a small industry of people periodically informing us its dead. Nevertheless, people go on writing it in all sorts of different ways. Why? I guess we need it. Virginia Woolf wrote, The poet is always our contemporary. I believe she meant that poets, for all time and in all lands, have always found the places in language that continue to be common to human experience. Poems are, in and of themselves, an assertion of both a particular imagination and a common humanity, the possibility that my dreams can be yours, and vice versa. Thats why very old poems can still feel completely present and meaningful to us and why the great new poems can feel very ancient.

My exciting and somewhat daunting task is to pick, each week, a poem and write a very short introduction, which somehow manages to open up the poem without interfering with it. When I think of these introductions, I imagine them as little keys that will open the lock of the poem. And each time, just like in those old stories we heard as children, once the lock opens, the lock and key will disappear, and it will be clear that nothing was ever locked at all.",[]

Which ones?

A

By your early 20s, theres a good chance you are due for some boosters, said Dr. Wanda Filer, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. You may also need to play catch-up if youve missed any vaccines or failed to complete a series, she said.

Everyone needs a tetanus and diphtheria booster every 10 years; the shots are often combined. So if you were 12 the last time you had a tetanus shot, youre due for one at 22.

Adults ages 19 to 64 should also get a pertussis, or whooping cough, booster. Pregnant women should be vaccinated against pertussis toward the end of each pregnancy in order to protect their newborns from this disease, which can be devastating for a baby.

If you are not pregnant but may become pregnant, its a good idea to plan ahead and be tested for immunity to two other childhood diseases: rubella and chickenpox. If you do not have evidence of immunity -- and are not pregnant -- you should be vaccinated.

If you were not vaccinated against the human papilloma virus, or HPV, or did not complete the recommended series of three doses, women can complete the series through age 26, and men through age 21, with more leeway for men who have sex with men and those with compromised immune systems, who who may be vaccinated through age 26. The HPV series protects against viruses that cause cervical cancer, head and neck cancers and anal cancer.

Beyond childhood immunizations, flu shots are recommended every year for just about everybody, Dr. Filer said. The shingles vaccine is also recommended for older adults.

You may also want to check whether youve been vaccinated against meningitis, said Dr. Carolyn Bridges, associate director for adult immunizations at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Its a good idea to obtain a record of your vaccinations, she said, and to encourage your physician to input your record into a state vaccine registry.

The above recommendations are for the general population. Additional vaccines may be advised for anyone with a chronic health condition such as a compromised immune system, asthma or diabetes; those who work in the health care field; men who have sex with men; people who travel to certain parts of the world; and adults 60 or older. Talk with your doctor.

You can find out if youre due for shots by taking the C.D.C.s online vaccination quiz, Dr. Bridges suggested. Vaccine recommendations are confusing.""",[]

FRIDAY PUZZLE  When you dont have a theme to cling to and the clues are ramped up to weekend-level, it can be difficult to conquer a crossword puzzle. If you are just dipping a toe into the late week, themeless puzzles, there are only two things you will need to be successful, and they are 1) patience and 2) more patience.

There are two ways to approach a late-week puzzle. You can scan the clues looking for something, anything that you definitely know, or you can take an educated guess. I highly recommend starting out with the former approach. Nothing boosts your solving self-esteem like filling in that first entry in a blank grid. This first entry will vary, depending on your personal wheelhouse. In my case, I started with 57 Downs Janies got A GUN' and Almond ROCA at 60 Down (I know. Aerosmith and candy. Sorry, Mom.) If those are not your speed, how about Al JOLSON at 9 Down, who sang the timeless Toot Toot Tootsie (Goobye)? Or perhaps you are a bit of a dandy, and you are all about the PERIWIGS. I can remember reading The Bobbsey Twins as a child, so NAN went in right away.

No matter what you know, fill it in and pat yourself on the back for embarking on a late-week solve. From there, branch out and try to connect as many of the entries as you can. The patience comes in when you feel stuck. Put the puzzle down and go do something else. Your brain will continue to process what youve seen in the clues and when you come back to it, youll be surprised at how much more you suddenly know.

The second approach, which can also work, is to take an educated guess at entries that might not be what they seem. At 61 Across, the clue One who can see right through you? is obviously misdirection, what with the question mark at the end. So it probably doesnt mean someone who can see that youre not being honest, which is one possible definition of ... see right through you. Who else can see right through you? My first guess was SUPERMAN, but that doesnt fit. The only other person that could possibly see through you is a RADIOLOGIST.

Having fun yet? You should be. Remember, this is a game. Its a pastime, and its supposed to be fun. Getting angry because you dont know or like a certain word or you think that crosswords should be a strict test of intelligence is pointless and bad for your health. So, if youre having trouble with the puzzle, put it down and come back to it when you can solve it in the fun spirit in which it is meant to be solved.

Evans Clinchy offers us this Friday puzzle and has quite a bit to say about it, so Ill stop lecturing and let him take the mic:

Constructors Notes

So this is my second crossword published in The Times, and if you compare this puzzle with my previous one, youll notice a host of similarities. Both are themeless, both feature stacks of 11-letter entries across the top and bottom three rows, and both are built around the seed entry of a famous N.B.A. player. Last time, back in 2014, it was KEVIN DURANT; this time, I give you Kareem ABDUL-JABBAR. I swear, I have other ambitions in life beyond cramming as many basketball players as possible into Times puzzles. Eventually Ill have no names left to play with besides FESTUS EZELI or someone equally obscure. I should quit now while Im ahead. Anyway. This puzzle was a joy to construct  I remember it began with the realization that the fun CARTOONLIKE fit perfectly beneath ABDUL-JABBAR, and it all flowed from there. I liked getting to sneak in PERIWIGS (which Ive always thought is a cool word, no?) and ONE-TWO PUNCH. Including the name LOUIS C.K. in a puzzle was always something of a bucket-list goal, as the comedian has always been a favorite of mine. Funny, though  I thought I was so original for including Louie at the time I wrote this puzzle, as hed never been featured before. Then his name showed up three times shortly thereafter  in November 2014, January 2015 and March 2015. Great minds think alike, or something? At least I had the neat twist of crossing the comics name with TITLE ROLE, since he has one on his FX show. Its the little victories. As for the clues, Im happy with a few that I wrote (especially the pyramid scheme wordplay for CHEERLEADER), but Im equally grateful for Will sprucing up some of my duller clues with some flavorful ideas of his own. One who can see right through you? for RADIOLOGIST is great. Wish Id thought of that. Also, a picture in one of the clues! [The picture is in the print version only. D.A.] Thats crazy  didnt even know it was a thing. I understand its very, very rare, so Im honored that Will chose my puzzle to decorate. Thanks for reading (and solving), everyone. Ill be back with a Sunday puzzle next time, obviously, because how else am I gonna fit GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO into a grid?

And now for something completely different: a PERIWIGged game of charades:

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"George Martin and the Beatles: A Producers Impact, in Five Songs",['Allan Kozinn'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

When we hear a great recording, we tend to think of the music as having sprung fully developed from the imagination of the musician or band that cut the tracks. But that ignores the role of the producer, who translates the musicians vision into the sound we experience.









The contributions that George Martin, who died Tuesday at 90, made to the Beatles recorded catalog were crucial, and although he was the first to say that most of the credit belongs to the band, many of the groups greatest songs owe their sound and character to his inspired behind-the-scenes work. Here are a few of his most telling musical fingerprints:

From Me to You

When the Beatles turned up at EMIs studios on Abbey Road to record their third single, on March 5, 1963, they brought From Me to You, a short song that John Lennon and Paul McCartney had started writing less than a week earlier. Mr. Martin pondered the possibilities through the first four takes, and then proposed a solution for the songs two biggest problems, its brevity and lack of variety. After two verses, a bridge and a repeat of the first verse, the Beatles would play the verse yet again, this time with the first two lines as a short instrumental break, punctuated with the phrases from me (after the first line) and to you (after the second), before singing the final two lines. To fill out the break, Mr. Martin had Lennon play the songs melody on the harmonica, shadowed by Mr. McCartney on the bass.

For the introduction, Mr. Martin experimented with a string of overdubs. In one, Lennon played the tune on the harmonica. In another, the group hummed it. They also sang it, twice using the syllables da-da-da, da-da, dun dun da, and once with a falsetto floating across the top. In the end, Mr. Martin chose a combination of the harmonica and the sung line (sans falsetto), which establishes the songs bright character immediately.

Yesterday

Mr. McCartney first played Mr. Martin his classic torch song during the groups Paris residency in January 1964, so the producer had plenty of time to mull how to handle it. The group may have considered it, at first, as simply a ballad that would get the full-band treatment. But when Mr. McCartney decided to record it, during the Help! sessions in 1965, Mr. Martin proposed that Mr. McCartney accompany himself on an acoustic guitar, with a string quartet taking the place of the other Beatles.

Mr. McCartney had his doubts: In his view, string arrangements on rock records were suspect. But Mr. Martin played him some recordings and sat him down at the piano to show him what could be done. In the end, Mr. McCartney was convinced, and Mr. Martin  typically open to the groups ideas  worked out his quartet arrangement with Mr. McCartney present. Mr. Martin has said, in fact, that one of the arrangements highlights  the descending cello line, after the lyric Im not half the man I used to be  was Mr. McCartneys idea.

In My Life

Mr. Martin began adding keyboard parts to the Beatles recordings virtually from the start, a notable early example being the ringing celesta line on Baby Its You. But the finest such contribution was his solo on In My Life, an autobiographical meditation by Lennon, on Rubber Soul. When the Beatles recorded the song, on Oct. 18, 1965, they left an instrumental verse open, to be filled with a solo, the nature of which was yet to be agreed upon. By Oct. 22, the group agreed to turn the solo over to Mr. Martin, who decided to give it a Bachian twist, writing a part that had the character and ornamentation of a Two-Part Invention.

On his first pass, he used a Hammond organ but didnt care for the result. A piano worked better, but Mr. Martin, a functional but not virtuosic pianist, was unable to fully channel his inner Glenn Gould. So he played the master tape at half-speed, recording his part slowly and precisely. When the tape was played at full speed, the piano line was not only suitably crisp, but the speed change gave the instrument an unusual character  somewhere between that of a piano and a harpsichord, but not quite either.

Strawberry Fields Forever

Strawberry Fields Forever, the first song recorded for the sessions that produced the Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band album, had as difficult a birth as any song the Beatles and Mr. Martin created. Lennon wrote this psychedelic dreamscape while filming How I Won the War in Almeria, Spain, and recorded demos of all kinds  on acoustic guitar, electric guitar, with and without keyboard overdubs  before taking it to Abbey Road on Nov. 24, 1966. That night, the Beatles recorded a simple, short version with harmony vocals and a Mellotron approximation of a slide guitar, but they junked it two days later and started again, recording a tougher, tighter version with Mr. McCartney playing a fluty Mellotron introduction.

Lennon didnt like that one either, and asked Mr. Martin to write an orchestral score. Mr. Martin responded with a hard-driven chamber score for brass and cellos. He sped the piece up, and moved the song to a higher key so that he could use the vibrant sound of the cellos lowest open string. On Dec. 8, the band and its symphonic friends recorded this third version, which also boasted a raucous timpani part, played by Mr. McCartney, and an Indian zither, played by George Harrison.

Lennon liked it, briefly, and then he didnt. He told Mr. Martin that he enjoyed both the bands version and the chamber version, and envisioned a combination. Mr. Martin protested that the two were in different keys and at different tempos, but Lennon knew the extent of his producers magic, and said, You can do it, George. As it turned out, the key and tempo changes worked to Mr. Martins advantage: by slowing down the orchestral version and speeding up the band take, he found common ground without making either sound too unnatural. If you listen closely, you can spot his splice exactly one minute into the song.

A Day in the Life

The song that closes Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, and is, for many listeners, the most astonishing track on an astonishing album, actually began as a pair of unrelated songs: The melancholy outer verses were Lennons, the brighter central section was Mr. McCartneys. What transformed these fragments into a cohesive whole is a touch of avant-garde string scoring by Mr. Martin. By the time the Beatles set to work on the track, on Jan. 19, 1967, they and Mr. Martin had mapped out its structure. Two of Lennons verses would open the song, followed by Mr. McCartneys verse, which would lead back to final thoughts from Lennon. Between the two composers sections, though, the band would vamp for 24 bars, and there would be another long vamp after the closing verse. How these would be filled  well, Mr. Martin would figure that out later.

For several weeks, the group tweaked the main parts of the song, polishing the vocals, drums and bass, adding extra percussion parts, and trying to imagine what should occupy those long vamped sections. Mr. McCartney thought an orchestral section would be good, but left the question of what that should entail to his producer. Mr. Martins solution was to take a page out of the playbooks of classical composers like John Cage and Krzysztof Penderecki, who at the time were creating works in which chance played a role. Mr. Martin hired 40 symphonic musicians for a session on Feb. 10, and when they turned up, they found on their stands a 24-bar score that had the lowest notes on their instruments in the first bar, and an E major chord in the last. Between them, the musicians were instructed to slide slowly from their lowest to highest notes, taking care not to move at the same pace as the musicians around them.

The sound was magnificently chaotic, and it became more so once Mr. Martin combined the four takes he recorded (some with Mr. McCartney on the podium, some conducted by Mr. Martin himself). It was a brilliant solution: as Lennons voice faded into the echoic distance, the orchestra began its buildup, ending sharply on the chord that begins Mr. McCartneys section.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Missouri Senate Approves Bill Protecting Foes of Gay Marriage,"['Austin Huguelet', 'Richard P Rez-pe A']","Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.  A bill to give some of the nations broadest legal protections to opponents of same-sex marriage took a crucial step forward in Missouri on Wednesday, winning approval in the State Senate after Republicans used a rare procedural move to break a 39-hour filibuster by Democrats.









Since the Supreme Courts ruling in June legalizing gay marriage, legislators in many states have introduced bills that they say would protect religious freedom and opponents say permit discrimination. In some respects, the Missouri bill would go beyond any law now in place, prompting challenges that could keep the issue before the courts for years.

The bill, a proposed amendment to the state Constitution, would shield religious groups and businesses from having to facilitate same-sex weddings. Opponents contend that the bill is probably unconstitutional, and that the wording could lead to much broader consequences, like denying social services, education, employment or housing to married gay people.

Democrats began a filibuster on Monday, but with Republicans holding an overwhelming Senate majority, it was clear that opponents could only delay the bill. The Legislature allows lawmakers to cut off debate by submitting a letter signed by a simple majority of the members; the rule is often invoked in the House, but rarely in the Senate.

On Wednesday, entering the third day of debate, 21 Republicans signed such a letter. The vote was called, and the bill passed, 23 to 9. The Senate must pass the bill again before sending it to the House, which is also controlled by Republicans. If both chambers approve it, the measure will go on the ballot this year.

To stand up for people whove been discriminated against and disenfranchised, of course it was worth it, said Senator Maria Chapelle-Nadal, a Democrat. She predicted a very difficult session for Republicans, saying that Democrats would keep using stalling tactics.

Each side accused the other of being unwilling to compromise.

Senator Ron Richard, the Republican president pro tem, said the majority had no choice but to force a vote. We rarely use it, but we couldnt come to a negotiated settlement that was fair to the sponsor and to our caucus, he said, and we had to move on.

The long debate veered from same-sex marriage, to unrelated bills, to topics far removed from public policy, like which shoes were best for a filibuster. Sleep-deprived Democrats appeared in shifts, holding the floor while others took breaks to nap, shower or change clothes.

Twenty-one states have what backers call religious freedom laws, which do not mention same-sex couples but make it harder to win a lawsuit for discrimination based on religious belief.

The Missouri bill is one of a new batch of measures that explicitly address same-sex marriage and attempt to pre-empt such lawsuits entirely. None have become law so far. The Missouri bill says that clergy members and religious groups would not have to facilitate gay weddings and celebrations, a widely agreed-upon principle. But it also would give businesses like caterers and florists the right to refuse their services.

What troubles opponents most is a passage that does not mention weddings; in fact, it does not limit what actions it would apply to. The passage would shield religious groups from being penalized for acting in accordance with a sincere religious belief about same-sex marriage, and lists many things that could qualify as religious organizations, including schools, charities and retirement homes.

Critics say that could mean denying married gay people housing, employment, social services and schooling.

Missouri law does not bar discrimination against gay or transgender people, but a handful of local ordinances do; the proposed amendment would supersede elements of those.

Such laws in some states have been used as weapons against people of religious faith, said Senator Bob Onder, the Republican sponsor of the bill. My bill, on the other hand, is a shield, not a sword.

Sarah Warbelow, the legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, a prominent gay rights group, said, This reckless legislation has nothing to do with religious freedom and everything to do with enabling discrimination against L.G.B.T. Missourians and their families.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"At High Street on Hudson, Prime Time Starts Early in the West Village",['Pete Wells'],"High Street on Hudson is an adventurous and often exciting restaurant trying extremely hard to pass for an ordinary West Village cafe. Philly spinoff providing house-made breads & pastries, elevated sandwiches, coffee & cocktails, is Googles capsule summary. The description is factual to the last ampersand, yet it doesnt go past the camouflage this place wrapped around itself when it sidled into town in December.









What is missing, what you may miss at first if you came for breakfast or lunch, the only meals High Street on Hudson served in its first few weeks of life, is the high level of intelligence the kitchen applies to everything it does from morning through evening.

The chef, Eli Kulp, is unmistakably trying to make his mark in New York after making his name in Philadelphia. (He was traveling between the two cities last year when his Amtrak train derailed, leaving him with serious spinal injuries.) At dinner, the time when chefs make their big statements, the menu turned out to be full of small oddities and unexpected ripples of flavor when it was finally unveiled in January. Yet his restaurant doesnt just put on a show at night and wait for you to be impressed. Mr. Kulp and his business partner, Ellen Yin, understand that coffee and a great pastry can be just as meaningful before noon as an artfully plated duck breast is after dark.

Restaurants that aim to be useful and interesting all day long are becoming more common in Los Angeles and other cities; New York could use more of them.

The view into the windows from Hudson Street says bakery: You can see bread on shelves, a squarish seeded rye and a round buckwheat loaf with dried cherries inside. Baked by Alex Bois, they have the roughness and flavor of whole grains, the complicated taste of slow-rising dough, and the kind of dark, thick, crackling crust you want to feel between your teeth.

In a glass case by the door are a few of Samantha Kincaids pastries, fewer as the day goes on. The neighbors are especially fond of carrying off the round doughnuts rolled in spiced sugar and filled with salty cider caramel.

Unlike Sadelles, which also has a retail bakery up front, High Street on Hudson puts virtually all of its pastries on the daily menus. An ideal breakfast could be made of coffee and the witty red-eye Danish, a flaky golden swirl with warm country ham over a bulls-eye of bittersweet pastry cream made with espresso.

Or it could revolve around a black bialy. This oddball creature, dark with squid ink and strewn with sesame seeds, is soft and chewy, with pickled peppers and a mound of tart, uncreamy whitefish salad pressed into its divot.

Cooking at breakfast takes the form of egg sandwiches. My choice of these is the Bodega, an incongruous name for a countrified affair of flattened sage sausage and Cheddar on a biscuit with a mule kick of black pepper. Like the other sandwiches, the Bodega arrives alongside a grilled hot pepper on an irregular block of wood. This is both affected and counterproductive; a boring old plate would do a better job of keeping food off the table. (Whats going to happen to all these fancy boards once they stop being cool and everybody admits what a pain they are?)

I am tempted to jump from breakfast straight to dinner out of cowardice. I would rather not have to say that lunch is the weakest meal of the day. The sandwiches are the trouble. The pastrami is a buzz kill, an inert mass of cold pink meat sliced too thickly on too much rye. Another is called the Best Grilled Cheese Ever. It isnt. (Granted, calling a sandwich the Best Grilled Cheese Ever is like naming your child Jesus Buddha.)

If a place is going to go to the trouble of baking those first-rate breads, it should keep a closer eye on the laws of contrast and proportion that mean success or failure in the sandwich universe. Sandwich engineering is a skill of its own, or maybe an instinct.

When it gets dark, High Street on Hudson doesnt entirely pack up the bakery. One of Mr. Kulps more clever moves is to integrate dinner into the overall program with a few breads and some of the regionally grown grains theyre made from.

Vollkornbrot, a dark German rye riddled with sunflower seeds, is a wonderful thing to eat when its buttered and griddled and spread with rutabaga hummus, which could double as vegetarian chicken-liver pate. Slices of anadama, a venerable New England cornmeal loaf sweetened with molasses, are topped with very rich, very tender, very smoky eel.

I was happily surprised that sunflower seeds cooked into a creamy mock risotto could be so appealing. A less pleasant surprise was the portion size, too small to be served as a separate course to our table of four. Apart from the breads, the menu is a longish list under a single category, To Share. The kitchen decides what to send out when, and it doesnt always make the right call.

Tempura-style broccoli is at the start of that list and, ideally, at the start of your meal. Impressively crisp, it gets a refreshing assist from pickled wood-ear mushrooms and an exhilarating dribble of spicy chowchow relish.

Halfway down the menu you come to the pastas. Do not, for any reason short of an allergy, ignore the bucatini with squid and mussels. Mr. Kulp, who was chef de cuisine at Torrisi Italian Specialties before he moved to Philadelphia, knows what he is doing in the pasta department. The bucatini are flavored with seaweed, a terrific idea, and the plate is finished with lobster bottarga shaved into rose-colored petals, an even more terrific idea. It may be the finest use of lobster coral anybody has come up with.

Toward the bottom of the menu are what used to be called main courses. Arctic char is sauced with a very smart remix of a gribiche; the eggs are pickled for extra snap. And while the phrase soured grains does not make the heart go pitter-pat, I could work up some affection for the thing it described, a tart, almost refreshing porridge served under fat slices of duck breast with especially flavorful skin.

You may expect a place serving soured grains to go salty and savory with its desserts. And youd be correct. I like them, mostly, but Id rather have a piece of the spiced kabocha cake, or the cream puff, with its soft spill of Meyer-lemon cream, followed by a cookie offered on a tray by a smiling woman at the door.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-02-26 00:00:00,Unearthing Bogota's Past on the Carrera Septima,"['Annie Correal', 'Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Reference Timestopics People C Annie_correal Index Html']","Leer en Espanol.

A century ago, the Carrera Septima, Bogotas main thoroughfare, was bordered by the stately homes of the well-to-do. Like a European promenade, it led to the city center: grand municipal buildings, a towering cathedral, the expansive Plaza de Bolivar. Its electric streetcars were a symbol of progress, high in the Andes.

Now, little remains of the Septimas grandeur. The old city was nearly reduced to rubble after a political assassination in 1948 sparked riots that left buildings ransacked and burned, the streetcars tipped over and torched. Those who could moved north, leaving the city center to fill with soulless office buildings and the indigent.

Its dirty, its ugly, it smells, and its full of thieves, said the photographer Juan Cristobal Cobo, summarizing the popular attitude toward the old center, also known as the Candelaria, which has been partly restored and attracts international tourism.

But for eight months last year, Mr. Cobo visited a still-rough part of the area weekly, concentrating on four blocks of the Septima that were closed to vehicular traffic not long ago. There, he mined for visible signs of a past often forgotten by Colombians in their eagerness to move forward. Historic centers interest me, he said. In Colombia, they are centers of forgetting.

Mr. Cobo, 52, was born in Cali, Colombia, and studied film at New York University. Since the early 1990s, he has lived in Bogota and worked as a cinematographer and commercial director. A few years ago, I reached a point where I couldnt stand to do any more advertising, he said. As we say in Spanish, I kicked my lunch pail.

He embarked on a number of personal photography projects, including this one.

Remnants of the past abounded on the Septima, where the streetcar tracks were embedded like scars in the street. In one image, a man smoked on a bench in the spot where the populist leader Jorge Eliecer Gaitan was killed in 1948  arguably the most important spot in Bogota, for were it not for that event, the city wouldnt have been destroyed, Mr. Cobo said.

Photo

Mr. Cobo also spotted living relics of the past: older gentlemen in suits and ties crossing the street. Retired public servants and office workers, they lingered in the city center, walking alone or sitting in cafes discussing events from long ago. These men are the last of a type known as el cachaco, the quintessential Bogotano of the last century.

They come from the early 20th century when the British and European influence was strong, Mr. Cobo said. They have a certain formality, a certain courtesy. They probably dont have a place to sleep, or live in rented rooms, but they wont go out without fixing their tie and putting on their sweater and overcoat.

He also found plenty of what he called rebusque, buskers and swindlers of all stripes: fortune-tellers, men selling emeralds, or offering to let him in on a deal. By the Plaza de Bolivar, vendors sold bags of corn to working-class Colombian tourists to feed the pigeons. A one-armed man did push-ups for change, his knuckles leaving a groove in the concrete from his 1,000 daily repetitions (Slide 18). A handful of Michael Jackson impersonators took turns dancing for coins, among them a 14-year-old who had fled Uraba, one of the flashpoints in Colombias decades-long civil conflict.

Its like a very, very, very sad Times Square in a third world country, Mr. Cobo said.

Photo

Despite the details in his work that speak to daily life and the passage of time and history, Mr. Cobo said he did not consider himself a photojournalist. He wanted to stir feelings in the viewer. As often as he saw brokenness, Mr. Cobo said he sensed strength in his subjects. And he wanted to convey this.

Colombia is a complex country, but very resilient, he said. There is a spirit of resilience. The Septima is a mirror of that.

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"Iran, Up Close, Though Far Away","['James Estrin', 'Http Jamesestrin']","Hossein Fatemis photos of Iran provide an unvarnished and intimate view of his homeland. His project An Iranian Journey, which was published on Lens in 2013, earned Mr. Fatemi the World Understanding award in the Pictures of the Year International contest last month.

Im trying to get away from the stereotypes and cliches that Western cultures have about the Iranian people, said Mr. Fatemi, 35. Most Americans have a third world perception and cant even separate Arab culture from Persian culture.

Mr. Fatemi says there is a lifetimes worth of photographs for him to make in his country.

But he cannot.

Photo

The day after Mr. Fatemis story was featured on the website of his photo agency, Panos Pictures, he received the first of many emails from conservative hard-liners who wield power in political parties, official news media and the government. They accused him of undermining Islam and of having a Western ideology and perspective, Mr. Fatemi said. Similar emails were sent to his photo agency, and its website was blocked in Iran.

At the time, Mr. Fatemi was visiting a photo festival in San Diego, and it quickly became clear to him that it would be too dangerous to return to Iran.

Although he settled in Chicago, he did not give up on documentary photography in Iran. He enlisted eight of his former students and started A Journey Inside, a documentary project on social issues in Iran. Although he could not be there physically, Mr. Fatemi stayed in contact through Skype, social media, email and phone.

The stories the participants  four men and four women from different parts of the country  chose focused on the place of women in Iranian society, university students, drought and a disabled war veteran. Mr. Fatemi did not tell them to take any particular point of view or political position.

I just want them to be free and take the pictures they need to, he said. I chose a subject that would not cause them to be arrested or get into any trouble if they were published. There are many subjects that could force photographers to leave the country as I did.

Photo

Indeed, scores of photographers have fled Iran since the post-election protests and 2009 crackdown, he added.

Mr. Fatemi arranged and led virtual workshops throughout Iran to teach his students how to be better visual storytellers and to have an open-minded viewpoint. At times, local government officials banned his workshops because they included men and women together and because a critical documentary viewpoint was politically unacceptable.

The project lasted 14 months, including training and photographing under the supervision of Mr. Fatemi and Panos Pictures, with the assistance of Maryam Athari. The photographers included Zahra Ostadzadeh, Bahar Aslani, Hossein Heidarpour, Hamid Akhlaghi, Negin Kiani, Saeed Zeidi, Mahya Rastegar and Ali Tajik.

Ms. Ostadzadeh, who has a masters degree in sociology, concentrates on womens issues in her photography and video work. For the project, she documented an all-girls boarding school in Kerman Province where, she said, the girls were satisfied by what they have, even though in the larger society women are sometimes seen as inferior.

I wanted my photos to improve their life, she said. My approach wasnt looking down at them. I dont want my photos to only show poverty. Instead I want to show lifes happiness and the great goals they envision. I want to show that despite all the poor conditions and poverty that should be changed they are still content.

Photo

For Mr. Fatemi, receiving the award from POYi was a little bittersweet. Although he cannot return to Iran for now, he has forged a new way forward  with his students. The Journey Inside project was, he said, another way to get at the truth.

Iran is a very complex and complicated country, he said. We photographers think that through this kind of photography we can understand ourselves, our beliefs and our viewpoints.

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,New Procedure Allows Kidney Transplants From Any Donor,['Gina Kolata'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In the anguishing wait for a new kidney, tens of thousands of patients on waiting lists may never find a match because their immune systems will reject almost any transplanted organ. Now, in a large national study that experts are calling revolutionary, researchers have found a way to get them the desperately needed procedure.









In the new study, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, doctors successfully altered patients immune systems to allow them to accept kidneys from incompatible donors. Significantly more of those patients were still alive after eight years than patients who had remained on waiting lists or received a kidney transplanted from a deceased donor.

The method, known as desensitization, has the potential to save many lives, said Dr. Jeffery Berns, a kidney specialist at the University of Pennsylvanias Perelman School of Medicine and the president of the National Kidney Foundation.

It could slash the wait times for thousands of people and for some, like Clint Smith, a 56-year-old lawyer in New Orleans, mean the difference between receiving a transplant and spending the rest of their lives on dialysis.

Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Science Times Newsletter Every week, we'll bring you stories that capture the wonders of the human body, nature and the cosmos.

The procedure, Mr. Smith said, changed my life.

Researchers estimate about half of the 100,000 people in the United States on waiting lists for a kidney transplant have antibodies that will attack a transplanted organ, and about 20 percent are so sensitive that finding a compatible organ is all but impossible. In addition, said Dr. Dorry Segev, the lead author of the new study and a transplant surgeon at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, an unknown number of people with kidney failure simply give up on the waiting lists after learning that their bodies would reject just about any organ. Instead, they resign themselves to dialysis, a difficult and draining procedure that can pretty much take over a persons life.

Desensitization involves first filtering the antibodies out of a patients blood. The patient is then given an infusion of other antibodies to provide some protection while the immune system regenerates its own antibodies. For some reason  exactly why is not known  the persons regenerated antibodies are less likely to attack the new organ, Dr. Segev said. But if the persons regenerated natural antibodies are still a concern, the patient is treated with drugs that destroy any white blood cells that might make antibodies that would attack the new kidney.

The process is expensive, costing $30,000, and uses drugs not approved for this purpose. The transplant costs about $100,000. But kidney specialists argue that desensitization is cheaper in the long run than dialysis, which costs $70,000 a year for life.

Although by far the biggest use of desensitization would be for kidney transplants, the process might be suitable for living-donor transplants of livers and lungs, researchers said. The liver is less sensitive to antibodies so there is less need for desensitization, but its certainly possible if there are known incompatibilities, Dr. Segev said. With lungs, he said, desensitization is theoretically possible, although he said he was not aware of anyone doing it yet.

In the new study, 1,025 patients at 22 medical centers who had an incompatible donor were compared to an equal number of patients who remained on waiting lists for an organ or who had an organ from a deceased but compatible donor. After eight years, 76.5 percent of those who received an incompatible kidney were still alive, compared with 62.9 percent who remained on the waiting list or received a deceased donor kidney and 43.9 percent who remained on the waiting list but never got a transplant.

The desensitization procedure takes time  for some patients as long as two weeks  and is performed before the transplant operation, so patients must have a living donor. It is not known how many have someone willing to donate a kidney, but doctors say they often see situations in which a relative or even a friend is willing to donate but is incompatible.

Often patients are told that their living donor is incompatible, so they are stuck on waiting lists, for a deceased donor, Dr. Segev said.

In recent years, an option called a kidney exchange has helped some in this situation. Patients who have incompatible living donors can swap donors with someone whose donor may be compatible with them. Often, there are chains of patient-donor pairs leading to a compatible organ swap.

That process can be successful, said Dr. Krista L. Lentine, the medical director of the living donation program at the Saint Louis Center for Transplantation, but patients often still cannot find a compatible organ because they have antibodies that would reject almost every kidney. In those cases, desensitization may be the only realistic option for receiving a transplant, said Dr. Lentine, who was not involved with the study.

Dr. Jeffrey Campsen, a transplant surgeon at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center who also was not a study investigator, said his group focused on exchanges and had been fairly successful. But he also comes across patients whose donors do not want to participate. There is a hurdle if the donor and patient have an emotional bond, he said.

The new data showing the success of desensitization lets people get behind it, Dr. Campsen said, adding, I do think it is something we would consider.

Mr. Smith, the New Orleans patient who went through desensitization, had progressive kidney disease that slowly scarred his kidneys until, in 2004, they stopped functioning. His sister-in-law, Allison Sutton, donated a kidney to him, and he had a transplant, but after six and a half years, it failed. He went on dialysis, spending four days a week hooked up to dialysis machines for hours. It was keeping him alive, he told his friends, but it was not a life.

Then a nurse suggested that he ask Johns Hopkins about its desensitization study. I was like, whatever I could do, he said. He discovered that he qualified for the study. But he needed a donor.

One day, Mrs. Smith was talking on the phone to a college friend, Angela Watkins, who lives in Augusta, Ga., and mentioned that Mr. Smith was praying for a donor. Mrs. Watkinss husband, David Watkins, a judge in state court, had been friends with Mr. Smith in college and the two wives, also college friends, had kept in touch over the years.

Mrs. Watkins told her husband about the conversation, and they asked themselves if they should offer to donate.

We talked and researched and prayed, Judge Watkins said. Finally, he said, they came to a conclusion. We have a moral obligation to at least see if we would qualify. And he thought that he should be the one to go first. If he did not qualify, his wife could be tested.

Mr. Smith warned his old friend that donating was an enormous undertaking. He said, You cant grasp what you are doing. I heard him but it didnt register, Judge Watkins said. I told him, I have something you need, so whats the big deal? 

Of course, it was a big deal. Although Judge Watkins had prepared by getting himself in top physical shape, it still took about six months to recover from the operation.

That was four years ago, and Mr. Smiths new kidney is still functioning and he is back to his active life, forever grateful to his friend.

Every night. he says, during my nightly prayers with my wife, I thank God for bringing David and Allison to me and for giving me the gift of life.

But for David giving me this gift, I would still be in that dialysis chair.",[]

Even before revelations that the Fox Sports reporter Erin Andrews was secretly videotaped naked by a stalker in a hotel room in 2008, female sportscasters have understood how frightening obsessed fans can be.









Andrea Kremer recalled being in a hotel room while she was at NFL Films in 1988 when a man called late at night as she was falling asleep.

He started saying all these things he wanted to do to me, and it scared the living hell out of me, Kremer, who is now with NFL Network and HBO Sports, said. I hung up, called downstairs, and said: I got a really threatening call. Can you trace it? They said it was coming from inside the hotel. Then he called back  it was so chilling and terrifying. I was shaking. My heart was beating fast.

After another call to the front desk, she said, the hotel stationed a security guard outside her door.

I told the men on my crew, and they were livid, she said. They said: Why didnt you call us? We would have slept on the floor.

In an age of round-the-clock sports broadcasting and the widespread dissemination of their work across social media, female sportscasters have unparalleled reach. There are more of them now than ever, across multiple channels and websites.

But the flip side can be unwanted attention from an audience that is male dominated, from stalkers or even from self-described fans who recognize them and simply get uncomfortably close.

Female newscasters and celebrities have long faced such harassment and threats  one newscaster in St. Louis two years ago said she had to quit her job under repeated threats from a stalker  but some sportscasters work in potentially vulnerable and highly visible places like stadiums and arenas where they are in close proximity to passionate fans, many of them males.

They routinely take precautions like asking hotel clerks not to say their name loudly when checking in, refusing to step in elevators if they see glaring male eyes, and opting for private transportation in late hours, to avoid the flock of people who often gather outside studios, innocently or not. Some check to make sure the hotel door peephole has not been tampered with, as it was in Andrewss case.

In one of the most disturbing episodes faced by a female sportscaster, a determined fan named Michael David Barrett used a hacksaw to alter the peepholes of Andrewss hotel rooms in Nashville and Columbus, Ohio. Jurors on Monday found Barrett and the companies that manage the Nashville Marriott responsible for invading Andrewss privacy and awarded her $55 million in damages.

Jessica Mendoza, an analyst on ESPNs Sunday Night Baseball, said that what happened to Andrews made her wonder about taking more than minor precautions like closing the blinds in hotel rooms.

You think about all the times youre in a room  and how scary that someone could see me in there, she said.

But even less egregious encounters can leave female sportscasters unsettled and almost always on guard.

Ill try to avoid ever being in the hall of a hotel by myself, Kim Jones, a reporter for NFL Network, said. And Ill allow whoever is behind me to pass me before I put my card or key in the door. You have to be so aware because unfortunately that one time out of 10,000 something can happen.

Alyssa Roenigk, a reporter for ESPNs magazine who also appears on ESPN television, primarily covering action sports like the X Games, said she rarely gave her security much thought. For years, she usually walked from venues to her hotel, even late at night. But as she began to do more television, and was recognized more often, she was told by her bosses to start taking the courtesy car provided by the network.

At first I thought I was getting special treatment, and I dont want special treatment, Roenigk said. Its not special treatment. Its being safe.

Jamie Little of Fox Sports, who primarily covers Nascar and other motor sports, said: Just last week, I got on an elevator and there were some race fans in there, and they were drinking and it made me a little nervous. And they were kind of watching what floor I was going to, so I pressed the wrong floor. So I go to the wrong floor, get off the elevator, wait for them to go and get back on.

In another instance, she said, she was on an airport shuttle on her way to pick up a rental car when a man approached her. She is still not sure if he was an ardent fan, or something else.

This guy turns right into me and says, Hey, Jamie, so you going to so-and-so today? I was like, Whoa, hey, well, Im here for Nascar,  she recalled. And he kept trying to make small talk. I went down another escalator, and when I looked over, he was literally standing there staring at me, on his phone.

That kind of stuff makes you worry, she continued. You want to give people the benefit of the doubt. Yeah, Im on TV, its not a big deal. But you have to watch the mannerisms, the body language, the constant following you as they try to ask questions. I tend to be overly nice to people. When weird things happen, I honestly kind of forget about it because its your job and Ive got to get on a plane the next week.

Laura Okmin, a sideline reporter for N.F.L. games on Fox, dealt with a stalker in the mid-1990s when she was working at a TV station in Chattanooga, Tenn. The man became angry when she did not respond to letters he sent her and gifts he dropped off for her. Eventually, police officers escorted her home several times and security was provided at events that she covered. Later, a man kept calling her at every hotel she checked into.

She uses these experiences at seminars she holds for aspiring female sportscasters at her company, Galvanize.

I tell them that sometimes someone will be lovely and pay you a great compliment, but if you dont respond the right way in person or on social media, they turn angry and belligerent, she said. Nowadays, it can be 24/7 with all the ways they can come at you.

After the jury award, Andrews was thankful for the encouragement she said she had received from other victims of harassment, and she suggested the cases outcome would improve safety.

Ive been honored by all the support from victims around the world, she said on Twitter. Their outreach has helped me be able to stand up and hold accountable those whose job it is to protect everyones safety, security and privacy.",[]

Your hand may be fondled and examined as if it were some kind of mysterious bauble, then perhaps placed on a naked hip. A kiss may be planted on a fingertip. And at many points, you may find yourself being suddenly stroked as you wander the rooms of the lavishly restored Billy Roses Diamond Horseshoe nightclub in the basement of the Paramount Hotel.

Queen of the Night, directed by the talented set designer Christine Jones (American Idiot, the Metropolitan Operas Rigoletto), blends several strands of currently fashionable theatrical DNA. Among its presenters is Randy Weiner, who is among the producers of Sleep No More, the wildly popular riff on Macbeth that requires you to don a beaky mask and wander several floors of a building in Chelsea in search of dark doings. As at Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812 (at least when it first opened in the meatpacking district), a full meal is included in the ticket price: kale salad and potatoes, and one of three theatrical main dishes: chunky beef ribs presented on a huge wooden platter, a roast suckling pig plopped down on the table still on the spit, or lobster. (A vegetarian option, mushroom risotto, is also available.)

Although there is a sprig of drama involved  characters modeled on the principals in Mozarts Magic Flute have central roles in the floor show  the foursquare aim of this meticulously produced spectacle is to satiate appetites other than traditionally dramatic ones. Just how sated you will be depends on chance, to a degree. As with Sleep No More, every individuals experience will be different. You might drink, dine and watch the performance, most of which takes place on a raised platform in the middle of the ballroom-size dining room, without being accosted by any of the butlers, as the wranglers who spirit customers away for private encounters are called.

Or you could be lassoed (literally) almost the moment you descend the marble staircase leading to the festivities, as my companion was, and led off into a private chamber for some intimate talk about intimate matters. (Have you ever been in love?)

Or you could find yourself, as I did, shoeless and sitting in a fur- and mirror-lined boudoir with a pert young woman making goo-goo eyes at you as she strokes your face with a feather.

Or you could be hijacked during the dinner service and swept off to a small chamber and invited to engage in a game of striptease, as the handsome hedge fund guy sitting next to me was. (I expect the young, toned and beaming-with-extroversion are selected for this option.)

If youre in the mood for these kinds of things, Im not sure I can give any advice about how to convey your inclination. Maybe just look for a young man sporting raccoon eyes (the eyeliner budget alone must stretch to the thousands a month) and a come-hither look, and throw yourself in his path. These assistants can also be identified by their black-and-white ensembles, created by the fashion designer Thom Browne, who provided all the costumes. Of course, as with real mating games, maybe its better to look like youre not looking. Try clutching your drink tightly and staring in anguished anxiety at the floor, and see what happens.

In fact, staring at the floor, and the walls, and the light fixtures, is among the most reliably pleasurable diversions at Queen of the Night, and one that does not require curatorial assistance. The design is a collaborative effort among the interior designer Meg Sharpe, the set and scent designer Douglas Little and the creative director Giovanna Battaglia. (I recall a little incense, but nothing too wild in the olfactory department.) It features a riot of different styles, with an emphasis on opulence twisting toward the decadent.

A stuffed leopard, posed as if on the prowl and draped in jewels, stands sentinel in one of the antechambers, looking as if hed just crawled down from an Erte print. One room I was led through, in which a female cast member was bathing as nonchalantly as you can bathe while strangers stroll by, featured walls and a chandelier molded from white wax. Another wall in one of the antechambers features an elaborate inlaid design created from metallic blue beetle shells and butterfly feathers. The handles on the doors to most of the rooms are outstretched hands, a clever symbol of the shows theme of connection and seduction. (Take care to establish the gender of the hand on the bathroom door you choose, or you could find yourself treating some patron to an unwanted moment of interpersonal engagement.)

You may also notice that some attendees have little hand-shaped amulets hanging from ribbons around their necks. These would be the guests who opted for the higher tiers of pricing. General admission tickets begin at $135 and include a cocktail and full dinner with unassigned seating, but there are levels of increased coddling that can push that price north of $500. (For that sum, you get to select your own premium wine and have special canapes in the kitchen.)

I was assured, however, that the butlers have no instructions to give extra attention to patrons who have paid more. Everyone has an equal chance at being treated to a little knife throwing, a magic trick, a back rub or even a ritualized milk bath. Given the shows general air of fin-de-Bloomberg-era lavishness, it was good to know that at least when it came to the elaborately stage-managed intimacies, all were on the same footing. At Queen of the Night, decadence and democracy are shaking hands.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-02-26 00:00:00,Why Tech Degrees Are Not Putting More Blacks and Hispanics Into Tech Jobs,"['Quoctrung Bui', 'Claire Cain Miller']","Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Technology companies employ strikingly few black and Hispanic workers. They blame the recruitment pipeline, saying there arent enough of them graduating with relevant degrees and applying for tech jobs.









Yet the data show that there are many more black and Hispanic students majoring in computer science and engineering than work in tech jobs. So why arent they being hired?

Those who enter the candidate pipeline fall out somewhere along the way  and the culture and recruiting methods of tech companies seem to have a lot to do with it.

The pipeline problem is not a myth. Black and Hispanic students are underrepresented in computer science and engineering programs, relative to their share of the population, while Asian students are overrepresented.

Yet the pipeline is more fruitful than tech companies make it out to be. Among young computer science and engineering graduates with bachelors or advanced degrees, 57 percent are white, 26 percent are Asian, 8 percent are Hispanic and 6 percent are black, according to American Community Survey data. At the top 25 undergraduate programs, nearly 9 percent of graduates are underrepresented minorities, according to Education Department data analyzed by Maya A. Beasley, a sociologist at the University of Connecticut.

But technical workers at Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter, according to the companies diversity reports, are on average 56 percent white, 37 percent Asian, 3 percent Hispanic and 1 percent black.

One issue is that black and Hispanic computer science and engineering graduates are less likely than white and Asian ones to go into tech jobs. Forty percent of young Asian graduates do so, compared with 16 percent of black graduates and 12 percent of Hispanics, according to American Community Survey data.

Meanwhile, 10 percent of black computer science and engineering graduates have office support jobs, which include administrative support and accounting jobs, compared with 5 percent of white graduates and 3 percent of Asians.

Continue reading the main story What Jobs Do Computer Science and Engineering Majors Have? Occupation Black Hispanic Asian White

Ms. Beasley studied why talented black students ended up in lower-paying, lower-status careers for her book Opting Out: Losing the Potential of Americas Young Black Elite. Those who studied science and technology were less likely than white students to stick with their majors when they felt they were underperforming, she found. Those who did stick with their majors were less likely to apply for technical jobs. They often pursued nonprofit or business work instead, she said, sometimes because they had heard negative things about the culture at tech companies, and seen how few black people worked there.

One example: At Facebook, where some employees had written black lives matter on the walls, others in recent days have crossed it out to write all lives matter. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, called the actions malicious and deeply hurtful.

Any student of color looking at the numbers from the tech giants is going to be turned off and wary about taking a job there because it tells you something about what the climate is, Ms. Beasley said. They dont want to be the token.

Recruiting is another issue. Part of it is looking not just at Stanford and M.I.T. but also at places like historically black colleges. Even at the colleges that tech companies typically recruit from, students who are not white or Asian might not be in the networks to know about opportunities at tech companies.

Tristan Walker, a tech start-up founder and chief executive of Walker & Company, said he didnt know about Silicon Valley until he was 24 and arrived at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

There definitely isnt a pipeline problem, even going to the same schools companies go to, Mr. Walker said. He puts the onus on the companies. These folks arent working hard enough, theyre just not.

Tech companies need to look into more places to find students outside the mainstream network, said Mr. Walker and Laura Weidman Powers, who together started Code 2040, a nonprofit that connects black and Hispanic engineering students with tech companies. (By the year 2040, some people predict, minorities will become the majority in the United States, and the group says its goal is that they are proportionally represented in the tech sector by then.)

When companies come to campus to recruit, for example, black and Hispanic students often simply dont show up for information sessions, Ms. Powers said. But theyre more likely to come to workshops, like for writing resumes or preparing for interviews.

That gets a higher yield in terms of students showing up, and they leave with an impression that we value them and their growth, as opposed to it just being a sales pitch, she said.

Tech companies often give coders whiteboard interviews  asking them to solve a problem by writing code on a whiteboard, so the interviewers can see their thought process. At Code 2040, however, they discovered that many black and Hispanic students, unlike white and Asian ones, had never heard of this type of interview and were unprepared for it.

Theres still a dominant cultural narrative in black and Hispanic communities that you have to be twice as good and keep your head down and work hard, Ms. Powers said. That does not translate to Valley culture, starting with the whiteboard interview, because it requires people to work through errors in front of the interviewer, as opposed to presenting only the right answer.

Research has found that during hiring, managers are biased against black-sounding names on resumes, for instance, and interviewers weigh too heavily whether theyd want to hang out with someone. Software can help remove human bias, such as with new tools for stripping resumes of biographical information, offering blind auditions to job applicants or analyzing job postings for language that excludes certain groups.

Many tech companies have started doing things like requiring training on unconscious bias and hiring corporate diversity chiefs. But it is unclear how much of a difference these efforts make. Holding hiring managers responsible for diversity works far better than either staff diversity training sessions, which dont work well, or networking and mentoring programs, which help a bit, according to a study analyzing three decades of work force data from 708 companies.

Some researchers offer other strategies: Use standardized interview questions, not subjective ones; evaluate hiring managers based on whether they bring in diverse candidates; build a Rolodex of potential hires by working with networking groups for minorities; hire more than one minority member in each batch of new hires, so they have a support network.

Techniques like these could expand the pipeline for tech companies  and for any other industry, too.",[]

Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders will convene in Miami for the second Democratic presidential debate of the week on Wednesday night, ahead of big primaries in Florida and Ohio next Tuesday. Their previous encounter was a testy affair, as the candidates clashed over the economy, guns and campaign finance. While Mr. Sanders won in an upset over Mrs. Clinton in the Michigan primary on Tuesday, her delegate lead still widened because of her victory in Mississippi.

Heres how to tune in:

On television

The debate begins at 9 p.m. Eastern and will be shown on Univision, CNN and Fusion.

Online

There are also plenty of free options to view the debate online, with the websites of Univision, CNN, The Washington Post and Fusion streaming it live.

On social media

Facebook and Twitter will be full of commentary about the debate, and readers can find the conversation using the hashtag #DemDebate. Also, Purple, a new messaging app, is collaborating with the networks to provide real-time updates about the debate via text messages in Spanish.

And you can follow along with The New York Times for our live chat and analysis of the action.

FRIDAY PUZZLE  When you dont have a theme to cling to and the clues are ramped up to weekend-level, it can be difficult to conquer a crossword puzzle. If you are just dipping a toe into the late week, themeless puzzles, there are only two things you will need to be successful, and they are 1) patience and 2) more patience.

There are two ways to approach a late-week puzzle. You can scan the clues looking for something, anything that you definitely know, or you can take an educated guess. I highly recommend starting out with the former approach. Nothing boosts your solving self-esteem like filling in that first entry in a blank grid. This first entry will vary, depending on your personal wheelhouse. In my case, I started with 57 Downs Janies got A GUN' and Almond ROCA at 60 Down (I know. Aerosmith and candy. Sorry, Mom.) If those are not your speed, how about Al JOLSON at 9 Down, who sang the timeless Toot Toot Tootsie (Goobye)? Or perhaps you are a bit of a dandy, and you are all about the PERIWIGS. I can remember reading The Bobbsey Twins as a child, so NAN went in right away.

No matter what you know, fill it in and pat yourself on the back for embarking on a late-week solve. From there, branch out and try to connect as many of the entries as you can. The patience comes in when you feel stuck. Put the puzzle down and go do something else. Your brain will continue to process what youve seen in the clues and when you come back to it, youll be surprised at how much more you suddenly know.

The second approach, which can also work, is to take an educated guess at entries that might not be what they seem. At 61 Across, the clue One who can see right through you? is obviously misdirection, what with the question mark at the end. So it probably doesnt mean someone who can see that youre not being honest, which is one possible definition of ... see right through you. Who else can see right through you? My first guess was SUPERMAN, but that doesnt fit. The only other person that could possibly see through you is a RADIOLOGIST.

Having fun yet? You should be. Remember, this is a game. Its a pastime, and its supposed to be fun. Getting angry because you dont know or like a certain word or you think that crosswords should be a strict test of intelligence is pointless and bad for your health. So, if youre having trouble with the puzzle, put it down and come back to it when you can solve it in the fun spirit in which it is meant to be solved.

Evans Clinchy offers us this Friday puzzle and has quite a bit to say about it, so Ill stop lecturing and let him take the mic:

Constructors Notes

So this is my second crossword published in The Times, and if you compare this puzzle with my previous one, youll notice a host of similarities. Both are themeless, both feature stacks of 11-letter entries across the top and bottom three rows, and both are built around the seed entry of a famous N.B.A. player. Last time, back in 2014, it was KEVIN DURANT; this time, I give you Kareem ABDUL-JABBAR. I swear, I have other ambitions in life beyond cramming as many basketball players as possible into Times puzzles. Eventually Ill have no names left to play with besides FESTUS EZELI or someone equally obscure. I should quit now while Im ahead. Anyway. This puzzle was a joy to construct  I remember it began with the realization that the fun CARTOONLIKE fit perfectly beneath ABDUL-JABBAR, and it all flowed from there. I liked getting to sneak in PERIWIGS (which Ive always thought is a cool word, no?) and ONE-TWO PUNCH. Including the name LOUIS C.K. in a puzzle was always something of a bucket-list goal, as the comedian has always been a favorite of mine. Funny, though  I thought I was so original for including Louie at the time I wrote this puzzle, as hed never been featured before. Then his name showed up three times shortly thereafter  in November 2014, January 2015 and March 2015. Great minds think alike, or something? At least I had the neat twist of crossing the comics name with TITLE ROLE, since he has one on his FX show. Its the little victories. As for the clues, Im happy with a few that I wrote (especially the pyramid scheme wordplay for CHEERLEADER), but Im equally grateful for Will sprucing up some of my duller clues with some flavorful ideas of his own. One who can see right through you? for RADIOLOGIST is great. Wish Id thought of that. Also, a picture in one of the clues! [The picture is in the print version only. D.A.] Thats crazy  didnt even know it was a thing. I understand its very, very rare, so Im honored that Will chose my puzzle to decorate. Thanks for reading (and solving), everyone. Ill be back with a Sunday puzzle next time, obviously, because how else am I gonna fit GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO into a grid?

And now for something completely different: a PERIWIGged game of charades:

MIAMI  Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida who ended his presidential bid after a string of disappointing finishes, is planning to meet with three of the remaining Republican candidates while theyre in Miami for the Republican debate on Thursday night.

Mr. Bush has plans to meet with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, an aide to Mr. Bush confirmed. The lists glaring omission, of course, was Donald J. Trump.

Mr. Bush will meet with Mr. Rubio on Wednesday, and Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich on Thursday, the aide said. It was unclear whether Mr. Bush intended to make an endorsement before Tuesdays winner-take-all primary in Florida.

As a candidate, Mr. Bush made taking on Mr. Trump, forcefully and repeatedly, a hallmark of his campaign, criticizing him for disparaging women, Hispanics and the disabled, and warning that he was insufficiently serious to be commander-in-chief.

Mr. Trump, meanwhile, always seemed to hold Mr. Bush, and his dynastic family, in poor regard, attacking him from almost the first moment he entered the race. It was Mr. Trumps two-word insult  dubbing Mr. Bush low-energy  that helped devastate Mr. Bushs campaign, as voters parroted back the phrase and Mr. Bush, who in fact routinely held several free-wheeling events every day, was never able to fully shake the moniker.

The relationship between Mr. Bush and Mr. Rubio is especially fraught. As governor of Florida, Mr. Bush helped mentor Mr. Rubio, then a charismatic, up-and-coming lawmaker, even bestowing on him a sword when he became speaker of the Florida House. But Mr. Bushs team was livid when the young protegee entered the 2016 race, refusing to cede the Florida political world to Mr. Bush, in what many viewed as a betrayal.",[]

PALM BEACH, Fla.  After testing the bounds of vulgarity, factuality and decency, the most surreal presidential campaign in modern times now arrives in the state where hanging chads, romantic dalliances and a mishmash of voting allegiances have made and unmade political careers.









This is Florida, where campaign money flows like sugar cane runoff and the Republican Party establishment is planning to make what could be its last stand against a man, Donald J. Trump, who embodies many of the states stereotypes  the love of a year-round suntan, an obsession with golf, a preening ostentation.

The states winner-take-all primary on Tuesday is shaping to be a climactic moment. Mr. Trumps insurgent candidacy faces the biggest test yet of whether it is built to endure. Marco Rubio, Floridas junior senator, will have to decide whether he should stay in the race if he loses. And Senator Ted Cruz of Texas will see how far his efforts to chip away at the support of both rivals can go.

A glimpse of the antics that lie ahead came Tuesday night, when Mr. Trump won Hawaii, Michigan and Mississippi. He celebrated at his golf club in Jupiter, Fla., where he set out on display an array of Trump-branded products like steaks, wine and water while he talked up the Jack Nicklaus-designed course. (Upon closer inspection, however, those steaks carried the label of a local meat purveyor.) I love Florida. Special place, he told the crowd.

This special place will have its fill of politicians over the next week. Univision was to host a Democratic debate on Wednesday night, and CNN a Republican debate on Thursday night, both in Miami.

But with little drama expected in the Democratic race  Hillary Clinton is comfortably ahead of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont here in polls  most of the attention is on the Republican contest.

Mr. Rubio, in the fight of his life, is trawling the state, from a paella cookout in the Cuban enclave of Hialeah, near Miami, to a high-dollar fund-raiser in Palm Beach to events in Sarasota and St. Augustine. Mr. Cruz also plans to visit Miami, Mr. Rubios home base.

It will be an expensive race, with Floridas 10 news media markets and $12 million in ads swamping televisions in the final two weeks before voting.

It will be bitter, too, with many supporters of the former governor, Jeb Bush, refusing to back Mr. Rubio. Some are threatening to vote for Mr. Bush, who dropped out of the race last month, because his name remains on the ballot.

And it will be a spectacle.

The guys I see every day are having ministroke episodes, said David Johnson, a Republican consultant in Tallahassee, the capital, who was supporting Mr. Bush in the presidential race. He will be one of those still voting for the former governor.

In a twist that Mr. Rubio cannot enjoy, much of the anti-establishment anger that he rode to victory in the 2010 midterm elections is now working against him. Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz, who party leaders fear would lead the Republicans to historic defeats in November, are the anti-establishment now.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Its a very similar thing, Mr. Johnson added. People are angry. They dont know what they want, but they dont want what they have right now.

Every 15 years or so, Florida manages to send a shock through the presidential race, whether in the form of a romantic escapade on a yacht named Monkey Business, which helped sink Gary Hart, or in the form of hanging chads, the half-punched ballots that sent the 2000 election to the United States Supreme Court.

This time, the shock wave is Mr. Trump.

For evidence that this is Mr. Trumps Republican Party now, look no further than here in the blue-blooded beachhead of Palm Beach. When the local party hosts its annual Lincoln Day dinner this month, a tradition that dates back decades, Mr. Trump will not only headline the event but also host it. His private club Mar-a-Lago is the venue.

Many Republicans here, people who have opened their homes to Rockefellers and Bushes, are getting behind him.

Have you ever hunted grouse? asked Byron Thomas, a longtime Palm Beach resident, explaining Mr. Trumps appeal. Grouse, which he said he hunts on his property near Cooperstown, N.Y., need to be flushed out of the brush before you can shoot them. And to do that, he said, you have to startle them and make them angry. What Trump has done is hes flushed out these impostors, he added.

Sure, the real estate developer has done things that Mr. Thomas finds crass, like putting his picture on the water bottles handed out at his golf courses. But he can look past that. Bob Dole couldnt win. Mitt Romney couldnt win. So lets try something different, he said.

Many conservatives like Mr. Thomas lost trust in Mr. Rubio shortly after he went to Washington and began working on a bipartisan immigration overhaul plan. His time in the capital, they say, has eroded his anti-establishment credibility.

Florida allows ballots to be cast before Election Day, and the early-voting data contains signs that Mr. Trump should find encouraging. According to an analysis of the more than 600,000 votes that Florida Republicans have already cast, 18 percent came from people who did not vote in November 2012 or in 2014 when Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, was re-elected.

Daniel Smith, the University of Florida political scientist who conducted the analysis, said that the number accounted for more than just population growth and could be seen as a sign that Mr. Trump is pulling in new voters, much as he has done in other states.

But not all the data is discouraging for Mr. Rubio. In Miami-Dade County, where Mr. Rubio hopes to make up for the ground Mr. Trump is likely to gain in the more conservative north of the state, Mr. Smith said the rate of Hispanic Republicans participating is above average. That, he said, should be good for Mr. Rubio.

Beyond Miami, it has been slow going for the Rubio campaigns get-out-the-vote operation. One afternoon over the weekend at the Orlando headquarters, which opened only last week, about 20 volunteers were working from lists of likely Rubio voters who had requested absentee ballots and calling them to make sure they had voted. Their surroundings were bleak: the vacant offices of what used to be an architecture firm, the floor littered with broken ceramic tiles and orange cones marking where hazards protruded.

Complicating matters for Mr. Rubio is Mr. Cruz, who despite not being particularly competitive in Florida has decided to be at the very least a nuisance, and at the very worst a drain that keeps the senator from catching up with Mr. Trump.

Mr. Cruz announced recently that his campaign had opened 10 offices across the state  a move that seemed aimed at goading Mr. Rubio, since at the time the Rubio campaign had only five formally open. Rubio campaign officials circulated photographs of what they said were the Cruz locations, which looked vacant.

If Mr. Rubio has much of a campaign treasury left, he is not spending it on ads here but rather relying on the support of the super PAC backing him. The Conservative Solutions PAC placed nearly $6 million in advertising for the two weeks before the primary. Some of that will be spent attacking Mr. Trump, who is already the target of $4 million in negative ads by an array of groups working to take him down.

Even if Republicans were spending more to swamp Mr. Trump in negative ads, it is not clear they would agree on a candidate to support in his place. Mr. Rubio has spoken to Mr. Bush at least twice since Mr. Bush quit the race on Feb. 20, and was planning to sit down with him this week. (Mr. Bush also was meeting with Mr. Cruz and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio.) But the Rubio campaign has all but written off the possibility that Mr. Bush will endorse him.

Mr. Bushs friends say some Bush loyalists still think that Mr. Rubio did not show the respect he should have to the man who helped nurture his career when he was a young state legislator.

I talked to Jeb, and he doesnt have any harsh feelings about this, said Mel Martinez, the former senator whose seat Mr. Rubio won. I think he obviously wishes Marco would have been a little more loyal a friend. But what are you going to do?

Its a tough deal, he added.

Given that absentee votes were circulated before Mr. Bush dropped out, he is still expected to register some support on Primary Day.

Its probably going to be at least 2 percent, said Michael P. McDonald, who studies elections for the University of Florida and the Brookings Institution, basing his assumptions on the results in Texas, where Mr. Bush drew votes even after dropping out. In Florida, like in Texas, he said, they like their Bushes.

Whether it is the feuding between the Rubio and Bush camps, or Mr. Trumps outrageousness, or Mr. Rubios perceived betrayal of the conservatives who elected him in 2010, Floridians may not agree on much these days. But they all seem to want the primary to end quickly.

This has been immature and childish. Its like grade school kids  all the fighting and talking over each other, said Virgil M. Price II of Palm Beach, who is not sure whom he will vote for except that it will not be Mr. Trump. Its been horrible.",[]

Her conversation with James Estrin about covering the ceremony has been edited.

Q.

Tell me about your first Oscars.

A.

It was at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in 1999. I shot the red carpet, and that was it. I shot film and it wasnt a tight deadline. At that time, The Times would run the red carpet story the Tuesday following the awards.

Q.

What is the difference between 1999 and last year?

A.

The difference is the technology and new media. The fan base has always been there, but its even larger now because of the technology that lets people experience this on their phones. Theres an insatiable appetite for films and movie stars.

Q.

Now the Oscars photos are essentially broadcast live. You take a photo, and it ends up on the New York Times home page minutes later.

A.

Its gone from dropping film overnight and picking it up the next morning to transmit, to running memory cards to an on-site editor to beat the closing time for the next days paper. When the first wireless transmitters came out, we started using them. We work under an extremely tight deadline on East Coast time.

Josh Haner made all the difference when he devised an ingenious system where every single frame we shoot is transmitted immediately to the editors in New York. They are actually seeing the pictures in real time. They caption them with the names of the stars and the designer and post them on the web.

You work on a lot of serious, in-depth stories. Yet these award shows are among the most popular slideshows we do.

A.

Yes. The Oscar slide shows get the most views of any shows all year, which is quite amazing. Last year, it got over three million views over all. But do you want to hear something incomprehensible to me? The red carpet slide shows for last months Golden Globes got 13 million page views. And thats pretty much somebody posing in an evening gown. But we were faster. We were beating the wires. They were still dealing with on-site editors.

Q.

What is involved in shooting the red carpet?

A.

We have more access now so its gotten much more interesting and challenging. It used to be all about logistics  setting up days in advance to make sure all that technology works.

I have shot every position, from the red carpet to the photo room, where there are bleachers full of hundreds of photographers screaming at the winners when they come to pose for pictures; to a position inside of the theater, which is essentially what is seen on television.

Once I got the backstage position in 2014  and along with that the ability to move around on the red carpet  I could roam, take pictures, observe and work the light. Youre not in one position waiting for something to happen in front of you. You can actually start to take real pictures. The first year, I felt like a kid in a candy store.

Q.

And how did this happen?

A.

It took many years of asking. Only a handful of photographers are granted that access, and the biggest news and entertainment organizations are represented. The New York Times is one of them, and our reach has grown tremendously, especially the last few years, through our website and social media.

Photo

Q.

Whats it like to be in the bleachers?

A.

You get into your position in the photo room and everybodys dressed in formal attire. You wait for the winners to come in with their awards and when they do the whole room just goes crazy. Theres a stage thats set up and they pose with their statues.

You just try to capture whatever moment you can with somebody standing in front of you posing.

Q.

And the other photographers screaming in your ears.

A.

Yes, but sometimes that might work to your advantage if youre sitting next to somebody who gets the winners attention and they kind of look your way. Im not inclined to scream at people. Its just pandemonium.

Then the celebrity walks away and everything quiets down. The next one comes and the room erupts again. It can be entertaining, but also sort of a sensory overload at times.

Im at my best when Im like the only photographer around. And so this is quite the opposite. The red carpet positions are pretty much the same. Essentially youre stuck in a tiny position waiting for somebody to walk by and pose and you try to make visual sense. You want to make a clean image, but you want to make an interesting one. Sometimes youre a little limited and they breeze past you.

Photo

Q.

Are you taking note of the clothes or are you just trying to make a sharp head-to-toe image?

A.

A little bit of both. There are some dresses that do really stand out. Now, being able to roam on the carpet, you can be a lot more discerning. You can follow a person or gown that looks really great. When youre in position you really have to get it while theyre there. Its like shooting theater or sports. It takes a lot of technical prowess  you really have to be on top of it. You have to capture that moment. Once theyre gone, theyre gone.

Q.

Half of Americas watching whats happening onstage. Whats it like backstage?

A.

Its really quite impressive and a little intimidating at first. There is so much activity going on in a crowded, confined space. Im fairly new to it and there are great photographers like Al Seib of The L.A. Times who have been shooting backstage for a long time. I learned a lot from them.

I use flash sparingly and shoot with fast primes because if youre shooting into a black hole it doesnt always look good and it creates a big disturbance. Ill raise my ISO as high as 6400, and work with the light thats there.

There are all the stagehands and different sets coming in and moving out at a very fast pace. And you have to stay out of the way of the performers, musicians, presenters and stage managers. You dont want to interfere with their flow but you still want to get your pictures. So its kind of an intricate dance, knowing when to step in  and knowing when to step out.

Q.

What have been your most memorable Oscar moments?

A.

Backstage, when Lupita Nyongo won, she had a big smile on her face and then she came out and she was just so quiet (Slide 10). She just stood there like she was just trying to take it all in, but it was just such a quiet moment. I mean, theres so much excitement and activity going on all the time, and I was just there, shooting, and it was dark.

Q.

As photographers we see so many famous people, presidents and stars, that we have been somewhat inoculated against being impressed. And then every once in a while theres someone youre impressed by.

A.

The most obvious pictures are of the famous people onstage. But I have to remind myself to resist the urge to blast away when I see a familiar face and to look for something that is interesting in that moment, even if its an expression or a gesture.

In some ways its like shooting politics. I went to Nevada for the caucuses, stayed for a week and flew back on Wednesday to go straight from the airport to the Oscars venue for the first walk-through. So I went from one American ritual to another.

Photo

Q.

How are they similar and how are they different?

A.

Well, there are the obvious differences: One group of people is dressed much more elegantly than the other.

The similarities are that these are rituals the American public feels that it has a vested interest in. And that dominate our television screens and social media. People can get very passionate about entertainment and politics.

Q.

Theyre both theater.

A.

The challenging part of both is finding the real human moments in between the staged moments  finding something that looks different from what everybody else is shooting. I mean not only the angles, but also the little off-moments. Like the workers who are behind the scenes carrying the big Oscar statues around.

Q.

Did you watch the Oscars when you were growing up?

A.

Absolutely.

I love movies. The town I grew up in  a small suburb east of L.A.  had a drive-in that played all the first run movies. I saw all the movies of the 70s there with my parents: The Godfather, The Exorcist, Jaws, even Carnal Knowledge. We went to the movies every single week. That was a big part of my life growing up. I always watched the Academy Awards. The Oscars were a special occasion when I could stay up late and watch the show with my parents. I never dreamt that I would get so close to the actual awards ceremony.

Q.

So I wonder whether the 8-year-old Monica, what she would have thought about the fact that you are now backstage.

A.

Actually the 40-something Monica would be pretty impressed, after all the years of shooting from all the other positions.

I remember watching in the living room with the family. I remember the streaker one year, and when Marlon Brando, sent the Native American woman (Sacheen) Littlefeather to decline his award. I remember Jane Fonda. Its a reflection of society and the times.

Thats whats going on this year, too. I remember the palpable elation when Denzel Washington and Halle Berry won the Best Actor and Best Actress awards the same year, in 2002.

So its interesting to see the controversy going on now and how different people are responding to it. As gilded and removed as it is from reality, the Oscars cant avoid being a reflection of our society as well.

Sam Sifton emails readers of Cooking five days a week to talk about food and suggest recipes. That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here.

Good morning. Brett Anderson is the restaurant critic for The Times-Picayune of New Orleans, but this week hes on the cover of our Food section with a paean to pot roast, a dish of his Midwestern youth that he says is due for a mass reappraisal. Bretts recipe for the pot roast is adapted from one that the Minneapolis chef Gavin Kaysen serves at his Spoon and Stable restaurant, and we hope youll find it a must-make for coming days.

We feel the same way about Martha Rose Shulmans new recipe for roasted vegetable bibimbap, adapted from Lukas Volgers new book, Bowl  and about Pierre Franeys classic recipe for sauteed salmon with leeks and tomatoes as well.

But today is Wednesday, the center of the workweek, the evening on which we often dont cook with a recipe, but with a narrative no-recipe recipe instead.

Todays comes from Julia Moskin. Scatter a bunch of sliced onions and shallots across the oiled bottom of a large roasting pan, then put a bunch of chicken thighs on top of them, skin side up. Season it all with salt and pepper and then slide the pan into a hot oven to roast until the chicken is crisp and cooked through. Mix the onions around below the chicken every so often and add wine or stock if they are browning too fast. Meanwhile, make some croutons from good chewy bread, toasting them until golden in a pan or in the oven. They can be sliced or torn up  no matter. Put the croutons on a warm platter, place the chicken on top, then dump the contents of the roasting pan over everything. Serve with green salad. Boy howdy.

Those looking for an actual recipe to cook tonight can turn to Cooking. We like miso chicken in the middle of the week, with rice and baby bok choy. Also: a baked potato with crab, jalapeno and mint, which is easier to make on a Wednesday than its ingredients suggest, and is awesomely delicious to boot. Maybe vegetarian mapo tofu? Spaghetti carbonara? A big Persian salad by way of Los Angeles? So many choices!

Save the recipes youre interested in cooking to your recipe box, so you can track them down later, like in the supermarket when youre looking for pecorino Romano and pancetta. And when youve cooked them? Rate the recipes. Leave notes on them. Share them with family and friends.

NEWARK  Elevated levels of lead caused officials in New Jerseys largest school district on Wednesday to shut off water fountains at 30 school buildings until more tests could be conducted, officials said.

The district, Newark Public Schools, told the State Department of Environmental Protection on Monday that annual testing found concentrations ranging from undetected to above the departments action level for lead, which is 15 parts per billion. That level requires additional testing, monitoring and remediation.

The department, which requested test results from previous years to perform a complete analysis, said in a statement that no building had more than four samples above the action level.

The department also said lead had not been found in the citys water supply. In the vast majority of cases where lead is found in drinking water, it enters through the water delivery system itself when it leaches from either lead pipes, household fixtures containing lead or lead solder, the department said.

Notices have been posted and bottled water and water coolers delivered to the buildings.

Lead in drinking water has drawn increased attention recently because of the crisis in Flint, Mich., which began after the city switched from the Detroit water system to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure in 2014. Lead from aging pipes leached into the drinking water because it was not treated with anticorrosion chemicals.

Lead in school water is a longstanding issue in the United States and has been a focus of federal and local regulators.

I understand in the Flint environment that any sign of elevation is going to make everyone go haywire, but here, the water system in Newark is still safe, its still drinkable, the citys mayor, Ras J. Baraka, said at a news conference. Mayor Baraka also asked for cases of water to be donated to the schools.

Parents should have no concerns about their childrens water and food consumption at school, the environmental department said, because the act of drinking water is usually not associated with elevated levels of lead in the blood on its own. It is the buildup of lead from all sources over time that determines whether harmful health effects will occur, the agency said.

Concerned parents can have their children tested for lead at Newarks Department of Health and Community Wellness.

The state chapter of the Sierra Club, an environmental group, called for more testing and pipe replacement.

New Jersey cities have old, outdated pipes in our streets and homes, which can mean even higher levels of lead in our water, Jeff Tittel, the groups director, said. Many of our water systems go back to the Victorian era, and even homes built in the 30s and 40s have pipes made with lead solder.

The Newark school system has 35,054 students in 66 schools.",[]

Donald Trump once had you physically removed from a news conference for asking questions about his proposed immigration policies. Now hes the front-runner for the Republican nomination. The only other time that has happened to me was with Fidel Castro in Guadalajara, Mexico.









As a member of the Spanish-speaking media, do you blame the mainstream media for Trumps rise? I hoped he would have been asked harder questions. How is he going to deport 11 million people in two years? That would require more than 30 jumbo-jet flights every day. How is he going to build a 1,900-mile wall? It will cost at least $20 billion. I spoke with former President Vicente Fox, and he clearly told me: Mexico is not going to pay for that wall.

I think white voters cant really imagine what its like to be the target of the sort of language that Trump uses when talking about illegal immigrants. Do Latino voters feel it more personally? Yes. President Obama has deported more than two million undocumented immigrants in seven years, more than any other U.S. president. Trump is talking about deporting 11 million. Ted Cruz said he wants to deport 12 million. For us, immigration is not something abstract. It is personal. Very, very personal.

How strong is the voting bloc? Do you think theres really a Latino firewall that could prevent a Trump presidency? Absolutely. Trump seems to think he can win the White House with only the white vote. I believe that the only way to win the White House is with the Latino vote. If the Republican candidate cannot get 33 percent of it, he cannot win the White House.

Do you think a Trump nomination could be energizing, in a way, to Latino voters? Young Latinos have been telling me that they want to register to vote because of Donald Trump. Not because they want to vote for him, but because they want to vote against him.

What about the 16 percent of Latino voters who support Donald Trump? Who do you think they are? I think these are Latinos who at some point in their lives decided to turn their backs on other immigrants. There used to be a tradition within the Hispanic community that regardless of your political party, you would support undocumented immigrants. That ended with Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.

Rubio and Cruzs families came from Cuba, whereas the bulk of illegal immigrants who are here are from Mexico and Central America. Do you think their heritage has anything to do with their politics? What Ill say is that Cuban-Americans dont have to deal with the same immigration issues as other nationalities because of the wet feet, dry feet policy. For Cubans, one year after you touch United States territory, you can become a legal resident.

He refused to talk to the families of the 43 students who disappeared in Ayotzinapa. It was a different pope from the one we saw here in the United States.

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Padma Lakshmi Opens Up About Rushdie in Memoir,['Christine Hauser'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Padma Lakshmi, the cookbook author and reality television star, has a signature repertoire as host of Top Chef on Bravo. It plays out at key moments in the competition, when anxious chefs stand opposite her as she tastes their dishes, their faces scrutinizing hers for some clue about what she is thinking.









She chews silently and then puts down her utensils, often without a flicker of expression. Thank you, she finally says, before turning away gracefully and moving on to the next contestant.

Part of the appeal of the moment is that Ms. Lakshmi, 45, leaves so much unsaid.

Not so in her new book, Love, Loss and What We Ate, which was released on Tuesday. In the 324-page memoir, Ms. Lakshmi opens a window into her life, weaving together stories from her childhood, her love affairs and her work through the lens of the culinary experiences that eventually shaped her fame. The book appears to spare little, delving deeply into personal details about uncertainty over paternity during her pregnancy, the pain of a custody case and her efforts to overcome the insecurity she felt being Indian.

I am going to own my history, she said in an interview on the Today show on NBC.

Ms. Lakshmi particularly highlights her high-profile relationship with the author Salman Rushdie, which was overshadowed by a fatwa, or religious edict, that had been issued in 1989 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Irans former supreme leader. It called for Mr. Rushdie to be put to death for his supposedly blasphemous book The Satanic Verses.

The two met at a party in New York in 1999, when he was married and she was an aspiring model and actress. They shared a high-profile love affair, and then a marriage. But health and professional tensions frayed their relationship.

Ms. Lakshmi suffered from endometriosis, a painful uterine disorder in which tissue grows outside the organ. The struggles of dealing with it  she had extensive surgery  upended their sex life and contributed to the demise of their marriage, she writes. Ms. Lakshmi said Mr. Rushdie at one point called her a bad investment and was insensitive to her medical condition even as she tried to recuperate.

She wrote that he believed she was using her ailment to justify not having sex with him. Deciding she was better off alone, she said, I was free to wallow in my malaise, and nurse myself without seeing the disappointment in his face.

Ms. Lakshmi said in an interview with People magazine that she told Mr. Rushdie that she was writing about their marriage. And he said, You have the right to tell your side of the story as you see it, Ms. Lakshmi said.

Photo

Mr. Rushdie has also written about their relationship in his 2012 memoir Joseph Anton, which is told in the third person and derives its title from the security code name that he used as he lived in the shadow of the fatwa. In the book he refers to Ms. Lakshmi as his Illusion, and he describes her as irrational, vapid and vain.

Her feelings for him  he would learn  were real, but intermittent, he wrote. She was ambitious in a way that often obliterated feeling. They would have a sort of life together  eight years from first meeting to final divorce, not a negligible length of time  and in the end, inevitably, she broke his heart as he had broken Elizabeths.

He also suggested that she was competitive with him and thought he was blocking her light.

She didnt like playing second fiddle.

But Ms. Lakshmi leavens dark memories of Mr. Rushdie with bright ones, reflecting in her memoir on the love and the passion the couple shared in their eight years together courting and as a married couple.

She said the book initially started out to be one about healthy eating, but then it broadened into a narrative of a life that bridged cultures.

Ms. Lakshmi was born in India and spent some of her childhood years in the southern city of Madras, which she says was the starting point for the culture and chemistry of food that eventually formed the backdrop to her life. She describes knocking tamarind pods out of trees to be used for cooking, watching the white shavings fall from her grandmothers wood coconut grater and inhaling the scent of frying mustard seeds.

The vivid flavors I experienced there will forever be the standard to which I hold any food I eat today, she writes.

Her memories in the book are interspersed with recipes  yogurt rice; kumquat and ginger chutney; and kichidi, a rice and lentil porridge.

She immigrated to the United States as a child, and said she struggled with self-confidence as she tried to come to terms with her identity, to overcome a brown girls self-loathing and to fit in.

It took years for this internalized self-loathing to fade, she writes.

Ms. Lakshmi pursued modeling and acting (she appeared in the Mariah Carey bomb Glitter, from 2001) in Los Angeles. Years in Paris and in Italy contributed to her personal growth through culinary and sexual adventures.

Ms. Lakshmi said that after her marriage ended, in 2007, she struck up relationships with Adam Dell, a venture capitalist, and Theodore J. Forstmann, a colorful financier and philanthropist several decades her senior who she said taught her unconditional love.

When she discovered she was pregnant, in 2009, a paternity test later established Mr. Dell as the father of the girl, Krishna. A contentious custody case played out in the media, but she said she and the girls father reached a rapport in their parenting.

Ms. Lakshmi went on to become a co-founder of the Endometriosis Foundation of America. For all her struggles, she writes, cooking staked out emotional markers in her life. It bolstered her confidence when, in the presence of Mr. Rushdies friends, it allowed her to keep her hands busy, to mask her insecurities.

It provided a wholesome distraction. Alone in an empty new temporary home after their split, Ms. Lakshmi decided to whip up a chutney to revive her spirits.

Through the simple ritual of cooking, she writes, I could lift myself, at least gastronomically, from the gray.",[]

If you dont mind spending more on shipping, you may want to order from Tot Brill, an artist living in East London, who buys fine vintage linens which she, too, re-embroiders. A former theatrical designer with art-school training, Ms. Brill sells antique table linens via her online shop, Brill and Ben.

Whether Ms. Brill embroiders insects, Italian graffiti or Fornasetti-like faces, her sales on Etsy are strongest in New York and California. Though no two sets are alike, her trompe loeil wine stains series are the most popular. She embroiders realistic-looking wine stains on her napkins and table clothes, with different specific threads for different grapes (claret, malbec, Beaujolais and shiraz-colored stains).

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,New Procedure Allows Kidney Transplants From Any Donor,['Gina Kolata'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In the anguishing wait for a new kidney, tens of thousands of patients on waiting lists may never find a match because their immune systems will reject almost any transplanted organ. Now, in a large national study that experts are calling revolutionary, researchers have found a way to get them the desperately needed procedure.









In the new study, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, doctors successfully altered patients immune systems to allow them to accept kidneys from incompatible donors. Significantly more of those patients were still alive after eight years than patients who had remained on waiting lists or received a kidney transplanted from a deceased donor.

The method, known as desensitization, has the potential to save many lives, said Dr. Jeffery Berns, a kidney specialist at the University of Pennsylvanias Perelman School of Medicine and the president of the National Kidney Foundation.

It could slash the wait times for thousands of people and for some, like Clint Smith, a 56-year-old lawyer in New Orleans, mean the difference between receiving a transplant and spending the rest of their lives on dialysis.

Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Science Times Newsletter Every week, we'll bring you stories that capture the wonders of the human body, nature and the cosmos.

The procedure, Mr. Smith said, changed my life.

Researchers estimate about half of the 100,000 people in the United States on waiting lists for a kidney transplant have antibodies that will attack a transplanted organ, and about 20 percent are so sensitive that finding a compatible organ is all but impossible. In addition, said Dr. Dorry Segev, the lead author of the new study and a transplant surgeon at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, an unknown number of people with kidney failure simply give up on the waiting lists after learning that their bodies would reject just about any organ. Instead, they resign themselves to dialysis, a difficult and draining procedure that can pretty much take over a persons life.

Desensitization involves first filtering the antibodies out of a patients blood. The patient is then given an infusion of other antibodies to provide some protection while the immune system regenerates its own antibodies. For some reason  exactly why is not known  the persons regenerated antibodies are less likely to attack the new organ, Dr. Segev said. But if the persons regenerated natural antibodies are still a concern, the patient is treated with drugs that destroy any white blood cells that might make antibodies that would attack the new kidney.

The process is expensive, costing $30,000, and uses drugs not approved for this purpose. The transplant costs about $100,000. But kidney specialists argue that desensitization is cheaper in the long run than dialysis, which costs $70,000 a year for life.

Although by far the biggest use of desensitization would be for kidney transplants, the process might be suitable for living-donor transplants of livers and lungs, researchers said. The liver is less sensitive to antibodies so there is less need for desensitization, but its certainly possible if there are known incompatibilities, Dr. Segev said. With lungs, he said, desensitization is theoretically possible, although he said he was not aware of anyone doing it yet.

In the new study, 1,025 patients at 22 medical centers who had an incompatible donor were compared to an equal number of patients who remained on waiting lists for an organ or who had an organ from a deceased but compatible donor. After eight years, 76.5 percent of those who received an incompatible kidney were still alive, compared with 62.9 percent who remained on the waiting list or received a deceased donor kidney and 43.9 percent who remained on the waiting list but never got a transplant.

The desensitization procedure takes time  for some patients as long as two weeks  and is performed before the transplant operation, so patients must have a living donor. It is not known how many have someone willing to donate a kidney, but doctors say they often see situations in which a relative or even a friend is willing to donate but is incompatible.

Often patients are told that their living donor is incompatible, so they are stuck on waiting lists, for a deceased donor, Dr. Segev said.

In recent years, an option called a kidney exchange has helped some in this situation. Patients who have incompatible living donors can swap donors with someone whose donor may be compatible with them. Often, there are chains of patient-donor pairs leading to a compatible organ swap.

That process can be successful, said Dr. Krista L. Lentine, the medical director of the living donation program at the Saint Louis Center for Transplantation, but patients often still cannot find a compatible organ because they have antibodies that would reject almost every kidney. In those cases, desensitization may be the only realistic option for receiving a transplant, said Dr. Lentine, who was not involved with the study.

Dr. Jeffrey Campsen, a transplant surgeon at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center who also was not a study investigator, said his group focused on exchanges and had been fairly successful. But he also comes across patients whose donors do not want to participate. There is a hurdle if the donor and patient have an emotional bond, he said.

The new data showing the success of desensitization lets people get behind it, Dr. Campsen said, adding, I do think it is something we would consider.

Mr. Smith, the New Orleans patient who went through desensitization, had progressive kidney disease that slowly scarred his kidneys until, in 2004, they stopped functioning. His sister-in-law, Allison Sutton, donated a kidney to him, and he had a transplant, but after six and a half years, it failed. He went on dialysis, spending four days a week hooked up to dialysis machines for hours. It was keeping him alive, he told his friends, but it was not a life.

Then a nurse suggested that he ask Johns Hopkins about its desensitization study. I was like, whatever I could do, he said. He discovered that he qualified for the study. But he needed a donor.

One day, Mrs. Smith was talking on the phone to a college friend, Angela Watkins, who lives in Augusta, Ga., and mentioned that Mr. Smith was praying for a donor. Mrs. Watkinss husband, David Watkins, a judge in state court, had been friends with Mr. Smith in college and the two wives, also college friends, had kept in touch over the years.

Mrs. Watkins told her husband about the conversation, and they asked themselves if they should offer to donate.

We talked and researched and prayed, Judge Watkins said. Finally, he said, they came to a conclusion. We have a moral obligation to at least see if we would qualify. And he thought that he should be the one to go first. If he did not qualify, his wife could be tested.

Mr. Smith warned his old friend that donating was an enormous undertaking. He said, You cant grasp what you are doing. I heard him but it didnt register, Judge Watkins said. I told him, I have something you need, so whats the big deal? 

Of course, it was a big deal. Although Judge Watkins had prepared by getting himself in top physical shape, it still took about six months to recover from the operation.

That was four years ago, and Mr. Smiths new kidney is still functioning and he is back to his active life, forever grateful to his friend.

Every night. he says, during my nightly prayers with my wife, I thank God for bringing David and Allison to me and for giving me the gift of life.

But for David giving me this gift, I would still be in that dialysis chair.",[]

Can the government help Donald Trumps supporters?









The political system is in shock over the insurrection of the white working class, which has flocked to Mr. Trumps candidacy.

On the wrong side of globalization and technological change, no longer at home in an increasingly multiethnic America, these voters have eagerly embraced his simple proposal to make things better: walls against the imports and the people they believe have robbed them of a shot at prosperity.

That strategy, if it amounts to that, would visit a disaster of epic proportions upon the world economy. It harks back to the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of the 1930s, which pushed the world into a tit-for-tat trade war in which everybody raised their barriers against everybody elses imports, entrenching the Depression.

As Lawrence H. Summers, Treasury secretary under President Clinton and former chief economic adviser to President Obama, warned, Even the possibility of Trump becoming president is dangerous.

But the raw anxiety of his supporters remains unaddressed.

It is not obvious how to restore the America Mr. Trumps legions pine for. The nations diversity would not go into reverse regardless of how high he built his wall along the nations southern border.

Their economic discontent  born of the mismatch between expectations based on an earlier America, where plenty of blue-collar jobs offered a decent standard of living, and the more cutthroat reality they face today  can seem intractable, too.

Its not clear what public policy can do for someone who was expecting his income to grow from $50,000 to $80,000 but instead saw it stagnate at $50,000, said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist.

Stumped by the economys inability to deliver more decent jobs, policy makers are struggling to come up with solutions.

The routine promise that economic growth will automatically spread prosperity has proved empty, belied by the long slide in the real earnings of all but the best-paid workers.

Any long-term strategy to improve workers lot, of course, must include improving their skills. But just kicking the challenge down the road under the fuzzy prescription that all America needs is better education and training  a favorite of policy makers and their economic advisers  is no longer acceptable for workers who have suffered multiple rounds of dislocation over several decades.

Stepping into the vacuum, the technologically endowed of Silicon Valley are talking about a future that bypasses the labor market entirely. They are offering up a universal basic income  financed by taxing rich capitalists and an elite corps of computer programmers tasked with making sure the robots perform meticulously  as the tool to satisfy peoples basic needs without any work involved. (Its the subject of an online conversation between me and my fellow columnist Farhad Manjoo.)

But before we enter the world of science fiction, its worth looking at some policies that could improve jobs for most American workers, in the here and now.

For all its strengths, the American job market has some troubling features. Unemployment might be lower than in many other industrialized nations, but the employment rate for prime-age workers has been on a downward trend for 15 years.

Whats more, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the research arm for the most advanced industrialized nations, the United States suffers the highest incidence of low pay among its members. A quarter of workers earn less than two-thirds of the median wage.

Americans also suffer from the steepest earnings inequality and limited income mobility. Workers who start with low wages more often get stuck with them for a very long time. And for American men, mobility has declined over time.

Instead of enhancing these trends, as it now does, government policy could push back. As Professor Katz noted, over the last few decades, about 13 percent of the nations gross domestic product was redistributed to the top 1 percent from the rest of the population. It is not crazy to suggest, he said, that some percentage of that could be shared with a broader group.

The earned-income tax credit  a wage subsidy for low-income workers that has become the nations most powerful antipoverty tool  could be expanded to include more workers and phase out at higher incomes. Combined with a higher minimum wage, it could be calibrated to ensure that workers earnings totaled, say, at least $15 an hour.

Employers could be subsidized, too, to hire workers from problematic populations, including the long-term unemployed. The government could set itself up as an employer of last resort.

The Obama administration has been quietly deploying a screwdriver or two from this tool kit. New rules proposed by the White House last year would make millions of workers eligible for overtime pay.

The White House also supports increasing the earned-income tax credit for adults without children; so does Speaker Paul Ryan, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives.

In this years State of the Union address, President Obama proposed wage insurance, to protect workers who lost their jobs and had to take new ones for less money. He said that Washington should cover half the difference in pay, up to $10,000 over a two-year period.

These proposals represent only a start. They are far from full solutions for the struggling working class.

Yet modest though they may be, they are still highly controversial. Indeed, the most critical question is whether politicians divided by an ideological gulf could agree on any effective labor market strategy.

The idea of direct government employment  a once common practice  has been anathema on the American right since the late 1970s. Strengthening American workers collective bargaining power, among the weakest in the rich industrialized world, seems equally fanciful.

Research by Suzanne Mettler and Julianna Koch from Cornell University underscores how any plan to help Mr. Trumps beleaguered supporters may end up entangled in ideological knots. They found that on closer inspection, many Americans who deny ever benefiting from a government social program actually received far more public support than they realized. And the most strenuous denials come from conservative Republicans.

Many citizens of red states and members of the struggling working class  supporters of Mr. Trump, not to mention Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida  oppose programs to benefit poor people. Even if the poor people these programs would help is them.",[]

As Volkswagen continues to deal with the fallout from its emissions scandal, the company announced on Wednesday that Michael Horn, the head of its American operations, was stepping down.

The decision, which the company said was reached by mutual agreement, is effective immediately. In the interim, Mr. Horn will be replaced by Hinrich J. Woebcken, who was recently named the new head of the North American region and chairman of Volkswagen Group of America.

The departure is the latest in a string of executive changes at Volkswagen in the wake of its emissions scandal. Volkswagen acknowledged last year that its diesel cars did not meet emissions standards in the United States and used a so-called cheat device to produce fake emissions during testing.

Mr. Horn, 54, who has worked for more than 25 years at Volkswagen, took the top job in North America in January 2014. Before that, he was the companys global head of after sales.

nytimes.com,2016-02-25 00:00:00,Review: Pandemic Explains How to Host the Perfect Pathogen Party,['Jennifer Senior'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Sometimes, the best approach to a book about deadly pathogens is to read it in a slightly dissociated state  it allows you to marvel at the cunning adaptability of microbial life, rather than contemplate the far creepier possibility of your own doom. In her introduction to Pandemic: Tracking Contagions, From Cholera to Ebola and Beyond, Sonia Shah, a science writer whose previous books include The Fever and The Body Hunters, does not seek shelter in euphemisms or shy away from scary numbers. Instead, she cites a study in which 90 percent of epidemiologists say they believe a global pandemic will sicken one billion and kill up to 165 million within the next two generations.









Looking closely at the source of this statistic  a paper by the epidemiologist Larry Brilliant and three colleagues  Im not convinced that things are quite so dire. (The number of epidemiologists he surveyed is actually quite small.) But theres no doubt that new forms of pestilence are appearing in the world with an almost metronomic regularity and that old ones are reappearing in new places, the Zika virus being only the most recent example.

And pandemics are never pretty. Here is Ms. Shahs description of what happened to Parisians when they were infected with cholera in 1832:

Fluid blood turned tarry, clotting in the blood stream. Muscles, deprived of oxygen, shuddered so violently that they sometimes tore. As the organs collapsed in turn, victims fell into acute shock, all the while fully conscious and expelling massive amounts of liquid stool.

The good news is that cholera made quick work of its victims. It was said that someone with cholera could feel perfectly fine at dinner and expire by dessert.

Yet once you get past the unfriendly statistics of the books introduction, and once you get past the chilling biology lesson of Chapter 1  which explains how these sneaky organisms jump from one species to the next  Pandemic is far less terrifying, perhaps because errant microbes are only one component of what makes a pandemic a pandemic. Theyre the known unknowns, as Donald R. Rumsfeld might put it. The other components are known knowns, which by definition are at least familiar: filth, political corruption, increasing population density and mobility.

Ms. Shah uses cholera, one of the most obdurate of pandemics, as a paradigm to explain how new deadly pathogens both emerge and circulate. If you already know something about cholera  if youve read Steven Johnsons excellent The Ghost Map, say  you may find yourself disappointed; she covers, inevitably, some of the same ground.

But this structuring conceit is also useful for simplifying an unwieldy topic. A discussion about the East India Companys expansion into the wetlands in the Bay of Bengal, which exposed many Indian workers to the tiny crustaceans that carry vibrio cholera, becomes the perfect segue to discuss how modern deforestation in Guinea encouraged more interaction between people and fruit bats, which are thought to carry Ebola.

As wetlands were paved over and forests were felled, different species came into novel, prolonged contact with each other, she explains. From a pandemics point of view, the more mingling among species the better.

For those who dont know much about the history of cholera, Ms. Shahs dense, compact book is a decent primer, explaining how new forms of transportation encouraged the spread of this waterborne disease, as did rising urban density, as did political corruption. (It was Aaron Burr who thwarted an attempt to bring clean water from the Bronx River into New York City  as if this man needed any more negative publicity.)

Perhaps my favorite chapter, though, is about waste  or, as Ms. Shah puts it, the rising tide of feculence. Nothing seems to awaken the muse in Ms. Shah like excreta, the ideal delivery system for all kinds of diseases. In each gram is up to one billion viral particles; yet somehow, Christianity shunned water-based rituals for centuries. Martin Luther went so far as to eat a spoonful of his own feces every day.

In 19th-century New York City, sanitation was extravagantly grim. By 1820, Ms. Shah writes, privies and cesspools covered one-twelfth of the city. Human and horse waste covered the streets and seeped into the groundwater; it was sometimes sold as fertilizer for sewage farming in Brooklyn and Queens.

The same conditions that drove cholera  overcrowding, corruption, poor hygiene, expanded transportation  are what drive pandemics today.

In the age of cholera, shipping trade helped spread disease. Today, its air travel  if you want to understand the helter-skelter distribution of flu outbreaks, simply consult a map of airline routes. In the age of cholera, politicians obfuscated and denied their way through the epidemic; today, the World Health Organization, the globes dedicated first responder, is so deprived of public funding that its private donors disproportionately control the agenda  which often has nothing to do with controlling pandemics.

Today overcrowding is not just in cities, but on farms, which have gotten denser and dirtier. In the United States, theyve become breeding grounds for E. coli; in China, poultry farms have grown so large theyve created many opportunities for interactions with wild waterfowl, which can lead to new strains of the flu.

Complicating matters is climate change. Warmer waters have washed cholera-rich surf into Alaska and Chile and Iceland. A cold winter altered the migration patterns of wild swans in 2006, which meant they ferried a new flu into more than 20 countries in Europe; an unseasonably warm New York winter in 1999 contributed to the West Nile outbreak.

To me, however, the most provocative  and sci-fi  part of Ms. Shahs book is not about the ways humans have altered the evolution of pandemics. Its about the ways pandemics have altered the evolution of humans. Pathogens, Ms. Shah explains, have always been the bodys antagonists. Every time we adapt to combat one, it counter-adapts to harm us back.

It is for this reason, she writes, that some evolutionary biologists believe weve evolved to have sex, rather than to clone ourselves  by diversifying the gene pool, were confounding pathogens, making it harder for them to keep up with our ever-shuffling genetic variations.

Ms. Shah ends her book on both a hopeful and cautious note. The cautious note is intriguing: Ms. Shah suggests that the real danger with pandemics is that humans often start to treat them as mere inconveniences, rather than crises (which is how many Africans treat malaria and many Americans treat the flu). As for the optimistic note: I wasnt buying it. She makes a case for building a worldwide, highly attuned surveillance system. A network of clinics, she writes, staffed with health care workers trained to recognize and report new pathogens, could do the trick.

No doubt it would. But, politically speaking, achieving this goal is about as likely as eradicating pathogens themselves. Now that is scary.",[]

Eat your soup. Its good food, my paternal grandmother, Bubbe Mary, would say.

Eat your soup. Its good food, my dad would playfully tell me, as he reminisced over the wonderful Jewish dinners his mom used to cook for him when he was a boy.

Split pea soup, poppy seed challah with six strands, braised brisket and potato kugel were a frequent occurrence.

Your Bubbe loved to fatten me up even when the doctors would shame her for how obese I was, he said. But Bubbe was proud that her job as a fluffer in the garment district could provide me with such extravagance. Every dairy meal had butter, milk and cheese, and Bubbe made sure there was plenty for seconds and thirds.

I giggled remembering some of the holiday meals at Bubbes, and how I hardly had a chance to swallow one thing before my plate was filled again.

Just a little more, she always encouraged. Food is meant to be eaten, not wasted, shed say, squeezing my cheeks until they were bright red and stung with pain. Think of all the hungry children in the world.

With each bite I took, Bubbe would profess her love. Shayna maideleh! Beautiful girl! Who loves you the most in the world? she would say, as she checked that I polished off every last crumb on my plate.

But other than holidays, we did not visit Bubbe much. My dad was a rising star in the ad industry  he was an international creative director at the ad agency McCann Erickson, but Bubbe was confused about what he did for a living and was disappointed that he did not have a regular job like his brother Melvin, who was an accountant. Even before I knew what an accountant was, I knew my dads job was super-fun as he got to work with Tony the Tiger and the Pillsbury Doughboy. But Bubbe was never impressed: A Jewish boy should be a doctor or a lawyer!

My dad felt that if they were not talking about food, the room was silent, so he made jokes  most of which Bubbe did not understand  to break the silence. Even when my dad was a child, he did things that she did not understand, like creating satirical comic books, or questioning why they had two different sets of dishes, or turning the lights on and off on Shabbat when she strictly forbid it.

As my dad showed me how to slice the mushrooms for the soup, he talked about his new account: Campbells. The current campaign, Mm! Mm! Good! was no longer generating enough sales, and it was my dads job to help create a slogan that would sell more soup.

While we stirred in the barley and shredded the meat for the broth, my dad shared the story of how when he was in the sixth grade, he got beaten up by a bunch of bullies who jumped him from behind, hitting him with lead pipes until he was unconscious.

Fat mamas boy! Fat mamas boy! they taunted. The beating was so bad that he spent a week in a coma, and the doctors didnt know if he would live or die.

Helpless, my bubbe cooked all day and all night, praying for his recovery. She hoped the smells of her famous mushroom barley soup, which she schlepped to the hospital, would revive him. When my dad awoke, Bubbe was standing there with a big pot, a bowl and a ladle  fully believing in the healing powers of her thick broth, made with beef bones, beef chuck and tomato paste.

My bubbe cooked all through the night when my dad was in the hospital, showering him with cinnamon raisin rugelach, sponge cake with an orange glaze, and mandel bread with big chocolate chips  feeding him obsessively, but never telling him she loved him.

My dad wanted to feel comforted by all the amazing food she had worked so hard to prepare, but he felt angry. He wanted to be thin. He wanted to be popular. He wanted to have self-confidence. The very food, which brought him such extreme pleasure, caused him to be bigger than the other kids, leading to ridicule and worse, landing him in the hospital.

When my dad dieted, he felt as if he was betraying my grandmother and dissolving the one bond they shared. Of course, as a child I didnt know any of this; I didnt understand the relationship between my father, my grandmother and food. I just knew that Bubbe Mary was a wonderful baker, and my dad missed her even though he would never say it.

As my dad served us each a warm bowl of mushroom barley soup with sweet parsnips and bay leaves, we looked at each other. Eat your soup. Its good food, we said in unison  imitating Bubbes Yiddish accent.

The next day when my dad came home, he smiled, announcing the new tag line and jingle for Campbells soup, Soup Is Good Food, inspired by my bubbes soup.

The soup that revived my dad when he was in a coma. The soup he taught me to cook. The soup that said I love you the way Bubbe showed her affections best  spoonful by spoonful.

Mushroom Barley Soup : This soup is made with nourishing bone broth and root vegetables.

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,The Enduring Curse of Caste,['Ananya Vajpeyi'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

NEW DELHI  Of the many protests to convulse public universities across India in recent weeks, the one held on Feb. 23, in which thousands of students, faculty and activists marched through central Delhi demanding Justice for Rohith, was the largest and perhaps the most palpably indignant.









A month before, Rohith Vemula, a 26-year-old Ph.D. student at the University of Hyderabad, in southern India, hanged himself from the ceiling fan in a friends hostel room. Mr. Vemula was raised by his single working mother, who is from a scheduled caste, the lowest rung of the hierarchical system that structures traditional Hindu society, and which used to be deemed untouchable until Indias independence in 1947. Mr. Vemula identified as Dalit, a word meaning crushed or ground down and refers to the oppression, often violent, suffered by scheduled castes over centuries of Indian history.

Mr. Vemula had secured admission to a prestigious graduate science program, as well as a highly competitive national research fellowship. He was a brilliant scholar and a popular and vociferous campus activist for the rights of disenfranchised communities. He killed himself because of relentless caste discrimination.

He left behind a searing suicide note: The value of a man was reduced to his immediate identity and nearest possibility. To a vote. To a number. To a thing. Never was a man treated as a mind.

Mr. Vemulas suicide  hardly a rarity among Dalits at Indias best universities  is emblematic of the problems of the countrys affirmative action program. Within a few years after independence, India had set aside for Dalits and other disadvantaged castes about 23 percent of government jobs and seats in public universities. Today, the reservations apply to many more groups and cover about 50 percent of such posts and seats. But numerical improvement does not an equal society make.

Dalit students still come from severe poverty. They lead de facto segregated lives on nominally diverse and inclusive campuses. They still face daunting disadvantages in the job market even after they graduate with degrees. The ability of reserved candidates is always suspect, regardless of their performance.

The gap between the high and the low castes, between so-called backward and forward communities, not only persists, it also manifests itself through ever-more subtle and complex forms of discrimination and violence. Being the beneficiary of reservations can itself be a stigma.

B.R. Ambedkar, a Dalit and an architect of Indias 1950 Constitution, warned the Constituent Assembly in 1949 that the political revolution inspired by Mohandas K. Gandhi, which had led to Indias freedom from British rule, must be accompanied by a social revolution upholding the ideals of fraternity and dignity for all.

Together with other progressive founders of the Indian Republic, Ambedkar helped make social, economic and political justice the first item of business in the statute books. The Constitution they drafted made it a punishable offense to treat anyone as untouchable, outlawed discrimination based on caste, and encouraged the state to pass measures correcting its effects. With that, the bare bones of affirmative action  the reservations, or quota, system  were in place.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Ambedkar believed that within a decade or two quotas would bring about the annihilation of caste and become unnecessary. But this was not to be. In the late 1970s the government set up the Mandal Commission to study which other groups, even if not among the lowest castes, might also be suffering from social, economic or educational deprivation. By the early 1990s, India had begun to expand reservations to include the so-called Other Backward Classes.

But today it is clear that even the Mandal reforms have failed to bring about Ambedkars dream of a genuinely equal society. Caste, instead of withering away as Indian democracy matures, has asserted itself in new ways.

Mr. Vemula viscerally understood this unhappy truth. Since August 2015, he had faced the hostility of university authorities for being politically engaged and unusually articulate. In just one semester, he had lost his hostel accommodation, his monthly stipend and access to the classroom.

For several nights leading up to his suicide, during the coldest stretch of the winter, he had camped on mattresses and blankets set outside the hostels gates. A few other students were with him, and they wryly referred to their makeshift arrangement as a Dalit ghetto.

Mr. Vemulas fault was not simply being a Dalit. He was also a leader in the Ambedkar Students Association, which actively campaigned to educate, agitate and organize students, following a rousing slogan from Ambedkar. The groups members discussed not only Dalit issues, but also other controversial matters: the death penalty; Kashmirs problematic relationship with the Indian union; communal violence against minorities, especially Muslims, in what is an officially secular nation.

Worse perhaps, Mr. Vemula had gained admission to the University of Hyderabad in the general, nonreserved category  meaning that his trajectory had not followed the standard script of marginality and exclusion. Politically aware and assertive youth like him face the brunt of double discrimination: Not only are they Dalit, but they refuse the victimhood expected of them.

Contrast that with groups that traditionally have been better off but increasingly are calling themselves victims in order to claim special protection. Castes like Jats in Haryana, Patidars in Gujarat, Marathas in Maharashtra and Kapus in Andhra Pradesh have been agitating recently, asking to benefit from reservations, even though they often are wealthy or own land.

India started opening up its economy at the same time that the Mandal recommendations were being debated. By the mid-2000s, overall prosperity increased, lifting many poor people into the middle class. But liberalization, along with urbanization, also created unforeseen types of inequality.

The so-called dominant castes agitating for reservations fall between two stools: the old model of social justice, meant principally for the weakest of the weak, and the gains brought on by the free market. The sociologist Satish Deshpande refers to them as the backward forwards.

My birth is my fatal accident, Mr. Vemula wrote in his suicide note. But his birth as a citizen of democratic India should have been a guarantee of dignity, opportunity and respect. He also wrote that he blamed no one. Yet there are culprits: his fellow Indians who have embraced democracy without understanding that its first principle is equality for all.",[]

PARIS  A skirt lifted above her ankle. A beauty mark painted on her cheek. A direct gaze. Sitting alone over a drink in a cafe.









These were some of the clues that a woman in 19th-century Paris might not be a person of standing but just might be a streetwalker.

Ambiguity about prostitutes in the public space is a central theme of Splendor and Misery: Images of Prostitution 1850-1910, which opens on Tuesday and runs through Jan. 17 at the Musee dOrsay here. Taking its title from Honore de Balzacs mid-19th-century Comedie Humaine novel The Splendors and Miseries of Courtesans, it is touted by the museum as the first major exhibition on the artistic representation of prostitution in Paris.

Paris during this period was a city in transformation. Its population of one million in 1850 almost doubled by 1870 as men and women abandoned the countryside for this capital. Traditional social structures and codes of behavior shattered. The rise of a wealthy urban class through trade and industry meant plenty of money to spend.

In this frenzied era of commerce, prostitution  already legal and considered a necessary evil  exploded.

Every major artist and writer (male, of course) explored the subject. Over the years, it was romanticized, exposed, caricatured and eventually condemned. Prostitution became so central to the artistic imagination that the poet Charles Baudelaire wrote in his personal journal: What is art? Prostitution.

Why was prostitution such a big theme for artists? said Richard Thomson, professor of fine art at the Edinburgh College of Art and a curator of the exhibition. There was the sexual aspect, of course. But there was another reason. The city was slippery. Everything was speeding up, becoming more commercial, more ambiguous, more of a spectacle. How can we be sure this person filled a certain role and not another? Who was who? Was she or wasnt she? These questions disturbed and fascinated artists.

In this show, the museum has brought together masterpieces by artists of the day, including Edgar Degas, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Edouard Manet, Edvard Munch, Vincent van Gogh and Pablo Picasso.

The artists explored only the world of female prostitution; male prostitution was treated as a homosexual act subject to criminal prosecution. However, the exhibition includes a small number of police reports and photographs of men together in sexually suggestive poses.

To illustrate the interaction between the artists representations of the prostitutes world and its harsh reality, the show has drawn on the vast collection of police records, photographs, periodicals and pornographic material from Frances national library.

There are also objects of the trade, including jetons (tokens) paid by clients to prostitutes in lieu of cash, which went directly to the bordellos madame; brothel guides for tourists; and business cards advertising ambiguous services. (One offered hygienic massages in a setting where English was spoken.)

One room of the show is dominated by the Armchair of Love, or Chair of Voluptousness, a brocade-upholstered contraption with a seat and bronze stirrups on the top and a place to recline below, to have relations with two women at once. It was built in the late-19th-century for the Prince of Wales and future King Edward VII, who visited Paris for pleasure.

The cornerstone of prostitution in the mid-19th-century was the maison close  closed house, or bordello, a controlled legal entity where women were registered with the police and subjected to regular medical examinations.

Several bordello paintings by Toulouse-Lautrec are here, the women depicted neither as victims nor femmes fatales, but as working women. In one, a woman lifts her dress for a medical inspection; in another, a nude woman pulls a black stocking over her knee.

As more women decided to work as independent contractors, the number of brothels declined. Women working in poor-paying jobs as florists and laundresses, for example, might supplement their incomes with part-time prostitution. In the streets, in cafes and bars, at the theater or the opera, it was often difficult to tell the honest women from those who sold their bodies.

In the opening room of the exhibition, for example, hangs the 1892 painting Sur le Boulevard (La Parisienne), by Louis Valtat, of a heavily made-up woman wearing flat black tie shoes and a long black boa. She is lifting her skirt several inches to reveal her ankle, a sign that she is a prostitute.

The exhibition also explores the world of courtesans, the top of the hierarchy. These were kept women who were often showered with jewels and elegant clothing and housed in luxuriously decorated mansions. (Cash payments were considered vulgar.)

A painting of Valtesse de la Bigne, one of Pariss most celebrated courtesans, portrays her in a ruffled white dress, holding a white umbrella, a half-smile on her face. There is nothing to suggest she sells herself. In a nearby display case, however, is her walking stick and a whip with six thin metal strands that can be neatly hidden inside.

One of the exhibitions centerpieces is Manets Olympia, the painting of his muse, the 17-year-old Victorine Meurent, posing as a reclining prostitute, with a gaze of independence and defiance that shocked the art world. Among the telltale signs of the profession: the orchid in her hair and the black cat at her side.

With the advent of photography came a new medium to represent prostitution. Photographers were prohibited from working inside brothels, so they recreated these scenes in their studios. The photographers and their subjects remained anonymous; the photos were sold illegally.

Behind heavy red velvet curtains are two small rooms off limits to those under 18. In them hang pornographic photographs of heterosexual and homosexual activity and women in various sexual poses.

A number of artists focused on the suffering of prostitutes. Picasso was allowed access to the Saint-Lazare prison, where prostitutes, many with syphilis, were locked up. He painted them in shades of blue, as sad Madonnas, with elongated bodies and sculpted faces.

Most jarring in the show are 1910-1912 photographs of women whose faces and bodies have been disfigured by syphilis.

The show ends with the moralistic portrayal of prostitution by early-20th-century artists. France was by then cursed with high rates of alcoholism and syphilis, and prostitutes came to be considered disease-carrying corrupters of men.

A dozen films about prostitutes are to be shown, including Luis Bunuels 1967 Belle de Jour, in which Catherine Deneuve plays a bored bourgeois housewife who becomes a high-class prostitute.

The issue of prostitution continues to perplex the French. The exhibition coincides with a protracted debate in the French Parliament about whether a prostitutes customers should be subject to prosecution, although prostitution is, and is likely to remain, legal here. Last spring, some prostitutes protested the bill in front of the National Assembly. One sign read: Youre sleeping with us. Youre voting against us.

Prostitution still retains the scent of the romantic. Among the corporate sponsors of the Musee dOrsay exhibition is the Maison Souquet, a boutique hotel in a former bordello in Pigalle, near the Moulin Rouge nightclub. It has kept the bordello decor, and each of its rooms is named after a famous Parisian courtesan.",[]
nytimes.com,2015-12-17 00:00:00,The Curators of a Homes Brooklyn Look,['Penelope Green'],"The stoops and sidewalks of Brooklyn Heights on this November afternoon were napped with gold  drifts of maple, oak and willow leaves  appropriate dressing for the gold coast neighborhood that was the citys first historic district. Its de facto caretaker, Robert Taffera, a mild-mannered contractor from Washington State, walked the fog-slick streets and pointed out his handiwork: nearly 40 houses that have been renovated by his company.









At an immaculate brownstone midblock, with rigorously landscaped window boxes, a wine cellar and a roof deck, he slipped off his shoes and padded through the soaring period parlor and modernist kitchen that is a signature of this millenniums version of the Brooklyn townhouse.

Mr. Taffera showed how the plaster walls had been gently roughed up after new wiring had been laid in, and how rotted pine floors on a second floor had been replaced with antique planks harvested from another site and carefully gouged to match their 165-year-old mates in the hall.

Continue reading the main story NYT Living Newsletter Get lifestyle news from the Style, Travel and Food sections, from the latest trends to news you can use.

Like many Taffera clients, the lawyer and publisher who live here prize 19th-century patina (or the illusion of it) as much as the complex 21st-century systems and flourishes  elevators, central air, wine cellars  installed by Mr. Taffera and his crew.

While the houses of brownstone Brooklyn have always been romantic money pits, said Ingrid Abramovitch, author of Restoring a House in the City, and require major bucks to keep them standing and safe, much less beautify them, the current wave of Brooklyn Heights settlers are focused on more than just preservation. They consider the energy efficiencies that come from passive house technology, for example, and they have the means to go wide and deep.

Among this cohort  the anti-masters of the universe, as Tom Scheerer, the interior designer of one Taffera-renovated house on Willow Street, described a financier client who favors Birkenstocks over Oxfords (and Brooklyn over Greenwich, Conn., or Park Avenue)  there is an interest in using more house than ever before. Residents dig down to create wine cellars, and build up to fabricate roof decks. Now, as Mr. Taffera pointed out in a dizzying tour, a Taffera townhouse tends to have a view of Manhattan. Elevators are standard fare, not an easy flourish to shoehorn into a historic house.

None of this comes cheap. A Taffera renovation may require many millions of dollars, clients say, but it will come in on time and on budget, an approach that inverts the natural order of the contractor-client relationship, which can follow the path of some marriages: a delirious courtship, then a scorched-earth divorce.

I know its weird: How can you be friends with your contractor? said Joanne Witty, a longtime client and lapsed lawyer, as she called herself. Nobody finishes a job liking their contractor.

On this afternoon, Eric Taffera, Roberts younger brother, was shooting texts back and forth with Amy Larocca, fashion director of New York Magazine, who was giving him advice about preschools for his son. After the renovation of their Cobble Hill townhouse last year, she and her husband, Will Frears, a theater director, now count themselves as part of a network of Taffera-linked families.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

I think we got in under the wire, said Ms. Larocca, whose neighbors architect tried and failed to secure the Tafferas for her renovation. (Ms. Larocca ran into Robert on the street, and he promised to reconsider.)

In the last year Mr. Taffera has turned down 15 or so small projects and eight houses. Those with lots of money arent necessarily difficult, he said, and those with less arent by nature easygoing.

Money isnt what decides the job, he said. Its the relationship we can have with them.

Luke Fichthorn, an amiable financial manager with a townhouse on Willow Street (Taffera-renovated, and now on a Taffera maintenance program), said: They dont take every job. I was shocked because they turned down a friend of mine. I saw him and he was like, Your guy turned me down.

But its not like getting into kindergarten, he added, somewhat unconvincingly.

On any given weekday in the Heights, most of the passers-by seem to be Taffera employees, easily identified by their dark blue T-shirts emblazoned with a gold T (created by Michael Gericke, a partner at Pentagram Design and one of Mr. Tafferas first clients).

Mr. Taffera likes the esprit de corps that a uniform gives his crew, but is still conflicted about putting his name on a job site, as other contractors do, with a branded billboard. Theres no swearing on a Taffera job. Do it safe, do it well, be productive, have fun are Mr. Tafferas core principals, he said. Maintaining a profanity-free site is a grace note that supports them.

The eldest of six children, Mr. Taffera was raised as a Jehovahs Witness in Shelton, Wash., a town of just under 10,000. In 1983, he arrived in Brooklyn Heights to volunteer for his church, working as a painter and scaffolder on its many Heights properties.

Mr. Taffera has long since left the church (Its a fairly conservative religion, he said, though he appreciates many of its values), but in those early days, like many Witnesses, hed moonlight on weekends.

One of his first jobs was with Kathy Marshall and Brian McGorry, a banker and a lawyer, who were filled with renovation fever when they bought a house here in the late 1980s. Ms. Marshall recalled that Mr. Taffera was a bit hesitant about the scope of the job, and so her husband said, Why dont you just do one good days work?

Ms. Marshall continued: We decided wed start with demo, we all worked together, and my first memory of Robert is this skinny kid covered in brown debris. At the end of that day, my husband said, O.K., would you like to do another day?

That was nearly three decades  and three renovations for Ms. Marshall and Mr. McGorry  ago.

Robert has exquisite taste and is an incredible problem solver, Ms. Marshall said, and he ended up being our construction marriage counselor.

Ms. Marshall passed Mr. Tafferas name along to Helen Simonson, the author of the best seller Major Pettigrews Last Stand, and her husband, John Simonson, a financial regulatory consultant, who in the early 1990s bought a dilapidated early -19th-century former clapboard that had been McMansioned in 1922, as Ms. Simonson said, with a stucco facade. The Simonsons had tried and failed to renovate it themselves, and then they had hired a local contractor whose crew walked off the job one day because he had neglected to pay them.

Kathy told us, Ms. Simonson remembered, Im passing you this name, but dont tell anyone and dont use him too much. Later, I would do the same: I would size people up for whether they were worthy of being admitted to this very select club. Now, Robert has moved on to museum-quality restorations and mansion-level jobs with swimming pools on the roof, but we still have breakfast and he still doesnt forget old-time clients like me who have an emergency sewer problem.

On Grace Court Alley, amid the remnants of 81 carved pumpkins at the entrance of their carriage house (this is a family that goes big on Halloween), Sarah Steinberg, a gastroenterologist, and Peter Steinberg, a web start-up entrepreneur, hugged the brothers and recalled the scene on the day of their wedding, seven years ago, when the house was filled with Taffera crew members knocking out the punch list and Robert was installing a toilet-paper holder.

Mr. Steinberg bought the place in 2003. (It was notable, he said, for a garage that was once part of the ground floor, where Marilyn Monroe was said to have gotten drunk.) With a design by Baxt Ingui Architects, the Tafferas gutted the house to its stone shell. The rebuild was not exactly a speedy one, said Mr. Steinberg, raising an eyebrow at Eric.

Then, in early March 2008, he met Sarah on the dating website JDate; by the end of the month, they had planned a June wedding at the house, a screeching deadline for the Tafferas. The day of the ceremony, with the toilet-paper holder installed and the paint touched up, the Tafferas raced home to change. They were back at the Steinbergs in time for the festivities, which was a good thing because when a toilet overflowed, Eric was on hand to fix it.

Architects promise you the moon and stars, Ms. Witty said, but then Robert looks at the drawings and says, You cant get a steel beam into the cellar. He catches what an engineer might not, and he gets the landmark process because hes done it a million times and hes just a great guy in an environment where there are no great guys.

When the Tafferas finished the renovation of James La Force and Stephen Hendersons Chelsea loft last year, the couple were so happy with the process that they hosted a dinner party for the entire crew.

It was last year, too, that Phyllis Norton-Towers, a real estate broker who lives in a Taffera-finished house on Remsen Street, tripped while doing a walk-through and broke her ankle badly enough to put her in a wheelchair. When she came home from the hospital, a ramp had been installed over her front stoop. Mr. Taffera never mentioned it, and he still hasnt sent her a bill.

And when Ms. Marshalls husband died last year, Mr. Taffera called her immediately.

Dont worry about the house, he told her. Ill take care of everything.",[]

Throughout the country, the arts are pumping new life into the bodies and minds of the elderly.

Two summers ago, a remarkable documentary called Alive Inside showed how much music can do for the most vulnerable older Americans, especially those whose memories and personalities are dimmed by dementia.

The film opens with a 90-year-old African-American woman living in a nursing home being asked about her life growing up in the South. All she could say in response to specific questions was, Im sorry, I dont remember.

But once she was fitted with an iPod that played the music she had enjoyed in her youth, her smile grew wide and her eyes sparkled as vivid memories flooded her consciousness. She was now able to describe in detail the music and dances she had relished with her young friends.

At another nursing home, a man named George with advanced dementia refused to speak or even raise his head when asked his name. He too was outfitted with an iPod, and suddenly George came back to life, talking freely, wiggling to the music in his wheelchair and singing along with the songs he once loved.

The Music and Memory project that provided the iPods was the inspiration of a volunteer music lover named Dan Cohen, and has since spread to many nursing homes and facilities for the aged around the country. Alas, not nearly enough of them. Medicaid, which fully covers the cost of potent drugs that can turn old people into virtual zombies, has no policy that would pay for far less expensive music players. So the vast majority of nursing home residents who might benefit are deprived of this joyous experience.

Nonetheless, across the country, the arts in their myriad forms are enhancing the lives and health of older people  and not just those with dementia helping to keep many men and women out of nursing homes and living independently. With grants from organizations like the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Institute on Aging, incredibly dedicated individuals with backgrounds in the arts have established programs that utilize activities as diverse as music, dance, painting, quilting, singing, poetry writing and storytelling to add meaning, joy and a vibrant sense of well-being to the lives of older people.

Through a program called EngAGE in Southern California, 90-year-old Walter Hurlburt, who once made a living as a sign painter, now decorates rooms at the Burbank Senior Artists Colony, a retirement facility where he lives, with lovely oil paintings he creates from pictures he finds in magazines and books. Mr. Hurlburt regularly attends classes on various art forms at the residence where, he told me, Im always learning something new.

His buddy at the residence, Sally Connors, an 82-year-old former schoolteacher, surprised herself by writing and directing a screenplay that was performed by fellow residents. Then, with Dolly Brittan, 79, a former early childhood educator, they both surprised themselves by writing their life stories in rap and performing their rap memoirs on a stage for at-risk teenagers they were mentoring.

Both she and Ms. Connors said their newfound involvement with the arts has made them feel decades younger.

Tim Carpenter, the executive director of EngAGE, is now working to expand this approach to senior living in other cities, including Minneapolis, Portland, Ore., and Raleigh, N.C. His goal is to create a nationwide network of programs for seniors that keep them healthy, happy and active through lifelong learning in every conceivable art form, enabling them to live independently as long as possible.

As in Burbank, Mr. Carpenter is promoting the development of arts colonies in senior residences where residents can study and create art in all its forms and where they can see their artistic creations come to life on a stage.

Dr. Gene D. Cohen, a gerontologist at George Washington University who died in 2009, was a staunch advocate for the mental and physical benefits of creativity for the elderly. He directed the Creativity and Aging Study, a controlled study sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts at three sites, including Elders Share the Arts in Brooklyn, N.Y., that showed after only a year that the health of elders in the cultural groups stabilized or improved in contrast to a decline among those in the control groups.

In a film called Do Not Go Gently, Dr. Cohen, who founded the Creativity Discovery Corps, featured an architect who, at age 96, submitted a plan for redeveloping the World Trade Center site. Dr. Cohen pointed out that creativity challenges the mind and results in the formation of new dendrites, the brains communication channels.

At 26 different facilities in the Washington, D.C., area, 15 teaching artists work with seniors in centers where they live or visit regularly. Janine Tursini, director of Arts for the Aging in Rockville, Md., seeks to get at what best jazzes up older adults. Groups of about 20 older adults get involved in what she calls art making  music, dance, painting or storytelling.

Ms. Tursini said the N.E.A.-sponsored study showed that when older people become involved in culturally enriching programs, they experience a decline in depression, are less likely to fall and pay fewer visits to the doctor. In another study among people with Alzheimers disease, a sculpting program improved the participants mood and decreased their agitation even after the program ended.

The arts open people up, giving them new vehicles for self-expression, a chance to tell their stories, Ms. Tursini said. The programs capitalize on assets that remain, not on whats been lost.

Naomi Goldberg Haas created the Dances for a Variable Population program to get older adults dancing. People who havent moved in years, even those who can no longer stand, can participate. Young professionals and older dancers go to various sites  libraries, churches, senior centers  where elders gather and encourage them to move more.

Movement enriches the quality of their lives, Ms. Haas said. Its absolutely healing. Balance, mobility, strength  everything improves.

Social engagement, which nearly all these programs provide, has been repeatedly found in major population studies to prolong life and enhance healthy aging. Clinically, the programs have been linked to lowered blood pressure, reduced levels of stress hormones, and increased levels of the happiness hormones that are responsible for a runners high.

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Coming Home to Pot Roast,['Brett Anderson'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

MINNEAPOLIS  Pot roast was one of the first dishes the chef Gavin Kaysen learned to cook, if you can call it cooking. The recipe he used as a teenager growing up in Bloomington, Minn., a Twin Cities suburb, required no culinary training.









Id just Crock-Pot it, Mr. Kaysen said. He then mimicked the act of pouring packaged beef stock into a slow cooker and grinned.

Mr. Kaysen had just slid a more technically advanced pot roast into the oven in the open kitchen at Spoon and Stable, the restaurant he opened here in late 2014 to much anticipation. I cant wait for that gravy, he said.

Northeasterners cook Yankee pot roast. Jewish brisket and most beef daube in New Orleans are pot roast by other names. But to many who grew up in Americas heartland, pot roast tastes and smells of home.

Comprising little more than a large cut of beef (chuck roast is common), onions, root vegetables and braising liquid, pot roast has none of the meddling influence of haute cuisine.

Pot roast was a dish my mother made more Sundays than I can count, said Rick Nelson, the longtime restaurant critic and food writer at The Star Tribune, the Twin Cities largest newspaper, which gave Mr. Kaysens restaurant four stars last year. I can picture her preparing it and putting it in the oven before going to Cross of Glory Lutheran Church. I can still remember that smell.

Photo

Mr. Kaysen sums up the dish as simply meat and potatoes. Growing up, he said, It was my favorite thing to eat.

Growing up in the Twin Cities, I also developed an affection for pot roast, but hadnt given the dish much thought until Mr. Kaysen recently brought it back to my attention. Ive tested a half-dozen different recipes since our meeting late last year. The results left me convinced that pot roast is overdue for a mass reappraisal.

Pot roast shares virtues with many dishes that have enjoyed the validation of ambitious chefs. The meat is texturally similar to the tougher cuts of meat (beef short ribs, lamb and veal shanks) that chefs love to cook until the flesh falls from the bone. The vegetables hold their shape, but are somehow softer than those served mashed or pureed.

The consistency of the cooking liquid depends on the recipe. Those that dont call for flour tend to yield something like consomme, while those that do fall somewhere between beef gravy and demi-glace.

That liquid is what captures the heart of many pot roast fans. It tastes restorative, akin to the current appeal of bone broth, and is one of the reasons Mr. Kaysen likes to eat pot roast this time of year, when Midwestern hospitality boils down to the act of bringing people together when its freezing outside.

Yet he did not intend to make pot roast when he returned home after cooking all over the world, at least not for paying customers. The first drafts of the menu at Spoon and Stable featured clear nods to the region: Canadian bison, cheese curds in the creamed spinach, dill-cured salmon.

But pot roast was not in the mix because Mr. Kaysen feared that a dish commonly associated with slow cookers and bouillon cubes would hurt his bid for local acceptance.

I didnt want people to think, Oh, this New York chef comes home and only cooks what he thinks we like to eat, which is pot roast, Mr. Kaysen said. I didnt want to offend people.

Photo

A little history here to explain Mr. Kaysens anxiety: He left Minnesota for culinary school at 20. The appeal of pot roast is linked to comfort-food predictability and ease of preparation. The young Mr. Kaysen sought adventure. He got that and more working in respected restaurant kitchens in Switzerland, London and California, and later under the wing of Daniel Boulud in New York.

When Mr. Kaysen, now 36, returned to the Twin Cities in 2014, it was as one of the most impressively credentialed culinary talents ever to set down roots in his hometown. Advance expectations for Spoon and Stable were stoked by Mr. Kaysens resume, highlighted by a seven-year run as executive chef at Cafe Boulud and his success, as both contestant and coach, at the Bocuse dOr, the French cooking competition named for the legendary chef Paul Bocuse.

The very accomplishments that would seem to guarantee his success in this relatively small market also gave the native son pause. Mr. Kaysen feared that the hype surrounding his homecoming (Spoon and Stable was fully booked through its first two months before it opened) could alienate a population with a reputation for prizing modesty and recoiling from East Coast exceptionalism.

I thought people were going to be offended by the pot roast, he said, but they went crazy for it.

On a whim, Mr. Kaysen included a version of his grandmothers pot roast on Spoon and Stables pre-opening menu. It remained through much of the winter. I ate there on a visit home, shortly after the restaurants grand opening, and was as delighted by the pot roast as the locals who made it a best seller.

Spoon and Stables pot roast departed from my moms in satisfyingly upscale ways. The vegetable sides  chanterelle mushrooms, pommes puree, parsley root cooked in milk and then sauteed  owed as much to the influence of Mr. Boulud, his mentor, as that of Dorothy Kaysen, his grandmother.

I missed mashing and then eating the unfashionably soft vegetables that emerge from a home cooks pot (Mr. Kaysen said he feeds those to his staff), but the gravy was silken and redolent of rosemary; the beef spoon-tender.

Instead of chuck, the cut favored by most home cooks including Dorothy, Mr. Kaysen uses a richer-flavored shoulder cut the French call paleron and butchers here often call a flat iron roast.

Photo

Its got this really fantastic tendon that runs right in the middle of it, Mr. Kaysen said, drawing a knifes blade across the length of a raw roast. If you cook it down enough, the tendon almost turns into, like, a marrow. He beamed at the thought. At Cafe Boulud, whenever we made pot au feu, wed always use this paleron.

Considering his globe-hopping past, its not surprising that he defines Midwestern cuisine broadly. He believes his food is reflective of an increasingly diverse and urbane Midwest. It has to be, the chef suggests, given that hes a Midwesterner working collaboratively with a mostly Midwestern staff.

Before we put a new dish on the menu, Mr. Kaysen said, we ask ourselves: Is it accessible? Is it true to who we are? Is it our collective voice?

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Kaysen appears younger than he is, which, coupled with a deal-closing smile and an impulse toward self-effacement, creates the impression of someone who can charm his way into opportunities where his reach exceeds his grasp. He had already completed his first year at the New England Culinary Institute, having talked his way into an internship normally reserved for second-year students, when he realized he was getting a little ahead of himself.

I had no idea what foie gras was, he said. I didnt know beets came out of the ground and not out of a can.

After his stint working in Europe, Mr. Kaysen landed at El Bizcocho, a restaurant in San Diego, rising to executive chef after just seven months. He ultimately crossed paths with Mr. Boulud, who offered him a job as executive sous-chef at Daniel. Mr. Kaysen accepted, only to discover a better job waiting for him in New York.

I surprised him and I said, We have something else to propose to you, Mr. Boulud said. Andrew Carmellini had recently resigned his position running the kitchen at Cafe Boulud, and Mr. Boulud offered it to Mr. Kaysen. I always had trust in Gavin, Mr. Boulud said. Hes impressive. And I wanted to get him out of San Diego. I thought his talent needed to be nurtured in a bigger city.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Quality-of-life considerations influenced Mr. Kaysens decision to return home. He settled with his wife and children in a suburb with well-regarded public schools.

Photo

His presence in Minneapolis also brought fringe benefits to the city. Mr. Kaysen paved the way for the return of Christopher Nye, a fellow Minnesotan who had been working for the chef Fabio Trabocchi in Washington, and is now Spoon and Stables chef de cuisine. Mr. Boulud, Thomas Keller and Jerome Bocuse, all Spoon and Stable investors, appeared at the restaurant on opening day.

Mr. Kaysen recently announced the Synergy Series, a string of special dinners featuring top-shelf guest chefs from New York. The first seasons lineup: Michael White, Michael Anthony, April Bloomfield and Mr. Boulud.

One of Gavins greatest strengths is his Rolodex, Mr. Nelson said. Hes really well connected, and I think thats really good for the city.

His return to Minnesota could turn out to be really good for pot roast, too. The dish hasnt been widely embraced by Twin Cities restaurants (the Modern Cafe, a notable exception, closed last year), although there are signs its star is rising.

In his book The Food Lab, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt hails pot roast as superior to boeuf bourguignon. Stephen Stryjewski calls the beef daube he serves at Cochon, his Cajun-influenced restaurant in New Orleans, New Orleanss version of pot roast. Joseph Lenn, the former chef at Blackberry Farm in Walland, Tenn., braises a stewed lamb neck so reminiscent of his mothers pot roast that hes considering renaming it when he writes the menu for the restaurant he plans to open in Knoxville, Tenn., later this year.

Pot roasts position in Spoon and Stables urbane Midwestern repertoire lends the dish much deserved prestige, as does Mr. Kaysens now unconflicted love affair with it. With any luck, his efforts will incite other chefs to occasion a true pot roast renaissance.

Sometimes it just takes one place to open, or one thing to happen, for people to discover what theyve been missing, Mr. Kaysen said.

Recipes: Pot Roast | More Roasts

And to Drink ...

This recipe calls for a bottle of cabernet sauvignon for deglazing the pan. I dont hold to the old saw suggesting that one should drink the same wine used in cooking, but cabernet would be a fine choice, whether from the Medoc or greater Graves region, or a balanced but fruitier selection from California. You may also try cabernets from Washington State or South Africa, or good cabernet francs from the Loire Valley, or softer blends of merlot-and-cabernet-franc from St.-Emilion. Unrelated grapes may go even better. The tomato element suggests sangiovese, which is also an excellent accompaniment to beef. A firm Chianti Classico is one possibility. Another is a good Brunello di Montalcino or its sibling, Rosso di Montalcino, which is usually cheaper and easier to drink when young. ERIC ASIMOV",[]

nytimes.com,,Radiohead to Present New Album at 2016 Primavera Sound Festival,['Chris Payne'],"Thom Yorke performs during Pathway to Paris at Le Trianon on Dec. 4, 2015 in Paris, France.

When Primavera Sound unveiled its 2016 lineup today (Jan. 21), the announcement came with some unexpected good news.

Radiohead will not only perform, but present its forthcoming, shrouded-in-mystery ninth studio album as well. According to a Primavera press release (via Rolling Stone) the festivities will include the presentation of the new album by the British band Radiohead.""

Yup, that Radiohead.

Primavera is set for June 1-5 at the Parc del Forum in Barcelona, Spain.

Radiohead will also perform at Portugal's Nos Alive festival on July 8 and Switzerland's OpenAir St. Gallen festival, which runs between June 30 and July 3. These three recently-announced shows mark Radioheads first concerts since 2012.

Radiohead's New Company Filing Could Signal New Album

The Thom-Yorke led band has been working on the forthcoming studio album at least since Sept. 2014. So far, no title, release date, or other details have been shared. One thing we do know is that it will include a song that originated during Radiohead's Bends/OK Computer era.

Stay tuned.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"Mr. Leahy vs. Stupid, Stupid, Stupid","['Http Downesnyt', 'Lawrence Downes']","Photo

Ive never heard such a stupid, stupid, stupid thing, said Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, on Wednesday.

He was at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The witness was Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The subject was the troubling phenomenon of young children being forced to go through immigration court without lawyers.

Its the result of the influx of tens of thousands of Central American immigrants seeking asylum at the border, many of them minors traveling alone. The Obama administration has been rushing them through deportation hearings. The case loads are overwhelming, and the pro bono lawyers are few.

Mr. Leahy asked Ms. Lynch about recent remarks by an immigration judge, Jack Weil, in a deposition in a federal lawsuit, that children as young as 3 or 4 could, with patient instruction, be made to understand immigration law and represent themselves competently in deportation hearings.

Mr. Leahy made it clear what he thought of that. He hammered on the word stupid as if with a baseball bat.

Ms. Lynch was mild in reply. I share with you your puzzlement over those statements, she said. She added, We do not take the view that children can represent themselves.

She also noted that the Department of Justice isnt required do anything about the problem. The current law does not provide the right to counsel, she said.

This is true  unlike defendants in criminal cases, defendants in immigration court cannot demand lawyers at taxpayer expense. But what the Justice Department is obligated to do is different from what it should do. Mr. Leahy tried to address the distinction.

Q. D.O.J. has the authority to make sure these children have lawyers. Yet children are going before immigration hearings without counsel. Why not just have a blanket policy that they must have counsel?

A. We do certainly support that as a policy matter. We support efforts to provide counsel to  not just children but others in immigration court who dont have counsel, through pro bono representation, through nongovernmental groups, and we also support congressional efforts to strengthen the policies and laws that would enable us to have a lawyer for every individual.

It was a friendly-sounding non-answer. Mr. Leahy tried again.

Q. Why not just say, there wont be a hearing with a child unless they are represented?

A. Well, senator, I think you raise an excellent point. We may find ourselves there. I think were looking to find various ways to support that. And were looking to find various ways to get legal counsel appointed in every situation.

Q. I think its a mark against this country... I think it is a bad, bad image for a judge who would say something that stupid, that reprehensible, to be the face of the United States.



And then, having not gotten a firm commitment to a solution, the senator moved on.",[]
nytimes.com,2015-04-05 00:00:00,James Hannahams Delicious Foods,['Ted Genoways'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

When readers first meet Eddie, one of the principal characters in James Hannahams much anticipated second novel, he is struggling to steer a stolen vehicle out of Louisiana and north up Interstate 45, to where hes told his aunt and longtime protector now lives, in St. Cloud, Minn., a place whose very name sounds to him like heaven after the hell he has just endured. Eddie has no hands. How exactly he came to have them severed, a final act of desperation in a novel singularly focused on desperate acts, isnt revealed until the end. But one thing becomes brutally apparent from the start: Eddies mother, Darlene, is overtaken by drug addiction born out of grief over the early, violent death of Eddies black activist father, Nat  and her clouded judgment leads to any number of miseries for herself and her son. When she is tempted in her stupor into a van and into a contract with a company called Delicious Foods, which also gives the novel its title, she is secreted away to a camp where she is forced to work, in order to pay off the debt of her room and food and the diet of crack cocaine overseers use to keep their slave laborers subdued. The drug so utterly annihilates Darlenes autonomy that it speaks for her, narrating her portions of the novel as Scotty  a sinister, wiseass monologuist who often sounds like a cross between Katt Williams and the Devil himself.









In short, Hannaham is never lacking in ambition  and he means to tell a sweeping American tale that draws equally from Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass and The Grapes of Wrath. Unlike those classics of captivity and exploitation, however, Hannaham actively resists allowing his characters to stand in as exemplars whose stories unearth a larger system rigged against the innocent. Instead, Darlene and Nat are accidental iconoclasts, whose small-bore rebellions are often the result of naive idealism (as when Nat decides they should move to Ovis, La., in order to become civil rights activists, because the name sounded humble to him, like the sort of place where he could organize and mobilize small-town black folks). That their rash decisions often guide them into dangerous terrain is part of Hannahams mission, allowing him to explore the thorny nexus of systemic racism and the personal destruction that often hounds the hopeless. The voice of Scotty, the drug working on Darlenes brain, is never less than seductive, assuring her no one loves her the way he does.

But its important to note that the depraved exploitation at the center of Delicious Foods is based on real events. Hannaham (whose first novel was the well-received God Says No) has said he drew inspiration from the particular case of Bulls-Hit, a farm in Hastings, Fla., south of St. Augustine, in which overseers are said to have plied black workers with crack and alcohol, exactly as the book describes. But even Hannaham acknowledges the case was unusual. A vast majority of recent instances of what could be called modern slavery, especially in the American food industry, have involved Hispanic workers  and have almost all been in Florida, not Louisiana, where the book is set. (One such case, in Immokalee, is harrowingly depicted in the recent documentary Food Chains.) Thus the abuse and manipulation as depicted serve more to comment on the long history of slave labor on Southern plantations and the equally inescapable trap of indentured servitude under Jim Crow than the realities of field work in the food industry.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Nevertheless, Hannahams decision to focus on African-American characters seems to give him the freedom to fully inhabit the voice of Scotty while also achingly describing the early-life struggles that Eddie faces as the child of a dead father and drug-addicted mom. Early in the novel, for example, Darlene tells her son that his Vietnam-veteran father, who peers out from a fading photograph in his Air Force uniform, was killed by Southern racists, not the Viet Cong. Charlie didnt get your daddy, no sir. He had to come home to Jim Crow for that. The turn of phrase is striking  but it gains its deeper resonance in the way that Eddie comes to associate black birds with death. At one point, Eddie remembers scattering grackles from behind his house when he was still a boy. In his fantasy, Hannaham writes, Eddie knew that if he could only clear all the birds from the backyard, his father would return  not the stiff, fading image, but the real, lanky man whose crossed leg he would ride like a horse into that unhad future. Much later, when Eddie finally finds his mother, long after her kidnapping, he chances upon her chasing a grackle. She is so focused on catching the bird that she cannot snap out of her trance, even after her half-forgotten son wraps her in his arms. Eddie clung to her waist and bellowed, Ma, Hannaham writes, while she screeched and howled in the direction of the grackle, which leapt into even higher branches, then took flight above the treetops and into the smudgy sky, its black wings flapping quickly, then slowly, then fading into nothing.

Such moments of deft lyricism are Hannahams greatest strength, and those touches of beauty and intuitive metaphor make the novels difficult subject matter much easier to bear. Delicious Foods, however, is more often messy and scattershot when it comes to more basic issues of pacing, structure and, sometimes, simple narrative detail. When we finally witness the scene in which Eddies hands are severed, for example, Hannaham cant seem to decide whether to play it for dark comedy or gothic horror  and the uncertainty makes what should be the books most gripping scene into something that is painstakingly described yet nearly impossible to picture. In the end, the novels finest moments are not in its grander ambitions, but rather in the singular way that Hannaham can make the commonplace spring to life with nothing more than astute observation and precise language.

This poses a fascinating quandary for Hannaham as a writer with many novels yet ahead of him. Does he work to hone his skills as a social realist and commentator on larger issues of contemporary concern by better mapping out their connections to history? Or does he tighten his focus into the lives of people whose circumstances may be less obviously dramatic but whose worlds become large by way of Hannahams considerable gifts? Either path promises to make Hannaham a writer of major importance, and Delicious Foods is a notable and engaging step along that road. But I, for one, hope that Hannaham will not rest on the laurels that are almost certainly coming his way. If he can resist that temptation, his next book, whatever it turns out to be, will be not only eagerly anticipated but also long remembered.",[]

Many people take a daily low-dose aspirin to lower the risk of heart disease, and several studies have shown that regular aspirin use reduces the risk for some cancers. Now a long-term analysis has found that its population-wide benefits against cancer may be even greater than previously believed.

Researchers studied aspirin use in 135,965 health care professionals, men and women, tracking their health for as long as 32 years. Over the course of the study, published in JAMA Oncology, there were 27,985 cases of cancer.

Regular aspirin use reduced the risk for all cancers by about 3 percent, though it had no impact on the risk for breast, lung or prostate cancer.

But regular aspirin use reduced the risk for all gastrointestinal cancers by 15 percent, and for cancers of the colon and rectum by 19 percent.

The senior author, Dr. Andrew T. Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard, pointed out that even people who undergo regular colorectal screening can develop cancers, and aspirin could help prevent some of those cancers as well.

Based on our estimates, Dr. Chan said, we think that regular aspirin use could prevent almost 30,000 cases of gastrointestinal cancers a year, which account for almost 25 percent of all cancer deaths. So I think thats pretty substantial.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-02-29 00:00:00,"Once Upon a Greek Island, Migrants and Tourists",['Rena Silverman'],"Its hard to imagine enjoying a holiday getaway in an area rife with suffering. But it happens all the time, and not just in the developing world where verdant, gated resorts exist not far from impoverished shantytowns. Consider the Greek island of Lesbos, where sunbathers laze by azure waters while not too far away boats arrive daily full of families fleeing violence in Syria and other hot spots.

Marieke van der Velden and her partner, Philip Brink, decided to bring together these two disparate groups  tourists and migrants  in The Island of All Together. Conceived in May, carried out in August and completed in December of last year, the project includes portraits, a documentary short and an interactive website. But the central interaction is the encounter between two people whose paths crossed unexpectedly.

Lesbos is an interesting place because there are tourists and refugees coming to the island and they are both there for a week or two, Mr. Brink said. So thats how we came up with the idea to ask refugees and tourists to sit down and talk to each other and make a film out of it.

Last summer, a few months after United Nations officials expressed concern about the record number of migrants arriving on Lesbos, Ms. van der Velden and Mr. Brink traveled from their home in Amsterdam to the island, where they found tourists at their hotel and migrants at a parking lot where many were waiting for the next bus to register for transit to Athens.

We knew that people had to wait there for hours, Ms. van der Velden said. We didnt ask them when they were coming off the boats.

Photo

Ms. van der Velden and Mr. Brink paired up migrants and tourists for interviews in spots throughout the island. They handed out cards with questions for participants to ask each other, although in the end some questions came naturally. Each participant spoke in his or her native language  usually Dutch, English or Arabic  and used a headset for translations, often made by a Lebanese member of the film crew.

Selma Pabst, a 24-year-old German medical student visiting Lesbos with her sister and mother, was paired with Husam (Ms. van der Velden and Mr. Brink did not feel comfortable revealing any last names of migrants). He was a 26-year-old lawyer from Damascus en route to Germany. Hours before they met, Husam and some 50 other migrants had been packed in a black rubber boat intended for only 30 passengers.

What was your life like five years ago? was among the first questions they posed to each other.

Five years ago I had dreams and ambitions, Husam told Ms. Pabst. I had already started realizing them and I had achieved my goals. But the situation changed and there was nothing more for me to do. Everything in my life stopped.

When Ms. Pabst asked him to name those dreams and ambitions, he told her that when the war in Syria started (around five years ago), he had just graduated from law school. I wanted to work as an attorney, he said. The war put an end to that.

The trip was relatively safe, because I was nearly killed three times in Syria.  Mohamad

Mohamad, a Kurdish, 50-year-old former restaurant manager from Aleppo who spent two years in Turkey before arriving on the island, was paired with Jan Winkel, 56, from the Netherlands. Mr. Winkel often looked surprised by Mohamads candor.

The trip was relatively safe, because I was nearly killed three times in Syria, Mohamad said, adding that his wife and son were still in Turkey and his daughter in Syria.

Its hard to hear this story from you, Mr. Winkel replied. Then you think everything is torn up and we are here with the entire family.

Then there were the two little boys, one from Damascus, the other from a Channel Island between England and France. They sat on swings, discussing soccer players. My favorite player is Cristiano, the 11-year-old Syrian boy, Alaa, said referring to Cristiano Ronaldo. Finn, the other boy, who is 9, agreed. Hes good.

At the end of each session, Ms. van der Velden took portraits of the pairs, which she let them stage. Mr. Brink and Ms. van der Velden also asked participants to take selfies with their partners, an idea that originated because they were trying to come up with a creative ending for the film.

At the end of the conversation, Mr. Brink said, people come close to each other to take the picture, so its really kind of an intimate moment.

(*If youre writing about race and gender inequality.)

The data comes in like clockwork, at least a few studies every year: Hollywood has an enduring problem hiring women and people of color, both in front of and behind the camera.

But when I set out, last fall, to get the personal, firsthand stories behind those numbers  as part of an expansive project on diversity and representation  I was nervous. I didnt know if anyone would come forward to talk about such a sensitive subject, least of all stars or filmmakers whose livelihoods depend on maintaining smooth relationships with the industrys executives and gatekeepers. (Its hard enough to get celebrities to go off their talking points when theyre promoting a film; how many times have we heard that their latest cast and crew were  really, truly  the best theyve ever worked with?)

I wasnt even sure that there would be specific moments that revealed, starkly, what it felt like to be the lone female voice or person of color in a room  or a gay, a trans, or other underrepresented artist, fighting merely to be seen.

Man, was I wrong.

Certainly, not everyone I approached for the project wanted to take part. A few agreed and then backed off, skittish or weary of being mouthpieces for the larger problems of their field. But once some prominent people began talking, it was as if the gates were breached. People werent just coming to the table, they were crowding it, eagerly. That openness is new.

And, dishearteningly, everyone seemed to have a story. I barely had to get my question out before my subjects were nodding in understanding, ready to offer up their accounts. I was worried that nobody would want to talk; instead, they didnt want to stop. Ive got so much to say! the actor Wendell Pierce told me, as our conversation stretched long past its allotted time. Almost all of them did.

It felt personal right away. Many people began by talking about their childhoods, their parents or how they were raised  an indication, to me, of how deeply representation matters. Even for people whose job it is to play someone else, these questions cut to the heart of their own identity.

Several people were jolted by long-buried memories; one said that talking about this was like therapy. There were tears. It was intense for me, as well. I thought that I was already pretty cynical about the flaws of Hollywood, having spent five years covering the awards season and all the politicking that goes into the Oscar race, and many more years writing about and observing the business. And I didnt know the half of it.

I started the project months before #OscarsSoWhite erupted again, and eventually we decided to run it around the time of the Oscars broadcast, since it seemed to dovetail with reader interest in that topic. Because we thought of it as akin to a massive oral history, our photo editor and designers had already been working on how to make it visually accessible, especially online and on mobile. They were, crucially, involved from the get-go.

So when I returned from several reporting trips to Los Angeles and elsewhere this winter, with more than 30 hours of interviews, my editors were standing by to help carve out the story. Three of them joined me in reading through the pages and pages of transcripts. (Thankfully, I had some transcription help.) Patterns emerged quickly: how overtrained many of these people were for the menial roles that were available to them  that clinging sense that they always had to be more prepared than everyone else. And how often they had to learn to navigate these obstacles in the most neutral way possible, both for their professional survival and for their sanity. Also, sadly and predictably, only the women ever talked about negotiating family and career; I never brought it up with anybody, but they volunteered those stories.

Gratifyingly, there were also mentors and doors opening. My favorite comment might have come from Jimmy Smits, who felt permission to aspire when he saw other artists of color perform.

Its been two weeks since the story was published, and the responses are still rolling in. Ive received hundreds of emails from others whove been in similar circumstances, in the entertainment industry and beyond. Hollywood is a rarefied world, but these experiences are all too common. Now, at least, were emboldened to talk about them.",[]
nytimes.com,2014-11-13 00:00:00,Preparation for the Next Life by Atticus Lish,['Dwight Garner'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Atticus Lishs first novel, Preparation for the Next Life, is unlike any American fiction Ive read recently in its intricate comprehension of, and deep feeling for, life at the margins.









This is an intense book with a low, flyspecked center of gravity. Its about blinkered lives, scummy apartments, dismal food, bad options. At its knotty core, amazingly, is perhaps the finest and most unsentimental love story of the new decade. Its one that builds slowly in intensity, like a shaft of sunlight into an anthracite mine.

One of this novels two central characters is Zou Lei, who works in the kitchen of a forgettable Chinese restaurant in Flushing, Queens. Shes an ethnic Uighur from northwest China, and the other workers dont understand her language. She finds a blackened mattress in an overcrowded rooming house. She seems like the loneliest person alive.

Zou Lei slipped into America; she has no papers. Here are the first two paragraphs of Mr. Lishs novel, which tell a shred of her story. They also show off Mr. Lishs sentences, which are confident, loose jointed, strewn with essential detail.

She came by way of Archer, Bridgeport, Nanuet, worked off 95 in jeans and a denim jacket, carrying a plastic bag and shower shoes, a phone number, waiting beneath an underpass, the potato chips long gone, lightheaded.

They picked her up on the highway by a plain white shed, a sign for army-navy, tires in the trees. A Caravan pulled up with a Monkey King on the dash and she got in. The men took her to a Motel 8 and put her in a room with half a dozen other women from Fookien and a liter of orange soda. She listened to trucks coming in all night and the AC running.

So begins a particular kind of American story. It includes a scary stint in prison (the Patriot Act, in this novel, is a phrase of dread), and a series of dead-end jobs. Zou Lei rides the subway selling bootleg DVDs, which she fans out. She looks at the other riders and says: Deeweedee, deeweedee. Hello, deeweedee.

The other central character in Preparation for the Next Life is Skinner, an injured, tattooed, depressed and mentally unbalanced veteran of three tours in Iraq. He takes a basement apartment in Queens, with fitness magazines, pornography and pizza boxes spread around his bed.

Theres been a surfeit of wounded warriors in recent American fiction, and his arrival worried me; these men can, in lesser hands, be stock characters. Not here. The encrusted detail in Mr. Lishs prose flicks the switch on in every sentence. Here is Skinner approaching his new apartment for the first time:

Photo

One of the houses had its postage-stamp yard filled with statues and figurines  of elves, wise men, the crucifixion, leprechauns, animals, plastic flowers, a sleigh, a whirligig that spun in the wind. There were wind chimes on the porch and an American flag bumper sticker for 9/11 on the house. This was where he was going.

Skinner and Zou Lei  he calls her Zooey  dont meet cute. He bumps into her while looking for an erotic massage. They bond in part over their shared love of working out, intense sessions that are like purification rituals, sessions that are almost the only thing that makes sense to them. They become one more unlikely couple in Flushing, going home to open a Styrofoam shell in the dark, eat something hot together.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Skinner is a decent man who does bad things. He doesnt trust himself. He sometimes treats Zou Lei badly. This is a love story with a lot of ache in it. He tells her to shut up and, Mr. Lish writes, this pulled the power cord right out of her. She accuses him of thinking she is some garbage person, just another piece of unwanted human biology.

Mr. Lish has taught English in Central Asia, and he works as a Chinese-English translator of technical material. Hes a former Marine who, according to his biography, has held a long series of blue-collar jobs.

I dont doubt his resume: This book is thick with the kind of sub-countertop-level detail that cant be faked. He also arrives with a literary pedigree. His father is Gordon Lish, the writer and influential editor, most famously of Raymond Carver.

Atticus Lish has written a necessary novel, one with echoes of early Ken Kesey, of William T. Vollmanns best writing and of Thom Joness pulverizing short stories.

His writing about Queens is superb. The graffiti-covered steel gates on businesses at night resembled a thousand tattooed eyelids. Flushing is where you see a hard glint in peoples eyes, the knowing look of someone who wasnt going to be fooled again.

Hes just as good on Skinners memories of war. The explosion leaped out of the road and rose like batwings. In the following vehicle, Skinners ears popped and cut off like overloaded speakers.

Neither Zou Lei nor Skinner is particularly religious. Yet she is a Muslim, and Preparation for the Next Life takes its name from a saying on the doorway of a mosque she enters at one point. This novel helps one understand the appeal of ready-made answers to lifes vexations.

Zou Lei is optimistic, in the face of the odds, about where life is dragging her. After all, things are worse back in China. She is a fierce patriot of a sort. She thinks to herself: The N.Y.P.D. would not stop her. If they scanned her, they would see an American flag under the scan.

The N.Y.P.D., as it happens, may be the least of her concerns. The final chapters of this indelible book pulled my heart up under my ears.",[]

MONDAY PUZZLE  The main challenge I faced while solving this nicely symmetrical Monday puzzle was swallowing the emotions that surfaced, a tasty mix of fondness and revulsion for the cute little decade sandwiched between the Awesome 80s and the terrifying era we live in now. Im Generation X, though. Eating our feelings is one of our specialties.

The four clues to 90s phenomena were clear enough for me, therefore, although I wonder if that was the case for everyone. As the puzzles center readily admits, these are 90SFADS  for anyone unconcerned with the zeitgeist of that slice of time, solving could have been a challenge.

One wonders if THE RACHEL, for example, will really stand the test of time, and although THE MACARENA is probably an earworm for many of us, does anyone wonder what really happened to Los Del Rio? TAMAGOTCHI is a portmanteau that means absolutely nothing in English but is pretty fun to say out loud, so maybe the word will last longer than the demanding little trinkets it refers to ever did.

DRMARTENS are classic, however, and will be with us until the end of time. Even post-apocalyptic zombies wear Docs.

As a funny twist to this nostalgia trip, this is the first time that any of these definitions appeared in a New York Times puzzle. Itll be interesting to see if any of them come back and when.

Some other nice related touches by the constructor were references to earlier pop culture phenomena  the SAYHEY kid is a moniker that supposedly dates back to the early 50s, and WHAMO is older (although the Frisbee will turn 60 next year). I believed the SMURFS to be pure 80s, weakly reprised this decade, but to my surprise the little blue characters actually began as a 1950s Belgian cartoon, so maybe the Smurfs of my memories are also a weak reprise of Les Schtroumpfs. What goes around, comes around, right?

If the Macarena is still playing in your mind, this should knock it out:

I wanted to be up-to-date on what was going on in the profession.

The judging and the conference energized her, she said. Young photographers sought her out for advice. But perhaps the biggest lesson they could have learned came from what she did in her down time.

When they asked me to be a judge for the contest, it lifted my spirits. You get to be a certain age in your profession and you think its almost time to turn the corner. This got me excited.

In January, I judged thousands of photos, and that revived me, made me hungry again and excited about what I was doing. After that, they invited me to the conference, which I wanted to attend to catch up on the latest information, gear and tricks. I really just went to enjoy the conference.

That was short-lived, because one of the kids there asked me to look at her portfolio. O.K., I did. Then she told about somebody elses. Before you knew it, I was looking at portfolios until three in the morning!

In a lot of portfolios, they were just putting stuff in there. I knew what they were doing: They were letting me know they can do this. I told them theyre in the neighborhood, but theyre not there yet. Why? Dont show me your stuff until youre ready.

That Saturday, I was in the midst of going from workshop to workshop, taking the hotel elevator, when I saw this lady with this cute little girl and boy. The lady had a fancy dress and shoes, as if she were going to a wedding.

Are you the flower girl? I asked the one child, Milan Hutchinson.

No, she told me. Im in the pageant.

Her mother, Sade Bell, told me that Milan, who is 7, was in the Miss Celebrity Spotlight Pageant and that they were going to get her hair done. I asked her, Can I follow you for a minute?

Sure, Ms. Bell replied.

You dont mind me photographing? I asked.

No, she said. I want her to get used to being photographed, I want her to get used to dealing with it and not think about it.

She was my kind of girl, so we hung out for two hours.

What really attracted me was not so much the little girl, but the whole thing. This was an outside activity that was earned: If she didnt do well in school or clean her room, she wouldnt be participating in the pageant.

Her mother got Milan an outfit a size larger, so she could use it for a while, because these dresses are very expensive. She had to pin it to make sure it fit properly. At one point Milan was fidgeting, so I decided to step back and let her mother take care of those pins. I took a little break, then came back. By then, her 4-year-old brother, Tristen, wanted some me time. You wouldnt believe the patience Milan had dealing with her brother right before the pageant.

All of this was going on, and I was so honored to be able to be there and disappear.

We all went down to the lobby for her final makeup. After that, they called her number and we went up. There was a big guy at the door who asked me Do you have a stamp? I told him Im her photographer! and walked in real fast with the mother so they wouldnt have a chance to check me. I did the best I could to get close without getting kicked out.

The weekend had energized me. It was that energy inside me that led me to make those pictures. In a spiritual way, this is my calling; this is what Im about. Im not going to ignore a moment. I might be told, No, go away. But Ill find a way to get into the next door.

If that little girl had said No, there was hotel full of them and I was going to find one. She was my calling.

As told to David Gonzalez.

For a new generation of consumers, the traditional notion of gendered fragrances is starting to go a little stale. The days when floral notes were exclusively for women and musks were solely for men are all but gone, and mass-market brands that peddle colognes and perfumes are starting to catch on.

Next month, Calvin Klein is releasing CK2, a self-described gender-free fragrance complete with a global advertising campaign that includes steamy images of epicene youths photographed by the artist Ryan McGinley. The scent is a sequel to Calvin Kleins 1994 unisex bombshell, CK One.

In September, Bond No. 9 introduced the eau de parfum B9 (which is, according to the brand, fascinatingly gender-fluid) around the same time that Aesop debuted its own unisex smell, Tacit. Lubin, one of the oldest French perfume houses, released Upper Ten this year, for men and women.

And Russell Westbrook, the Oklahoma City Thunder point guard and noted clotheshorse, recently collaborated with the Swedish company Byredo on Westbrook, a scent for either sex sold exclusively at Barneys New York.

Were definitely seeing an increase in unisex fragrances from the mass brands, said Theresa Yee, the senior beauty editor at the trend forecasting firm WGSN, who noted that niche brands have been offering them for some time.

Smaller businesses, like Le Labo and Brooklyns D.S. & Durga, have had bolder smells or unisex products on their rosters, but what was once a specialized field is now gaining widespread recognition. Ms. Yee said she saw the emphasis on versatility as part of a continuing marketing push to reach millennials by appealing to their free-spirited attitudes on gender identity.

The new scents are in keeping with gender-fluid celebrities like Miley Cyrus and Jaden Smith, not to mention the Amazon show Transparent and the film The Danish Girl. In the world of fashion, everything from Alessandro Micheles dandified vision at Gucci to the androgynous streetwear designs of Hood by Air are blurring the line between mens wear and womens wear.

Ann Gottlieb, a fragrance consultant who helped develop CK2, has another theory. I think the market became saturated with celebrity scents, and there was a yearning for a new sort of qualitative fragrance that was not fruity, floral and easy, she said. Hence, the class of more amorphous, complex smells has hit a tipping point, spilling over into the mainstream.

But the future of the gender-agnostic trend is still undecided. Its going to depend on how receptive consumers are, and also how willing retailers are to go out on a limb, Ms. Gottlieb said.

Ms. Yee said: I dont think well see things marketed to a man or a woman. With fragrances, its quite personal anyway. When choosing a fragrance, people dont think about what smells masculine or feminine. Its all about personal preference.",[]

If there was any doubt about why the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan seized the newspaper Zaman last week, consider this: Within 48 hours after the takeover, the paper began publishing pro-Erdogan propaganda.

Zaman, Turkeys largest circulation daily, was one of the countrys few opposition media outlets before the police used tear gas and water cannons on Friday to disperse a crowd outside the papers headquarters chanting, Free press cannot be silenced as it raided the offices. The police acted after a court in Istanbul, without explanation, put the paper under the administration of a panel of trustees.

Before the takeover was complete, the journalists put out a Saturday edition of the newspaper with the headline, The Constitution Is Suspended. In the end, the newspapers editor was fired and efforts were underway to eradicate the papers entire online archive, according to news reports.

The attack on Zaman is no surprise. The paper has been associated with Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who lives in exile in Pennsylvania. Mr. Gulen, once an ally of Mr. Erdogan, broke with the Turkish leader about two years ago and the media group switched from being pro-government to anti-government.

This crackdown is merely the latest of Mr. Erdogans increasingly authoritarian moves, which have included imprisoning critics, sidelining the military and reigniting war on Kurdish separatists. He now controls much of the media and has made Turkey a leader among countries that jail journalists. Along with his campaign to wipe out a free press, his governments prosecutors have opened nearly 2,000 cases against Turks in the last 18 months for insulting Mr. Erdogan, which is a crime.

Turkey was once on track to be a model Muslim democracy, though it now seems unlikely that Mr. Erdogan ever believed in democratic principles. The fact that he is moving the country ever further from that path raises serious questions about whether Turkey can continue to be a trusted member of NATO, which was founded as a security alliance based on common values.

It is unsettling that the United States and Europe have responded so meekly to Mr. Erdogans trampling of a free press. The Obama administration said the move against Zaman was troubling, while the European Union said Turkey needs to respect and promote high democratic standards and practices, including freedom of the media.

They may well be muting their criticism in hopes of persuading Turkey to help contain the refugee crisis that is roiling Europe. On Monday, Mr. Erdogan offered a harder stance, setting new demands for his cooperation, including billions more in aid and earlier membership in the European Union for Turkey.

Thats not the approach of an ally, and Mr. Erdogans turn toward authoritarianism will not strengthen Turkey, NATO or the European Union.",[]

Viewers will soon have to turn elsewhere for snarky snippets from Party Down South and Bad Girls Club.

E! announced on Wednesday that The Soup, the weekly Friday night survey of batty reality-show clips and other TV eccentricities, will end on Dec. 18. Joel McHale, who hosted the show for 12 years, will once again deliver the laughs as he hangs up his signature skinny tie for the last time, the network said in a release.

Throughout its 22 seasons, the show has used caustic mockery to highlight TVs crasser quarters, allowing viewers to remain vaguely abreast of the goings-on on The Jersey Shore or The Bachelor without actually having to watch the shows themselves. (Or admit that they do, anyway.)

The show debuted in 1991 as Talk Soup, so-named because its favorite targets in the early days were trash-talk shows like The Jerry Springer Show. Greg Kinnear, the first host, stayed on until 1995 and went on to an acclaimed acting career. Other hosts included John Henson, Hal Sparks and Aisha Tyler, until Talk Soup ended in 2002.

The show came back as The Soup in 2004 with Mr. McHale as host, and it had a new favorite target: the then-blossoming world of reality television. In its later years the show began to welcome actors, comedians and other celebrities for green-screen shenanigans. Mr. McHale stayed on even as the hosting job led to work in film and on television, most notably as the star of the sitcom Community, which ran on NBC and Yahoo.

In the weeks leading up to the Dec. 18 finale, The Soup will look back on some of its most memorable moments, the network said.",[]

In a 2004 television interview, Bill Moyers told his guest, Maurice Sendak, that hed cheated death, thanks to his sublime body of work. Most of us will live only as long as our grandchildren remember us, Mr. Moyers said. But you will never die.









I have news for you, Sendak replied. I am gonna croak.

This unblinking, unblinkered response was both typical and atypical of Sendaks attitude toward his mortality, as Katie Roiphe perceptively shows in The Violet Hour: Great Writers at the End.

Sendak had a lifelong obsession with death, which he dramatized with ferocity and vitality in his art, drawing snaggletoothed wild things and bakers who leavened their cakes with little boys; when his lover of 50 years, Eugene Glynn, died, he drew pictures of his corpse. In general, he cultivated a mordant persona and was genuinely captivated by gruesomeness. He would be happy sitting at the dinner table, Ms. Roiphe writes, watching a graphic reality-TV surgery show while eating spaghetti.

Photo

Yet in spite of his veneer of resignation, Sendak would still sometimes capitulate to anguish toward the end of his life. There was a howl, Ms. Roiphe adds, a sorrow that was not managed. Even for Sendak, king of all wild things. He died in 2012.

In his 1915 monograph, Thoughts for the Times on War and Death, Sigmund Freud wrote: In the unconscious, every one of us is convinced of his own immortality. But die we all do, and in this elegant volume of five case studies, Ms. Roiphe, the gleeful contrarian and culture critic (her more recent works include In Praise of Messy Lives and Uncommon Arrangements) has set out to show us how some of her favorite writers faced their last days. One is Freud. The others are Susan Sontag, John Updike, Dylan Thomas and Sendak. Her epilogue is a conversation with James Salter, who, though not ill at the time of their discussion, died in June.

Ms. Roiphe does not claim theres any special logic underlying her selections. She chose her subjects primarily based on love, admiration and a feral intuition, knowing they were especially sensitive or attuned to death not just in their work but in their letters, in their love affairs, in their dreams.

She scotches the traditional linear narrative for something more epigrammatic and associative  a wise choice, seeing that death turns time into a jumble and occasions all kinds of reflection and stray reminiscences. Her book becomes a nifty twofer, a meditation on how four men and one woman experienced death both in vivo, so to speak, and in their art.

Sontags story is the largest cage of paradoxes. Her very identity, in some ways, was predicated on the notion of survivorship: In 1975, she was given a diagnosis of Stage 4 breast cancer, which most doctors considered unstoppable; yet she stopped it. Vanquishing death enlivened her, helping create her self-mythology as the invincible genius who solves her disease like a math problem.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But in 2004, when doctors told Sontag she had a particularly incorrigible form of blood cancer, her sense of exceptionalism deserted her, and that upset her terribly. She submitted herself to all manner of grueling therapies. She didnt care about quality of life, Ms. Roiphe writes. She cared about life.

Nothing worked. She never fully accepted that, believing on some deep irrational level she would be the one exception to mortality. Among the many consequences of this denial was that her son could never say a proper farewell: This would mean admitting that she is dying.

And so the book spins, with each writer and thinker reacting to death in his or her own, idiosyncratic way.

Freud, ever the student of human behavior, was so intent on facing death with clarity and rationality that he refused all painkillers except aspirin for his throat cancer. Dylan Thomas, who may or may not have drunk 18 whiskeys at the White Horse Tavern in New York City before slipping into a coma, had such an operatic commitment to self-destruction that his benders could almost be read as a kind of celebration. How could someone with that much life in him die? Ms. Roiphe asks.

In the case of Updike, cancer helped him relocate his voice. His poems in Endpoint, Ms. Roiphe writes, carry the urgency of his early work, the sharpness and swiftness he was afraid he had lost: the power of having something pressing he needed to say.

Death is an excellent subject for Ms. Roiphe, who delights in exploring subjects that upset us. A psychoanalyst might say that her interest in this topic is also overdetermined: As a child, she had a pneumonia so dangerous and acute the doctors removed half of one of her lungs.

My only objection to her book is that it does not precisely deliver on what it promises: a look at writers in their last throes. Ms. Roiphe is, in her heart, a critic, with sensibilities heavily inflected by the work of Freud.

Which means these essays, at their finest, are often literary analyses. In her chapter on Updike, she explores the sexual restlessness of his characters, and how they use adultery as a defense against death. She quotes his Marry Me: He had become an athlete of the clock, bending odd hours into an unprecedented and unsuspected second life. The most poignant part of her chapter on Sendak is how he converted the ovens of the Holocaust, in which his young cousins perished, into an oven from which Mickey, naked in the night kitchen, could escape.

But the point is: Her main interest is in looking at how her subjects wrestled generally with aging and dying, not the moment of death itself.

This does not make The Violet Hour any less enveloping. I read it in bed, at the kitchen table, while walking down the street. But it does mean Ms. Roiphe seldom discusses the most obvious, physical aspect of dying: that as its happening, it can really hurt. I often think of what a friend once told me her father said in his final hours: I cant stand it.

It is so very hard to stand.

In her epilogue  her visit with James Salter  Ms. Roiphe indirectly acknowledges this oversight. He is the first to point out to her that her father, who collapsed from a heart attack in the lobby of his apartment building, must have felt pain.

This shocks me, she writes, adding, Why had I never thought of pain?

And then she explains: Because she couldnt bear to think of her father experiencing terror. Because it was easier to imagine that he made a hasty, painless exit. She suspects the panic, the knowing you are about to die is what made her write The Violet Hour in the first place. Who knows? It may even explain her guilt about phoning the friends and relations of Sendak, Updike and Sontag to discuss the most brutal days of their lives.

What normal person wants to blunder into this hushed and sacred space? she asks.

But the answer is all of us, and Ms. Roiphe does it with grace. Let the wild rumpus start.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Volkswagen Inquiry Expands to 17 Suspects,['Jack Ewing'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

FRANKFURT  German prosecutors said on Tuesday that they had expanded their investigation into the illegal manipulation of tailpipe emissions by Volkswagen, raising the number of suspects to 17, from six.









In line with German privacy rules, none of the suspects names were disclosed.

So far, no suspects are current or former members of the companys management board, said Klaus Ziehe, a spokesman for the states attorneys office in Braunschweig, a city near Volkswagen headquarters in Wolfsburg.

But Mr. Ziehe said that the investigation was continuing, and that prosecutors had not ruled out involvement by top management. We are looking at all levels, including the management board level, he said.

Mr. Ziehe declined to say what kinds of jobs the suspects held or where in the company they worked.

Volkswagen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In a second development, French prosecutors have opened a formal fraud investigation into the Volkswagen diesel cheating, following a preliminary inquiry that began in October. Nathalie Homobono, the head of the French anti-fraud authority, said at a news conference on Monday that a preliminary investigation had found that Volkswagens fraud was intentional.

In the German investigation, the increasing number of suspects, none of whom have been formally charged, raises the stakes for Volkswagen as the company takes a more aggressive stance against accusations that knowledge of the wrongdoing was widespread in the company.

In a court filing last week, Volkswagen said that, until last summer, no members of its management board were aware that software in 11 million diesel vehicles had been programmed to cheat on emissions tests. The filing portrayed the software manipulation as the work of individual employees whose activities could not be detected by outsiders.

The management board of Volkswagen had no knowledge either of the programming of the impermissible software nor of its later use in affected diesel motors, the company said in a document filed on Feb. 29 as part of its defense against lawsuits by shareholders.

The filing was not public, though Volkswagen released a summary last week. The New York Times subsequently acquired a full copy of the document, which was more than 100 pages.

The shareholders accuse Volkswagen of violating German laws requiring company managers to disclose information that could affect the share price, so the dates when top managers learned of the wrongdoing are crucial to the court case.

The illegal software recognized when a car was being tested and turned up pollution controls. At other times, the cars emitted many times the allowed amount of nitrogen oxides, which are linked to serious lung ailments and premature deaths.

In the document, filed with a civil court in Braunschweig, Volkswagen said that the software manipulation had taken place in November 2006 in departments responsible for engine electronics, diesel motor development and motor testing. The cheating occurred, the company said, because Volkswagen employees realized they could not meet emissions rules legally within the time and budget allotted.

Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board began asking questions about Volkswagen emissions in May 2014, after testing by technicians at West Virginia University revealed discrepancies between pollution levels in the lab and on the road.

According to the court filing, upper management at Volkswagen initially regarded the discrepancies as a routine technical issue and did not become aware of possible illegal activity until a year later. Even then, based on similar cases, they expected to be able to settle with regulators quietly and pay a fine in the tens of millions of dollars.

Volkswagen executives continued to believe that they had good relations with the Environmental Protection Agency until Sept. 18, according to the court filing, and they were shocked when the agency held a news conference to publicly accuse the carmaker of illegal activity. The maximum possible fine for the violation is $18 billion, though the final amount is likely to be substantially less.

It was only after the agency went public, Volkswagen said in the filing, that the management board discussed the issue as a group.

Mr. Ziehe of the Braunschweig prosecutors office said on Tuesday that investigators were looking into people who had been aware of the wrongdoing and took no action, as well as people responsible for the illegal programming.

A team of 20 investigators is working on the case, but it is not possible to say when the team would press formal charges or complete the investigation, Mr. Ziehe said.

Matthias Muller, the chief executive of Volkswagen, told workers gathered at the main factory in Wolfsburg on Tuesday that they needed to pull together to overcome the crisis.

Together, we must make the necessary changes to safeguard the future of Volkswagen, Mr. Muller said, according to excerpts from his remarks released by the company. Volkswagen is more than just a crisis.",[]

My father is one of three brothers who thrived in their respective professions, lifting themselves above the economic station of their Italian-immigrant parents. Theyre archetypal American success stories. Buoyed by their good fortune, my siblings, my cousins and I racked up athletic trophies, won scholarships, gained admission to competitive schools, built enviable careers.

So when the generations of Brunis reunite for mountains of pasta and a marathon of conversation, the talk is often like the text of one of those what-a-year-we-had holiday letters. Someone just bought and renovated a dream home. Someone else just directed a hit Broadway musical. Someone made partner. Someone finished the course work for a doctoral degree.

The goal is to catch everyone up; the impulse isnt boastful. But Ive risen from the table and walked away from these occasions feeling pressured, almost panicked: How can I be sure that I wont disappoint anyone in this crowd? What if I arrive for the next feast without shiny medals in tow?

The glory of a close family is that you never lack for cheerleaders, enveloping you in support. The flip side is that you never lack for judges, weighing you down with expectations. Ive seen this not just in my own life but in politicians Ive covered and public figures Ive admired. Like many clubs, a family has dues, and you have to figure out how to keep them from rising too high.

Every year my siblings, their spouses, their children, my life partner and I carve out an uninterrupted week to pack into a beach house somewhere. We prioritize it. We relish it: the card games, the group runs, the cocktail hour. Especially the cocktail hour.

But almost always, theres an awkward instance when a nephews or a nieces disappointing report card, abandoned sport or episode of bad behavior pops up in discussion  incidentally, accidentally. Frequently he or she sulks off, weepy and mortified. Because were the people he or she cares the most about, were the witnesses he or she cant shake off. Were the opinions that cant be ignored. Thats not our goal. But its a byproduct thats maddeningly hard to avoid.

Im more and more conscious of this. Recently, at the prodding of one of my siblings, I had a conversation with one of my nieces about working harder in school. I kept it short, studying her body language to determine the precise moment to end the admonishments. Then I switched quickly to a lighter topic, so that something other than a sense of recrimination might linger. I was careful to say, I love you, but I was just as careful to say it in a somewhat casual manner, not a pregnant, theatrical, shaming one.

Is that the way through this prickly briar patch?

The delicate ecosystem and difficult byways of family were much on my mind on the campaign trail over recent weeks, as I watched the Bushes gather around Jeb.

His stooped, 90-year-old mother, Barbara, trudged alongside him in frigid New Hampshire, making a last-ditch effort to reanimate his presidential bid. His older brother, George W., traveled from Texas to South Carolina for a special rally, where they did an offstage chest bump  perhaps a holdover from their roughhousing as kids  and then hugged.

I took in all of this and thought: What a lucky man Jeb Bush is. Surrounded by so much loyalty. Cushioned by such love.

Days later, he tearfully ended a campaign that hed never seemed entirely sure of. This time I thought: What a burdened man. Measured against daunting examples. Compelled to keep pace. His quest for the White House was a kind of parable of the blessing and the curse of a tightly knit family deeply invested in each members advancement.

Of course few broods fly at the Bushes altitude, with its privileges. But many know its tensions. And many know one of its obvious binds: How do you glue a family together strongly enough that its a dependably nurturing force without having it become an oppressive one? Have the Obamas figured that one out? Their daughters are clearly cherished, but they must also be daunted. Getting the balance of that right is a familys toughest, trickiest work.

On the athletic front, did the Mannings succeed? I bring them up because of all that chatter after the Super Bowl about Eli Mannings mien as he watched his older brother, Peyton, add another championship to his legendary career. Caught on TV, Eli had a blank  even downbeat  expression on his face.

The brothers now have two Super Bowl rings apiece. But Elis recent season with the New York Giants was a bust. Peytons with the Denver Broncos was triumphant. Peyton has always been the larger figure, casting a long shadow, and their father, Archie, was himself a distinguished pro quarterback.

Does Manning-hood entail as much obligation and torment as pride? That was no doubt the question on many viewers minds when they observed Eli during that game. And it probably struck close to home. Theyd wondered the same thing about their own families.

I actually started writing about the Bushes all the way back in 1999, when I was assigned to cover George W.s presidential campaign. I followed him almost daily for the next two years.

It was clear that family, more than anything else, had given him the confidence to pursue the highest office in the land. It was equally clear that family had made him feel compelled to do that  as proof that he was worthy, as evidence that he belonged. It informed all the decisions he made. It warped them, too, so that you couldnt be sure what was genuinely felt, what was pantomimed, what was a reaction, what was an overreaction.

I learned then about a pair of gold cuff links  a family heirloom  that the first President Bush passed down to George W. on the day of his inauguration as the governor of Texas, explaining in a heartfelt letter: Now, it is your turn. I believe those words and that jewelry were presented as comfort, not summons. How they were received is a different matter altogether.

Then I switched quickly to a lighter topic, so that something other than a sense of recrimination might linger. I was careful to say, I love you, but I was just as careful to say it in a somewhat casual manner, not a pregnant, theatrical, shaming one.

Is that the way through this prickly briar patch?

The delicate ecosystem and difficult byways of family were much on my mind on the campaign trail over recent weeks, as I watched the Bushes gather around Jeb.

His stooped, 90-year-old mother, Barbara, trudged alongside him in frigid New Hampshire, making a last-ditch effort to reanimate his presidential bid. His older brother, George W., traveled from Texas to South Carolina for a special rally, where they did an offstage chest bump  perhaps a holdover from their roughhousing as kids  and then hugged.

I took in all of this and thought: What a lucky man Jeb Bush is. Surrounded by so much loyalty. Cushioned by such love.

Days later, he tearfully ended a campaign that hed never seemed entirely sure of. This time I thought: What a burdened man. Measured against daunting examples. Compelled to keep pace. His quest for the White House was a kind of parable of the blessing and the curse of a tightly knit family deeply invested in each members advancement.

Of course few broods fly at the Bushes altitude, with its privileges. But many know its tensions. And many know one of its obvious binds: How do you glue a family together strongly enough that its a dependably nurturing force without having it become an oppressive one? Have the Obamas figured that one out? Their daughters are clearly cherished, but they must also be daunted. Getting the balance of that right is a familys toughest, trickiest work.

On the athletic front, did the Mannings succeed? I bring them up because of all that chatter after the Super Bowl about Eli Mannings mien as he watched his older brother, Peyton, add another championship to his legendary career. Caught on TV, Eli had a blank  even downbeat  expression on his face.

The brothers now have two Super Bowl rings apiece. But Elis recent season with the New York Giants was a bust. Peytons with the Denver Broncos was triumphant. Peyton has always been the larger figure, casting a long shadow, and their father, Archie, was himself a distinguished pro quarterback.

Does Manning-hood entail as much obligation and torment as pride? That was no doubt the question on many viewers minds when they observed Eli during that game. And it probably struck close to home. Theyd wondered the same thing about their own families.

I actually started writing about the Bushes all the way back in 1999, when I was assigned to cover George W.s presidential campaign. I followed him almost daily for the next two years.

It was clear that family, more than anything else, had given him the confidence to pursue the highest office in the land. It was equally clear that family had made him feel compelled to do that  as proof that he was worthy, as evidence that he belonged. It informed all the decisions he made. It warped them, too, so that you couldnt be sure what was genuinely felt, what was pantomimed, what was a reaction, what was an overreaction.

I learned then about a pair of gold cuff links  a family heirloom  that the first President Bush passed down to George W. on the day of his inauguration as the governor of Texas, explaining in a heartfelt letter: Now, it is your turn. I believe those words and that jewelry were presented as comfort, not summons. How they were received is a different matter altogether.

nytimes.com,2015-12-17 00:00:00,Love for Sale: The Shopgirl Has a Pop Cultural Moment,['Ruth La Ferla'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In the 1939 George Cukor classic, The Women, Crystal Allen is the ultimate spritzer girl. A perfume vendor by any other name, as portrayed by Joan Crawford shes a mantrap in a black sheath and pearls, as fetching a commodity as the amber-tinted potions that she sells.









Cukor cast his sales clerk in a hard-edge mold. Yet as an archetype, the shopgirl of pop culture lore persists, turning up this holiday season in a spate of films, in variations that are gentler, kinder, and less predatory than her celluloid progenitors but adventurous just the same  spirited and often chic, heroines for a modern age.

In Carol, the Todd Haynes melodrama based on a Patricia Highsmith novel, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) toils at a department store counter, solemnly conventional in a gray jumper and sweater.

I dont think she cares much about being a shop assistant at all, and she doesnt care much what she wears, said Sandy Powell, who created the films wardrobe, underpinning Thereses sad little pinafore with equally nondescript sweaters.

Photo

Ms. Maras shopgirl knows her place and seems not to give it much thought, that is, until she encounters Carol (Cate Blanchett), a blond Venus who offers her passage to a wider, more opulent world.

Carol is eye-catching all right, making her indelible entrance in a pale fur coat and saucy red hat, her look a sophisticated and tantalizing contrast to Thereses carelessly assembled schoolgirl turnout.

Small wonder Therese cant look away; its as if she had sighted a beautiful alien.

Shes in awe, Ms. Powell said. Her reaction is: Oh, my God, shes gorgeous. Who is she? Where did she come from?

As Eilis, the young Irish immigrant of Brooklyn, Saoirse Ronan is drab in her Peter Pan collars and timid to a fault. Yet she becomes a faultlessly groomed vendeuse. In a trim cardigan and crisp white shirt, she is as much at ease with her customers as she is in a fetching new wardrobe.

Then theres Lili Elbe (Eddie Redmayne), the transgender heroine of The Danish Girl, in a rustling silk suit, ruffles cascading from its collar, trading shoptalk with peers and beauty secrets with clients.

Like their earlier counterparts, the shop assistants of the current cinema share an eagerness to please, their coy smiles, gestures and dawning fashion sense accompanying transactions as emotional as they are material.

Equipped with reserves of taste and apparent good will, they offer style, expertise and friendly banter, tossing into the bargain, when it suits them, a bit of themselves.

The shopgirl-as-commodity seems an apt conceit for a consumption-driven society, with roots dating to the early 19th century, and the rise of the modern department store, a pleasure palace teeming with temptations, not least the lowly sales assistant.

Emile Zola sketched the type optimistically in Au Bonheur des Dames, his story of department store life in 1860s Paris. The tale, and a 1943 film it inspired, turns in part on the fate of Denise Baudu, the little clerk from the country, whose unassailable virtue wins the day and, with it, the heart of her department-store-magnate employer.

A flurry of Gilded Age musical comedies picked up the theme, inviting spectators to commiserate with the shopgirl (perceived in an earlier era as little better than a prostitute) and cheer her elevation as the heroine of her own compelling drama.

In those popular musicals of Londons West End, the young heroine manages against all odds to cling to her integrity as she climbs the social ladder.

Photo

A similar scenario was played out in more recent times. Mirabelle (Claire Danes), the wan glove saleswoman in the 2005 movie Shopgirl, based on the Steve Martin novel of the same name, can scarcely scrape together her rent.

Then she meets Ray Porter (Mr. Martin), the oh-so-wrong Mr. Right, who presents her with a pair of gloves she could never have afforded to buy for herself, attractively packaged with a dinner invitation. What struggling young woman could resist?

Something more is on offer in the latest films. In addition to the promise of love for sale, there is the vision of infinite perfectibility: the clerks as much as the clients.

Then as now, the sales assistant had at her disposal an arsenal of props, tools for seduction and stealthy self-improvement. They were weapons, in fact, something like those of the saucy little heroine of The Shop Girl, a musical comedy set and produced in turn-of-the-century London. Onstage, she trills about how a dear little girl makes up for men.

A touch of rouge that is, she sings, and just a touch and black in the eye, but not too much.

A similarly calculated understatement was mandated at the 20th-century department store. In the 1920s setting of The Danish Girl, sales assistants commonly wore uniforms, typically a black silk frock trimmed at the throat with a wisp of white lace. The objective, said Paco Delgado, who created that movies costumes, was to look like a maid or a well-dressed servant, but with upscale aspirations.

Photo

In the absence of a uniform, a dark suit or dress was required, Mr. Delgado said, meant to convey a hint of luxury and hold up a mirror to the customer, without overshadowing her.

Not that such store-imposed constraints mattered. The shopgirls of earlier eras, and of current films, are likely to have reveled in their newfound sense of chic. But there was an emotional payoff as well.

In Carol, Therese gets a glimpse of life thats beyond her station, her own style evolving as the courtship picks up steam.

Eilis in Brooklyn trades in her self-effacing shirtwaists for a suit, her stylish turnout reflecting a growing self-assurance.

And Lili, a model of coquettish femininity in The Danish Girl, derives her real satisfaction, and something approaching self-realization, from other facets of her job.

The department store scenes in The Danish Girl are key, said the director Tom Hooper, because they show Lili being accepted as a woman by other women.

True, she is positively aflutter in her new black silk dress and tidy bob. But what we see most of all, Mr. Hooper said, is the joy that her authentic self brings.",[]

PARIS  The French Culture Ministry announced on Wednesday that Guy Cogeval, the president of the Musee dOrsay in Paris since 2008, would be reappointed to his post  but for only one year rather than the expected three.

In a statement, the ministry praised Mr. Cogeval, who is also the head of the Musee de lOrangerie across the Seine, noting that he had helped to develop and renovate the Musee dOrsay and that recent exhibits there, like one on the artistic depiction of prostitution, had been met with repeated critical and public success.

But Mr. Cogevals governance came into question last month when half a dozen curators at the Musee dOrsay anonymously contacted the newspaper Le Monde to oppose his reappointment, arguing that he was neither physically, nor psychologically, nor scientifically able to run a museum of this stature.

Mr. Cogeval, 60, suffered a stroke in 2014. The anonymous curators said his health problems had left him unfit to manage the museum, calling his decision-making irrational and his programming extremely fluctuating.

Several high-profile curators have recently left the institutions under Mr. Cogeval, including Sylvie Patry, who left the Musee dOrsay last November to become chief curator and deputy director for collections and exhibitions at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia.

In an open letter addressed to Le Monde, Mr. Cogeval dismissed the anonymous criticism as rumors fostered by rivals vying for his job and denied the stroke had left him impaired.

Although the statement did not specify why Mr. Cogevals term would only last for only one year, the ministry said he would step down in March 2017 to head a center dedicated to the study of a movement of painters known as Les Nabis, which he specializes in.",[]

Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how daily news, features and opinion pieces come together at The New York Times.

Super Tuesday started with a map  a blank, gray map of 50 states stretching across the home page of The New York Times.

By the end of the night, 12 of those states would bloom in color  in various shades of red (Donald J. Trump), green (Bernie Sanders), blue (Hillary Clinton), purple (Marco Rubio) and yellow (Ted Cruz).

It was a way to show Times readers, in real time, how the vote was shaping up in the states that went to the polls on March 1  who was ahead, who had won, how many precincts had been counted, how many were out.

The map was a result of imagination, technology and teamwork; it was set in motion by The Timess digital graphics team and was built using real-time data feeds from The Associated Press.

Color appeared as soon as the first precincts began reporting, starting with Virginia (just after 7 p.m.) and ending with Alaska (in the early-morning hours on Wednesday).

The totals were fed by A.P. reporters, via The A.P., to The Timess infrastructure  and onto our map. And it wasnt just the state totals that readers were seeing; readers could click on individual states and see how each county voted.

States were first colored in pale stripes, but those often changed. Oklahoma, for example, went from Trump (red stripes) to Cruz (yellow stripes). When The Associated Press called a winner, the color for that state went solid.

In many of these cases, readers were being told the winner of each state about the same time our reporters and editors were getting the news. That gave our readers a real-time experience that was once available only from live reports on television.

There was a time, not too long ago, when our Super Tuesday map would have been impossible to put together and display. Even earlier in the digital era, a complete vote-totals map wouldnt have been available until every ballot was counted at the end of the night. (Not to mention that in the print-only era, no map would be available until two days after the vote, and then often only in black and white.)

As primary season continues, readers will see even more states fill with color. And if John Kasich takes a primary or state caucus, we will have to add a new one.",[]

Good morning.

Heres what you need to know:

 3 wins for Trump; Sanders takes Michigan.

Donald J. Trump solidified his lead for the Republican nomination, scoring victories in Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii. Ted Cruz took Idaho.

A focus on trade and jobs propelled Bernie Sanders to an upset in Michigan, but Mississippi strengthened Hillary Clintons Southern stronghold.

The Democrats debate tonight in Miami (9 p.m. Eastern, CNN and Univision). Mr. Trump campaigns in North Carolina; John Kasich is in Illinois; and Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz will be in Florida today.

Check out our takeaways, the full results and delegate tracker.

 Obamas plan for peace.

President Obama, who was unable to broker a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians, is weighing a plan that would preserve at least the principle of a two-state solution for the next president to pursue. It comes as an American tourist was killed in a stabbing rampage in Israel.

Separately, the president is in great health. We have highlights from his latest medical report.

 On Capitol Hill.

The Senate today again takes up a bill to fight the nationwide opiate crisis. The measure would provide hundreds of millions in funding for anti-heroin programs.

The heroin epidemic has grown largely out of a dependence on legal opioid painkillers and has spread to white, urban, suburban and rural areas. Nationwide, 125 people a day die from drug overdoses, 78 of them from heroin and painkillers.

 Missouri Senate filibuster is broken.

Republicans used a rare procedural move today to break a 39-hour filibuster by Democrats and advance a bill to give some of the nations broadest legal protections to opponents of same-sex marriage.

The bill is one of many that have been introduced in state legislatures and in Congress since the Supreme Courts ruling in June in favor of same-sex marriage.

Back Story

The mystery writer Mickey Spillane once said, Im not writing for the critics. They had dismissed his hard-boiled private-eye tales because of their sex, mayhem and violence.

Instead, he wrote for readers, and few American authors ever had more.

Photo

Spillane, born on this day in 1918, had seven of the Top 15 best-selling novels in the U.S. by 1980, with global sales of over 200 million copies.

After tiring of writing comic books, he attempted a novel: I, the Jury. It was a success when it was published in 1947, even though The Times called it a spectacularly bad book.

Spillane then wrote six novels in the next five years. He created Mike Hammer, the heroic but frequently sadistic gumshoe.

After more than two dozen volumes and appearances in several Miller Lite beer commercials, Spillane reached iconic status.

He died in 2006, but his latest work, completed by another writer, was released on Tuesday.

nytimes.com,2016-03-02 00:00:00,"Young Africans, Wrapped in Tradition",['Whitney Richardson'],"The young woman sat proudly, firmly placing her hand below her chin to profile her face. Colorful silk fabric was neatly wrapped around her chest, while the studio light and golden backdrop bathed her gently oiled skin. Small circular tribal markings were tattooed on her upper body. Her neck and wrists were adorned with layers of beaded jewelry.

Just a few hours before, she had been wearing jeans, a button-up shirt and stiletto heels.

This transformation was spurred by Joana Choumali, a photographer from Ivory Coast who has been documenting modern African women wearing their familys traditional clothing. She said these portraits allow her subjects to reconnect with their family history in a physical way.

Even if we dont speak the language or dont go to the village every day, we are still African, Ms. Choumali said. I think its time to redefine what being African is.

That motivation came from her own experiences. Ms. Choumali, 41, was born and raised in Abidjan  Ivory Coasts economic capital and West Africas most populous French-speaking city. She attended international schools and was surrounded by students from all over the world.

But at least once a year, her family would travel to Adaou, a small town in the southeast, to visit her paternal grandmother, Ettien Amalan Louise. The visits were brief, and Ms. Choumali often felt a cultural disconnect with her grandmother: They didnt speak the same language or have relatable life experiences. Ms. Choumali eventually got a top-level job at an ad agency, while her grandmother spent her life in the village working as a farmer and a trader.

When her grandmother died in 2001, Ms. Choumali realized how much of her family history would be lost because she had not been able to talk with her about her life.

I felt like a part of me was going and part of my family was fading away, she said. For a long time, I felt guilty. I thought, I dont speak the language, maybe Im not that African.

Photo

In her portrait series, Resilients, which was recently featured at the Photolux Festival in Lucca, Italy, sponsored by the African Artist Foundation, Ms. Choumali sought to document young, professional African women  mostly Ivorian  who also struggled with the lingering guilt of not being able to relate to their familys traditional past. Over the course of several months, each portrait session required intense research on the specific details of how the clothes, jewelry, skin and hair needed to be styled based on the specific tribe the family was from.

She initially found most of her subjects  lawyers, students, doctors and managers  on the streets of Abidjan. Her sole requirement for the portrait was that the women had to wear traditional clothing already worn by their grandmother or an older female relative. This was intended to emphasize the link between past and present, and also the cultural heritage, Ms. Choumali said. Inspired by the golden hues of Rembrandts paintings, she handmade a backdrop to give the portraits a feeling of time travel, she said.

Ms. Choumalis interest in portrait photography began when she was 13; like many West African families, her parents hired a professional photographer to do a traditional family portrait at home. That same year, she received a camera for Christmas and said she had since been exploring how photography can address social issues. After quitting her job as an art director in an advertising agency, she became a full-time freelance photographer and has created her own studio in Abidjan.

Over the course of her Resilient series, women began reaching out to her to participate. Of her more than 30 subjects, a student studying in France came to her studio with her mother wearing a miniskirt and Converse sneakers. They had descended from the royal family of Grand Bassam, a city that was briefly the French colonial capital in the late 19th century. She had asked the king of Grand Bassam if she could wear her great-grandmothers outfit for the portrait session (image above).

The mother was so emotional, Ms. Choumali said. We dont even know why we cried, but the energy was really special. I feel that they were feeling the same feeling as I felt  relieved and kind of reassured that they were also part of their culture.

nytimes.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,The Decorous Demise of the Establishment,['Mark Leibovich'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

We have a multicar pileup on Establishment Lane, with fatalities reported. The most mangled vehicle belongs to the defunct presidential campaign of John Ellis (Jeb) Bush.









The last time I saw Jeb before the crash, he was speaking at a town-hall meeting in Iowa and seemed to be bracing for something bad. I am part of the establishment, the former Florida governor said in a solemn tone, as though he were beginning a eulogy.

By the fine manners of the crowd, you gathered that they, too, were establishment-bred. People raised their hands and stood in line and waited for the microphone to be brought over. Everything was calm and orderly, as it was back when Republican presidential campaigns always ran through Establishment Lane.

Well save lanes for another day (or better yet, close them all) and focus here on the wounded establishment. What is the establishment other than one of those bloviation-chamber words that political types toss around to describe something that might not actually exist in the real world? No one really agrees, except that to be part of the establishment is most certainly a bad look in todays politics. It represents a catchall designation for people in charge  and implies that theyve been ensconced too long. The establishment is tired and musty and too comfortable. Yet it is still invoked constantly as a phantom solution: The establishment will step in and bring order to this chaos. They are the parents that will arrive home just as the party has grown out of control, the house is being trashed and the cops are taking names.

In the politics of 2016, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are the party crashers. Jeb and Hillary Clinton are the fuddy-duddy neighborhood-association types, and no shortage of contempt is reserved for them. I think the people of Iowa have sent a very profound message to the political establishment, to the economic establishment and, by the way, to the media establishment, Sanders said in his victory speech after finishing in a virtual tie with Clinton. It is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. That was five disparagements of the establishment from Sanders in two sentences.

Bill Clinton betrayed the telltale exasperation that has become characteristic among stalwarts of the establishment when asked about Sanderss health care plan. Every time we try to have a debate on this, they say, You dont understand,  Clinton said.  Were creating a revolution. Youre getting in the way. Youre part of the establishment. 

The establishment used to be a safe space. It represented an established or stable condition, according to one of many Oxford English Dictionary definitions. Membership suggested a secure position in the pecking order of American life. You were a made man or (less likely) woman and were assured a swaddling of fund-raising, endorsements and support from the select committee of the club.

In return, establishment candidates adhered to certain codes of behavior. They would be gentlemanly and magnanimous in victory or defeat and would write thank-you notes by hand on monogrammed stationery when it was all over. They would wait their turn to run for president and not threaten to run third-party. They would not pursue a floor fight at the national convention or pick a running mate who threw around expressions like going rogue. The establishment does not do rogue (the G.O.P. tried that once with Sarah Palin, and it proved not prudent).

Subcommittees abound within the establishment. They include the national-security, Wall Street, academic, legal and economic establishments. They all mean the same thing, essentially: a ruling class, mythical in some cases, but always believed to be powerful. The news media has its own establishment, of course, which works in lock step with the other establishments to perpetuate their myths and nourish the same tropes, cliches and circular logics that define establishment consensus (or conventional wisdom). Traditional journalists are only part of the media establishment. It also includes Internet personalities, campaign media advisers and Democratic and Republican strategists who pollute our cable news.

The various establishments have no borders. No one is proposing that anyone build a big, beautiful wall between any of them. A titan of the business establishment  Trump, say  can migrate freely to the media establishment and then maybe one day come to dominate the political establishment (as of now, hes still confined to Anti-Establishment Lane).

Most of all, the establishment makes for a potent straw man in the hands of people who otherwise might not know precisely what theyre fighting, only that theyre angry and frustrated. The media establishment loves angry and frustrated as a safe couplet of graveyard words to stand in for more precise and judgmental notions  like maybe nativist or gullible. A strong majority of Trump supporters in South Carolina, for instance, believe that President Obama is a Muslim, which could potentially shed much light on the mind-set behind a lot of Trumps support. And according to a recent Public Policy Polling survey, a good portion of Floridians  about 40 percent  thinks it is possible that Ted Cruz is the Zodiac killer. Yet the media establishment is always careful to lump everyone together as the angry and frustrated electorate. To be more specific would jeopardize the solemn commitment to fairness that the media establishment must always strive for.

It has always been politically expedient to fight the establishment. Insurgent conservatives like Barry Goldwater in the mid-20th century used to rail against the Eastern establishment, which implied an elitist, Ivy League and (implicitly) hail-fellow style. Goldwater was anti-establishment in the early 60s, as was Ronald Reagan. They built robust followings. Goldwater wound up winning the Republican presidential nomination in 1964, and Reagan ascended to the presidency in 1980, injecting their brands of conservatism into the core of the Republican establishment.

Likewise, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both ran for president as Washington outsiders, which suggested anti-establishment credibility. But living in the White House carries with it a lifetime membership in the establishment, with little opportunity for escape.

Recent conditions have fostered a particularly lethal stigma against their breed. Grass-roots movements like the Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street and social media (mainly Twitter and Facebook) have energized resistance to the vague establishment. Super PACs have placed huge amounts of political money into the hands of people far removed from the party operatives who used to control the coffers.

And of course, in 2015, a sui generis big bang came along to blow up the existing establishment with stunning efficiency  Donald Trump. Even now, nine months into the phenomenon, no one fully grasps what his rise really means, only that it might actually be transformative and (gasp) lasting and that the establishment, if not dead, really might be changed forever. It is hard to imagine future generations of candidates returning to the same establishment style embodied by Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush or going back to the same well of on-message orthodoxy. They wont spend tens of millions on ads, enriching the same cast of consultants and operatives.

When the casualties of these anti-establishment days are tallied and the saga is explained, there will be many cautionary tales. Once again, Jeb is the early front-runner. His demise was swift and tidy. He wound up finishing in sixth place in Iowa and fourth in New Hampshire and South Carolina before quitting.

Still, the political-media wiseguys and gals remain obsessed with which Republican candidate will inherit the establishment. Around whom will they coalesce? (Everyone keeps using the word coalesce  immediate moratorium on coalesce!) Clearly, its Marco Rubio, the young Florida senator who was elected in 2010 as a first darling of the Tea Party. There is a certain symmetry to his inheritance: The outsider becomes the establishment, for whatever thats worth now.

I was traveling with Rubio in Nevada on the eve of that states Republican caucuses last month. His campaign kept pushing out news of his latest establishment endorsement. They were collecting them like snow globes  Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, former Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Representative Peter King of New York, Bob Dole. Rubio seemed almost giddy about the Marcomentum he was feeling.

Weve had a great day today, he said in an impromptu meeting with reporters on his campaign plane. Weve had a lot of people come onboard and support us today  the governor of Arkansas, a number of senators and congressmen and local officials, a lot of people who were committed to Jeb. Thats what establishment love has been reduced to: a nice consolation prize and lovely parting gift. Trump won Nevada handily the next day. Rubio left Vegas with the love and blessing of Orrin Hatch.",[]

Neil Patrick Harris is collaborating with the producers behind the immersive theater spectacle Queen of the Night on a new, magic-themed nightlife project.

One of those producers, Randy Weiner  whose production credits also include Sleep No More and Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812  said in an interview that the currently untitled project with Mr. Harriss Prediction Productions was in the works, with an opening aimed for the fall. (Mr. Harris will not be performing in the show.)

Mr. Harris has performed magic at a variety of venues, including the Magic Castle in Los Angeles, where he served as president of the board. Mr. Weiner said the collaboration had come about casually. Mr. Harris wanted to work with him on an immersive theater project, he said, and Mr. Weiner reached out when he decided on a magic theme for his next one.

Details are scant but Mr. Weiner did say that the production, which has no opening date, would involve totally transforming 311 West 57th Street  which his company, Variety Worldwide, is to lease when the event space Providence leaves it this year. The site is the former home of the nightclub Le Bar Bat.

Magic is at the core of this venue for the production, Mr. Weiner said, adding that the space would be made to look like a mansion and that there would be dance, variety acts and one-on-one interactions. As with Queen of the Night, there will be a meal, which he said would be an unexpected culinary experience.

Mr. Weiner said he was in the final stages of securing collaborators for set design, choreography and cuisine. Workshops for the production are scheduled to begin this summer.",[]

Ah, the adolescent male appetite. Those always hungry growing boys who eat standing up, drain the quart containers of milk or juice, and are fully capable of finishing off as an after-school snack the whole lasagna or pot of stew or cold roast beef that was supposed to serve as dinner for the family. I have come home to this myself: the teenager who greets his parents in the evening with an empty refrigerator, a sink full of dirty dishes, and the hopeful question, Whats for dinner?

In January, when the recently revised Dietary Guidelines for Americans came out, adolescent boys were specifically mentioned in a slightly unexpected context: Some individuals, especially teen boys and adult men, also need to reduce overall intake of protein foods by decreasing intakes of meats, poultry and eggs, and increasing amounts of vegetables or other underconsumed food groups.

Are teenage boys eating too much protein? What do we actually know about the dietary habits of adolescent males, beyond the sitcom jokes?

Dr. Elsie Taveras, the chief of general pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, is an expert on childhood obesity. The forces that are working against good diet quality in adolescent boys, she told me, begin with that famous appetite. Theyre always hungry, and that hunger, and a lack of satiety with small portions, leads to impulsive eating and eating large portions. And the foods they are choosing arent really keeping them full, since foods with high fiber levels are the kinds of foods which do keep people full.

The dietary guidelines include graphs of what people in different age groups eat, drawing on data from the large National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and showing, for each food group and at each age, how those amounts compare with the recommended daily intake. No one will be surprised to hear that when it comes to vegetables, both males and females of all ages eat significantly less than what is recommended.

For protein, the graphs look very different. For males, intake rises steadily from the 9- to 13-year-old category up through 31- to 50-year-olds, so that by the time they reach late adolescence and young adulthood, males report eating significantly more protein than recommended. Females, on the other hand, report eating quantities at the bottom of the daily standards, and 14- to 18-year-old girls say theyre eating less protein than recommended.

Theres so little research focused just on boys, said Alison Field, an obesity and eating disorders expert who is the chairwoman of epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health. We know that at puberty, boys will acquire more muscle mass, and females will end up with more fat mass, she said. When males go through their growth spurt, which is longer than females, their appetite is tremendous.

These hungry fellows have big appetites, and as a group, they dont tend to fill up on salad. So the primary dietary advice for them is probably eat more vegetables, and the hope is that would mean less meat. What this recommendation really says is that teen boys should be eating more of their calories from vegetables but less from meat to better balance their nutrient intake, Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University wrote in an email.

We know as much as we do about the dietary habits of teenage girls because there has been so much concern about obesity and also eating disorders. Many, if not most, adolescent girls are trying to lose weight whether they need to or not. Eating disorders are less common in males, but adolescent boys, on the other hand, are often preoccupied with building muscle, particularly if they are athletes in a sport like football, where size matters. Males may want to bulk up, may want to be big, Dr. Field said.

We really underestimate how important weight and shape are to males, she told me, suggesting that airbrushed images of models and sports figures in the media promise quick results. Young men are just as influenced as young women by these images.

The extra protein in the supplements that many boys buy in hope of bulking up may be useless. The body can only absorb so much protein, said Jerel Calzo, a developmental psychologist who studies eating disorders in adolescent males and is an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. Boys who are eager to build muscle may exceed the recommended amounts, he said. If youre doubling up, youre only getting the extra calories  sugars and fats. Further, he said, the supplements are under-regulated, and the marketing is often deceptive.

In the worst-case scenario, these protein supplements can damage your kidneys, especially if you get dehydrated, so boys who dabble in protein supplements have even more reason to keep drinking fluids. But again, that can lead to problems, since sports drinks, also heavily marketed to young men with athletic ambitions, include additional refined sugars and empty calories. We do a lot to push the fact that children dont need sports drinks, Dr. Taveras said. Water is just fine.

Although some teenage boys are clearly preoccupied with their bodies, others manage to eat their way right through adolescence without ever making very clear connections between any aspects of diet and health.

The unbounded adolescent male appetite, the athletic ambitions and the concomitant desire to add muscle, taken together with the very deliberate drumbeat of marketing, can add up to a poor diet. To me, protein is a nonissue, Professor Nestle said. You cant talk about protein in isolation from everything else people eat.

The most essential message for adolescent boys and young men is a variant of the basic unsurprising message in the overall report: Eat more vegetables, and substitute healthier, less processed foods for the junk. Oh, and while youre at it, guys, be careful of the protein powders. By and large, extra protein is not what you need.

BEIJING  Migrant workers are the unsung heroes of Chinas economic miracle. Numbering more than 270 million, they abandon their impoverished farms and villages to move to the cities, where they run the factories and build the highways and high-rises that have made Chinas growth the envy of the world.









Now, as Chinas economy slows, the countrys leaders have a new mission for them: Buy homes.

China is looking for ways to get migrant workers to help buy up a huge glut of unsold homes that is dragging down the countrys economic growth. Chinese leaders have eased taxes and down payment requirements. They are taking new steps to offer mortgages. And they have eased the tough laws that traditionally have kept migrant workers from putting down roots in big cities.

The leaders want to turn people like Hong Qiwen into home buyers. Mr. Hong, 32, runs a small pastry shop in Xian, a city in Shaanxi Province in the countrys north. The province has said it will offer mortgages and other help as part of a $9.1 billion lending push to get people  especially migrants  to buy homes.

Photo

But Mr. Hong, a father of two young children who is from a rural area in Chinas east, represents the challenge to Chinas effort. He has no plans to buy one in Xian. I am like a fallen leaf that will eventually return to the roots, he said, invoking a Chinese proverb.

The housing glut is one of the biggest drags on Chinas economy, and therefore one of the major drags on global growth. The empty homes have discouraged further investment in real estate, idling cranes and construction workers around the country.

Investment in Chinese real estate reached nearly $1.5 trillion last year, according to official figures. Economists say the property sectors impact on the economy is even greater when related industries like steel and furniture-making are included. But growth has come to a standstill. After growing by double-digit percentage rates for more than a decade, Chinese real estate investment last year grew just 1 percent.

The precise size of the housing glut is unclear. China nationally tracks square meters available for sale. Government data shows that the space in unsold residential units reached a high last year at 452 million square meters, more than twice as much as in 2011 and 130 times the size of Central Park in New York. (A square meter is a little less than 11 square feet.) Unlike typical homes in the United States, which are generally single-family houses, the typical Chinese home is an apartment in a residential complex.

The real housing overcapacity may be more serious than official figures show. If we take into account the land that hasnt started construction or newly started projects, the pressure from overcapacity will be greater, said Yan Yuejin, a property analyst at E-House R&D Institute in Shanghai.

The problem stems from Chinas lending-and-spending binge eight years ago to stave off the effects of the global financial crisis. With $611 billion in spending, China rekindled growth but added to its surfeit of steel mills, cement kilns and glass factories  as well as empty homes. The glut was further fueled by Chinese investors looking for a place to park their wealth.

The problem is most acute in Chinas less developed cities. Rapid increases in home prices persist in wealthier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and the southern manufacturing mecca of Shenzhen, and analysts still warn of the potential for bubbles.

For now, Chinese leaders seem mostly preoccupied with the backlog of unsold homes. President Xi Jinping was quoted in November as saying that destocking the property market and promoting the sustained development of the sector were important tasks for the coming year. Changjiang Daily, an official newspaper in the central city of Wuhan, likened the task of unloading vacant homes to a battle of annihilation.

Government ministries have responded with a number of measures, such as reducing the deed tax and lowering requirements for down payments. The pressure is on: One Chinese provincial government has warned county- and city-level officials that they will be held accountable if they fail, without specifying the penalties.

Part of the solution, officials believe, lies with Chinas hundreds of millions of migrant workers. Many are from the countryside and lack an urban hukou  the household registration that provides access to social services such as subsidized health care and state schools and the right to buy a home. Originally, that system was designed to keep rural workers from flooding Chinese cities.

Now, provincial governments are encouraging the workers to stay, and many are focusing on initiatives tailored to migrants. In the central province of Henan, the government will subsidize city home purchases by migrant workers and give them easier access to an urban hukou. In Wuhu, in Anhui Province, the authorities have promised easy commercial bank loans to migrant workers.

The policies are aimed at people like He Yong, 28, a driver from a village in Jilin Province, which borders North Korea and Russia. He hopes someday to get married, settle down in the nearby city of Hunchun  population 250,000  and set up his own business. The policies to encourage that have not been introduced in his part of the country yet, but he hopes to take advantage of them.

Here no one wants to marry you and live in the village, Mr. He said. We all want to get a place in the city some day. Being a farmer is tiring and doesnt make much money.

Still, the effort could prove to be tough. Hu Xingdou, an economics professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology, said rural residents hesitated to move into cities because rural services were improving, and they worried about compensation for their land and a lack of jobs in less developed cities.

Mr. Hong, owner of the pastry shop in Xian, currently rents an apartment in Xian, but he doesnt plan to stay. Pollution and traffic make city life unpalatable, he said, adding that he could probably buy a modest home in a small city if he wanted to. Eventually, he said, he will probably settle down back in rural Jiangxi.

I dreamed about city life when I was young, because many of the villagers who went there bragged about the city, which they said was full of new things, he said. But once I began working in cities, I missed home a lot and was not entirely used to the city way of life.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-04 00:00:00,Bravo Zulu: On (Representative) Ryan Zinke,['Dan Brooks'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Welcome to Social Capital, a series devoted to analyzing the social-media presences of celebrities.









The key to understanding Representative Ryan Zinkes Twitter account  the ur-tweet, if you will  is this photo of an assault rifle printed with the stars and stripes, which his campaign offered as a raffle prize during the 2014 Montana Republican primary. It is a ridiculous object: Too garish for the solemn purpose of self-defense, it is similarly inappropriate for hunting, in which animals are not imagined to be in conflict with the United States. But it means something. There is a connection among the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, the American flag and the Republican Party, and Zinke has made it the essence of his social media persona.

As a freshman congressman  he became Montanas sole delegate to the House of Representatives in 2015  he criticized President Obama for participating in the Paris climate summit, on the grounds that it did nothing to stop ISIS. He made the same argument about gun control a month later. In his disdain for the hierarchies of Washington, his attention to cultural signifiers and his fixation on foreign enemies, Zinke represents the post-Tea Party strain of conservative populism. But unlike Sarah Palin or Ted Cruz, he actually fought in a war.

Zinke is a former Navy SEAL. Lest you forget, his office consistently refers to him as Commander Zinke. Shortly after he was elected, he tweeted his promise to push back against making decisions based on politics, rather than what is right for the mission. The mission is the representative government of the United States, and Commander Zinke will be damned if hes going to let politics get in the way. When @RepRyanZinke approves of something, he tweets the Navy expression bravo zulu  at his son Konrad, at the Special Olympian Dakota Shaffer, at CNNs Wolf Blitzer. The message is plain: He is a soldier doing politicians work, a gun painted over with the American flag.

If Commander Zinke were a fictional character, this presentation would be too flat: No real person could bravo zulu so hard. But on Twitter, were all fictional anyway. Zinke has taken the performance of identity that is social media and reduced it to one clear note. Ironically, his relentless message discipline compels us to imagine the man behind the curtain, or the phone, in this case. There must be a real Ryan Zinke, because Commander Zinke is obviously fake. This impression only deepens with the discovery that there are two of him on Twitter: @RepRyanZinke, the congressman, and @RyanZinke, the citizen.

Their identities are congruent  comically, almost maddeningly so. Consider the two portraits he has painted of himself. The official Zinke account offers the bio 5th generation Montanan. Retired #NavySEAL Commander. Husband, father, grandfather. Played 4 #OregonDucks. Teddy Roosevelt fan. Congressman for Montana. Meanwhile, his personal bio describes him as husband, father & grandfather. Montanas Congressman, former State Senator, and 23-year veteran of the US Navy SEALs.

Its a relief, I suppose, that he is keeping his admiration for Roosevelt out of his personal life. Otherwise, @RepRyanZinke versus @RyanZinke is a distinction without difference. His insistence on keeping them separate when they are functionally the same suggests that he thinks of himself as a man with two identities, and that idea is important to him.

Its tempting to assume that @RyanZinke functions as a kind of preserve for his Commander Zinke identity. But @RepRyanZinke tweets bravo zulu, too  for example, at the Montanan and X Games competitor Maggie Voisin. On both timelines and on his Facebook pages, an impressive number of his posts end with some variant spelling of hooah!

In recent years, that military expression has crept through the lips of public figures who did not actually serve. (Sarah Palin wore it as a rhinestone pin.) Hooah has become part of a rhetoric that is not strictly military but military-adjacent  in which actual service, support for the troops and support for conservative politics meld into a single, patriotic brand. Zinke epitomizes this fusion, hitching his identity as a veteran to the disdain for politicians that propels so much of contemporary politics.

About 13 percent of adult Montanans have served in the armed forces; no state but Alaska has a higher percentage. At the same time, the national rate of service is shrinking. In 1977, Congress was 77 percent veterans. Today, that number stands at 20 percent, making Zinkes war record a valuable commodity. But as his status as a veteran advances his political career, he undergoes the same blurring of previously distinct identities  soldier, patriot, Republican  that has transformed his party into a lifestyle brand.

Heres @RyanZinke with an unidentified Vietnam veteran and an inspirational quote: Weve been trained to solve problems. What a sign of relief that is for America.  Congressman-elect Ryan Zinke, former Commander at SEAL Team Six. The implication is that unlike other members of Congress, he has actually been trained to solve problems. This belief in the special relevance of warfare allows Commander Zinke to hold politicians in contempt even as he joins them.

Here he is riding his motorcycle to a parade honoring the Devils Brigade, the first American Special Forces unit. He is wearing a white T-shirt emblazoned with an American flag and the word Independence. This shirt will become conspicuous later in the day, when Zinke appears in a photo with three dozen other soldiers as the only man not wearing a suit or dress uniform.

Theres something sympathetic about that picture. Commander Zinke, rare in his experience and outsize in his public persona, has committed a faux pas familiar to ordinary men: He has dressed wrongly for an event. Memorialized on social media, the mistake humanizes him. It makes him seem fallible in a way Special Forces commanders generally do not.

Behind Commander Zinkes gung-ho social media facade lies a certain vulnerability. If Zinke is a soldier, not a politician, then the business of serving in the House must rack his nerves. In this context, his social media persona becomes a poignant archetype: the old soldier, hyper-competent in situations that would reduce most men to tears, befuddled by civilian life. The irony is that these two Ryan Zinkes seem identical to everyone else.

His hooah shtick is surely exaggerated. But if Commander Zinke is a role he plays on Twitter, it is also the character he has enacted his whole life. He was a teenager once. He had a first day in the Navy. As a soldier, he faced terrifying danger, but at least he knew his mission. Can we blame him for wanting to carry that certainty into the House, where so much seems unclear? His social media persona captures the central fantasy of contemporary politics: that running this country is simple, so long as we are bluff, hearty and unusually brave.",[]

The Barnes Foundation  which is still feeling out its new identity in downtown Philadelphia after relocating in 2012 from its original home in the suburb of Merion, Pa.  announced Thursday that it had chosen Sylvie Patry, a longtime curator at the Musee DOrsay in Paris, to be its new chief curator and deputy director for collections and exhibitions.

Ms. Patry, 46, is a specialist in Impressionist and Post-Impressionism, which is the strength of the Barness collection, built by Albert C. Barnes, a willful and eccentric pharmaceutical tycoon, and opened in 1922. A contentious 2004 court decision allowed the foundation to relocate downtown, a decision that circumvented the highly specific charter and bylaws of Barnes, who had stipulated that his collection could not be lent, sold or moved from its original home. The move, while still unpopular in many quarters, has allowed the foundation to expand its programming and conservation initiatives and explore exhibitions with contemporary artists whose work can play off the permanent collection.

Ms. Patry, in a telephone interview from Paris, said she sought the job because she felt the Barnes was a collection that is known but not so well known, which makes it a very interesting job for a curator. It was so isolated in a way for so many years and there are so many stories still embedded in the collection. My sense is that the relocation has really reshuffled the cards.

Ms. Patry will be joined in re-envisioning the museums shows and outreach by Martha Lucy, a former curator at the foundation, who will be returning as curator and as deputy director for education and public programs.",[]

George Martin, the urbane English record producer who signed the Beatles to a recording contract on the small Parlophone label after every other British record company had turned them down, and who guided them in their transformation from a regional dance band into the most inventive, influential and studio-savvy rock group of the 1960s, died on Tuesday at his home in Wiltshire, England. He was 90.









His death was confirmed by Adam Sharp, a founder of CA Management, a British company that represented Mr. Martin.

God bless George Martin, Ringo Starr, the former Beatle, wrote on Twitter. In a reminiscence on his website, Paul McCartney, the other surviving former Beatle, said Mr. Martin was like a second father to me.

Mr. Martin helped redefine a record producers role in pop music. He was one of a handful of pop producers  Phil Spector and Quincy Jones among them  to become almost as famous as the musicians they recorded. And when he left Parlophone, a subsidiary of EMI Records, to start his own production company in 1965, his reputation as the producer of the Beatles helped raise the stature of record production as an independent career, rather than as simply a record label function.

In the dozen years before he met the Beatles, Mr. Martin produced symphonic, chamber and choral recordings, jazz albums and a string of popular comedy records by Peter Ustinov, Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan. In the 1960s, as the recordings he made with the Beatles rode the top of the charts, he also produced hits by other British Invasion acts, among them Gerry and the Pacemakers, Cilla Black and Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas. He later worked with a diverse roster of pop and jazz performers, including Ella Fitzgerald, the Bee Gees, Jeff Beck, the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Paul Winter, Cheap Trick, America and Ultravox.

His collaboration with the Beatles inevitably overshadowed his other accomplishments. From 1962 to 1970, Mr. Martin produced 13 albums and 22 singles for the group, a compact body of work that adds up to less than 10 hours of music but that revolutionized the popular music world. After the Beatles broke up, he virtually doubled that output, overseeing archival releases drawn from the groups concerts at the Hollywood Bowl, BBC radio performances and unreleased studio recordings that reveal a great deal about the Beatles working process.

Musicians, celebrities and political leaders paid tribute to Mr. Martin on social media on Wednesday, including the producers Mark Ronson and Quincy Jones, who described him on a Facebook post as my musical brother who knew the secrets of our craft that so few know today.

A modest man who had been trained as a classical pianist and oboist, Mr. Martin always deflected credit for the Beatles success, telling interviewers over the years that his own efforts were secondary to the songwriting genius of John Lennon, Paul McCartney and, to a lesser extent, George Harrison. The Beatles, for their part, recognized that Mr. Martin came to the job with a virtually infallible ear for arrangements. His advice and his behind-the-scenes scoring and editing gave some of the Beatles greatest recordings their characteristic sound.

When the Beatles played Please Please Me for him for the first time, for example, it was in a slow arrangement meant to evoke the style of Roy Orbison, one of their heroes. Mr. Martin told them the song sounded dreary, and insisted that they pick up the tempo and add a simple harmonica introduction. His suggestions transformed Please Please Me, which became their first big hit.

Always intent on expanding the Beatles horizons, Mr. Martin began chipping away at the groups resistance to using orchestral musicians on its recordings in early 1965. While recording the Help! album that year, he brought in flutists for the simple adornment that enlivens Lennons Youve Got to Hide Your Love Away, and he convinced Mr. McCartney, against his initial resistance, that Yesterday should be accompanied by a string quartet.

A year later, during the recording of the album Revolver, Mr. Martin no longer had to cajole: The Beatles prevailed on him to augment their recordings with arrangements for strings (on Eleanor Rigby), brass (on Got to Get You Into My Life), marching band (on Yellow Submarine) and solo French horn (on For No One), as well as a tabla player for Harrisons Indian-influenced song Love You To.

It was also at least partly through Mr. Martins encouragement that the Beatles became increasingly interested in electronic sound. Noting their inquisitiveness about both the technical and musical sides of recording, Mr. Martin ignored the traditional barrier between performers and technicians and invited the group into the control room, where he showed them how the recording equipment at EMIs Abbey Road studios worked. He also introduced them to unorthodox recording techniques, including toying with tape speeds and playing tapes backward.

Mr. Martin had used some of these techniques in his comedy and novelty recordings, long before he began working with the Beatles.

When I joined EMI, he told The New York Times in 2003, the criterion by which recordings were judged was their faithfulness to the original. If you made a recording that was so good that you couldnt tell the difference between the recording and the actual performance, that was the acme. And I questioned that. I thought, O.K., were all taking photographs of an existing event. But we dont have to make a photograph; we can paint. And that prompted me to experiment.

Soon the Beatles themselves became intent on searching for new sounds, and Mr. Martin created another that the group adopted in 1966 (followed by many others). During the sessions for Rain, Mr. Martin took part of Lennons lead vocal and overlaid it, running backward, over the songs coda.

From that moment, Mr. Martin said, they wanted to do everything backwards. They wanted guitars backwards and drums backwards, and everything backwards, and it became a bore. The technique did, however, benefit Im Only Sleeping (with backward guitars) and Strawberry Fields Forever (with backward drums).

Mr. Martin was never particularly trendy, and when the Beatles adopted the flowery fashions of psychedelia in 1966 and 1967 he continued to attend sessions in a white shirt and tie, his hair combed back in a schoolmasterly pre-Beatles style. Musically, though, he was fully in step with them. When Lennon wanted a circus sound for his Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite, Mr. Martin recorded a barrel organ and, following the example of John Cage, cut the tape into small pieces and reassembled them at random. His avant-garde orchestration and spacey production techniques made A Day in the Life into a monumental finale for the kaleidoscopic album Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.

George Henry Martin was born in London on Jan. 3, 1926, to Henry and Bertha Martin. As a child, he was a talented and largely self-taught pianist who had perfect pitch and was able to learn classical pieces and popular tunes by ear. While a student at Bromley Grammar School he formed a dance band, George Martin and the Four Tune Tellers. He continued a part-time career as a pianist during World War II, when he was a pilot in the Fleet Air Arm of the British Navy. When one of his performances attracted the attention of a BBC producer, he was invited to play one of his compositions, a piano prelude, on the Navy Mixture radio program.

After the war Mr. Martin attended the Guildhall School of Music, where he took up the oboe in addition to studying composition, conducting and piano. He worked briefly as a freelance oboist and as a clerk in the BBCs music library before he was invited to become an assistant to Oscar Preuss, the recording manager at Parlophone Records. When he succeeded Mr. Preuss in 1955, at 29, he was the youngest label manager at EMI.

Parlophone was a poor relation among EMIs labels  HMV and Columbia were more prestigious  but it had a varied roster when Mr. Martin joined its staff in 1950. He was first assigned to the companys classical projects, including recordings by the London Baroque Ensemble and the conductors Malcolm Sargent and Charles Mackerras. But he soon moved on to orchestral pops, with Sidney Torch and the Queens Hall Light Orchestra; jazz, with John Dankworth and Humphrey Lyttelton; popular vocal music, with Matt Monro; and comedy, with Mr. Ustinov, Mr. Sellers and the Beyond the Fringe troupe of Jonathan Miller, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett.

For all its diversity, though, Parlophone had little success with rock n roll until Mr. Martin began recording the Beatles. When Brian Epstein, the groups manager, called on Mr. Martin in early 1962, the Beatles had already been rejected by virtually every British record label, including the other EMI subsidiaries. Mr. Martin turned them down, too.

But Sid Colman, the director of EMIs publishing arm, Ardmore & Beechwood, had heard demonstration discs of some early Lennon-McCartney songs, and pushed EMI to sign the group so that he could publish their music. The company resisted at first, but finally agreed, and assigned the band to Mr. Martins Parlophone label.

Mr. Martin remained uninterested, assigning the groups first session, on June 6, 1962, to Ron Richards, his assistant. But Mr. Richards found the Beatles interesting enough to send for Mr. Martin, who took over the session and was quickly won over by their charm and originality.

Still, he had doubts. He told the Beatles that their drummer at the time, Pete Best, was not good enough to record. They had their own doubts about Mr. Best, and quickly replaced him with Mr. Starr. Mr. Martin also had qualms about the first Lennon-McCartney songs he heard  Love Me Do, P.S. I Love You and Hello Little Girl  regarding them as derivative. He helped them find the spark that soon became their hallmark by insisting that they think carefully about their vocal harmonies and such niceties of the arrangers art as introductions and endings. They quickly internalized his advice.

By the end of 1963 Mr. Martin was virtually coining money for EMI, not only with the Beatles recordings but also with the hits he was producing for Gerry and the Pacemakers, Cilla Black and others.

Mr. Martin did not at first share in the wealth these successes generated. When Mr. Epstein offered him a share of the Beatles publishing, he turned it down on the grounds that it would be a conflict of interest. He had, however, been arguing since early 1962 that EMI should pay him a royalty on his productions, instead of a salary. In August 1965, when EMI refused to offer Mr. Martin more than a token bonus, he left the company and formed his own production company, Associated Independent Recording (AIR), along with two other producers from EMI and the competing Decca label. The Beatles insisted that EMI continue to engage Mr. Martin as their producer after AIR was established, as did most of Mr. Martins other artists.

In 1966, not long after he established AIR, Mr. Martin married Judy Lockhart-Smith, who had been his secretary at Parlophone. They had two children, Lucie and Giles. He also had two children, Alexis and Gregory, from an earlier marriage, to Sheena Chisolm, which ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife and children, as well as several grandchildren.

AIR opened its own studio in London in 1970, and a Caribbean branch, on the Caribbean island Montserrat, in 1979. When the Montserrat studio was destroyed in a hurricane in 1989, Mr. Martin decided not to rebuild. But he compiled an album of recordings made at the studio by Mr. McCartney, the Rolling Stones, Dire Straits, the Police, Elton John and others as a charity for the 12,000 people who lost their homes in the storm.

In 1993 Mr. Martin opened AIR Lyndhurst, a state-of-the-art studio in a converted Victorian church in London, which has become an important studio for orchestral film soundtrack recording. Mr. Martin remained involved in its operation long after he stopped producing recordings in the late 1990s.

Im there every week, he said in 2003. I listen to my friends who come and do film recording. I love sitting in a 100-piece orchestra and listening. And I still do a bit of writing, and I help a bit with studio work sometimes.

As a composer, Mr. Martin supplied incidental music to the soundtracks of several films, including the Beatles A Hard Days Night and Yellow Submarine as well as Live and Let Die, Honky Tonk Freeway and Pulp. He wrote the music for a recording of Dylan Thomass Under Milk Wood that he produced in 1989, using an entirely Welsh cast of actors and singers. Having made several recordings of his own arrangements of Beatles songs in the 1960s, he periodically conducted orchestras, mostly in Europe and Latin America, in concerts of Beatles music.

In the late 1990s, he toured as a lecturer, speaking about the making of Sgt. Pepper and tantalizing listeners with excerpts from the unreleased session tapes for that album. His last Beatles project was a collaboration with his son Giles, also a record producer, on the 2006 soundtrack for Love, the Cirque du Soleil show for which Beatles recordings were remixed and recombined.

Mr. Martin was also the host of several television programs, including The Making of Sgt. Pepper in 1992 and The Glory of Gershwin in 1993, and he wrote a handful of books, among them All You Need Is Ears (1979), Summer of Love: The Making of Sgt. Pepper (1994) and a lavishly illustrated limited-edition autobiography, Playback (2003). He was made a Commander of the British Empire in 1988 and was awarded a knighthood in 1996.",[]
nytimes.com,2011-04-14 00:00:00,Dana Delany Tackles a Friday Puzzle By Patrick Berry,"['Deb Amlen', 'Patrick Berry']","FRIDAYS PUZZLE  If you do the New York Times crossword puzzle every day, you know that some of them are light repasts and some of them are multicourse feasts. Now that its Friday, we have survived another week of puzzle challenges, and I consider this one by Patrick Berry a sweet finish to the weekday hustle. An AFTER-DINNER MINT, if you will.

We have a special guest with us today, and I was very pleased to learn that she is not only a terrific actress and health issues activist, but she is an experienced crossword puzzle aficionado as well. Among many other roles, Dana Delany won an Emmy for her role on China Beach, co-starred on Desperate Housewives as Katherine Mayfair, and is currently starring in the ABC-TV series Body of Proof. She sits on the board of the Scleroderma Research Foundation and memorably underwent a televised mammogram to increase awareness on the live broadcast Stand Up 2 Cancer in 2008.

Lets welcome Ms. Delany and see how she did:

When I was a child, I used to watch my mother sit at the counter with a drink, peanuts and the New York Times crossword puzzle. Or at the beach in a low chair with her Bain de Soleil and the Sunday puzzle in the summer. It was the height of sophistication for me.

I dabbled with the Sunday puzzle when I was in my 20s, but I didnt make the full commitment until I was 40. I was shooting a miniseries in Austin, Texas called True Women about the intrepid females who pioneered that wild west. They also had a LOT of hair. Which meant spending two hours in the make-up trailer adding extensions and crimping with a curling rod. Or rather, Joanie my hairdresser did; I just sat there bored. So my co-star Annabeth Gish and I started doing the puzzle. I wasnt very good at first but I quickly became addicted and faithfully completed every day of the week. Over the years, I have cut back to only Friday and Saturday with an occasional Thursday for fun. I need to do other things!

Now, lets discuss the iPad and the electronic crossword. It is my method of late, but I find the Google search way too tempting. And I do admit to succumbing once in a while. But not this puzzle. It was refreshing to pull out the ballpoint pen and remember the good old days. I am not sure if I found this Patrick Berry (for whom I have great respect) puzzle relatively easy because I used a pen or not. Maybe its a different neural pathway. Now that I am playing a former neurosurgeon on Body of Proof I should know the answer to that.

This was one of those puzzles where I didnt know all of the answers, but they became clear the more I filled in. I usually like the long crossings, but they may have made things a little too easy.

There were a few movie references, which should be easy for me. However, I actually went to the premiere of The Children of Men (love Alfonso Cuaron films) and did not realize it was based on a P.D. JAMES novel (1A). But I got PIETA (1D) right away, which helped. Not a lot of Michelangelo works that would fit. Again, I saw Eastern Promise, but can only remember Viggo Mortensen wrestling naked in the steam room; was he tattooed? (17A). I knew that the Clint Eastwood movie was The Outlaw JOSEY Wales (3D) but who knew Josey was spelled like that? One movie reference I can never get is all the Harry Potter characters (38A). They appear everywhere now and I think I have only seen one of the movies. Never read any of the books. So I might have to rectify that if only for my puzzle solving abilities. Other film references were GRIPS (43D) and BAIO (52D). I kept wanting the last one to be Adam, because I think hes funny. But I knew in my heart Matter of contention (52A) had to be BONE, hence the old crossword standby BAIO. There were a few too many crossword gimmes for me: EER, EELS, LAM, ACHE, APSE. Do people actually pray in an apse? Thank god for churches  what would we do without nave?

I did like the crossing of SURGEON GENERAL with POLICE SERGEANTS. Those are two words where I constantly have to think twice about their spelling. Which leads me to my final story: My name is a good one for crossword puzzles. As my mother reminds me, its not because Im famous, its because I have a lot of vowels. However, I am famous for being one of the few errors ever made in the New York Times crossword puzzle. They used me as the clue, but spelled my last name DELANEY instead of DELANY. [Deb says: Hat tip to Patrick Merrell for setting up this link.] Which, of course, threw the whole puzzle off. I happened to be doing the puzzle that day and quickly realized what the problem was, as I am used to people spelling my name wrong. DELANEY is much more prevalent. If the clue had been Star of NYPD BLUE it would have been correct. Kim Delaney is a lovely actor and a friend of mine, but no, we are not related. I felt kind of bad about the whole thing, but honored to have a place in the annals of the New York Times crossword puzzle.",[]

IF the gatekeepers at Davidson College had judged the teenager by her ACT score, she probably wouldnt have gotten in. It was 25 out of a possible 36, and more than three-quarters of the students at Davidson, a liberal-arts school in North Carolina with about 1,800 undergraduates and an acceptance rate of just over 20 percent, do better than that.









Her grades at a small charter school in the Boston area didnt carry the day. I was allowed to look at her application, with her name redacted, and what I saw was an impressive but unexceptional mix of As and B-pluses, along with an impressive but unexceptional array of extracurricular activities much like any ambitious high school seniors.

I had to read deeper, as the admissions officers at Davidson had done, to understand why they felt so strongly about her, and to feel that way myself. I had to notice details embedded in her letters of recommendation and mentioned fleetingly in bits of personal information that shed provided.

Shed been reared by a single mother. She had a 6-year-old brother. And for the last few years, shed spent three nights a week making his dinner and getting him to bed while her mom was at work, earning an income so modest that the teenager met the federal requirements for receiving free lunch at school.

Look at what shes juggling, Chris Gruber, Davidsons dean of admissions, said as we chatted about her last week. In the context of those stresses, her Advanced Placement classes shimmered brighter; so did her volunteer work.

And though her high school wasnt chockablock with counselors, shed had the good sense to read up on Davidson and, in her application, lay out a mix of cogent, sophisticated reasons that it was right for her.

She researched the place perfectly, Gruber marveled, and, in all likelihood, was doing it on her own. Everything about her suggested maturity, independence, determination. Forget that ACT. She was a wager that Davidson was willing to make, and she was granted early admission to the class of 2020, which will begin studies next fall.

There has been a crescendo lately in talk about how to conduct college admissions in a manner that brings greater socioeconomic diversity to campuses, making them richer places to learn and better engines of social mobility.

I had extensive conversations with administrators at three very different schools that have made such diversity a priority and were willing to discuss specific applicants whose mettle became evident only upon a closer consideration of circumstances. The administrators explained how such an examination is done.

One of those schools was the Air Force Academy, which has a 17 percent acceptance rate and an especially interesting vantage point. Because its free and funded by the government, it feels an extra obligation to be open to all. Its also legally compelled to look for, and at, applicants in all 50 states.

And because it is preparing its students to be military officers, character matters as much as  if not more than  test scores.

The academys administrators briefed me on several applicants from recent years who were admitted despite inferior scores, and who nonetheless performed superbly at the academy. One had an ACT of well under 20, and yet shed earned As in A.P. classes at her high school in inner-city Philadelphia.

Delving into her background, the administrators concluded that the low ACT was in part a function of a childhood in which shed bounced around in foster care and even lived with teachers. It wasnt a capacity issue for her, Col. Carolyn Benyshek, the director of admissions, told me. It wasnt a skill issue. It was about exposure.

That shed nonetheless challenged herself academically and maintained a high grade point average struck academy administrators as remarkable. They admitted her, and she went on to win a coveted award for her performance during basic training.

Phillip Prosseda, who works with Colonel Benyshek in admissions, stressed that what theyre trying to be sensitive to isnt simply a sad story or a sob story. Its about: What are the candidates life experiences, and how did they react?

For instance, a young woman with modest test scores and grades that werent dazzling had done something that showed remarkable gumption, ingenuity and civic concern: She had coordinated the chain of events that led to the government cleaning up an environmental hazard near her school in an Illinois suburb.

The academy admitted her.

An admissions operation with enough resources to ferret out accomplishments like the Illinois womans and to follow up with high schools and learn more about candidates is key.

The Air Force goes even further: It has a residential prep school where academically marginal students whom it wants to admit can do a year of remediation. Private schools with especially robust endowments could pursue more efforts along these lines than they do.

Admitting students with merit that isnt instantly clear in their transcripts is a purposeful effort, a commitment. Davidson and the third school I looked at, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, do extensive outreach to make sure that North Carolina kids from geographic areas and backgrounds that arent ready-made conduits to top colleges know about them and about aid that can make them affordable.

Davidson sends emissaries to speak with the leaders of community-based organizations and with guidance counselors in less affluent schools. U.N.C.-Chapel Hill is a vigorous partner in the College Advising Corps, which places recent graduates in schools to nurture kids who might not otherwise set their sights on higher education.

Chapel Hills admissions director, Stephen Farmer, told me about the follow-up that his office had done regarding a young man who recently applied for early admission.

HIS test scores placed him toward the bottom of the applicant pool. He had Ds from his freshman and sophomore years. But then there was a stunning improvement that suggested a commitment all the more noteworthy in light of significant adversity in his family.

Farmer and other admissions officers wavered, conscious that if you put students in an academic environment thats too tough for them, youre setting them up to fail. On the other hand, they sensed real grit in him. So they delayed a decision in order to see if his grades from the fall of senior year held up. They did  and he has just been admitted.

Farmer mentioned a similar case from a year ago: a young man from rural North Carolina with an ACT of 22. He was the son of immigrants who didnt speak fluent English and had relied on him, since the sixth grade, to translate for them and even deal with the bank. He devoted up to 30 hours a week to the family business.

He needs a bridge to his future, wrote one of his teachers in a letter of recommendation.

He started in Chapel Hill last fall. For that first semester, he had an A-minus average. And hes proof, Farmer said, that if were viewing everybody through a single lens, were not seeing most people clearly. So we need to get better at adjusting our vision, or were going to miss a lot of talent.

nytimes.com,2016-02-29 00:00:00,"Once Upon a Greek Island, Migrants and Tourists",['Rena Silverman'],"Its hard to imagine enjoying a holiday getaway in an area rife with suffering. But it happens all the time, and not just in the developing world where verdant, gated resorts exist not far from impoverished shantytowns. Consider the Greek island of Lesbos, where sunbathers laze by azure waters while not too far away boats arrive daily full of families fleeing violence in Syria and other hot spots.

Marieke van der Velden and her partner, Philip Brink, decided to bring together these two disparate groups  tourists and migrants  in The Island of All Together. Conceived in May, carried out in August and completed in December of last year, the project includes portraits, a documentary short and an interactive website. But the central interaction is the encounter between two people whose paths crossed unexpectedly.

Lesbos is an interesting place because there are tourists and refugees coming to the island and they are both there for a week or two, Mr. Brink said. So thats how we came up with the idea to ask refugees and tourists to sit down and talk to each other and make a film out of it.

Last summer, a few months after United Nations officials expressed concern about the record number of migrants arriving on Lesbos, Ms. van der Velden and Mr. Brink traveled from their home in Amsterdam to the island, where they found tourists at their hotel and migrants at a parking lot where many were waiting for the next bus to register for transit to Athens.

We knew that people had to wait there for hours, Ms. van der Velden said. We didnt ask them when they were coming off the boats.

Ms. van der Velden and Mr. Brink paired up migrants and tourists for interviews in spots throughout the island. They handed out cards with questions for participants to ask each other, although in the end some questions came naturally. Each participant spoke in his or her native language  usually Dutch, English or Arabic  and used a headset for translations, often made by a Lebanese member of the film crew.

Selma Pabst, a 24-year-old German medical student visiting Lesbos with her sister and mother, was paired with Husam (Ms. van der Velden and Mr. Brink did not feel comfortable revealing any last names of migrants). He was a 26-year-old lawyer from Damascus en route to Germany. Hours before they met, Husam and some 50 other migrants had been packed in a black rubber boat intended for only 30 passengers.

What was your life like five years ago? was among the first questions they posed to each other.

Five years ago I had dreams and ambitions, Husam told Ms. Pabst. I had already started realizing them and I had achieved my goals. But the situation changed and there was nothing more for me to do. Everything in my life stopped.

When Ms. Pabst asked him to name those dreams and ambitions, he told her that when the war in Syria started (around five years ago), he had just graduated from law school. I wanted to work as an attorney, he said. The war put an end to that.

The trip was relatively safe, because I was nearly killed three times in Syria.  Mohamad

Mohamad, a Kurdish, 50-year-old former restaurant manager from Aleppo who spent two years in Turkey before arriving on the island, was paired with Jan Winkel, 56, from the Netherlands. Mr. Winkel often looked surprised by Mohamads candor.

The trip was relatively safe, because I was nearly killed three times in Syria, Mohamad said, adding that his wife and son were still in Turkey and his daughter in Syria.

Its hard to hear this story from you, Mr. Winkel replied. Then you think everything is torn up and we are here with the entire family.

Then there were the two little boys, one from Damascus, the other from a Channel Island between England and France. They sat on swings, discussing soccer players. My favorite player is Cristiano, the 11-year-old Syrian boy, Alaa, said referring to Cristiano Ronaldo. Finn, the other boy, who is 9, agreed. Hes good.

At the end of each session, Ms. van der Velden took portraits of the pairs, which she let them stage. Mr. Brink and Ms. van der Velden also asked participants to take selfies with their partners, an idea that originated because they were trying to come up with a creative ending for the film.

At the end of the conversation, Mr. Brink said, people come close to each other to take the picture, so its really kind of an intimate moment.

On a block where subtlety has no role, they exhibit refined artistry, with color gradients that make it appear as if sheer, feathery muslin had been draped over 16 lines radiating from a compass rose. And as the city continues pell-mell into the 21st century, they are frozen in 1957.

For instance, the Metropolitan Opera House (No. 15 on the map) is shown in Midtown Manhattan, where it has not been since 1966. At Columbus Circle is the New York Coliseum (No. 6). Too bad it was razed in 2000.

Anachronisms aside, the maps are worth seeing and worth saving. And that is worth saying because the Police Department has begun to make plans for a $3.5 million rehabilitation and modernization of the substation.

Happily, City Hall seems to understand the maps importance.

Were looking closely at where and how the murals might be preserved, Austin Finan, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said last week.

The map murals are the work of Edward Meshekoff (1917-2010), an artist, illustrator and designer who was born in the Bronx and educated at the University of California, Los Angeles. His commissions included a childrens playroom aboard the ocean liner United States and the 1952 childrens book The Little Car That Wanted a Garage.

On the maps, childlike delight is evident in the metal icons Mr. Meshekoff embedded among mosaic tiles to pinpoint civic landmarks: an artists palette for the Metropolitan Museum of Art (No. 9), a polka-dot apatosaurus for the American Museum of Natural History (No. 10), a giraffe for the Bronx Zoo (No. 12), an open book for the New York Public Library (No. 17) and, for the opera house at Broadway and West 39th Street, a staff with a treble clef and a G quarter-note.

The map sweeps across the five boroughs and New Jersey, from the Long Island Sound to the Hudson River to the Narrows to the Atlantic Ocean.

Now, this does not look like a representation of police work. But the building was not constructed for the police.

It was originally the Times Square Information Center, which opened in 1957 and was dedicated in 1958, after 66,000 visitors had already come through, putting questions like these to employees of the citys Department of Commerce and Public Events:

My friend is sick in a hospital in New York. Where? Answer: New York Hospital  or so one of the information clerks, Art Tallman, guessed. His hunch located the inquirers friend immediately. Where can we find a good Chinese restaurant? Answer: Chinatown. Why do you folks allow Pepsi-Cola to waste all that water in that waterfall sign up there? Answer: The water in the huge billboard is constantly recycled. Where can I find some action? You know, a dice game. Answer: Not provided.

The police took over the center in 1993, when visitors questions might have run more along the lines of, How can I leave Times Square alive?

Mr. Meshekoffs murals did not survive the neighborhoods nadir totally unscathed. Statue of Liberty icons were pried off both maps. City Hall, the Brooklyn Bridge and a Staten Island ferry were stolen from the east map.

But over all, the murals seem to be in amazingly good shape.

Im assuming that this remarkable mosaic will be preserved and celebrated as part of the restoration and upgrade of the station, said Tim Tompkins, the president of the Times Square Alliance, which runs the business improvement district. (The alliance included the murals in a booklet on distinctive works of art, architecture and design.)

Obviously marveling at the notion, Mr. Tompkins said: Heres a mosaic above a subway, in the shadow of the New Years Eve ball and blazing digital ads, on the side of a police station that has a blinking neon sign  its your classic Times Square mash-up and juxtaposition of things that one doesnt expect to find together. This would be the equivalent of having a medieval chapel with an N.Y.P.D. cop as a gargoyle and a neon cross, planted down in the middle of the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Director Chosen for Harvard Art Museums,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Reference Timestopics People K Randy_kennedy Index Html', 'Randy Kennedy']","Photo

The Harvard Art Museums, which have been without a director since last July, announced Wednesday that they had chosen Martha Tedeschi, a longtime curator and administrator at the Art Institute of Chicago, to lead the institutions.

She will succeed Thomas W. Lentz, who directed the museums for more than a decade and shepherded them through a long and sometimes contentious $350 million renovation and expansion, designed by Renzo Piano, that was completed in 2014.

Ms. Tedeschi, 57, a specialist in British and American art with expertise in the history of printmaking, began her career at the Art Institute in 1982 as an intern and became a full curator in 1999. Since 2012, she has served as the deputy director for art and research, overseeing the institutes libraries and archives, publishing and imaging, academic programs and conservation departments, while also serving as its academic liaison to local universities and foundations.

In a statement, Harvards president, Drew Gilpin Faust, said that Ms. Tedeschis experience would serve the museums well as the university seeks to elevate our extraordinary collections and integrate them more fully into Harvards intellectual life.

Ms. Tedeschi, who will take over in July, said in a telephone interview that she was drawn to the job because of her deep interest in how the visual and the creative and intuitive can be meaningful to students regardless of the field in which theyre working and training, and that she believed that Harvard was a campus that is so clearly ready to collaborate with the museums.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,An Anti-Semitism of the Left,['Roger Cohen'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

LONDON  Last month, a co-chairman of the Oxford University Labour Club, Alex Chalmers, quit in protest at what he described as rampant anti-Semitism among members. A large proportion of the club and the student left in Oxford more generally have some kind of problem with Jews, he said in a statement.









Chalmers referred to members of the executive committee throwing around the term Zio  an insult used by the Ku Klux Klan; high-level expressions of solidarity with Hamas and explicit defense of their tactics of indiscriminately murdering civilians; and the dismissal of any concern about anti-Semitism as just the Zionists crying wolf.

The zeitgeist on campuses these days, on both sides of the Atlantic, is one of identity and liberation politics. Jews, of course, are a minority, but through a fashionable cultural prism they are seen as the minority that isnt  that is to say white, privileged and identified with an imperialist-colonialist state, Israel. They are the anti-victims in a prevalent culture of victimhood; Jews, it seems, are the sole historical victim whose claim is dubious.

A recent Oberlin alumna, Isabel Storch Sherrell, wrote in a Facebook post of the students shed heard dismissing the Holocaust as mere white on white crime. As reported by David Bernstein in The Washington Post, she wrote of Jewish students, Our struggle does not intersect with other forms of racism.

Noa Lessof-Gendler, a student at Cambridge University, complained last month in Varsity, a campus newspaper, that anti-Semitism was felt in the word Zio flung around in left-wing groups. She wrote, Im Jewish, but that doesnt mean I have Palestinian blood on my hands, or should feel nervous about conversations in Hall when an Israeli speaker visits.

The rise of the leftist Jeremy Corbyn to the leadership of Britains opposition Labour Party appears to have empowered a far left for whom support of the Palestinians is uncritical and for whom, in the words of Alan Johnson, a British political theorist, that which the demonological Jew once was, demonological Israel now is.

Corbyn is no anti-Semite. But he has called Hamas and Hezbollah agents of long-term peace and social justice and political justice in the whole region, and once invited to Parliament a Palestinian Islamist, Raed Salah, who has suggested Jews were absent from the World Trade Center on 9/11. Corbyn called him an honored citizen. The Corbynistas on British campuses extol their fight against the racist colonization of Palestine, as one Oxford student, James Elliott, put it. Elliott was narrowly defeated last month in a bid to become youth representative on Labours national executive committee.

What is striking about the anti-Zionism derangement syndrome that spills over into anti-Semitism is its ahistorical nature. It denies the long Jewish presence in, and bond with, the Holy Land. It disregards the fundamental link between murderous European anti-Semitism and the decision of surviving Jews to embrace Zionism in the conviction that only a Jewish homeland could keep them safe. It dismisses the legal basis for the modern Jewish state in United Nations Resolution 181 of 1947. This was not colonialism but the post-Holocaust will of the world: Arab armies went to war against it and lost.

As Simon Schama, the historian, put it last month in The Financial Times, the Israel of 1948 came into being as a result of the centuries-long dehumanization of the Jews.

The Jewish state was needed. History had demonstrated that. That is why I am a Zionist  now a dirty word in Europe.

Today, it is Palestinians in the West Bank who are dehumanized through Israeli dominion, settlement expansion and violence. The West Bank is the tomb of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. Palestinians, in turn, incite against Jews and resort to violence, including random stabbings.

The oppression of Palestinians should trouble every Jewish conscience. But nothing can justify the odious anti-Semitic anti-Zionism (Johnsons term) that caused Chalmers to quit and is seeping into British and American campuses.

I talked to Aaron Simons, an Oxford student who was president of the universitys Jewish society. Theres an odd mental noise, he said. In tone and attitude the way you are talked to as a Jew in these left political circles reeks of hostility. These people have an astonishingly high bar for what constitutes anti-Semitism.

Johnson, writing in Fathom Journal, outlined three components to left-wing anti-Semitic anti-Zionism. First, the abolition of the Jewish homeland; not Palestine alongside Israel, but Palestine instead of Israel. Second, a demonizing intellectual discourse that holds that Zionism is racism and pursues the systematic Nazification of Israel. Third, a global social movement to exclude one state  and only one state  from the economic, cultural and educational life of humanity.

Criticism of Israel is one thing; its needed in vigorous form. Demonization of Israel is another, a familiar scourge refashioned by the very politics  of identity and liberation  that should comprehend the millennial Jewish struggle against persecution.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"A Flying Baseball Bat, a Dads Instinct and a Photograph",['Karen Workman'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

A father stops a flying baseball bat that was inches away from hitting his sons face. A photographer captures the moment. You can guess what happens next.









Its been crazy, said Shaun Cunningham, 37, the father from Ocala, Fla., who has been declared a hero in several headlines. The last 24 hours have been out of control.

The near-hit happened on Saturday while Cunningham and his 8-year-old son, Landon, were cheering on the Atlanta Braves in a spring training game in Orlando against the Pittsburgh Pirates.

Christopher Horner, a photographer for The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, took the photo that has ricocheted around the Internet. He was positioned on the third-base line, across from where Cunningham and his son were sitting, when he saw the bat come out of the hands of Danny Ortiz, a Pirates outfielder.

Although Horner knew instantly that he had captured the moment, it wasnt until later, when he saw the photo on his computer, that he realized how precarious that moment was.

Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox. Monday  Friday.

The only thing between the bat and the boy was his fathers arm, said Horner, a photographer for The Tribune-Review for 21 years.

He posted the photo on Twitter that night, but it didnt gain traction until the next morning.

Before I knew it, my phone was getting hot, he said. The notifications have been a steady drumbeat since then, keeping him awake Sunday night while he followed the photos journey in conversations abroad.

It was on Sunday night that the Cunninghams saw the photo for the first time, too.

It made me sick to my stomach, said Landons mother, Ashley Cunningham.

During the game, her husband told her that there was a little bit of an incident with a bat nearly hitting their son, but that everybody was O.K.

Cunningham had some bruises on his arm, but that was the worst of the injuries.

Much of the conversation on social media has focused on why the child was looking down at a phone when the bat came flying. Cunningham said Landon had borrowed the phone from him to take a photo of Ortiz, and was texting it to his mother.

So while he was looking at the picture, I made sure I was paying attention to everything, Cunningham added.

Indeed he was. The photographer said the series of shots leading up to the one most widely shared show the fathers instantaneous reaction, amid a wave of raised arms and panicked faces on other fans in the stands around him.

It was his instinct, Horner said. He was on the ball.

But is it really up to fans to be alert to safety hazards?

In June last year, a woman struck by a broken bat in Fenway Park sustained serious injuries. That was one of the cases that prompted Major League Baseball to recommend in December that all clubs erect protective netting that extends from the existing screen behind home plate to the closest edge of the dugout.

The netting at Champion Stadium did not extend to where the Cunninghams were sitting, a few rows up from the Braves dugout on the first-base side, but Horner described it as typical for a ballpark. A spokesman for the stadium could not be reached.

I made this photo of a guy being a hero, Horner said. But a split-second difference, and I would have had an image no one would have wanted to see.

Despite the close call, Landon, who plays baseball, said he had fun at the game. It was his first professional game  a treat for his birthday, which is next week.

Landon wasnt sure what to tell other fans about his experience, but his mother was.

Make sure you pay attention! she said.",[]
