In the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, Congress in 1978 passed the Inspector General Act, establishing independent watchdogs whose job it is to uncover waste, fraud or abuse across scores of federal departments and agencies.









These public servants are our eyes and ears within the executive branch, as Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa described them in December.

Under the 1978 law, inspectors general, who are based in the agencies, have access to all records needed to do their job. But since the early days of the Obama administration, many agencies have systematically thwarted that access for whole categories of information  including, most notably, grand jury testimony, personal credit data and information from wiretaps.

The effect has been to slow down investigations into, among other things, the shooting of civilians during Drug Enforcement Administration raids in Honduras, sexual assaults in the Peace Corps and the F.B.I.s antiterrorism powers. Inspectors general have spent time and taxpayer dollars arguing for access to documents they should, by law, have in hand  denying the American people the robust scrutiny of their federal government.

Last July, the Office of Legal Counsel, which provides legal opinions to the president, issued a 68-page memo defending this obstructive behavior. Because certain documents are protected by statute from being disclosed publicly, the memo reasoned, agency officials must determine whether to hand them over to inspectors general.

This makes no sense. The whole point of an independent monitor is to counteract the self-interest of the agency it monitors. Giving inspectors general access to critical information is not the same as making that information public. Congress understood this back in 1978, and it has since reiterated the need for total, unmediated access  most recently in 2014, when it barred federal agencies from spending any money to deny inspectors general timely access to all records.

Equally important, for nearly three decades no one questioned the authority of inspectors general to obtain sensitive or protected information, and no one accused them of mishandling it. The problems began in 2010, when lawyers for the Federal Bureau of Investigation started to claim that they were barred by law from handing over certain documents.

As it is, inspectors general already operate under significant constraints. They cannot tell agencies what to do; they can only issue reports and urge the agencies, or Congress, to take corrective action. And even those reports are vetted by the agencies themselves before release, which erects another barrier to transparency.

Still, the inspectors work has managed to expose thousands of cases of wrongdoing by government officials, including the F.B.I.s violation of its wiretapping and other intelligence-gathering procedures, the Justice Departments roundup of hundreds of illegal immigrants after the Sept. 11 attacks, and many more.

On Tuesday, the Justice Departments inspector general, Michael Horowitz, announced an investigation into the actions of the F.B.I.s Hostage Rescue Team during the late-January shooting in Oregon that led to the death of an anti-government activist.

The Justice Department, where the pushback against the inspectors generals work began in 2010, now supports giving its own inspector general full access to documents. But meaningful legislation must cover all 72 inspectors general.

Congress is currently considering a bipartisan bill, sponsored by Mr. Grassley, to make clear once again that inspectors general may not be hindered in performing basic, critical review. The bill has been held up in the Senate since last year for unexplained reasons.

It is no surprise that government officials dont want their wrongdoing or incompetence made public. Inspectors general are on the front lines of ensuring the transparency needed if government is to be held accountable. They should have unfettered access to the materials they need to do their job.",[]

For all I know, as I write these words, Nathan Lane is lying dead on a chaise longue on the stage of the Westside Theater.









Probably not. You would have read the obituary by now. But Mr. Lane, who gave the first New York performance of White Rabbit Red Rabbit, a playful, enigmatic and haunting solo show by the Iranian writer Nassim Soleimanpour, was lying supine on that chaise when I left the theater as strictly instructed Monday night, the only night of the week the show is being presented. The play concludes with the ominous suggestion that  well, perhaps I shouldnt say any more.

The novelty  or gimmick, or both  of White Rabbit is that the actor performing the show does not have a chance to read it before arriving at the theater. He (or she) is handed the script onstage, before us, with no prior knowledge of its contents (unless, of course, he or she has already Googled it and got a general sense of what is in store). Every week, a different actor will perform the 75-minute piece. The list of upcoming performers, a diverse and distinguished lot, includes Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Wilson, Brian Dennehy and Cynthia Nixon. (Check the shows website to see who is performing when.)

Mr. Lane, I am tempted to say, could hardly be bettered. Mr. Soleimanpours play allows for interpolations and ad-libs from the actor performing it (Mr. Lane raised his hand when he was departing from the text) and nobody but nobody has a quicker wit and a more deft ability to joust merrily with the audience than he does. When handed a mysterious vial of powder at the start, he quipped, Its the 80s again!

After a reference to audience participation  a not insignificant element  he joked that this was, for him, a blight on the world somewhere between incest and folk-dancing. And perhaps the only tedious passage of the show comes up front, when the audience is counted, or rather counts itself, one by one; thank God, I cracked to myself, aping Mr. Lane, we were not in the voluminous Gershwin Theater. (A tip for those who share Mr. Lanes aversion: Most of the people conscripted for larger roles came from the first couple of rows, or participated voluntarily.)

I thought for a few minutes that Mr. Lane might hijack Mr. Soleimanpours play entirely and treat us to a Nathan Lane show, and who would complain? But Mr. Lane is also a dedicated and serious actor, great funnyman though he is, and he honored the playwrights words dutifully (if, yes, continuing to add his own marvelous asides here and there).

Reviewers have been admonished not to give away much about what transpires during these 75 minutes, so my hands are tied, to a certain degree. Maybe this is appropriate, since the play comments implicitly on the strictures that all artists  indeed, all citizens  in Iran and other authoritarian states must confront and negotiate on a daily basis.

Authoritarian regimes do not allow for freedom of artistic expression, of course. So among the shivery aspects of the play is the ghostly presence of the writer  absent and present, simultaneously  and ever in danger of being silenced, whether by the oppression of the countrys rulers or, more darkly, the anguish and despair that this can induce. (The program notes that by the time Mr. Soleimanpour was allowed to travel outside Iran, in 2013, White Rabbit, his first play, had been performed more than 200 times in 15 languages.)

The play also addresses obliquely  and you soon become aware that writers living in repressive cultures must cloak their ideas in symbols  the oppression of women in some Muslim nations; the alienation that living in such cultures can engender; and the universal human tendency to obey authority, whether its the laws under which people must live, or the text and directions an actor (or an audience member) has just been handed and told to perform.

Among the things I will say is that the actor performing the play is required to portray one animal playing another (no, not a rabbit), and that the play is a conversation among playwright, performer and audience, a conversation that, for all its diverting humor, takes on a gravity that prickles your skin when we are reminded that the author might not have the freedom to even see the performance we are watching. Exhortations to send him an email (we are given the address) enhance the sense of his disconnection from the wider world.

The title in fact refers to an experiment supposedly performed by the writers uncle, in which hungry rabbits had to compete for a lone carrot. This was another metaphor, to be read in any number of ways, for the brutality and divisiveness that living under an authoritarian regime may induce, but more broadly a general comment on human behavior.

Ill admit that I got a bit perplexed during the extensive discussion of the white rabbits and the red rabbits. Some other passages slide perilously close to pretentiousness, and much is shrouded in obscurity and frisky quirkiness. But Mr. Soleimanpours elliptical play keeps taking odd, unexpected turns that often lead us back to the relief of laughter.

Any worthy theatrical experience is, on some level, a dive down into a rabbit hole, where the destination is unknown, even if we know the play well. The distinction of White Rabbit Red Rabbit is that the performer moves right alongside us on the journey.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,The Cosby Case: Where Things Stand,['Graham Bowley'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Bill Cosby had once been due in a Pennsylvania court on Tuesday for a hearing in the only criminal case that has been brought out of the many sexual assault accusations leveled at the once-beloved entertainer. A judicial ruling last week, though, suspended those proceedings, perhaps for many months. Below are questions and answers to help untangle the complexities of that case and five civil suits in which Mr. Cosby is also embroiled.









What is the criminal case about?

Dogged by allegations of sexual misconduct for years, Mr. Cosby, 78, was charged in December with sexual assault in the case of a woman, Andrea Constand, who said he drugged and sexually abused her in 2004 at his home in a Philadelphia suburb. Until then, Mr. Cosby, who denies all wrongdoing, had never been charged with a crime.

Why did it take more than 11 years to bring charges?

An initial investigation in 2005 ended when prosecutors in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, concluded there was not enough credible evidence to bring the case to trial. But prosecutors reinvestigated last year. They say that the new inquiry was sparked by the dozens of women who came forward, starting in the fall of 2014, to say they, too, had been drugged or assaulted by Mr. Cosby.

In addition, parts of a deposition Mr. Cosby later gave in a 2005 civil case brought by Ms. Constand were revealed last year. In them, Mr. Cosby acknowledged obtaining quaaludes as part of his effort to have sex with women. Prosecutors say the recent accusations and the deposition testimony are included in the new evidence prompting them to bring charges.

Why was the criminal case suspended this month?

Mr. Cosby is trying to have the criminal charges dismissed, arguing that the Montgomery County district attorney at the time of the initial investigation made a binding commitment that he would not be prosecuted in the Constand case. The former district attorney, Bruce L. Castor Jr., says he made the pledge so that Mr. Cosby would testify in Ms. Constands subsequent civil suit without fear of prosecution based on what he said. Mr. Cosby testified and the suit ended in 2006 with him paying Ms. Constand a financial settlement.

Last month, Judge Steven T. ONeill of the state Court of Common Pleas rejected Mr. Cosbys bid to dismiss the charges; his lawyers appealed to the states Superior Court. The sitting district attorney, Kevin R. Steele, has moved to quash Mr. Cosbys appeal and the Superior Court suspended the criminal case while it considers Mr. Steeles arguments.

Whats next?

The Superior Court review of Mr. Steeles motion to quash the appeal could last several weeks, if not months. If the court agrees with the prosecution, then criminal proceedings would resume. If the Superior Court chooses to hear Mr. Cosbys appeal, a new round of deliberations would start.

The court could then dismiss the case entirely or rule that it should go forward. Either way, deliberations could take several more months, possibly pushing a criminal trial to late this year or even into 2017.

Even if the case proceeds, Mr. Cosbys lawyers may still try to suppress his testimony in Ms. Constands civil suit, arguing that he would never have sat for the deposition had he known it could be used against him.

What are the civil suits about?

Mr. Cosby faces four defamation suits  three in Massachusetts and one in California  filed by 10 women who say that he sexually assaulted them, typically decades ago. They came forward after it was no longer possible to file a lawsuit charging sexual assault because the statute of limitations had expired. So they have sued him for defamation, claiming they were branded as liars when Mr. Cosbys lawyers and other representatives dismissed their allegations as fabrications.

In one of the civil cases, lawyers have successfully fought to depose Mr. Cosbys wife, Camille, who was also his business manager. They are also fighting to avoid any delay caused by the criminal deliberations, arguing that their clients should be able to proceed with depositions regardless of the criminal case.

A fifth defamation suit, by a woman in Pittsburgh, was thrown out in January by a judge who said that statements by Mr. Cosby, his wife and his lawyer amounted to opinions protected by the First Amendment.

Are there any other civil cases against Mr. Cosby?

One woman, Judy Huth, is suing Mr. Cosby in California, asserting that he forced her to perform a sex act on him at the Playboy Mansion in 1974, when she was 15. Californias statute of limitations is extended for adults who contend they were victims of sexual abuse as children, her lawyers say.

A sixth suit was withdrawn by Chloe Goins, who said Mr. Cosby assaulted her in 2008. The suit was dropped after prosecutors in California said they would not bring sexual assault charges.

What does Mr. Cosby say?

Mr. Cosby has said that any sexual relations were consensual. He has responded to the seven women suing him in federal court in Massachusetts by, in turn, suing them for defamation. He is also suing Ms. Constand, her mother and her lawyers, seeking the return of money from the 2006 confidential financial settlement. He says they broke the agreement by, among other things, voluntarily cooperating with the Montgomery County prosecutors.

But he recently dropped a lawsuit against another woman he was suing for defamation, the former supermodel Beverly Johnson. His lawyers said that it was too difficult to pursue both the civil case and his criminal case in Pennsylvania but that they intended to refile.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Balkan Nations Shut Down March of Migrants,['Sewell Chan'],"LONDON  The route that more than one million migrants have used to traverse southeastern Europe was effectively shut down Wednesday, when four Balkan nations stopped waving the migrants through on their journey northward.









The four countries  Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia and Macedonia  have closed their borders to new migrants with the implicit backing of the European Union, which announced an agreement with Turkey on Tuesday to slow the flow of migrants.

The deal has not been completed  that is supposed to happen at a summit meeting next week. But within hours of the announcement from Brussels, Slovenia and Serbia announced new restrictions on the entry of migrants.

From midnight, there will be no more migration on the Western Balkan route as it took place so far, the interior minister of Slovenia, Vesna Gyorkos Znidar, said on Tuesday evening.

Serbia quickly followed suit on Wednesday. Serbia cannot allow itself to become a collective center for refugees, so it will harmonize all its measures with those of the E.U. member states, the countrys Interior Ministry said in a statement.

Prime Minister Tihomir Oreskovic of Croatia said at a news conference on Wednesday: The message is clear. Illegal migrants will no longer pass along this route.

Mr. Oreskovic said the agreement with Turkey had reduced the incentive for migrants to head to Europe. Like other leaders, he attributed the problem to traffickers who lure migrants into taking dangerous voyages across the Aegean Sea. In what way can we destroy this business model? he asked. Thats what it is, a business model.

The decision by the four Balkan countries does not affect regular vistors, like tourists or business travelers, but it is an effort to stop undocumented migrants from passing through the countries to seek asylum elsewhere. Very few migrants have applied for asylum in the Balkan countries.

The shutdown of the migrant corridor is consistent with an effort by Brussels to restore order after the asylum system broke down last year.

Under the new agreement with Turkey, any unauthorized migrant arriving in Greece will be automatically sent back to Turkey, and for each Syrian sent back, the European Union will resettle a Syrian refugee from Turkey.

The European Union has also pledged to expand humanitarian aid to help Turkey deal with the 2.7 million Syrian migrants living there; to expedite visa-free travel for Turks; and to reopen long-stalled negotiations over Turkeys application to join the 28-nation bloc.

Human rights groups, however, have objected to the European Unions proposed deal with Turkey, saying that returning asylum-seeking migrants en masse without first assessing their legal applications for refuge violate international law. About 2,000 migrants a day are entering Greece, observers have reported.

Lots of misery here at Idomeni border as 13K are trapped, 2 days of rains forecast, Peter Bouckaert, the emergencies director at Human Rights Watch, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday morning, referring to the Greek village near the Macedonian border, where people have been pouring through in recent months, under increasingly miserable conditions.

As of Wednesday night, Mr. Bouckaert said, migrants appeared to be leaving Idomeni for other points within Greece  as word of the blocked route through the Balkans rippled through the encampments.

The situation in much of the region seemed wretched, though not nearly as bad as the scenes of migrants stranded at the Budapest train station and at a camp in Calais, France, that became known as the Jungle.

In Slovenia, about 460 of the nearly 478,000 migrants who have entered the country since last October have applied for asylum there; the rest moved northward, with ambitions of reaching Germany and Sweden and other countries viewed as friendlier to asylum seekers.

In Croatia, 408 migrants are stuck in a camp in a small northern town of Slavonski Brod. Were in the process of defining the terms of their return to Greece, Croatias interior minister, Vlaho Orepic, said on Wednesday, without further explanation.

United Nations officials say there are around 1,000 migrants in Serbia and 1,500 in Macedonia.

In northern Macedonia, 437 people were stranded, unable to enter Serbia but unwilling to return to the squalid conditions of the reception center in the northern village of Tabanovce, where some 1,000 people were stuck. Many were women and children. As many as 2,000 people were stranded in Serbia, the United Nations refugee agency reported.

Greece remains the largest bottleneck; around 34,000 migrants are scattered around the country, on islands close to the Turkish coast; in the capital, Athens; and in the countrys second-largest city, Thessaloniki.

The European Union has given tacit approval to the actions of these countries, as it strives to restore order to the asylum-seeking process and to restore the integrity of the Schengen area, the 26-nation passport-free travel zone that is one of the blocs most tangible accomplishments.

Slovenia and Croatia are members of the European Union, and Serbia and Macedonia hope to join. Of the four countries, only Slovenia is part of the Schengen area. (Greece is also part of Schengen.)

Natasha Bertaud, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, the European Unions executive body, said that Slovenias decision to block refugees was part of the effort to restore order.

What this means is that third-country nationals who do not satisfy the entry conditions into the Schengen area, or who have not made an asylum request despite having had the opportunity to do so, will not be given entry into Slovenia, Ms. Bertaud said at a news conference.

The Slovenian policy was step toward ending the wave-through approach, she added.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-04 00:00:00,More Support for Early Exposure to Peanuts to Prevent Allergies,['Andrew Pollack'],"Photo

LOS ANGELES  Evidence is accumulating that food allergies in children might be prevented by feeding peanuts and other allergenic food to infants in their first year of life, researchers reported here Friday.

That finding would challenge the recommendation of the World Health Organization that babies be fed exclusively breast milk for the first six months of life.

At least as far as peanut is concerned, I would recommend parting from that, Dr. Gideon Lack, professor of pediatric allergy at Kings College London, said in an interview.

Dr. Lack was the senior author of a study last year that found feeding peanuts to young children starting when they are 4 to 11 months old sharply reduced the risk of their developing peanut allergies.

That upended the conventional wisdom that it is best to avoid introducing peanuts until children are older.

On Friday, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which helped pay for that study, issued proposed new guidelines recommending that children at risk of peanut allergies be fed peanuts starting at 4 to 6 months of age, though they should be tested first to make sure they do not already have an allergy.

But that initial study also left several unanswered questions. Some of those questions were answered by two additional studies that were set to be published online in The New England Journal of Medicine and were presented here at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology on Friday.

One question was whether children who consume peanuts from an early age will still remain free of allergies if they stop consuming them. The researchers followed the children from the original study for another year, from the time they turned 5 until they turned 6. For that year, they were not supposed to eat peanuts at all. The results found no big increase in allergies. It tells you the protective effect is stable, Dr. Lack said.

Another question was whether the early feeding technique could be applied to other types of foods and to children at normal risk of allergies. (The original study involved children deemed to have a high risk of peanut allergy.)

The researchers conducted a second study at Kings College London involving 1,300 infants who were 3 months old and being fed only breast milk. Half were randomly assigned to continue on only breast milk until 6 months of age, which is the recommended practice in Britain by the United Kingdom Department of Health.The other half were to be regularly fed small amounts of peanut butter and five other allergenic foods: eggs, yogurt, sesame, white fish and wheat. The children were assessed for allergies when they turned 3.

Over all, 5.6 percent of the infants who were fed the allergenic foods early on developed an allergy to at least one of the six foods, a modest improvement from the 7.1 percent in the breast-milk-only group. However, the difference was not statistically significant, meaning it could have occurred by chance.

One problem was that fewer than half of the parents in the early-introduction group actually fed their children the required six foods on a regular basis. But when researchers looked only at those children whose parents adhered to the feeding regimen, there was a statistically significant reduction in allergies. Only 2.4 percent of those children developed a food allergy, compared with 7.3 percent of those whose parents faithfully stuck to only breast milk for six months. There were also significant reductions in peanut and egg allergies alone.

One conclusion could be that feeding allergenic foods to infants early really does work to prevent allergies, providing that parents consistently follow the feeding regimen.

But researchers cautioned that there could be another explanation. One reason parents stopped feeding the foods is that they thought their children were having a possible allergic reaction to them. In that case, looking only at the children who were actually fed the food would overstate the effectiveness of the technique.

Dr. Lack said he did not think that was an explanation because the children in the early-introduction group whose parents did not adhere to the feeding protocol did not have an unusually high rate of allergies at age 3.

Dr. James R. Baker Jr., chief executive of Food Allergy Research & Education, a patient advocacy group, said that even if the benefits of early introduction were not totally clear for all the foods, there appeared to be little harm from that practice.

I think for a very long time here weve vilified these foods, he said at a news conference here. Theres no reason not to do this. Theres no harm that comes from early introduction.

In a commentary in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Gary W.K. Wong, a pediatrician at Chinese University of Hong Kong, cautioned against unproven conclusions. He said the fact that so many parents did not stick to the regimen suggested that it was too demanding to be practical and that less-burdensome ways must be found to introduce allergenic foods early.

In the meantime, he said, evidence is building that early consumption rather than delayed introduction of foods is likely to be more beneficial as a strategy for the primary prevention of food allergy.",[]

THURSDAY PUZZLE  Heres what can happen when your mother eagerly signs you up for music lessons when youre a child and you dont pay attention: You grow up to be a crossword puzzle blogger, responsible for explaining the puzzle to a large number of people, and then you wind up solving  or rather, not solving  a crossword that incorporates music notation theory as part of the theme. Its like one of those stress dreams we all have, but this is for real.

Somewhere in Florida, my mother is laughing her behind off.

This is as good a time as any to admit to you that I had to look at the answers to crack the theme. That is not as bad as it sounds; who amongst us has not revealed an answer here or there? No one, thats who, and that is a good lesson for all you beginning solvers out there. Dont feel that you cant take a peek if you think youll learn something from it. That knowledge is stored away for the next time you will see it in a puzzle. Streaks be damned. [Cleans off the remains of the tomatoes thrown at me.]

Sidenote: I originally thought this puzzle was going to be a commentary about footballs DEFLATEGATE and that the black squares in the lower center of the grid represented goalposts. You see how misdirected you can get on a Thursday?

Anyway, if, unlike me, you did not fall asleep in music theory class, you will recognize that there are supposed to be two musical notes in three of the squares of Andrew Zhous mirror symmetry puzzle. Each note is used once: one note for the Across entry and one note for the Down entry. For example, at 16 Across and 6 Down, we have the respective entries MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY and THE SHARPER IMAGE. Where the two entries cross, we have the two rebus elements: F NATURAL going across and E SHARP going down.

And because you havent had enough agita for the day, all of the notes are different. If you are solving this on the web or in our app, please note that the accepted entries are supposed to be either the entire entry (either Across or Down) or the first letter. So, for 16 Across and 6 Down, the accepted answers should be F NATURAL, F, E SHARP or E.

As a public service, I would like to present you with the six theme entries:

16A/6D: MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY / THE SHARPER IMAGE

65A/53D: LOOKING SHARP / GET A FLAT

66A/55D: DEFLATEGATE / CARD SHARP

In addition, Mr. Zhou has thrown in some long Downs that highlight the theme, MUSICAL NOTE and TWO TONE CARS (sort of). For my money, One added to the staff? also wins Clue of the Day.

Constructors Notes:

A couple of months back, Evan Birnholz espoused his theory that music and crossing words have much to do with one another. Ive always thought that a good crossword works like a piece of Bachian counterpoint, in which both the vertical (harmony) and the horizontal (melody) are required to maintain absolute integrity. In that spirit, todays puzzle puns in the form of ENHARMONIC spellings, wherein the same sounded pitch (in equal temperament) is notated in two different ways. I hope it offers a significant contribution to the canon of musical puns, which includes beloved classics like, If you dont C-sharp, youll B-flat. Heres to a music-filled Thursday!

And that is why I failed to solve todays crossword puzzle, Officer. Please dont tell my mother.

We just have to move on to the Friday puzzle with this song:

Many people take a daily low-dose aspirin to lower the risk of heart disease, and several studies have shown that regular aspirin use reduces the risk for some cancers. Now a long-term analysis has found that its population-wide benefits against cancer may be even greater than previously believed.

Researchers studied aspirin use in 135,965 health care professionals, men and women, tracking their health for as long as 32 years. Over the course of the study, published in JAMA Oncology, there were 27,985 cases of cancer.

Regular aspirin use reduced the risk for all cancers by about 3 percent, though it had no impact on the risk for breast, lung or prostate cancer.

But regular aspirin use reduced the risk for all gastrointestinal cancers by 15 percent, and for cancers of the colon and rectum by 19 percent.

The senior author, Dr. Andrew T. Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard, pointed out that even people who undergo regular colorectal screening can develop cancers, and aspirin could help prevent some of those cancers as well.

Based on our estimates, Dr. Chan said, we think that regular aspirin use could prevent almost 30,000 cases of gastrointestinal cancers a year, which account for almost 25 percent of all cancer deaths. So I think thats pretty substantial.",[]

I dont need to introduce him to you, but if I did, I would say that Mr. Reiner transformed the landscape of comedy through his work on Your Show of Shows, The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Jerk, Oceans 11 and oh, my, how could I forget his partnership with Mel Brooks in The 2,000 Year-Old Man? He is a winner of multiple Emmys and exactly one Grammy. The third volume of his memoirs, What I Forgot To Remember, comes out on April 10, 2015.

To celebrate the publication of his book and his guest appearance here on Wordplay, Mr. Reiner was also kind enough to provide us with some relevant bonus content which I highly encourage you to read by clicking here.

Before you do that, however, please enjoy Mr. Reiners take on Finn Vigelands Monday puzzle:

Carl Reiners Notes:

I am an avid crossword puzzle player. I am a whiz at completing a Monday puzzle in the L.A. Times, almost a whiz at doing the Monday New York Times and am fairly confident that I will complete or almost complete their Tuesday puzzles. The possibility of success for the rest of the week diminishes each day and rarely do I ever attempt the weekend offerings. In those Monday puzzles I so appreciate the clues that ask Giants right fielder, Mel or Early German film director and star, Von Stroheim or Man of a thousand faces, Chaney, or early silent film stars, Lillian and Dorothy, or film Tarzan. It was a pleasure, without hesitation, to write in, Ott, Eric, Gish, Lon, or Ron and once Ely, the first and second names of the man who played Tarzan. At times I was thrilled and delighted to read clues such as  Fritz, Carl or Rob, or Robs filmmaker father. Or Carls filmmaker son. In approaching the challenge of filling in some of the tougher boxes of these easy puzzles, I resorted to writing in (with a pen, I am that confident) a few ss and ds, the last letters of words that were obviously either plural or past tense. Actually, I also filled in an e before the s or the d. Today, being Monday, I am proud to say that, in the loo, I was able to fill in all but one letter of The New York Timess puzzle. The clue for the last missing letter was, ___ My Ride, (old MTV series). That letter was a p as in Pimp. I added that p a few seconds after leaving the loo. To be honest, I did not know of that old MTV series but, Aaron Davis, one of my publishers, did and he coached me as I wrote it in.

Thank you, Mr. Reiner. Its an honor to have you here.

And lets also check in with Mr. Vigeland, todays constructor:

Constructors Notes:

When I first started constructing, I gravitated toward the thrill of constructing complicated themes or adventurous themelesses, thinking it was a better test of my constructing skills. But Id also always heard from veteran puzzlers how difficult it is to make a good Monday puzzle: find a simple theme, but not an overdone one, then fill it with interesting words, but dont make it too hard. Today is my first foray into easy puzzle territory. At first, Will thought it was almost too easy, since you can write in the whole theme once you get one of the sets of circled letters. Im glad we agreed that the lively fill made it worth your time. Heres hoping that my non-puzzle friends are able to solve this one!

Lets move on to the Tuesday puzzle with some wisdom from the 2,000 Year-Old Man:

IT might seem like a good time to be a long-haul trucker: More than ever, the American economy relies on hundreds of thousands of 18-wheelers to move goods across the country. But the industry is in crisis, with drivers leaving in droves because of low pay and poor working conditions.









A big part of the problem is that when it comes to long-haul trucking, the governments focus has been almost entirely on road safety. Thats not a misplaced concern; highway accidents involving semis kill about 5,000 people per year. But it overlooks a critical concern: the well-being of the drivers themselves.

We have inside knowledge of the trucking industry and the kinds of working conditions that truckers endure every day. One of us  Professor Balay  is a former long-haul trucker who does ethnographic research on blue-collar workers. The other, Professor Shattell, is a researcher and registered nurse who has studied the mental, physical and sexual health of truckers.

We know better than most why the allure of long-haul trucking is so strong: Behind the wheel of a semi, drivers feel connected to  almost one with  all that power. The job involves a high degree of skill and focus; floating the gears takes coordination and timing, maneuvering that bulk takes visual perceptiveness and courage, and surviving against the odds of weather, mountains, construction zones, cultural scorn and boredom takes a certain kind of toughness. Truckers take pride in their work, especially given that there are precious few other meaningful blue-collar jobs out there these days.

And yet when it comes to the operation of those big machines, the federal government seems to have forgotten that there are actual people behind the wheel. Drivers are largely regulated by the Department of Transportation, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, not the Department of Labor. That allows the government to address highway safety through things like maximum driving hours, mandatory rest times and annual physicals.

Such steps are meant to keep our roads safe, and they indirectly help drivers. But it also leaves them exposed to inhumane and demeaning work conditions, including abusive amounts of surveillance and micromanaging. Truckers are told what route to take, where to buy gas and for how much, when and where to sleep. They work 14-hour days routinely and continuously, often without weekends, sick pay or holiday pay. They drive 11 of those hours, and perform other work for the remaining three: loading, vehicle maintenance and a lot of waiting.

This mistreatment doesnt just harm the drivers. By forcing experienced workers to leave the industry, it leads employers to hire younger and less capable drivers. Under pressure from the industry, last month the Senate approved a pilot program that will allow 18-year-olds to drive semis across state lines, even though the 18- to 21-year-old demographic has one of the highest accident rates.

It also undermines truck-safety rules themselves: As long as drivers arent behind the wheel, the Department of Transportation lets employers do what they want with their drivers  which usually means they get back on the road unrested and irritated, hardly the person you want driving an 18-wheeler.

None of this is a secret; drivers have been raising concerns for years. But rather than improving working conditions and increasing requirements for rest, or regulating the companies themselves, legislators typically respond to truck-accident rates by amping up surveillance of truck drivers. Often speed is governed, with the truck unable to go over a specific speed; in other cases a sensor measures the distance from the front of the truck to the vehicle ahead, automatically braking if the space is deemed insufficient. Some companies even have two-way cameras trained on truck drivers 24/7. (Meanwhile, a new rule limiting a truckers workweek to 70 hours, down from 82, has been suspended since 2014.)

Its not that Congress hasnt tried; its that the few labor laws that do exist have been passed piecemeal, so they do more harm than good.

Take a recent rule requiring that truckers with sleep apnea use a continuous positive airway pressure machine when theyre asleep in their trucks. The machines are supposed to help truckers sleep better, which is great. But they also need power to run, more power than a truck battery can provide, so truckers have to run their engines. But many states forbid drivers to idle their trucks. So truckers often cant win  they must break one of these laws. No wonder they leave.

The solution isnt easy, but it is straightforward. Congress needs to give the Department of Labor the power to regulate truck drivers working conditions, and mandate that it coordinate its policies with the Department of Transportation. The upshot should be to extend the variety of workplace protections available to almost all American workers to the millions of men and women driving the nations commercial trucking fleet.

After all, the best way to protect the people driving alongside Americas long-haul trucks is to protect the people behind the wheel of those trucks, too.",[]

SUNDAY PUZZLE  April of this year marks the 400th anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare, and David J. Kahn is back with a puzzle about some of the Bards characters.

But hark, as the Bard no doubt would have said: What hath happened to our clues? All of the theme entry clues say See blurb. In case you missed it, the blurb is a Notepad that says The answers to 23-, 31-, 45-, 62-, 69-, 90-, 103- and 115-Across are themselves clues to the names spelled by their circled letters. That means that you will have to first solve the puzzle to get the clues, and then you will find the answers to the clue/answers inside the shaded/circled squares. Got that?

Not really? O.K., lets spell it out (sorry). Did you note the puzzles title, In Character? Thats a big hint to the theme. If you can solve 23 Across using the crossings, you get COMRADE OF MERCUTIO, and the shaded/circled letters inside that phrase spell out ROMEO, who was, in fact a COMRADE OF MERCUTIO. The character is in the clue, which is also the answer. Forget it, you guys; its Stratford-upon-Avon.

Here are the rest of them:

31A: BANQUET GHOST / BANQUO

45A: ELDERLY MONARCH / LEAR

62A: SCHEMER AGAINST CAESAR / CASCA

69A: LOVE INTEREST OF OLIVIA / VIOLA

90A: EVIL ANTAGONIST / IAGO

103A: MACABRE THANE / MACBETH

115A: UNHAPPY MALCONTENT / HAMLET

Clue of the Day for me was Italian fine? for BENE, followed by One carrying a toon? for CEL. I thought that 118 Downs answer was N.F.L. for Packers org., and was unpleasantly surprised when it turned out to be N.R.A. Oh well.

Lets hear from Mr. Kahn:

Constructors Notes:

I had just seen Something Rotten!, a very funny Broadway musical, and I was looking to do something to commemorate the upcoming 400th anniversary of Shakespeares death. The theme came to me when I realized that FRIEND OF MERCUTIO (where FRIEND later became COMRADE) included the name ROMEO. Coming up with other answers and getting this puzzle accepted was a struggle. My original submission had a few themed answers Will and Joel felt were either contrived (OPHELIAS COMPLEX SUITOR, anyone?) or hid characters with only four letters in 21-letter answers (e.g., VILLAIN UNDOING OTHELLO). They liked the concept, though, so I focused on shortening the answers and adding some 5-, 6- and 7-letter characters. I stuck to Shakespeares more popular plays and Will/Joel offered a lot of feedback along the way. Finally, deleting SHAKESPEARE as an answer, which I did at the very end, makes for more of an aha moment.

If you would like to join the observance, which is being called Shakespeare400 online, you can start here.

And while were talking iambic pentameter, lets watch Robin Williamss brilliant take on the playwright:

The surprisingly dangerous Caitlin Lovinger will be sitting in for me while Im on vacation. Happy solving, and Ill see you all when I get back.

LONDON  They have been called the Diamond Geezers and the Bad Grandpas: four thieves in their 60s and 70s who used diamond-tipped drills to break into a safe deposit company in London and make off with plastic garbage bins stuffed with $20 million in gems, gold and cash.









In a case that prosecutors have called the largest burglary in English history, three of the ringleaders  Daniel Jones, 61; Terrence Perkins, 67; and John Collins, 75  were each sentenced to seven years in prison on Wednesday at a court in southeast London.

Brian Reader, 77, another ringleader, whom the others called The Master, is in a prison hospital after having had a stroke and is expected to be sentenced at a later date. All four had pleaded guilty.

Three other men  Hugh Doyle, 48; William Lincoln, 50; and Carl Wood, 58  played lesser roles, including helping to either store, transfer or conceal the stolen valuables. On Wednesday, Mr. Lincoln was sentenced to seven years in jail, and Mr. Wood to six years, while Mr. Doyle received a suspended sentence.

Around Easter last year, members of the white-haired gang slid down an elevator shaft at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. in Londons diamond district. Once inside, they disabled the alarm system and bored three large holes through about 20 inches of reinforced concrete. Over four days  including a two-day break to buy a hydraulic pump  they ransacked 73 safe deposit boxes.

As the judge read out their sentences, the three ringleaders, several of them using electronic hearing aids, were individually asked to stand up in a glass enclosure at the back of the court.

Mr. Jones, wearing a plum-colored sweater, stared ahead blankly. Thank you, judge, he said, after the sentence was read out.

The men appeared resigned but shuffled uncomfortably in their seats. As he was led out of court, Mr. Jones blew a kiss to relatives in the gallery.

Judge Christopher Kinch said the burglary had stood out for the scale of its ambition and the value of the property stolen. This must rank among the worst offenses of its type, he said.

The case, which captivated Britain and made headlines around the world, presented two contrasting narratives. The defense sought to portray the gang as pill-popping, doddering old men, with ailments such as diabetes and bladder-control problems, who had engaged in a nonviolent folly. They were so inept, defense lawyers argued, that they had used the book Forensics for Dummies to help prepare for their crime.

But the prosecution depicted the men as ruthless and selfish criminals who, the police said, had wanted to sweeten their pension pots and were robust enough to wield heavy power tools. Mr. Reader, prosecutors said, had been a close associate of Kenneth Noye, one of Britains most dangerous gangsters who is serving a life sentence for a 1996 murder. Prosecutors said Mr. Reader had teamed up with Mr. Noye to help launder $40 million in stolen gold after a theft at Heathrow Airport in 1983, known as the Brinks-Mat robbery.

Mr. Perkins also has a long criminal record. He participated in a notorious robbery, also in 1983, in which a hooded gang with sawed-off shotguns stole about $8.6 million in cash from a London security company.

The police also emphasized on Wednesday that the gang had ruined the lives of dozens of victims who had kept their life savings in the safe deposit company. Craig Turner, head of the police unit that investigated the case, warned the public not to feel sorry for the perpetrators. They are all callous career criminals, he said.

The defense, however, maintained that the thieves were being unfairly treated as dangerous criminals, held in a high-security prison with only about 30 minutes a day to exercise. It is a comedy, Mr. Doyle, a plumber who has been out on bail, said in an interview outside the courtroom before the sentencing, referring to the fact that he had spent six months in a prison that is also used to hold terrorists.

Members of the gang were plucky and eccentric, the jury heard during the trial. Mr. Jones wore a fez and sometimes slept in his mothers dressing gown, alongside his dog, Rocket. Mr. Lincoln was known by the others as Billy the Fish, after a character in a comic strip, because he made extra cash by supplying seafood to his friends.

While the gang members had long criminal records, during their trial they often came across as bumbling and ill prepared. The crew learned to use their high-tech drills by watching YouTube. Mr. Reader took a bus to the robbery, using his free pass for seniors. The men also continued to use their cellphones and cars weeks after the crime, making it easy for the police to track them. And they hid some of the stolen goods under a gravestone in a Victorian cemetery in North London.

This was a 1980s team taking on 21st-century law enforcement, Peter Rowlands, Mr. Perkinss defense attorney, said in court.

The gang also made one big and amateurish mistake: They bragged about what they had done  often in expletive-laced Cockney rhyming slang. Their boasts were picked up by bugs that the police had installed in their cars, which officers had tracked after security cameras near the safe deposit company had recorded their license plates. Lip readers working for Scotland Yard also recorded their boasts at a pub.

Prosecutors said that about two-thirds of the valuables had not yet been recovered and that the sentences of the thieves could be extended at a hearing next year if they did not pay back what they had stolen.

Also casting a shadow over the case is the mystery of a fifth ringleader, called Basil, who the police suspect disabled the alarm and who is still at large. Basils lanky frame and distinctive red hair were captured by a security camera during the burglary, though the red hair may have been a wig.

In February, Mr. Jones wrote a letter to Sky News saying Basil was the brains of the operation and describing him as a former police officer who was involved in private security. Mr. Jones said that he did not know Basils true identity, and that he would not reveal it even if he did.

The police are concerned that Basil may have fled the country with millions of dollars in stolen valuables, and Scotland Yard on Wednesday renewed its offer of 20,000 pounds, or about $28,500, for information leading to his arrest.

Philip Evans, the leading prosecutor, noted in an interview that the case had sometimes seemed like a cross between Dads Army, a BBC comedy series about aging Home Guard soldiers during World War II, and the movie Oceans Eleven.

The audacity of the crime, Mr. Evans said, was exceptional.",[]

In political circles, it was the equivalent of Dylan goes electric  or at least Rose McGowan goes bald.









When Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, the clean-cut new Speaker of the House, showed an out-of-character beard on Instagram following the Thanksgiving break, the press corps greeted it as one of the most politically potent sets of whiskers since Benjamin Harrison, with his Socrates chin fuzz, stalked the White House in the 1890s.

Journalists and pundits mused about whether Mr. Ryans neatly cropped stubble, which suggested vintage George Michael as much as urban woodsman, signaled a significant political statement.

In a country riven by factionalism, it was little surprise that opinions were sharply divided.

What is Paul Ryan thinking? the National Review asked. Grow the economy, not facial hair. Cut taxes, as well as whiskers.

GQ was also skeptical, calling it the eye-roll-inducing style move equivalent to your father showing up to dinner on a skateboard.

Photo

The New York Post gave the beard a thumbs up: In our opinion, he now looks less like the frat boy youd pick a fight with in government class and more like a top dog.

In ditching his razor, the speaker may be proving that he is in tune with cultural currents that run deeper than the prevailing Brooklyn street styles.

After all, politics these days seems to be about running as an anti-establishment outsider. The tsunami in the Republican Party, as displayed with abandon by the support of Trump and Carson, is that the outsider is in, said Tammy Haddad, a Washington media consultant and former political director of MSNBC.

Even though Mr. Ryans job is the center of the entire political system, she said, the beard shows that hes not of Washington, hes not part of the system.

The speaker himself seemed to acknowledge this, sounding both proud and self-conscious on Instagram, writing: Waiting on confirmation from the House Historian, but apparently, Im the first Speaker to sport a beard in about 100 years.

A fact check by Alan Rappeport on The New York Timess First Draft politics blog showed that he was pretty close; the last bearded house speaker was named (irony alert) Frederick H. Gillett, who held the post until 1925.

There was a time when beards were the political mainstream. Starting with Abraham Lincoln in 1861, beards were popular with presidents for a half-century. But no president since William Howard Taft (1909-1913), with his extravagant handlebar, has padded through the White House garden with visible whiskers (unless you count Richard Nixons Flintstone-esque five oclock shadow).

According to the book Of Beards and Men, by Christopher Oldstone-Moore, Thomas A. Dewey, a two-time presidential loser, addressed the facial-hair issue in 1950. Dewey, whose cookie-duster mustache made him look like the priggish Higgins from Magnum P.I., told a Boy Scout troop: Any boy can become president  unless hes got a mustache.

Indeed, for much of the 20th century, beards were the stuff mostly of Marxist guerrillas (Fidel Castro, Ho Chi Minh), campus radicals and, later, sensitive 70s types.

In recent years, growing a beard in American politics was often interpreted as a sign of dropping out, like when Al Gore donned whiskers following his 2000 presidential loss.

Sure, there have been exceptions. The Former New Jersey Senator Jon Corzine wore a beard in the 2000s, but as a onetime Goldman Sachs chief executive, his Washington image always read more slumming rich guy than political lifer.

And Jay Carney, the former Obama spokesman, drew gasps when he strode to the podium last January with a new set of whiskers.

Given these politically sensitive times, its safe to assume that Mr. Ryan considered the implications of his style experiment.

Indeed, the official explanation seemed carefully crafted: This was a hunting beard, the product of weekend at a deer camp, said a spokeswoman for the speaker. (Subtext: I hunt. I am an alpha male).

That message is politically expedient, said Mr. Oldstone-Moore, the beard book author. As leader of a fractious party, a lot of people would like a piece of him, he said. He is signaling with his face what he has been saying in so many words: I will lead on my own terms, I am my own man, and will not take guff from anyone.

During a conversation on Tuesday with Mike Allen of Politico, Mr. Ryan said he had kept his beard thus far because both I havent gotten my bow kill yet and his wife, Janna, is tolerant, allowing him to keep this for a little while.(Subtext: Im not that kind of alpha male; Im sensitive to women voters).

That message has populist appeal, according to Bernard Whitman, a pollster who has worked for Bill Clinton and Michael R. Bloomberg. The beard makes him look cool and contemporary, Mr. Whitman said, which makes him more appealing to women, gays and millennials.

The debate echoes one in the social sciences, between Darwins ornament theory (the beard as plumage, to attract mates) and weapon theory (the beard as symbol of power, to intimidate rivals).

Both could be useful for the speaker. Or perhaps, neither.

He is experimenting, Mr. Oldstone-Moore said. He is seeing what the reaction is. If people are impressed, he may stick with it. If not, he can say it was a hunting beard, and away it goes.

If nothing else, it gives us something to talk about other than Donald Trumps hair.",[]

A Hedwig and the Angry Inch reunion of sorts will arrive at Cafe Carlyle this month, set to the music of ... Radiohead.

Lena Hall and Michael C. Hall, who appeared opposite each other in Hedwig in 2014-5, will perform a tribute titled Radiohead: Obsessed, on March 19.

The duo (who are not related) will perform songs from the bands early days, when it originated with the 1992 single Creep, to its last album, The King of Limbs, which was released in 2011. Radiohead will play several festival dates this summer, and a new album is expected this year.

Ms. Hall, a Tony winner, performed at the Carlyle last spring, and has made Radioheads Karma Police part of her recent repertoire. (Last month, she wrote on Twitter that she had recorded the song.) Mr. Hall recently played in the lead role in the musical Lazarus, one of David Bowies last projects.

After serving as a judge for the Northern Short Courses photo contest, the National Press Photographers Association and the City University of New Yorks journalism school invited Michelle V. Agins to attend their three-day conference the last weekend of February in Iselin, N.J. I wanted to go, because you get to learn new things, said Ms. Agins, 62, a New York Times staff photographer. I wanted to be up-to-date on what was going on in the profession.

The judging and the conference energized her, she said. Young photographers sought her out for advice. But perhaps the biggest lesson they could have learned came from what she did in her down time.

When they asked me to be a judge for the contest, it lifted my spirits. You get to be a certain age in your profession and you think its almost time to turn the corner. This got me excited.

In January, I judged thousands of photos, and that revived me, made me hungry again and excited about what I was doing. After that, they invited me to the conference, which I wanted to attend to catch up on the latest information, gear and tricks. I really just went to enjoy the conference.

That was short-lived, because one of the kids there asked me to look at her portfolio. O.K., I did. Then she told about somebody elses. Before you knew it, I was looking at portfolios until three in the morning!

In a lot of portfolios, they were just putting stuff in there. I knew what they were doing: They were letting me know they can do this. I told them theyre in the neighborhood, but theyre not there yet. Why? Dont show me your stuff until youre ready.

That Saturday, I was in the midst of going from workshop to workshop, taking the hotel elevator, when I saw this lady with this cute little girl and boy. The lady had a fancy dress and shoes, as if she were going to a wedding.

Are you the flower girl? I asked the one child, Milan Hutchinson.

No, she told me. Im in the pageant.

Her mother, Sade Bell, told me that Milan, who is 7, was in the Miss Celebrity Spotlight Pageant and that they were going to get her hair done. I asked her, Can I follow you for a minute?

Sure, Ms. Bell replied.

You dont mind me photographing? I asked.

No, she said. I want her to get used to being photographed, I want her to get used to dealing with it and not think about it.

She was my kind of girl, so we hung out for two hours.

What really attracted me was not so much the little girl, but the whole thing. This was an outside activity that was earned: If she didnt do well in school or clean her room, she wouldnt be participating in the pageant.

Her mother got Milan an outfit a size larger, so she could use it for a while, because these dresses are very expensive. She had to pin it to make sure it fit properly. At one point Milan was fidgeting, so I decided to step back and let her mother take care of those pins. I took a little break, then came back. By then, her 4-year-old brother, Tristen, wanted some me time. You wouldnt believe the patience Milan had dealing with her brother right before the pageant.

All of this was going on, and I was so honored to be able to be there and disappear.

We all went down to the lobby for her final makeup. After that, they called her number and we went up. There was a big guy at the door who asked me Do you have a stamp? I told him Im her photographer! and walked in real fast with the mother so they wouldnt have a chance to check me. I did the best I could to get close without getting kicked out.

The weekend had energized me. It was that energy inside me that led me to make those pictures. In a spiritual way, this is my calling; this is what Im about. Im not going to ignore a moment. I might be told, No, go away. But Ill find a way to get into the next door.

If that little girl had said No, there was hotel full of them and I was going to find one. She was my calling.

As told to David Gonzalez.

nytimes.com,2016-03-01 00:00:00,Testing for Joy and Grit? Schools Nationwide Push to Measure Students Emotional Skills,['Kate Zernike'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

SAN FRANCISCO  The fifth graders in Jade Cooneys classroom compete against a kitchen timer during lessons to see how long they can sustain good behavior  raising hands, disagreeing respectfully and looking one another in the eye  without losing time to insults or side conversations.









As reward for minutes without misconduct, they win prizes like 20 seconds to kick their feet up on their desks or to play rock-paper-scissors. And starting this year, their school and schools in eight other California districts will test students on how well they have learned the kind of skills like self-control and conscientiousness that the games aim to cultivate  ones that might be described as everything you should have learned in kindergarten but are still reading self-help books to master in middle age.

A recent update to federal education law requires states to include at least one nonacademic measure in judging school performance. So other states are watching these districts as a potential model. But the race to test for so-called social-emotional skills has raised alarms even among the biggest proponents of teaching them, who warn that the definitions are unclear and the tests faulty.

I do not think we should be doing this; it is a bad idea, said Angela Duckworth, the MacArthur fellow who has done more than anyone to popularize social-emotional learning, making grit  the title of her book to be released in May  a buzzword in schools.

She resigned from the board of the group overseeing the California project, saying she could not support using the tests to evaluate school performance. Last spring, after attending a White House meeting on measuring social-emotional skills, she and a colleague wrote a paper warning that there were no reliable ways to do so. Our working title was all measures suck, and they all suck in their own way, she said.

And there is little agreement on what skills matter: Self-control? Empathy? Perseverance? Joy?

There are so many ways to do this wrong, said Camille A. Farrington, a researcher at the University of Chicago who is working with a network of schools across the country to measure the development of social-emotional skills. In education, we have a great track record of finding the wrong way to do stuff.

Schools began emphasizing social-emotional learning around 2011, after an analysis of 213 school-based programs teaching such skills found that they improved academic achievement by 11 percentile points. A book extolling efforts to teach social-emotional skills in schools such as the KIPP charter network and Riverdale Country School in New York, How Children Succeed by Paul Tough, appeared the next year.

Argument still rages about whether schools can or should emphasize these skills. Critics say the approach risks blaming the victim  if only students had more resilience, they could rise above generational poverty and neglected schools  and excuses uninspired teaching by telling students it is on them to develop zest, or enthusiasm. Groups that spent decades urging the country toward higher academic standards worry about returning to empty talk of self-esteem, accepting low achievement as long as students feel good.

But teaching social-emotional skills is often seen as a way to move away from a narrow focus on test scores, and to consider instead the whole child. It may seem contradictory, then, to test for those skills. In education, however, the adage is whats measured gets treasured; states give schools money to teach the subjects on which they will be judged.

Next year, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a test of students in grades four, eight and 12 that is often referred to as the nations report card, will include questions about students social-emotional skills. A well-known international test, PISA, is moving toward the same.

The biggest concern about testing for social-emotional skills is that it typically relies on surveys asking students to evaluate recent behaviors or mind-sets, like how many days they remembered their homework, or if they consider themselves hard workers. This makes the testing highly susceptible to fakery and subjectivity. In their paper published in May, Dr. Duckworth and David Yeager argued that even if students do not fake their answers, the tests provide incentive for superficial parroting rather than real changes in mind-set.

You think test scores are easy to game? said Martin West, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, who is working with the districts in California. Theyre relatively hard to game when you compare them to a self-report survey.

Students might be tested on performance, as in the marshmallow test, in which children were told they could have a sweeter reward if they waited. Those who waited scored higher in self-control. But those tests are too time-consuming to use on a large group of students.

Other researchers have proposed calling or texting students at regular intervals to check their behavior and frame of mind, or monitoring Facebook or Twitter to observe patterns of behavior. But privacy concerns would almost certainly disqualify those.

Transforming Education, a Boston-based group that is among the biggest proponents of teaching social-emotional skills, argues that they are so important that schools have to begin testing for them, even if perfect measures do not exist.

The group worked with the school districts here  which count one million students, or 20 percent of the state total, in cities including Los Angeles and Oakland  to choose four measures to evaluate: growth mind-set, social awareness, self-efficacy and self-management.

The districts tested 10,000 students in 2014, and nearly 500,000 students last year, surveying things like how many days the students had come to school prepared (self-management), and whether they believed it was more important to be talented or to work hard (growth mind-set).

Just two years ago in her classroom in a trailer here at Visitacion Valley Elementary School, Ms. Cooney struggled with the kind of management problems that often confront young teachers.

Her students, mostly poor and living in a nearby housing project, were bouncing around the classroom, playing with their phones instead of paying attention, fighting out interfamily beefs. Even if they wanted to learn, they were not.

Ms. Cooney, 27, took a two-hour training session in a student-behavior program and began playing good-behavior games. They look like regular lessons, except that they begin with students identifying goals for good behavior, and end with her assessing what went right and wrong.

On a recent day, students took notes on their reading as Ms. Cooney moved with a kind of Zen bustle around the classroom, grading papers and consulting one-on-one while she watched for things she would compliment the class on later  keeping bodies still, focusing on the task  and quietly noted bad behavior.

For every 1,000 minutes of good behavior earned, the children win 15 extra minutes of recess.

Im really saving minutes that would be lost to transitions, settling disputes and behavior problems, Ms. Cooney said. It can be exhausting, but not nearly as much as teaching before. As she said, Would you rather put out fires, or prevent them?

Social-emotional learning will count for 8 percent of a schools overall performance score; no teacher will lose a job for failing to instill a growth mind-set.

Noah Bookman, the chief accountability officer for the districts, said he understood the concerns about testing. But, he said, This work is so phenomenally important to the success of our kids in school and life. In some ways, we worry as much if not more about the possibility that these indicators remain on the back burner.",[]

A new, modern steel-and-glass entrance on Madison Avenue took the place of the smaller, more old-fashioned entrance to the museums original Gilded Age building around the corner on East 36th Street. Until then, the institution had been known simply as the Morgan Library.

nytimes.com,1999-03-30 00:00:00,New Breed of Fox as Tame as a Pussycat,[],"Ordinarily the silver fox is a canny, elusive creature, quick to bite when cornered, and well nigh impossible to tame.

This is hardly surprising, considering that foxes over the eons have been hunted for sport, trapped for fur, and generally maligned by human beings, especially those with hen houses.

But because of selective pressure imposed by experimenters over a 40-year period, a new and once undreamed of breed of fox has evolved -- one that whines for attention from human beings without any prior conditioning, licks its masters' faces, and has even begun to look something like a domestic dog.

It is as if by an act of will human beings had transformed an innately hostile creature into a friend.

In a long-term experiment at a Siberian fur farm, geneticists have created this new version of Vulpes vulpes, the silver fox, by allowing only the friendliest animals from each generation to breed. Having selected only the most ''tamable'' of some 45,000 foxes over 35 generations, the scientists have compressed into a mere 40 years an evolutionary process that took thousands of years to transform ancestral wolves into domestic dogs.

The original purpose of the breeding was to create a friendly breed less likely than wild animals to fight when put to death. But in time, geneticists saw that far-reaching changes they observed in the foxes' physical and neurological makeup merited scientific study. The scientists apparently underwent some changes, too. Close bonds developed between the tame foxes and their human wardens, and the staff at the fur farm is trying to find ways of saving the animals from slaughter.

To keep environmental influences to a minimum, none of the foxes in the Siberian experiment received any training, and their contacts with human beings were limited to brief behavioral tests.

The director of the experiment is Dr. Lyudmila N. Trut of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics of the Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences at Novosibirsk. She reported in a paper that selective breeding to create genetically docile animals had resulted in a breed of ultra-tame foxes that make good house pets ''as devoted as dogs but as independent as cats, capable of forming deep-rooted pair bonds with human beings.''

Selective breeding of farm animals to enhance commercially useful traits is as old as human history. But a striking consequence of the Russian program was that breeding foxes to strengthen a single behavioral trait, ''tamability,'' brought about a wide variety of seemingly unrelated physical changes.

A paper by Dr. Trut discussing these changes, translated from Russian, was published in the current issue of American Scientist, the magazine of Sigma Xi, a scientific research society. Dr. Trut wrote that by breeding the tamest animals from each of about 35 successive generations, the final offspring were not only tame from early puppyhood but also looked different from their wild forebears.

The normal pattern of coat color that evolved in wild foxes as camouflage changed markedly in the genetically tamed fox population, with irregular piebald splotches of white fur appearing in some animals. The tame foxes sometimes developed floppy ears in place of the straight ones of wild foxes. The domesticated foxes generally had shorter legs and tails than ordinary foxes, and often had curly tails instead of straight, horizontal tails.

Moreover, the faces of adult tame foxes came to look more juvenile than the faces of wild adults, and many of the experimental animals developed dog-like features, Dr. Trut reported. Although no selective pressures relating to size or shape were used in breeding the animals, the skulls of tamable foxes tended to be narrower with shorter snouts than those of wild foxes.

Even reproductive cycles changed in foxes bred to be docile; wild vixens are receptive to sex only once a year, but some of the docile females become receptive more often.

Domestication also apparently affects genes controlling the timing of physiological development. For example, the genetically tamable fox puppies open their eyes sooner after birth than do ordinary silver foxes, and they show a fear response to unfamiliar stimuli about three weeks later than their wild counterparts.

Over successive generations and increasing congenital tameness, Dr. Trut wrote, the Russian team measured a steady decline in the hormone-producing ability of the foxes' adrenal glands. Adrenal hormones prepare an animal for fight or flight.

Even the brain chemistry of the tame animals differed from that of their wild ancestors; after 12 generations of selective breeding, Dr. Trut reported, test animals' brains contained significantly higher levels of serotonin than did their forbears. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter, is intimately involved in an animal's psychological state.

Dr. Darcy F. Morey, an anthropologist at the University of Kansas who has studied the physical changes that ancestral wolves underwent as they evolved into domesticated dogs, said that Dr. Trut's report underscores the complexity of seemingly simple genetic traits.

''Clearly,'' he said in an interview, ''the link between modifying the neurology of an animal and its biochemical balance is all intertwined with other aspects of physiology.''

Domestication, with all the physiological changes it brings, has not been limited to the the dog family, he said. ''Human beings more or less domesticated themselves,'' Dr. Morey said. ''Of course, we're not as docile as we'd like to think.''

The Russian breeding experiment began in 1959 under the direction of a geneticist, Dr. Dmitry K. Belyaev, who started with a population of 30 male foxes and 100 vixens from a commercial fur farm in Estonia. From the offspring of these animals and from each successive generation, Dr. Belyaev's team would winnow out about 5 percent of the tamest animals for further breeding. Dr. Belyaev died 14 years ago, but his experiment has continued.

In nature, the process of domestication is long and complex.

''Behavioral responses,'' Dr. Trut wrote, ''are regulated by a fine balance between neurotransmitters and hormones at the level of the whole organism. Even slight alterations in those regulatory genes can give rise to a wide network of changes in the developmental processes they govern.'' Changing a complex system of genes (or a ''polygene'') by selectively breeding for some trait like docility is not necessarily beneficial, she said. Even a slight alteration of a polygene like that presumed to lead to docility ''might upset the genetic balance in some animals, causing them to show unusual new traits, most of them harmful to the fox,'' Dr. Trut wrote.

Through selective breeding to enhance the docility of 45,000 foxes over the last 40 years, Dr. Trut said, ''we have compressed into a few decades an ancient process that originally unfolded over thousands of years.''

''Before our eyes, the 'Beast' has turned into 'Beauty,' as the aggressive behavior of our herd's wild progenitors entirely disappeared,'' she said.

Dr. Trut concluded her paper with a prediction that the experiment in tamability breeding would probably have to end soon; last year there was no money in Russia's budget to pay the scientists or even feed the foxes, most of which were destroyed.

''Recently we have sold some of our foxes to Scandinavian fur breeders who have been pressured by animal-rights groups to develop animals that do not suffer stress in captivity,'' she wrote. ''We also plan to market pups as house pets, a commercial venture that should lead to some interesting, if informal, experiments in its own right.''

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Small Gains for the Market as Energy Prices Rebound,['The Associated Press'],"Stocks rose Wednesday on the seventh anniversary of the bull market as crude oil resumed its climb from a 13-year low.









The gains were modest as investors await key policy decisions from Europes central bank on Thursday and from the Federal Reserve next week.

Energy companies rebounded from big drops the day before, gaining 1.5 percent.

The stock market has been climbing for three weeks as reports on hiring, retail spending and manufacturing suggest the U.S. economy is strengthening. The Standard and Poors 500-stock index is up 9 percent from its mid-February low.

People are becoming more optimistic and markets are recovering, said Seth Masters, chief investment officer at AB Bernstein. The hope is that monetary authorities are committed to doing what it takes and not derail it.

The Nasdaq composite increased 25.55 points, or 0.6 percent, to 4,674.38. The S.&P. 500 climbed 10 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,989.26.

The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 36.26 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,000.36.

The gains were broad, with nine of 10 industry sectors of the S.&P. 500 rising. The jump in crude sent several energy companies soaring. Chesapeake Energy climbed 8 percent, Devon Energy rose 7 percent and Newfield Exploration rose 6 percent.

The S.&P. 500 has tripled since bottoming out at 676.53 seven years ago during the financial crisis. The bull market is the third-longest of the 11 since World War II, according to research firm S&P Capital IQ.

Krishna Memani, chief investment officer of Oppenheimer Funds, said he was optimistic that the bull market would extend its run because modest economic growth means little inflation and no need for the Federal Reserve to move too quickly to reverse its stimulus policies.

We believe this will be one of the longest economic expansions, and thus one the longest bull markets, we have experienced, he said. Easy money still rules.

The Federal Reserve meets next week, but most investors do not think it will raise short-term interest rates it controls from near zero. It raised them for the first time in nine years in December.

At the end of its policy meeting on Thursday, the European Central Bank is widely expected to announce more efforts to stimulate the 19-country eurozone. Possible moves include another cut in the deposit rate for funds from commercial banks to even further below zero. The hope is that will get banks to stop holding onto their money and lend more.

The European Central Bank also could increase its bond-buying program to pump more money into the regions economy.

Among U.S. stocks making big moves Wednesday, Air Transport Services jumped $1.96, or 17 percent, to $13.73 after turning in solid results and saying it will operate an air transport network for Amazon. Pet-food company Blue Buffalo Pet Products rose $4.19, or 23 percent, $22.75 after posting strong earnings.

Chipotle Mexican Grill fell $18.06, or 3 percent, to $506.63. The restaurant chain closed a Massachusetts store after a local health board said an employee there tested positive for norovirus. The agency also found two other suspected cases.

The closure follows a series of food scares that sickened customers at its restaurants around the country. Chipotle stock is down 23 percent in the past 12 months.

In Europe, Germanys DAX and Britains FTSE 100 were each up 0.3 percent. The CAC-40 in France rose 0.5 percent. The three indexes each fell nearly 1 percent the day before.

Japans benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.8 percent while South Koreas Kospi rose 0.3 percent. Hong Kongs Hang Seng dipped 0.1 percent.

Prices for industrial and precious metals ended mostly lower. Gold slipped $5.50 to $1,257.40 an ounce, silver fell two cents to $15.37 an ounce and copper gained one cent to $2.23 a pound.

In energy trading, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.79, or 5 percent, to $38.29. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, gained $1.42, or 3.6 percent, to $41.07 a barrel.

Wholesale gasoline rose 8.3 cents to $1.471 a gallon, heating oil rose 3.3 cents to $1.233 a gallon and natural gas rose four cents to $1.752 per 1,000 cubic feet.

U.S. government bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.88 percent from 1.83 percent.

The euro was flat at $1.1002. The dollar edged up to 113.36 yen from 112.61 yen.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-02-26 00:00:00,Unearthing Bogota's Past on the Carrera Septima,"['Annie Correal', 'Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Reference Timestopics People C Annie_correal Index Html']","Leer en Espanol.

A century ago, the Carrera Septima, Bogotas main thoroughfare, was bordered by the stately homes of the well-to-do. Like a European promenade, it led to the city center: grand municipal buildings, a towering cathedral, the expansive Plaza de Bolivar. Its electric streetcars were a symbol of progress, high in the Andes.

Now, little remains of the Septimas grandeur. The old city was nearly reduced to rubble after a political assassination in 1948 sparked riots that left buildings ransacked and burned, the streetcars tipped over and torched. Those who could moved north, leaving the city center to fill with soulless office buildings and the indigent.

Its dirty, its ugly, it smells, and its full of thieves, said the photographer Juan Cristobal Cobo, summarizing the popular attitude toward the old center, also known as the Candelaria, which has been partly restored and attracts international tourism.

But for eight months last year, Mr. Cobo visited a still-rough part of the area weekly, concentrating on four blocks of the Septima that were closed to vehicular traffic not long ago. There, he mined for visible signs of a past often forgotten by Colombians in their eagerness to move forward. Historic centers interest me, he said. In Colombia, they are centers of forgetting.

Mr. Cobo, 52, was born in Cali, Colombia, and studied film at New York University. Since the early 1990s, he has lived in Bogota and worked as a cinematographer and commercial director. A few years ago, I reached a point where I couldnt stand to do any more advertising, he said. As we say in Spanish, I kicked my lunch pail.

He embarked on a number of personal photography projects, including this one.

Remnants of the past abounded on the Septima, where the streetcar tracks were embedded like scars in the street. In one image, a man smoked on a bench in the spot where the populist leader Jorge Eliecer Gaitan was killed in 1948  arguably the most important spot in Bogota, for were it not for that event, the city wouldnt have been destroyed, Mr. Cobo said.

Photo

Mr. Cobo also spotted living relics of the past: older gentlemen in suits and ties crossing the street. Retired public servants and office workers, they lingered in the city center, walking alone or sitting in cafes discussing events from long ago. These men are the last of a type known as el cachaco, the quintessential Bogotano of the last century.

They come from the early 20th century when the British and European influence was strong, Mr. Cobo said. They have a certain formality, a certain courtesy. They probably dont have a place to sleep, or live in rented rooms, but they wont go out without fixing their tie and putting on their sweater and overcoat.

He also found plenty of what he called rebusque, buskers and swindlers of all stripes: fortune-tellers, men selling emeralds, or offering to let him in on a deal. By the Plaza de Bolivar, vendors sold bags of corn to working-class Colombian tourists to feed the pigeons. A one-armed man did push-ups for change, his knuckles leaving a groove in the concrete from his 1,000 daily repetitions (Slide 18). A handful of Michael Jackson impersonators took turns dancing for coins, among them a 14-year-old who had fled Uraba, one of the flashpoints in Colombias decades-long civil conflict.

Its like a very, very, very sad Times Square in a third world country, Mr. Cobo said.

Photo

Despite the details in his work that speak to daily life and the passage of time and history, Mr. Cobo said he did not consider himself a photojournalist. He wanted to stir feelings in the viewer. As often as he saw brokenness, Mr. Cobo said he sensed strength in his subjects. And he wanted to convey this.

Colombia is a complex country, but very resilient, he said. There is a spirit of resilience. The Septima is a mirror of that.

Google wants to make it easy for travelers to decide where and when to go on vacation, and to see at a glance what a trip is likely to cost, right from their mobile phones.









The company on Wednesday announced a search feature, Destinations on Google, that touches on almost every aspect of a vacation, from research to flight selection, hotel booking and itinerary planning. Destinations does not offer off-the-beaten-path guides or exclusive information that cant be found elsewhere on the web. Rather, its meant to make researching and planning a trip on a mobile phone (typically a clumsy experience) more intuitive and productive for the occasional traveler by delivering good-quality basic information.

This is the first time Google has introduced a travel tool on mobile (where people are increasingly spending their time) before desktop; its available through your mobile browser or the Google app on iOS and Android. Everything on Destinations begins with a single search screen; theres no drilling down through multiple websites and hopping among them, no entering your desired number of nights or travel companions again and again. Heres how it works.

Continue reading the main story Travel Dispatch Newsletter Every Saturday, get travel tips, destination coverage, photos from all over the world and more.

Where to Go

On your smartphone, open your browser or the Google app and search for, say, Europe vacation. A grid of multiple destination tiles will appear  Paris, London, Rome, Barcelona, Madrid, Prague, Amsterdam, to name a few  each with an appealing photo. These are the most popular European destinations according to Google. Each photo has a bit of information beneath it, including the cheapest week to go within the next six months (based on your origin and the destination), the cost of the cheapest flight for that week, as well as the average price of a hotel (three-star or the next available class).

Its Europe at-a-glance, an easy-to-scroll, elegant reminder of some of whats out there  emphasis on some of. If youre looking for less frequented and up-and-coming places such as Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina, you have to make your initial search more specific: Instead of searching for Europe vacation, search instead for southern Europe vacation and youll find it. Or, if you have a particular destination in mind, like Split in Croatia, you can type Split, Croatia vacation into the search box and it will turn up. In other words, you can search at the city, state (California destinations), country or continent level. If you just search for Greece, for instance, youll see a carousel of destinations (Athens, Santorini, Rhodes) that you can scroll through and click into for more details.

A word of caution: When you begin a search, Google uses your current location to determine the origin city (and therefore the price) for flights. Thats a problem since I might be in Miami when I want to research a trip from New York to Latin America. Google did not confirm whether in the future users will be able to set their starting point, but it seems a logical next step.

Narrow the Options

You can filter those Europe vacation search results by travel dates, price and interests such as architecture, beach, camping, culture, golf, hiking, nature, sailing, skiing. Just tap the appropriate heading on the top of the screen and adjust the filters. Your search results will update accordingly. When I filtered Europe for skiing, for instance, my screen was instantly repopulated with images of mountains and vacation options for Bansko, Bulgaria; Chamonix, France; Zermatt, Switzerland; St. Anton am Arlberg, Austria; Sierra Nevada Ski Station, Spain; and more.

Delve Deeper

See that lovely photo of Venice? Tap it, or the photo of any city on your screen that captures your imagination, to learn more. Background information about each place is culled from Wikipedia as well as from a New York content team that also writes the descriptions for Google Maps. On each destination page, on a tab that says Explore, you can check out its top sights (in Amsterdam, for example, the Rijksmuseum, Anne Frank House, Vondelpark), see popular travel months for tourists, find out about the climate and watch related videos (more users are turning to mobile video for travel research, Google said).

The top sights are just that: the obvious must-see attractions, not lesser-known gems or nascent activities. And sorry, foodies, you wont find a guide to restaurants and bars, either. Think of Destinations as your basic Crayola crayon box; it is not aimed at those who want Magic Mint.

Build an Itinerary

On that same destination page that you reached by tapping a photo is a Plan a Trip tab that allows you to select how many people are traveling, the number of stops youre willing to make when you fly, the number of nights you plan to stay and your desired hotel class (up to five stars). Once you add those details you can use an interactive price bar graph. With a swipe right or left it slides through the months, showing you the changing price of your trip over time.

Photo

One of the niftiest features of Destinations is Popular Itineraries: trips through a country in a logical order with details about how far apart each site or activity is so you can maximize your time. But unlike most itineraries you find in travel publications, Popular Itineraries are not created by editors or writers. They are based on anonymous and aggregated data across a large pool of travelers who have opted into sharing their mobile location data with Google. Its the same technology Google uses to create its Popular Times graphs; i.e. people using mobile phones in a restaurant help Google determine the busiest and slowest times. As a result, you can see, for example, that on a Thursday night Bar Boulud in New York is most popular between 5:30 and 7:30 p.m. and that getting a seat at 10 p.m. would be easier.

To find Popular Itineraries, search for a country and add vacation or travel. Google will then turn up a guide; to get it, click on the blue button under the basic information for the country. When I searched for France vacation, there were several Popular Itineraries in the travel guide, including seven days in Nice, Avignon, Montpellier, Toulouse and Bordeaux; four days in Paris, Burgundy and Lyon; and five days in Paris, Strasbourg and Colmar.

A different feature, Suggested Itineraries, is not currently based on aggregate phone data; it offers sample itineraries for cities, not entire countries, by the content team at Google.

Book Your Trip

While some Destinations features call to mind online travel agencies like Expedia and Travelocity, Destinations is not meant to emphasize shopping for flights and hotels. Its primary purpose, a Google product manager told me, is to help users figure out where to go. The technology of Google Flights, my go-to comparison tool, and hotel search are baked into Destinations. Google Flights shows options across multiple airlines, but to book you go to an airlines own website. Choosing a hotel through Destinations takes you to a Google search page with information about the hotel, its location, reviews and the option to book through a partner site such as Hotels.com, Booking.com or Venere.com.

Bottom Line

Google says Destinations is designed for the leisure traveler who takes a trip or two a year and is concerned about making the right choices for that big getaway. He or she is interested in popular places and wants to see the major sites.

Destinations is not for those looking for obscure art galleries, or for foodies seeking the next great restaurant or food truck. Experienced travelers who have a short list of where they want to go, who fly frequently, who use particular airlines because they have elite status and who seek off-the-beaten path itineraries wont be surprised by the cities or points of interest they see on Destinations.

That said, chances are theyll like the planning tools. The price bar graph is a quick way to narrow down when to go. And a flexible dates feature allows you to say that you want to go in June, for instance, and then see your travel options for the entire month, rather than for specific dates. Details about rainfall and temperature mean you dont have to run a separate search to see if you were planning to visit during hurricane season. And Points of Interest and Suggested Itineraries could be handy for business travelers parachuting into a place for a night or two but hoping to get to a must-see spot between meetings.

Is Destinations regularly unearthing hidden treasures? No. Does Destinations make it easier to spark ideas and to start plotting? Absolutely. You can type Caribbean vacation in the search box and instantly begin finding the island thats right for you. You can do that on some vacation-idea apps, but most are haphazard and, more important, divorced from useful information about flights and hotels. Destinations on Google integrates the puzzle pieces.",[]

She joined the papers staff in January of last year after graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she was named College Photographer of the Year in a separate national competition associated with POYi.

Todd Heisler of The New York Times placed second in the Newspaper Photographer of the Year category and Alon Skuy of The Times in Johannesburg took third.

Paolo Marchetti, an Italian freelance photographer represented by Getty Images, was named Photographer of the Year, with Espen Rasmussen of the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang taking second and Chip Somodevilla of Getty images third.

The New York Times was named Best Publication by POYi, which is a program of the University of Missouri School of Journalism. The Times also won first place in the Newspaper Visual Editing category as well as 14 other awards. Mr. Heisler took first place for Sports Picture Story for Hardwood, a look at a New York City high school basketball team. Joshua Z. Weinstein received the top award in Multimedia Feature Story for a Times Op-Doc video, Holocaust Survivor Band.

In news photography contests, the top-prize winners are most often entrants who travel far from their homes to cover dramatic events. Those doing strong work in their own communities, unless they live in a war zone, are more likely to be passed by.

This year, the Pictures of the Year International competition tried to alter that dynamic by tweaking its two divisions. The open category, which Mr. Marchetti, 41, won, continues to be for all photographers working anywhere in the world. But the newspaper categories are now focused on those working in their local areas. This does not prohibit newspaper photographers from entering the open categories if they traveled outside their region.

There are so many important local stories and issues that often get overshadowed in competitions by the big global news events, said Rick Shaw, director of POYi. We wanted to recognize great photo stories produced in photographers own backyards.

Ms. Van Houten, 25, said that there are stories everywhere, though they may sometimes be more subtle or harder to find.

National Geographic won the Angus MacDougall Overall Excellence in Editing Award as well as the Documentary Project of the Year for its environmental issue Cool It.

The Timess sports photo editors Becky Lebowitz Hanger and Jeffrey Furticella received first and second places as well as an award of excellence in the Print Feature Story Editing.

Andrew Ellis of MediaStorm was named the Multimedia Photographer of the Year. Second place went to Katie Falkenberg of The Los Angeles Times and third to Jonah M. Kessel, a video journalist for The New York Times who was also was cited in two other categories.

Al Bello of Getty Images was named Sports Photographer of the Year. Hossein Fatemi took the World Understanding Award for An Iranian Journey, which was first published on Lens. Casper Dalhoff received the Community Awareness Award for A Commitment to Life. The Environmental Vision Award went to Brent Stirton of Getty Images for Ivory Wars, while Stephen Dupont received the Best Photography Book Award for Generation AK.

Yunghi Kim took first place in the General News category for a photo of the funeral of Freddie Gray, a black man from Baltimore whose death from an injury suffered in police custody set off nationwide protests.

Robin Hammond took first place in Portrait Series for his images of L.G.B.T. people living in countries where homosexuality is illegal. The series was featured on Lens last September. Mark Peterson took first for his political photos in the News Picture Story category and Gabriella Demczuk took third for work made on assignment for The Times. Ms. Demczuk also received special recognition from the judges in the Community Awareness category. Bryan Denton, a freelancer for The New York Times, received third place in the Feature category.

The Times also took first in the Online News and Issues Story Editing category for Walking in Wars Path, with photographs by Tomas Munita, text by Jodi Rudoren and Isabel Kershner and produced by David Furst, Jon Huang and Sergio Pecanha. The Times also placed third in the category with Josh Haners Greenland Is Melting Away, produced with Coral Davenport, Larry Buchanan and Derek Watkins.

Mr. Furst, The Timess international photo editor, was also part of a team that placed second in the Online Feature Story Editing category for David Guttenfelders Illuminating North Korea. It was produced by Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Douglas Schorzman, Rumsey Taylor and Mr. Furst.

In Multimedia News Story, Francesco Zizola of Noor placed first and Samantha Stark of The Times took second for How a Love Story Triumphed in Court. Is Nadia Sussman received an honorable mention for The Times for In Rio, Pacification Without Peace.

A Syrian freelance photographer covering his countrys conflict for Agence France-Presse won first place for Spot News and an award of excellence for News Picture Story. The same photographer took second in the World Press Photo contests General News category this year. Although AFP sends out the photographs under the name Abd Doumany, it is a pseudonym.

When asked about the use of pseudonyms last week, Francis Kohn, AFPs photo director, confirmed that Abd Doumany was not the photographers real name. He said that local Syrian photographers and their families might be in danger if their actual names were published.

We thought it was fine for these guys, he said. They chose their own names. And we agreed to that. We have a policy that we use real names, but in some really extraordinary circumstances we agree to use other names. The alternative would be to just use stringer, which we do sometimes.

Photo

The New York Times does not use pseudonyms in credits to avoid the risk of misleading readers, but will omit photographers real name if they might be in danger. The Times has previously published AFP photos using the credit Abd Doumany both online and in print without knowing it was a pseudonym. The Times has also published AFP photographs credited to Sameer Al-Doumy, another name that Mr. Kohn confirmed was a pseudonym.

Until he was contacted by Lens today, Mr. Shaw, of POYi, said he was not aware that Abd Doumany was a pseudonym.

We understand that there are situations that we would not want to put somebody in jeopardy, Mr. Shaw said. I think its acceptable under certain circumstances that Anonymous or a pseudonym can be used as a credit, as long as we can be transparent and divulge that to our audiences.

Mr. Shaw also said that he would contact AFP and ask for a clarification, which would be added to the list of winners.

My heart is with the photographers in the trenches working in conflict, he said. I want to do the right thing so they can continue to bring the images of conflict that we need to see.

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Meldonium Ban Hits Russian Athletes Particularly Hard,['Patrick Reevell'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

MOSCOW  The fallout from the tennis star Maria Sharapovas suspension over a failed drug test has ensnared her native Russia, as it becomes clear that the drug behind it is poised to create wider problems for Russian sports.









Sharapova, a five-time Grand Slam winner, announced Monday that she had tested positive for the banned drug meldonium during the Australian Open in January, shocking the tennis world and prompting the swift flight of a number of her sponsors.

Meldonium had been a common treatment for Russian athletes before it was added to the World Anti-Doping Agencys prohibited list in January. Its appearance in the headlines is another headache for Russias sports establishment, which is already under an international ban in track and field over accusations that the country conducted a massive doping program.

On Wednesday, the Kremlin responded to the outcry around Sharapovas suspension, with a spokesman saying her failed drug test should not be projected onto Russian sports generally.

But even as the Kremlin sought to play down Sharapovas lapse as an individual case, more Russian athletes were drawn into the controversy.

In the two days since Sharapovas announcement, seven Russian athletes have confirmed testing positive for meldonium. Among those provisionally suspended are an Olympic gold medalist short-track skater, Semion Elistratov, and his teammate, the world champion Pavel Kulizhnikov.

The doping positives have led to confusion and anger among top Russian athletes and sports physicians who said that they did not understand why the drug, legal for decades but monitored by WADA for at least a year, was outlawed.

Created as a treatment for heart condition in 1975, meldonium  under the name Mildronate  is widely available from Russian pharmacies without a prescription, selling for $3 to $10 for about 40 capsules. It can also be purchased online. Meldonium is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for sale in the United States, where Sharapova has been based since she was 7.

In January, WADA included meldonium on its list of hormone and metabolic modulators But until last fall, Russian teams had used the drug regularly and openly, viewing it as a remedy for fending off exhaustion and heart problems.

Meldonium helps increase blood flow and therefore boosts the amount of oxygen taken into the body, which would allow athletes to recover faster while training. The drugs inventor, Ivars Kalvins, a professor at Latvias Institute of Organic Synthesis, said in a 2009 newspaper interview that the drug was once used by Soviet soldiers lugging heavy equipment at high altitudes during the Russian invasion of Afghanistan.

Ive been working for 20 years; we could never imagine that it would be included as a doping substance, said Sergei Sheremetiev, a physician with Russias ski-jumping team. Its a good drug. Until they banned it, we used it in many types of sport: hockey, skiing  in those where theres pretty serious strain.

Sheremetiev said that until the ban, he had administered the drug to his own athletes about twice a year.

Sharapova and her lawyers said she was prescribed meldonium by her family doctor in 2006 for a variety of health problems, including signs of diabetes, irregular EKG readings, magnesium deficiency and frequent cases of the flu. She said she had failed to read an email sent by WADA that confirmed the medication had been added to the banned list for 2016.

The Russian trainers and officials said they were obeying the WADA ban on meldonium, but they insisted the medication  despite its benefits  should not be considered a performance-enhancer. Sheremetiev and other team physicians said it was for restoring physical fitness, not performance.

But WADA has disagreed. The bodys president, Craig Reedie, in an open letter to The Independent, wrote that the drug was a big concern because its clear that people are abusing the drug.

Several studies in the past year have bolstered WADAs case. A 2015 study, funded in part by the Partnership for Clean Competition, analyzed 8,300 urine samples collected at doping control sessions and found that 182 (2.2 percent) contained the substance. A study of last years European Games in Baku, Azerbaijan, published Wednesday in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, found an alarmingly high prevalence of meldonium use by athletes. According to the study, 13 winners or medalists were taking meldonium and 66 athletes tested positive for it.

While the Russian physicians said they were baffled at why the drug, after decades of use, was now banned, they nonetheless acknowledged that they had received plenty of warning of the need to stop their athletes from using meldonium.

It was unclear why Russian athletes  including some of the countrys most prominent sports figures  had been found to still have traces of the drug in their bloodstream. (Athletes from Sweden, Ethiopia and Ukraine have also reportedly tested positive for meldonium this year.)

Russian national teams stopped treating their athletes with the drug in September, officials said, after WADA warned it would be banned beginning in January. Some federations said they destroyed their supplies of the drug then.

Sheremetiev and a number of different federation officials and trainers said, given the warnings, it was incomprehensible that top athletes had continued to take meldonium.

Russias national speedskating team appeared to have been particularly badly hit by the new ban. Three of its athletes tested positive, including Elistratov, a world-record holder.

The speedskating federations president, Aleksei Kravtsov, insisted that none of the athletes had taken the drug knowingly and that the teams trainers had been told not to administer it. Still, the federation said it was conducting lie detector tests on its athletes as well as the teams trainers and medical officials.",[]

LASHKAR GAH, Afghanistan  The banks of the placid Helmand River have always been the social center of Lashkar Gah, the southern Afghan provincial capital sometimes called Little America during the decades of modernization efforts here.









The appeal of the river stands aside from worldly concerns, and there are many of those lately. The water is calm this time of year, the sunset gorgeous. To unwind at the end of the day, people come to the riverbank for bandaar  easy chat over a cup of tea or, if in season, the delicious pomegranates this region is known for. Other visitors have slowed their worlds with hashish, lying on their backs in the water, away from the crowds, fascinated with the clear sky above.

On a recent reporting trip, I was particularly keen to talk to a friend here, a young university lecturer with helpful insights about this place. Even by its own standard, the surrounding region of Helmand Province has suffered a rough, bloody year. The Taliban, making major inroads, are now holed up in one of Lashkar Gahs suburbs across the river. Was he worried that the city might fall, that the lifestyle he had grown used to  a vibrant educational environment, multiple private TV and radio channels  could be in danger?

After a conversation over milk tea on a worn-out couch at a little cafe facing the river, he suggested dinner with a couple of his friends, also university lecturers, at a fish restaurant that had opened just outside the city. The suburb, Karez, is considered one of the safest, he said. Even when the Taliban entered Lashkar Gah a few years ago, they met fierce resistance in Karez.

Before leaving for the restaurant, the professors spread their shawls by the river for the evening prayer. Everyone savored the beauty of the sunset in its last moments.

The rivers course is a reminder that life goes on despite violent upheaval, flowing through Taliban and opium country, slowing down in this city, and then running on to Nimruz Province, the smuggling hub on the border with Iran.

Its calm waters have sustained agriculture and towns in the middle of the desert, and would-be conquerors have been drawn along its path for eons. It is that role that informs a Pashto poem by Abdul Bari Jahani, who is now Afghanistans minister of information and culture, which reads in part:

Helmand,

I ask you in the language of the heart:

Do you recall the cruelties of your time?

You know well whats happened at your edges.

You listened as angry skies grumbled

and death rained down with bullets.

You watched blood flow with your waves

as hangmen discarded martyred bodies.

And you witnessed those who looted

the nomad girls nose-rings:

all in the name of the great lord.

Helmand,

how did you learn to flow with such calm?

For much of the day, I had tried to gauge the mood of the city.

We are very sad because our numbers are skyrocketing, said Dejan Panic, who runs the 91-bed Emergency Hospital here. The number of admitted trauma patients has increased by 20 percent this year, and so has the severity of the injuries, Mr. Panic said. The hospital recently built an underground bunker for staff and patients, in case the violence brings the sort of bombings that happened in Kunduz.

Jamila Niazi, Helmand Provinces director of womens affairs, said she had lost touch with the womens councils in the districts overrun by the Taliban. Girls schools have also been closed there. But Ms. Niazi expressed confidence that the security forces would be able to hold the city.

For years, theres been fighting here, and the city hasnt fallen, she said.

Ghulam Rabbani, who sells CDs and DVDs in downtown Lashkar Gah, was more concerned. He had not sold anything all day. His retailers from districts overrun by the Taliban, who oppose music and television as un-Islamic, no longer come to buy.

When the Taliban came close to the city a few years ago, we werent as concerned because the foreign troops were still here, and we knew they would be pushed back again, Mr. Rabbani said. This time, they are no longer here.

Trying to find the fish restaurant, we drove through the desert in a small Toyota Vitz, many times asking for directions. Still, we kept hitting dead ends, prompting questions about how much business the place could expect if even local customers struggled to get there.

The restaurant, found after almost an hour of searching, was beautiful, down a slope of cobblestone and facing the river. The lights on the first floor were dim, the doors locked.

A small window on the second floor opened, and a man looked out. Are you the fish guys? he asked with a smile.

The normalcy, in a place surrounded by war, recalled a lost Helmand that is still so present in the Afghan imagination.

Earlier in the day, a nostalgic politician who is now in charge of the battle here, Abdul Jabar Qahraman, had talked about that lost Helmand as he described a conversation with a NATO general.

If someone sat somewhere in the world and thought of Afghanistan, Helmand would definitely come to his mind, he recounted saying. Then he thought of the beauty of Lashkar Gah, and he would say, This is little New York, little Washington.

Today, when someone in the world thinks of Afghanistan, he thinks of evil, and he thinks of Helmand  that it is the center of it, Mr. Qahraman continued, lamenting.

Forty years ago, we had such a life here  we had a disco, he said. But then we fell into the ditch of misfortune. I just want to see that Helmand again in my lifetime.",[]

Handcrafted small-batch ceramics are everywhere these days.









You see them in trendsetting boutiques like the Primary Essentials in Brooklyn and Still House in Manhattan, artfully arranged in window displays and on shelves like totems of good taste.

They can be spotted in the stylized pages of Kinfolk, Apartamento and other cult magazines, often paired with organically shaped cutting boards and sun-dappled potted succulents. Vogue even devoted two pages in this years September issue to a new wave of independent ceramists.

And among certain creative-minded millennials, ceramics have replaced jewelry and furniture made from salvaged lumber as the craft du jour, with access to choice kilns as a status symbol to be flaunted on Pinterest and Instagram.

There is beauty in imperfection and having items that are really handmade, said the fashion designer Steven Alan, who populates his boutiques with textural American and Japanese ceramics in neutral hues.

While terrariums, Edison bulb light fixtures and fixed-gear bicycles have all enjoyed moments of demarcating cool, handcrafted small-batch ceramics are suddenly the accessory of the moment.

Just as those earlier trends represented a tactile, down-to-earth counterbalance to our sped-up, technology-centered world, the rejection of factory-produced sameness in dinnerware and vases reflects a desire to get back to something more essential.

We want to know where our free-range eggs come from, and where our coffee beans are grown and roasted. We also want the vessels we use to consume those things to embody a deeper story about craftsmanship and creativity.

People are looking to have their humanity reflected back at them, said the veteran potter David Reid, a co-founder of KleinReid, a ceramics company in New York. People are moving back from slick and stainless steel to something warmer.

For the interior designer Kelly Wearstler, who recently teamed up with the ceramist Ben Medansky on a line of tableware bedecked with golden cubes, ceramics imbue a room with a sense of purpose. Something made of the hand is so special, it inherently adds soul and dimension within a space, she said.

Robert Sullivan, the contributing editor at Vogue who wrote the magazines ceramics article, said that ceramics are popular now because they are among the most obviously and literally handmade things.

Its an antidote to all the electronics, he added.

Julie Carlson, editor in chief of the design website Remodelista, has chronicled the rise. Its entwined with the farm-to-table movement, she said. Its this desire to know the origin of whats in your kitchen.

Its hard to keep track of them, she added of new ceramists. In the beginning, it seemed like there were just a few, but now there are more than we can cover, and more than we can invite to our markets.

Perhaps nowhere is this more notable than in Brooklyn and Queens, where there are no shortage of makeshift pottery studios, clay-throwing classes and boutiques that resemble the home page of Etsy.

Natalie Weinberger, 29, made the jump from the nonprofit world to being a full-time ceramist a year ago, and she shares a basement studio near McCarren Park in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with nine other upstart ceramists.

Demand for learning ceramics is crazy right now, and its hard to get your hands on studio space, said Ms. Weinberger, who makes vessels with striking sculptural forms, often with textured clay speckled with black volcanic sand.

The launchpad for many New York potters has been Choplet, a ceramics studio and teaching space that the French-born Nadeige Choplet opened with her husband, John Lego, in Williamsburg in 2005. When I started, I had four wheels and I was only giving two or three classes a week, Ms. Choplet said. But the space grew into a buzzing claymaking hub with more than 30 wheels, along with a separate studio called the Williamsburg Ceramic Center.

Photo

Despite all the extra space and expanded schedule, she said, We have wait lists, every time, for our night classes.

The demand for ceramics classes also extends to colleges such as Rhode Island School of Design, where the number of graduate students majoring in ceramics jumped about 50 percent this year.

In addition, Weve had a huge influx of students from other departments wanting to take ceramics, especially from architecture, industrial design and furniture, said Katy Schimert, an associate professor and department head of ceramics. All our nonmajor classes have long wait lists.

There is growing evidence that ceramics is moving beyond mere hobby to budding creative career, along the lines of artisanal chocolate.

I have a lot of people who happened to start a little Etsy account, and then got wholesale orders, Ms. Choplet said. They get their own space, and quit their jobs. Its happened a lot.

One of the success stories is Forrest Lewinger, 31, whose studio, Workaday Handmade, produces cups with marbleized glazes, earthy bowls with hand-carved geometric patterns, and ivory-colored vases with a confetti-like spatter of blue.

Photo

His career began with a small shared booth at the Williamsburg Renegade Craft Fair in 2012, which blossomed into a string of wholesale orders. Soon, Barneys New York and Anthropologie came calling.

Now, he has two part-time employees in a shared studio in Ridgewood, Queens. Its gotten to the point where I have to have someone else in here to help me, just to keep up, Mr. Lewinger said.

The giant of the new ceramics movement is Heath Ceramics in Sausalito, Calif., which to the world of clay is what Stumptown is to coffee or Brooklyn Brewery is to craft beer. In 2003, the husband-and-wife designers Robin Petravic and Catherine Bailey bought and restarted the company, which was originally founded in 1948 to produce midcentury modern housewares.

The couple edited the collections of dinnerware, decorative objects and tile, and introduced new pieces and artist collaborations while maintaining a focus on handcrafted production.

Along the way, they transformed Heath from a niche company, which did about $1 million in sales in 2003, to a globally known outfit with 200 employees that sells about $20 million in products a year. This October, it received a National Design Award from the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.

But like a lot of emerging potters, the couple says one of the original reasons they were attracted to ceramics was that it allowed them to oversee the design process from start to finish.

The nice thing about clay is that you can do it all, and it doesnt take a lot of resources to build it up, Mr. Petravic said. You cant buy a forge to make metal things. But clay and a wheel, or a mold, and a kiln, is pretty straightforward.

And as anyone who made a wonky ceramic ashtray as a child can tell you, theres a certain thrill to seeing malleable clay, formed by your own hands, become a vitrified, functional product.

This weeks puzzle was suggested by Kenneth Kong, a television host in Singapore. The challenge is a follow-up to the Cheryls Birthday Problem, which Kenneth sent viral several weeks ago after posting it to Facebook.

Before getting to Cheryl, I asked Kenneth what it was like to kick off such an online phenomenon (the puzzle was briefly the most-shared item for many news sources around the world, including The New York Times). He replied by email:

This astonishing response really went beyond my imagination. I think the post first caught attention because it fulfilled gossiping and criticizing factors. Some followers wonder what me and my wife were debating about, while the rest thought that its outrageous for kids nowadays to face such difficult test questions.

Photo After I seriously looked into the comments and saw how the story went around the world, Im glad that it took the limelight. This is the first time Ive seen so many people trying so hard to solve a math problem. Many people have a phobia towards maths, but the way the question was set makes it interesting, changing mindsets makes it worth trying. This little red dot in South East Asia may not be well-known for academic achievements, but educators are trying hard to keep us as competitive as possible. Well, I must say I enjoyed my one week of fame. People came to me to tell me how frustrated they were, not able to solve the infamous Cheryls Birthday quiz. Now, back to my normal island life.

Thank you, Kenneth. Lets now return to Cheryl with 

How Old Is Cheryl? Albert and Bernard now want to know how old Cheryl is. Cheryl: I have two brothers. The product of all our ages (i.e. my age and the ages of my two brothers) is 144, assuming that we use whole numbers as our ages. Albert: We still dont know your age. What other hints can you give us? Cheryl: The sum of all our ages is the number of this bus that we are on. Bernard: Of course, we know the bus number, but we still dont know your age. Cheryl: Oh, I forgot to tell you that my brothers are the same age. Albert and Bernard: Oh, now we know your age. So what is Cheryls age?

Thats it for this week. As always, once youre able to read comments for this post, use Gary Hewitts Enhancer to correctly view formulas and graphics. (Click here for an intro.) Do you have a favorite puzzle similar to this logic challenge? Email to gary.antonick@NYTimes.com.

Solution

Heres Kenneth Kong:

The solution is:

1st hint: Since the product of Cheryls and her bros age is 144, and all in whole numbers, breaking down all the fractions of multipliers, we will have a list of possible combinations.

2nd hint: The sum of Cheryls and her bros age is equal to the bus service number they were on. Therefore we add up the numbers in brackets. Albert and Bernard knew the bus service number, but still unsure about Cheryls age, indicating, the possible SUM is repeating.

1 x 1 x 144 (146)

1 x 2 x 72 (75)

1 x 3 x 48 (52)

1 x 4 x 36 (41)

1 x 6 x 24 (31)

1 x 8 x 18 (27)

1 x 9 x 16 (26)

1 x 12 x 12 (25)

2 x 2 x 36 (40)

2 x 3 x 24 (29)

2 x 4 x 18 (24)

2 x 6 x 12 (20)

2 x 8 x 9 (19)

3 x 3 x 16 (22)

3 x 4 x 12 (19)

3 x 6 x 8 (17)

4 x 4 x 9 (17)

4 x 6 x 6 (16)

Hence, the options left with SUM 19 and 17.

A) 2 x 8 x 9 (19)

B) 3 x 4 x 12 (19)

C) 3 x 6 x 8 (17)

D) 4 x 4 x 9 (17)

3rd hint: Cheryls bros are of same age, and the only option with repeating fractions is D.

Therefore Cheryl is 9 years old.

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Primary Night Takeaways: Hillary Clinton Is Shaken and Donald Trump Roars Back,['Alexander Burns'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The story is getting familiar: Donald J. Trump won the biggest contests of the night, as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas captured the most conservative state up for grabs. Hillary Clinton kept a clear upper hand in the Democratic race, but Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont proved he would not be driven away anytime soon.









Tuesdays elections could have brought new clarity to the presidential primaries. Instead, they only seemed to confirm that both parties would probably settle their nominations by battling for delegates well into the spring.

For Republicans, Trump is in control

Nothing silences criticism like victory, and Mr. Trump racked up several on Tuesday. His successes in Hawaii, Michigan and Mississippi dealt a painful psychological blow to Republicans who had convinced themselves that his campaign was losing steam.

But Mr. Trump won, and he won big, with no obvious cracks in his support from disaffected, lower-income whites.

Still, Mr. Trump has a lot to prove in the race: He is only now being subjected to withering, well-funded attack ads, and Mr. Cruz notched another small-state win in Idaho, again proving the tenacity of his support with hard-core conservatives.

Photo

The Democratic race is stalled

If Mrs. Clinton had crushed Mr. Sanders in Michigan, their contest might have been over in all but name. But his narrow win there ensures the fight will go on.

Yet in the bigger picture, the basic battle lines of the Democratic race have barely moved in weeks. In Michigan, Mr. Sanders dominated with young voters, independents and white liberals  his core constituencies all along.

Mrs. Clinton handily won partisan Democrats, low-income voters and black voters in Michigan, and routed Mr. Sanders in Mississippi with overpowering black support.

The outcome in Michigan showed how difficult it could be for Mrs. Clinton to knock Mr. Sanders cleanly out of the race, but Mr. Sanders has still not attracted the kind of coalition that would make him a genuine threat to win the nomination.

Rubio has been sidelined

It was a miserable, even disastrous night for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. He finished fourth in Michigan and Mississippi, languishing in single digits and collecting no delegates from those states. He must fight for survival in his home state next week, where even an upset win might not rescue his campaign.

Mr. Rubios core problem is that he has claimed no distinctive space in the race. Exit polls showed that Mr. Cruz and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio have seized big pieces of the partys right and left wings. Mr. Rubio has claimed no particular constituency at all.

Photo

Cruz and Kasich are in parallel universes

Mr. Kasich wins college towns. Mr. Cruz wins ultraconservative outer suburbs. Mr. Kasich wins liberal Republicans. Mr. Cruz overperforms with evangelicals.

For most of the 2016 campaign, the Republicans vying to overtake Mr. Trump have squabbled bitterly. But Mr. Kasich and Mr. Cruz have so far avoided direct conflict, and Tuesdays results show why: They are just not competing for the same voters. In theory, they could keep hassling Mr. Trump from opposite sides of the Republican Party for weeks or months to come.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The Midwest matters

The results in Michigan gave Mr. Sanders a big lifeline  and they may be somewhat encouraging to Mr. Trumps principal challengers, too. Despite Mr. Trumps double-digit win, he collected less than two-fifths of the vote, with about half of voters opting for either Mr. Cruz or Mr. Kasich.

For the underdogs in both parties, those results point the way toward a hard fight for delegates in the Midwest, where Mr. Trumps appeal is limited among Republicans and Mr. Sanderss hard-left message plainly appeals to liberal whites.

The political calendar is teed up for just such a battle in the Rust Belt. For all the focus on Floridas primary on March 15, three Midwestern states vote on the same day: Illinois, Missouri and Ohio. Wisconsin follows soon after, on April 5.

Open primaries matter

If Tuesdays Democratic primaries had been restricted to Democrats, Mrs. Clinton would have won landslides in Michigan and Mississippi. Had only Republicans voted, Mr. Trump would have won narrower victories over Mr. Cruz, and Mr. Kasich would have been relegated to a distant third place.

While Mrs. Clinton won Democrats by 16 points, Mr. Sanders won independents, who made up less than a third of the electorate, by 42 points, according to exit polls.

There is nothing illicit about winning primaries with support from independents. But the collection of states that allow crossover voting have become a frustrating obstacle to Mrs. Clinton as she works to lock down the Democratic nomination, and a potentially crippling problem for Mr. Cruz as he tries to build a winning coalition against Mr. Trump.

Since my husband and I began dating, deciding whose family to visit for holidays has caused strife. (They live too far to visit both.) This year, our first as a married couple, we settled on Thanksgiving with his and Christmas with mine. We will alternate next year. But now my husband says he cant miss his fathers familys Christmas party  to be held the day after Christmas this year. He proposes spending Christmas Eve and Christmas night together, then visiting his family for the weekend, leaving me with mine. But that wasnt our agreement, and I want us together. Ideas?









Anonymous, Ipswich, Mass.

It never hurts to remind folks on the verge of breaking promises that a deal is a deal  eggnog or no. But it rarely helps. Whats more, you and your husband probably still agree (in theory, anyway) that one harried trip per holiday beats two. Alternating the big ones was also a smart touch. Now, what is it they say about the best-laid plans of mice and men?

The unforeseen wrinkle, I take it, is the pesky party, which Hubby loves and which may be the only time he gets to see his cousins and uncles and aunts on that side of the family. It sounds as if he counted on its being held sufficiently before Christmas so that he could attend it and still hold up his side of your holiday bargain.

For the future, start lobbying now for the party to be given earlier in December to allow for his attendance (even when Christmas belongs to your clan). This year, decide how tough you want to be about pressing your claim. You are clearly right and may insist on his staying with your family through the weekend, as your grand bargain contemplated. But they dont call it the season of giving for nothing. Could you let him go (one last time) and accompany him? Think of it as an annoying Christmas gift.

Not for Consumption

Last night, my girlfriend and I gave a holiday party. It was a roaring success  with one exception. My girlfriend spent hours baking, constructing and decorating a gingerbread house, which we placed at a distance from the food and drinks table. (It was not meant for eating; it was a decoration for the holidays.) Still, someone broke off a piece of the roof and presumably ate it. We dont know who. My girlfriend is livid and wants me to call around to find the culprit. Should I?

Paul, Boston

You should not. And with any luck, your girlfriend will agree as the gingerbread debacle recedes in time. It sounds like an honest mistake. Even you required an entire parenthetical statement to describe the existential plane on which an edible house exists. Ties go to the eaters. (Personally, I cant see myself breaking off a chunk of virgin masonry. But it wasnt outrageous behavior.) Perhaps in lieu of phone calls, you can offer to be her gingerbread roofer and make a patch.

Too Haute to Handle

I have a lovely housekeeper who has worked for me, full time, for years. Lately, she has been giving me Hermes scarves for Christmas and my birthday. Of course I appreciate her generosity. But I know from other conversations I have with her that she cant afford these gifts. I dont want to insult her, but please help me steer her toward less expensive gifts.

Two choices, Lady Crawley: If money is no object (and I hear good help is hard to find), simply top up your housekeepers salary to cover the cost of the scarves. Otherwise, write in your thank-you note: I am touched by your generosity. But you work too hard to give me such extravagant gifts. Next year, please treat yourself instead.

This is somewhat in line with my philosophy of simply thanking people for gifts, not trying to control them. But $800 annually in silken ware seems steep. Still, if your housekeeper doesnt take the bait, leave it alone.

Pushing Back

We were informed recently that our company holiday party, normally a luncheon on the last working day before Christmas, will become a year-end celebration during the week between Christmas and New Years. The memo said that the days leading up to Christmas are hectic, and management decided we would enjoy the party more after the holiday. This seems wrong to me. Not to mention that some co-workers take that week as vacation. Is there anything you can do to help?

J.L.

Sadly, the jurisdiction of Social Qs is limited to ... well, nowhere. I see no harm in speaking (respectfully) to your supervisor, conveying your concern about vacationing co-workers. But in fairness, many people dont celebrate Christmas, and the days leading up to the holiday are pretty frantic. A leisurely year-end lunch sounds like a treat. Why not try it this year, and see how it goes? If the party is a bummer or a ghost town, you and your colleagues can mention it to the powers that be in January. Otherwise, Happy Year End!",[]
nytimes.com,2011-04-14 00:00:00,Sleep No More Is a Macbeth in a Hotel,['Ben Brantley'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Those pushy Macbeths may be backstabbing social climbers, but you must admit that their new digs are to die for. The Thane of Cawdor and his wife have moved into a deserted hotel in the hinterlands of the West 20s, and my dear, what theyve done with the place. Dont be surprised if it shows up soon on the cover of Architectural Digest, bloodstains and all.









Punchdrunk, a British site-specific theater company, has taken over three abandoned warehouses on West 27th Street to enact the sorry sights of the murderous Macbeths career in a movable orgy titled Sleep No More. And the resulting adventure in decor  a 1930s pleasure palace called the McKittrick  suggests what might have happened had Stanley Kubrick (of Eyes Wide Shut and The Shining) been asked to design the Haunted Mansion at Disney World, with that little old box maker Joseph Cornell as a consultant.

New Yorkers with fond memories of nights out in the era of theme-park clubs like Area and MK have the chance to relive their salad days with this production (if they can score tickets). But they should know that sentimentally partaking of any mood-altering substances is inadvisable.

An unimpaired sense of balance and depth perception is crucial to attending Sleep No More, which leads its audience on a merry, macabre chase up and down stairs, and through minimally illuminated, furniture-cluttered rooms and corridors. The creative team here has taken on the duties of messing with your head, which they do just as thoroughly as any artificial stimulant.

Youll notice that so far I have not mentioned the name of the writer who immortalized Macbeth. Though the title of Sleep No More and much of its shadow of a plot do come from the compact tragedy that is a favorite of high school English classes, this is not the place to look for insights into Shakespeare. (For those, you would be better off checking out the current Cheek by Jowl or Theater for a New Audience productions of Macbeth, in which the emphasis is on interior worlds instead of the World of Interiors.)

But this largely wordless production, directed by Felix Barrett and Maxine Doyle (and designed by Mr. Barrett, Livi Vaughan and Beatrice Minns), is not without thought-churning apercus. These have less to do with the comely dancers who act out the doomed paths of Macbeth and company than with those clumsy, anonymous lugs in white face masks who keep elbowing one another out of the way to get a better view of the sex and violence. Thats you and me, my fellow theatergoers.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

You see, everyone who attends Sleep No More is required to wear (and keep on) a Venetian carnival-style mask. You are also asked not to utter a word during the two and a half hours you are given to follow the characters of your choice from room to room. But you are encouraged to poke around in corners and trunks and bookcases, and allowed to get as close as (in)decency permits to the lithe-bodied denizens of this chic spook house. (Just dont touch them, though they may well reach out and touch you.)

Sleep No More is, in short, a voyeurs delight, with all the creepy, shameful pleasures that entails. As conceived by Punchdrunk (which took a similar approach to an operatic version of The Duchess of Malfi in London last summer), this tale of regicide taps the same impulses that draw us to Agatha Christie mysteries and sensational tabloids, flavored with the snob appeal of biographies of self-destructive aristocrats.

The idea is once youre let loose on one of the floors of the hotel, you pick out a single character and pursue him or her (though you can switch any time you want), as the performer runs, dances and vaults all over the place. Dressed in drop-dead, Deco-era evening clothes, scanty lingerie or nothing at all, these characters include the Macbeths (of course), Macduff and his wife (who is conspicuously pregnant), Duncan (the king) and various witches and hotel employees. (Because the roles are mostly double-cast, I am not mentioning individual performers, but they are all lissome enough to make the audience look slow and dumpy.)

These jaded figures can be found in bedrooms, bathrooms, ballrooms, hospital rooms and nurseries getting dressed and undressed, doing the foxtrot, making every kind of love, killing one another and washing off blood. (The Macbeth mansion has many bathtubs.) Choreographed by Ms. Doyle, these activities are executed with tense balletic virtuosity by neurotic, anguished and gymnastic creatures, who climb the walls (I mean literally) in moments of high stress.

The knockout set pieces (and the detail in every room is remarkable) include a painterly banquet scene and an unnerving black mass sequence led by three ambisexual witches. The lighting is ravishingly crepuscular. The mood-matching sound design includes period pop recordings (Goodnight Children, Everywhere, A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square), techno music (but only for the witches) and swoony, suspenseful Bernard Herrmann scores for Hitchcock movies.

References to Hitchcock  the McKittrick is a nod to Vertigo  abound. (A character named Mrs. Danvers, an allusion to the Hitchcock film Rebecca, was in an earlier and slightly less spectacular incarnation of Sleep No More, which I saw last year in Brookline, Mass.) That director was the ultimate master of making us feel complicit in films invasion of private lives and ugly deaths. And it seems to me that sense of guilty enjoyment, translated into theatrical terms, is a large part of what Punchdrunk is trying to elicit here.

It can make you feel kind of shabby, watching other audience members rifling through a suitcase that Lady Macduff has left on a bed or reading a letter on the desk in Duncans sitting room. (Its a thank-you note from the socially correct Lady Macbeth.) That doesnt mean that you wont follow their leads once theyve moved on. As an advertising slogan for a tabloid newspaper used to say, enquiring minds want to know.

KENT, Wash.  The headquarters of Blue Origin, the secretive rocket company in an industrial park here, is anonymous, with not even a sign at the road to announce the occupants.









On Tuesday, for the first time, Blue Origin, started by Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, opened its doors to reporters.

Welcome to Blue, Mr. Bezos said. Thank you for coming.

Blue Origin is part of a shift of the space business from NASA and aerospace behemoths like Lockheed Martin toward private industry, especially smaller entrepreneurial companies. Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, founded by another Internet entrepreneur, Elon Musk, has been the most visible and most successful of the new generation of rocket companies. Last Friday, it launched another satellite to orbit, but an attempt to land the booster on a floating platform again ended in an explosion.

Much more quietly, Blue Origin has also had big space dreams, but until now did not give outsiders a look at what it was doing.

Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Science Times Newsletter Every week, we'll bring you stories that capture the wonders of the human body, nature and the cosmos.

For almost four hours, Mr. Bezos, who only occasionally talks to the press, led 11 reporters on a tour of the factory and answered a litany of questions over lunch. He talked garrulously, his speech punctured by loud laughs. Its my total pleasure. I hope you can sense that I like this, he said.

He described an image on a wall in the companys central area, which showed two tortoises holding an hourglass and gazing upward at a stylized image of the planets and cosmos. Below is Blue Origins motto: Gradatim ferociter, Latin for step by step, ferociously  no cutting of corners, but no dillydallying, either. You can do the steps quickly, but you cant skip any steps, Mr. Bezos said.

He also offered updates on progress for his space tourism plans. The reusable New Shepard spacecraft that launched to the outskirts of space in November and then made a return trip in January will launch again soon. Depending on how well the testing goes, paying tourists, six at a time, might start making the short trips, experiencing a few minutes of weightlessness in space as soon as 2018, he said.

At times, he told himself to stop talking, and let his engineers make their presentations about a new engine, the BE-4, which is under development with tests of a full version beginning by the end of the year.

Mr. Bezos started Blue Origin in 2000, although few people knew about it then. For the next few years, about half a dozen people explored whether there might be a better way to get to space than rockets powered by loud, inefficient chemical combustion. The conclusion: there is not.

Mr. Bezos said he had studied and thought about rockets since he was 5 years old. I never expected to have the resources to start a space company, he said. I won a lottery ticket called Amazon.com.

Mr. Bezos declined to say how much money he had poured into his dream. Lets just say its a lot, he said.

Around 2005, Mr. Bezos said he began rocket development in earnest. Still, almost no one knew what he was doing. For years, what went on here was mysterious and unknown, like Willy Wonkas chocolate factory in Roald Dahls childrens book.

Occasionally news would be tossed out to the outside world  an award by NASA, a blog post by Mr. Bezos, a video of a successful launch. Last year, the company made a splashy public announcement at Cape Canaveral, Fla., when Blue Origin announced it would launch rockets into orbit from there.

Like Mr. Musk, Mr. Bezos talks about Blue Origin less as a business than as part of a glorious future for humanity, with millions of people living and working off the planet. It is also a path, he asserted, that humanity must pursue if it is to continue to prosper.

His argument was simple: Energy consumption has been rising at 2 or 3 percent a year. Even at that modest rate, within a few centuries, the energy usage would be equal to the energy produced by high-efficiency solar cells covering the entire surface of the planet. Well be using all of the solar energy that impacts the Earth, he said. Thats an actual limit.

But there is much energy and raw materials to use elsewhere in the solar system, and eventually, he prophesies, there will be the great inversion. Instead of factories on Earth manufacturing sophisticated components that go into tiny machines that go into space, the heavy manufacturing will all be done elsewhere, and Earth, he joked, would be zoned for residential and light industrial use, allowing much of Earth to return to a more natural state. Itll be universities and houses and so on, he said.

That is still far in the future. For now, Blue Origins business plans fall in three categories. The first is space tourism, with short hops launching from West Texas on the New Shepard, a competitor to Virgin Galactic, Richard Bransons space start-up. Space tourism is not just a frivolity for the rich, but a necessary steppingstone to develop the expertise in a new technology, Mr. Bezos said, much like the early days of airplanes or how video games spurred the development of more powerful computer chips.

Currently, most rocket companies launch, at most, about a dozen times a year. You never get really great at something you do 10, 12 times a year, Mr. Bezos said. With a small fleet of reusable New Shepard rockets, Blue Origin could be launching dozens of times a year.

The other business plans are for selling its rocket engines to other companies like United Launch Alliance, which is planning to use them for the Vulcan, a next-generation rocket to replace the Atlas 5 and Delta 4, and for its own larger rocket to lift payloads to orbit.

Mr. Bezos said Blue Origin was quiet not necessarily to be secretive, but to avoid overpromising itself. Space is really easy to overhype, he said.

The tour would not be the last time the doors are open.

Later this year, Blue Origin will give more details about its designs for the larger rocket that will launch from Cape Canaveral, and Mr. Bezos said there would be an opportunity to watch a test flight of New Shepard in Texas.

We will not be strangers, Mr. Bezos said at the end.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Latinos Slow-Burn Anger,['H Ctor Tobar'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Los Angeles  IN this great season of seething American rage, showmen and rabble-rousers have the floor.









Round up the field hands and the busboys and deport them southward, they say. Build a wall! they chant at rallies and basketball games. Dip bullets in pigs blood for our Muslim enemies.

By comparison, we Latino citizens of the United States suffer from a rage deficit.

Consider our victimized brothers and sisters, the handcuffed and hunted of Mesoamerica: the Oaxacans and the Guatemalans, and the Hondurans and the many others who cross the sands of the Sonoran Desert to reach the Promised Land. They die in hundreds every year.

When was the last time we annoyed you with our outrage about their preventable deaths? The last time one of our leaders unleashed a viral television rant about the failure to enact immigration reform?

Our cries of protest and complaint might as well be whispers. And yet ... I figured two recent pieces of news might finally raise the volume of Latino anger.

The first was a plan by the Obama administration to conduct raids against hundreds of immigrants who are among the recent wave of refugees from Central American violence. The second was the scandalous treatment of some of those refugees, including minors who were released into the custody of sex traffickers.

How could this happen? Do we count for so little?

Last century, I was a student who marched and chanted the slogans of the day: U.S. out of El Salvador! Free Nelson Mandela! Maybe what we need now is a hashtag that summarizes our sense of worth and how weve been wronged. Say, #brownlivesmatter.

I went to the campus of California State University, Los Angeles, where the student body is more than half Latino, to try out my idea. Think of the undocumented roundups, I told the students I met. Think of our second-class status, even in Los Angeles, where Mexican and Guatemalan are often synonymous with laborer. Isnt it time for a Brown Lives Matter movement? I asked.

Almost all the Latino students objected on the ground of cultural appropriation. Black people have suffered enough, they said. Lets not take their slogan, too.

Theres nothing in American history as bad as slavery, a criminal justice major told me. No argument there.

And a graphic-design major pointed out, Well, you know, a lot of Latino people can pass for white.

True, I conceded. Like Marco Rubio.

Sure, these students were angry about the marginalized status of people of Mexican and Central American descent in the United States. One Latina told me how much she resented the othering she encountered because of her appearance and Spanish surname: People ask me all the time, Where are you from? And they dont mean, Are you from the Valley or Long Beach? 

Yet, she didnt see the need to make a stink about it. Why embarrass herself getting angry just because of some idiot?

Herein lies the reason for our anger deficit: We hear the voice of our mothers saying, Mijos, you only demean yourself if you lash back at an insult.

Please dont confuse this forbearance with passivity. And dont call Latinos the sleeping giant of American civic life. (That cliche will make me scream.)

The Latino students I met resist oppression in a low-key, goal-oriented way. By working full time while getting a degree. By studying to become breadwinners who give back to their communities. And by voting for a candidate likely to support immigration reform.

Only a handful, right now, feel the need to take to the streets, like the group arrested after blocking downtown traffic in a protest against deportations  a brave action that was barely a blip on the nations radar. One young woman at Cal State told me she felt guilty for not going, given that her own mother is still trying to sort out her immigration papers after more than two decades in the United States.

Thats all right, I told her. Getting good grades is also a way of resisting racism  though studiousness alone may not get us to the Promised Land.

For that, wed need an eloquent voice of leadership (think Barack Obama, Philadelphia, 2008). Or a book that changes the national conversation, as The Grapes of Wrath or The Jungle did. Another half-million people protesting on the streets (as we did here in 2006) wouldnt hurt.

Until then, Ill supply my rage needs by following a group of writers and comedians known as the Latino Rebels who tweeted sarcastically about how endorsements from anti-immigrant figures like the controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio would help Donald J. Trump do really well with the Hispanics.

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Recep Tayyip Erdogans Despotic Zeal,['Sevgi Akarcesme'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Istanbul  THE virtual control he already has of a majority of Turkeys newspapers and TV stations apparently isnt enough for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. On Friday, with the zeal of its despotic leader, his government seized my paper, Todays Zaman, and its parent, the Turkish-language Zaman, which is the highest-circulating daily in the country. Together, these titles were two of the few remaining independent voices inside Turkey  and Todays Zaman, in particular, was a reliable English-language news source for diplomats, academics and expatriates.









On Friday, a government-controlled court appointed trustees to take over the newspapers in what amounts to a politically motivated assault. At midnight, protesters faced tear gas and water cannons as riot police stormed our Istanbul headquarters.

The authorities used power tools to force open the iron gate to the building. The following day, our Internet connection was cut off to stop staff members from working on a special edition about the takeover. Since then, the authorities have been unplugging the newspapers servers, destroying our digital archive.

Some hours after the raid, I told the police officer smoking a cigarette outside the main gate, This is a nonsmoking area. He replied: Not anymore. That response underscores a broader shift in Turkey: a dangerous trajectory toward an end of the rule of law.

Its bad enough that more than 20 Turkish journalists are behind bars. But Friday will be remembered as the day when media freedoms were even more severely curtailed, in flagrant violation of the Constitution.

In November, two prominent Turkish journalists, Can Dundar and Erdem Gul, senior editors of the daily newspaper Cumhuriyet, were arrested on charges of aiding an armed terrorist organization and publishing material that threatened state security. They were released last month, after the constitutional court ruled that their rights had been violated, but still face trial and, if convicted, possible life sentences. Mr. Erdogan said he had no respect for the court decision that led to their release.

This pressure is not a recent thing. In December 2014, state authorities detained Zamans editor in chief at the time, Ekrem Dumanli, as part of a systematic crackdown on government critics. My predecessor as editor in chief of Todays Zaman, Bulent Kenes, was imprisoned last October for critical Twitter comments. I myself received a suspended jail sentence late last year for somebody elses response to one of my tweets.

Why have we been targeted by the president? According to the court order, these newspapers are accused of disseminating terrorist propaganda and aiding terrorist organizations. This has become a convenient catchall accusation for clamping down on government critics.

In the past, Zaman and Todays Zaman supported the Erdogan-led Justice and Development Partys pro-Western and democracy-oriented policies, as well as its efforts to introduce reforms that would pave the way toward Turkish membership in the European Union. Since the beginning of this decade, however, Mr. Erdogan and his party have become increasingly authoritarian.

Take, for example, the polices brutal response to the 2013 Gezi Park protests in Istanbul that arose after the uprooting of trees and the construction of a shopping mall. The protests attracted worldwide news coverage and elicited criticism from Turkeys most steadfast Western allies.

In March 2014, Mr. Erdogan, who was then Turkeys prime minister (he was elected president later that year), seemed to announce the nature of the new rule  one that involves silencing all forms of dissent  when he called for social media sites such as Facebook and YouTube to be shut down. He went on to describe Twitter as the worst menace to society.

The true oppression began in 2013 after two damning corruption inquiries resulted in several cabinet ministers being forced out. Trying to turn attention away from the graft allegations, Mr. Erdogan accused critics of being part of a parallel structure organized by the Turkish preacher Fethullah Gulen and his Hizmet movement that was seeking to overthrow him. A witch hunt followed against bureaucrats, businesses, journalists, teachers, philanthropists and ordinary citizens with perceived sympathies for Mr. Gulen, who has been living in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999.

Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

His sermons were published in Zaman, but Mr. Gulen has no official ties with the media group that owns the newspapers. Yet the court order that enabled the seizure of Zaman and Todays Zaman argued, without providing any evidence, that Mr. Gulen controlled the newspapers. Many of my colleagues are inspired by his peaceful, moderate teaching  as are millions of people around the world  but it is an insult to their intelligence and integrity to suggest they are under his control.

This may be the last article I write as the editor in chief of Todays Zaman, as I objected to the new administrations censorship on the day they turned Zaman into an official mouthpiece with a pro-government cover article. The world must tell the Erdogan regime that enough is enough.

As we saw in the court ruling on Mr. Dundar and Mr. Gul, which came after the American vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., expressed support for the two journalists, the international community still has leverage over Turkey. Merely showing concern for press freedom and civil liberties in Turkey while turning a blind eye to violations for the sake of business and regional deals may pay off for now, but unless the West takes firm action to check Mr. Erdogans slide into authoritarian rule, it risks losing a stable ally and rare democracy in a Muslim-majority nation.",[]

A la suite de larticle  Au Musee dOrsay, un bilan en trompe-lil  paru dans Le Monde du 2 fevrier, nous avons recu de Guy Cogeval, president du Musee, la lettre suivante :

 Si vous faites etat des succes du Musee dOrsay, de bons chiffres, dexpositions prometteuses, dexposition qui ont massivement attire les visiteurs, si vous annoncez des dons exceptionnels qui enrichissent de maniere significative les collections, il ny aurait cependant plus de pilote dans lavion et ce pilote absent, ce serait moi, evidemment.

La contradiction est piquante : il est difficile dimaginer que ce Musee a la derive puisse rencontrer tant de succes artistiques et commerciaux, si plus personne ne preside a ses destinees.

De meme, presente comme impotent tout en etant qualifie de genie, vous nexpliquez pas comment je ferais pour presider et etre commissaire dexposition dans cet etat daffaiblissement generalise.

Ce qui semble troublant, cest que les elements utilises pour qualifier mon bilan de trompe-lil seraient des dysfonctionnements datant de 2013 et des declarations enervees et acrimonieuses de chefs de service et de conservateurs cachees derriere le confort de lanonymat, qui, en cette periode propice, auraient decide, evidemment par interet pour le Musee dOrsay qui pourtant se porte bien, de donner libre cours a leur volonte de denonciation.

Je souhaite retablir les faits : le rapport remis en mars 2013 par linspection generale a rendu des conclusions positives sagissant de ma gestion du Musee dOrsay et de ses collaborateurs ; je regrette que vous ne le disiez pas.

De meme, mon accident vasculaire cerebral date de juillet 2014 et jen suis remis. Rien ne justifie des attaques sans reserve sur mon pretendu etat de sante.

Enfin, en cette periode de renouvellement, qui explique mon silence a la suite de vos demandes (je suis candidat a ma succession et je nentendais pas mexprimer pendant cette periode), vous apportez du credit et faites de la publicite a des declarations anonymes de personnes non identifiees, qui pourraient etre soit des candidats, soit des soutiens des candidats devoiles ou non, de ces nombreux noms qui circuleraient, prets a prendre ma succession...

Kate McDermott was just a week shy of giving birth to her first child when she and her husband, Steve, moved from Hoboken, N.J., to Westwood, N.J., in 2008. Six years, three more children and another house later, the McDermotts still find Westwood delivering on the qualities they originally sought.









Coming from an urban setting, we wanted somewhere we could walk to town, and didnt necessarily have to get in the car, Ms. McDermott, 34, said. We still do that now, she added, for outings like getting ice cream at Conrads Confectionery. My kids love going there in the summer and walking up to the open window at night.

Like many young families who have moved to Westwood, the McDermotts were attracted first by the boroughs bustling commercial district and convenient commuter access to New York City, and later discovered the areas community spirit and natural beauty.

Known as the hub of the Pascack Valley, Westwood is the largest by population of eight Bergen County municipalities that make up the valley, defined by the Pascack Brook, a tributary of the Hackensack River. In addition to its expansive downtown and residential neighborhoods, Westwoods 2.3 square miles contains ponds, brooks and parks that give it a more rural feel.

Many of the towns nearly 11,000 residents have long been aware of Westwoods advantages.

We have a number of attractive neighborhoods with a variety of houses at not terribly expensive prices, said Joan Sobeck, an agent with Re/Max Elite Associates who has lived here for 50 years. You have people who dont want to leave the area, or cant afford to leave, so they just add on.

In 2014, the McDermotts, with twins on the way, saw themselves quickly outgrowing their three-bedroom one-and-a-half-bath side hall colonial. Rather than expanding, they began looking for another house in Westwood. They wanted to stay in their neighborhood, a historic section known as Goodwin Park, which allows Mr. McDermott, 38, who commutes to his job in advertising sales at Google in Manhattan, to walk to the train station. When they found out a five-bedroom three-bath center hall colonial around the corner was going on the market, they jumped on it, paying $659,000 and moving in that June.

Their original house sold quickly to another young couple, Tom and Jennifer Fredeman, who had been living with their 2-month-old baby in a one-bedroom apartment in White Plains, and were looking for something bigger. Mr. Fredeman, 30, said his wife was driving around the area one day and happened on an open house at the McDermotts home, a 1926 colonial. They immediately put in an offer and bought it for $425,000.

It had everything on our wish list  a fireplace, a foyer, a separate garage  and it was slightly older so it had a little more character, said Mr. Fredeman, a field engineer who works in New York City and enjoys running around Westwood with his daughter in her jogging stroller.

For Ms. McDermott, who grew up in the neighboring town of Hillsdale and whose parents own a business in Westwood, coming back to the area was the right choice.

The town has changed a lot, for the better, she said. There are so many more restaurants and businesses. On Saturdays its become a real destination spot. And from a family perspective, were part of a community. Were all happy here.

What Youll Find

Westwood has a more middle-class feel than some of its neighboring Bergen County towns. It is often compared to Ridgewood, since both towns have thriving downtowns, but Westwood is a little more down to earth, said Margaret Hanna, an agent with Keller Williams Valley Realty.

The borough has a variety of housing styles, from the elegant historic homes in the Goodwin Park area toabundant ranches, split-levels, Cape Cods and smaller colonials. Rental and condominium options include older, midsizeapartment complexes and newer garden-style townhouses.

Besides the busy commercial district, which runs along Broadway, Westwood Avenue and Center Avenue, theres also Westwood Plaza, an outdoor shopping mall that has a Kmart and a T.J. Maxx, plus a small shopping plaza near the train station with a Trader Joes. Westwood is home to the Hackensack University Medical Center at Pascack Valley.

The borough has a volunteer ambulance corps and a volunteer fire department, which includes the former fire chief Jaymee Hodges, whose family has been in Westwood for almost 100 years. Mr. Hodges, who lives in the house he grew up in, runs Hodges & Sons Plumbing and Heating with his two sons, both of whom live in Westwood, as does one of his two daughters. He is also a member of the boroughs planning board.

Its a nice, affordable community, Mr. Hodges said. Someone can find a house that needs a lot of work for $250,000 to $300,000, or a place that needs a decent amount of work for $300,000 to $350,000.

What Youll Pay

On March 2, there were 26 single-family houses on the market, according to the New Jersey Multiple Listing Service, plus two two-family houses, four condominiums and one townhouse. A total of 104 houses sold in 2015, for an average price of $448,993, compared with 74 homes in 2014 for an average of $446,266.

The highest-priced house on the market on March 2 was a six-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath 1920s Georgian colonial in the Goodwin Park area listed at $1.249 million. The lowest-priced home not in foreclosure or in a short sale was a three-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath colonial listed at $329,000. The available condominiums included a one-bedroom one-bath unit listed at $193,000, and a two-bedroom two-bath listed at $209,900.

What to Do

Restaurants and shops downtown are mostly of the mom-and-pop variety, like the Rolling Pin Cafe, the L.N. Grand 5 & 10 store, and Conrads Confectionery, an institution since 1928 for candy and ice cream. Also dating to 1928 is Westwood Cinemas, an Art Deco-style movie house that shows first-run films. Residents can catch open-air movies in the summer at VeteransMemorial Park, where the borough also hosts summer concerts at the parks bandstand.

The Westwood Recreation Department offers a variety of summer camp options for children. Westvale Park has a playground, baseball and softball fields, and an enclosed area for dogs. The 79-acre Pascack Brook County Park has a fishing pond, tennis courts, ball fields and walking trails, among other features.

The Schools

Part of the Westwood Regional School District, Westwood shares a middle school and a junior/senior high school with neighboring Washington Township. The borough has two elementary schools, Berkeley and Brookside, serving a total of 680 students from kindergarten to fifth grade. The Westwood Regional Middle School, in Westwood, serves 430 students in sixth and seventh grades. The regional high school, with 1,032 students, is in Washington Township, and consistently ranks in the top 100 public high schools in the state. The schools music program is highly regarded. The high schools average SAT scores for 2013-14 were 514 in reading, 537 in math and 512 in writing, compared with state averages of 496, 521 and 497.

The Commute

Westwood is about 10 miles northwest of the George Washington Bridge. New Jersey Transit trains run from Westwood to Penn Station in New York, with atransfer in Secaucus, taking about 55 to 65 minutes and costing $9.75, or $298 for a monthly pass. New Jersey Transit bus No. 165 runs to New Yorks Port Authority, which takes 95 minutes and costs $7 one way, or $199 for a monthly pass.

The History

Originally the site of grist and saw mills along the Musquapsink Brook, Westwood boomed after the Erie Railroad extended New York rail service west to neighboring Hillsdale in 1870. After that, small hotels, factories, distilleries, churches and shops sprang up, according to Westwoods 2007 master plan. The borough was officially incorporated in 1894.",[]

AMSTERDAM  Paul Gauguin and many of his contemporaries were so much more than just post-Impressionists  a term largely used to define almost every artist in France in the last decade of the 19th century.









Indeed, they were all grappling with the profound impact of Impressionism. But Gauguin, for example, painted bold colors straight from the paint tube, without mixing, on flat surfaces, lacking linear perspective, with thick outlines around the figures and textured surfaces. A small group of painters at the Academie Julian in Paris felt this approach should be the future of art  a true heralding of artistic life after Impressionism. They followed his example, naming themselves Les Nabis, or The Prophets, because they wanted to usher in a new era of painting.

Maurice Denis, a theoretician, was the intellectual leader of the group, and in a manifesto of 1890 he reminded his compatriots that painting is essentially a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order. Other painters who supported this notion were Paul Serusier, Edouard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard, whose intense use of color made him perhaps the most famous in the group.

That is what unites the painters of Gauguin, Bonnard, Denis: A Russian Taste for French Art, an exhibition at the Hermitage Amsterdam that explores the work and legacy of Les Nabis. The show brings together works from two key collections amassed by the Russian collectors Ivan Morozov and Sergei Shchukin, who were scooping up art in Paris while Les Nabis were in vogue.

About 70 paintings and a handful of sculptures tell the story of this short-lived klatch of artists who may have, in fact, ushered in the next era of art. In addition to three major works by Gauguin, the show includes important paintings from the era, including Bonnards monumental triptych Mediterranee (1911), an interior from a room in a mansion by Denis, as well as work by other acolytes like Felix Vallotton, Aristide Maillol and Theophile Steinlen.

Its often said that Les Nabis were the announcement of Art Deco and Art Nouveau, said Paul Mosterd, the deputy director of the Hermitage Amsterdam, who helped curate the exhibition. They were rebellious, totally fed up with the success of Impressionism and getting bored. They believed in trusting your own senses, being individual, being arrogant, saying we can do better.

Calling themselves prophets was something of an inside joke, Mr. Mosterd explained, because these artists did not take themselves quite so seriously. But the Hermitages curator of exhibitions, Vincent Boele, says they did, in fact, usher in a new era of painting.

You could see them as the prophets of modern art, Mr. Boele said. They were some of the first modern painters who tried to paint according to a theory  that painting is a flat surface covered by colors. That was one step below abstract painting, which was later developed by people like Picasso and Braque.

Les Nabis, according to Mr. Mosterd, were the most influential artists of the beginning of the 20th century. What do you do after Impressionism if you want to find a new way? Thats an unbelievable task, but they managed, he said. They found this very colorful and decorative style, painting on very flat surfaces and using color, color, color.

The group of young painters attracted the attention of Morozov, a Russian textile millionaire who spent a great deal of time in Paris and bought art there throughout the Impressionist and post-Impressionist period and imported them to his palaces in Russia.

Morozov was particularly fascinated by Denis and in 1908 he commissioned the painter to decorate the concert hall in his Moscow mansion. The resulting work, The Story of Cupid and Psyche, depicting scenes from the Latin love story by Apuleius in bold pastel colors, includes seven paintings and six decorative panels. The entire interior has been reassembled and installed in the Hermitage Amsterdam as it was in Morozovs home. After the October Revolution of 1917, Morozov fled Russia with his family and his collection was confiscated; Deniss paintings were removed from the mansion in 1948, and rolled up and stored until the 1990s, when they were exhibited in the State Hermitage. This is the first time since they were in Morozovs mansion that they are being presented exactly as Denis designed them for the room, in a fully reconstructed setting.

Morozov was also an avid collector of Bonnards works, buying some of his finest paintings, including Landscape in Dauphine and Train and Barges, and commissioning the triptych Mediterranee, a view of a bucolic garden on a warm day, which is considered to be one of the great decorative paintings of the early 20th century.

For his part, Shchukin was also a fan of Denis, but he paid little attention to Bonnard. His purchases included works by Nabis artists who had more of a Symbolist bent, like Firmin Maglin, Alfred Guillou, Gaston La Touche, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and Eugene Carriere.

Gauguin never counted himself among Les Nabis, but he is often thought of as their inspirational leader. The exhibition includes three of his most famous canvasses, including the iconic image of two women in Tahiti seated on the ground eating fruit, Sacred Spring: Sweet Dreams (Nave Nave Moe) (1894).

The artworks from Morozov and Shchukin are on loan to Amsterdam from the State Hermitage in St. Petersburg.

Works from both collections will be presented as part of a permanent exhibition of paintings from the late 19th century until the present, in a new wing being built opposite the Winter Palace. Its quite exceptional that we got this collection right now, Mr. Boele said. Many of these painting will go into that new wing and they wont leave Russia for at least the next 10 years.",[]

LONDON  Less than a year after his unexpected general election victory, Prime Minister David Cameron has undertaken an even greater challenge. Staking his future on the outcome, he is holding a referendum on June 23 to decide whether Britain should stay in the European Union, or leave.









Mr. Cameron is said to be a lucky politician, good in a crisis. But is this a gamble too far?

Not since 1975 have Britains voters been given a specific say on their countrys participation in the union, which has undergone a transformation in the intervening years, evolving from a free-trade pact into an integrated political and economic alliance with many of the features of a superstate. Those who favor Britains departure, or Brexit, claim that too much control has been lost to the European Commission in Brussels and the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

Like a majority of Conservatives of his generation, Mr. Cameron himself is a euroskeptic, firmly opposed to European federalism. Yet he believes with no less vigor that Britain can have the best of both worlds, and would suffer economically, diplomatically and strategically outside the union.

Photo

As evidence of his determination to strike a sensible balance, the prime minister promised to renegotiate Britains terms of membership before putting the matter before the electorate. This deal, struck in Brussels on Feb. 19 after more than 30 hours of talks, is considerably better than most of the critics will admit. On a range of issues  Britains exemption from the goal of ever closer union, the benefits it must pay to European Union migrants, the position of the City of London, the ability of national parliaments to resist European law  Mr. Cameron won significant concessions.

The Leave camp claims that this so-called special status is flimsy and will lack the status of law until enshrined in a European Union treaty. But as those around Mr. Cameron admit, the fine print of the agreement was never going to be the deciding factor in the referendum.

Inasmuch as such surveys can be relied on after failing to predict the wide margin of Mr. Camerons victory in last years general election, opinion polls suggest that 15 to 20 percent of voters are undecided. It is their support that both campaigns must now chase. And that battle became all the more dramatic when Boris Johnson, the charismatic Conservative mayor of London, declared himself a supporter of a Brexit.

Like Mr. Cameron, Mr. Johnson is an upper-middle-class product of Englands most famous private school, Eton. But their styles could scarcely be more different.

In his statement to members of Parliament about the deal and referendum, Mr. Cameron made scathing references to Mr. Johnsons position and ambitions. These were ill received by the mayor. Neither man looks in any mood to back down. Whichever side prevails at the ballot box, this particular breach may be irreparable.

Mr. Johnson was only a political friend. But Michael Gove, the highly regarded justice secretary, has been close to Mr. Cameron for years. On the night of the 2010 election, Mr. Goves wife looked after the Cameron children. Mr. Gove also helped to write most of Mr. Camerons key speeches. So his decision to champion Britains exit from the union is a blow to Mr. Cameron personally as well as politically.

Another longtime ally, Michael Howard, a former party leader and now a Conservative peer, has also abandoned the prime ministers camp. On Feb. 25, he wrote in The Daily Telegraph that Mr. Camerons quest for a better deal for Britain had met with failure. The only step that might shake Europes leaders out of their complacency, he went on, was the shock of a vote by the British people to leave.

So much has been imperiled by this referendum. Membership in the European Union is not the essence of the countrys nationhood, but it gives Britain global punch and secures its economic prosperity. If Britons vote to leave, they will also be voting, in effect, for Mr. Cameron to quit Downing Street, his home of six years. After the distraction of the long referendum campaign, the Conservative Party would then be embroiled in a monthslong leadership contest. This would probably involve a runoff between George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. Johnson, his prospects enhanced by backing the winning side in the referendum.

This would be merely the local consequence. As Britain formalized its withdrawal, it would find its status in the world dropping like a bad stock. Britains special relationship with the United States would doubtless endure in rhetoric and sentiment. But America would need a new best friend for its negotiations with the European bloc.

Within Britains borders, most Scottish voters would be deeply aggrieved at exiting the European Union. One of the first tasks confronting the new prime minister could well be to grant a further referendum on the union of England and Scotland. The last such vote, in September 2014, resulted in a defeat for Scottish independence (by 55 percent to 45 percent), but the Scottish National Party has tightened its political grip since then. A Brexit could then be enough to drive Scotland and England apart  if only to allow the Scots to negotiate continued membership as a distinct nation.

A leadership crisis, the breakup of Britain and a shrinking role on the global stage as a commercial, diplomatic and strategic force: The stakes could hardly be higher. When Mr. Cameron won last years general election, he called it the sweetest victory. Doubtless it was. But losing the referendum would be the most bitter defeat imaginable.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,19 Shabab Fighters Die in Somalia in Strike Aided by U.S.,['Mohammed Ibrahim'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

MOGADISHU, Somalia  Only days after American aircraft struck a Shabab training camp in Somalia, American Special Operations forces and Somali troops carried out a raid against Shabab fighters, officials said Wednesday, in a sign of heightened pressure against the militant group.









Somali government officials said that commandos in helicopters raided a militant base in the village of Awdhegle in the lower Shabelle region, nearly 40 miles west of Mogadishu. The commandos landed a few miles outside the village before advancing on the base, killing 19 militants in the operation, officials said.

Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said that American attack helicopters were used in the operation, and that American military personnel had accompanied Somali troops but that they did not go all the way to the objective.

He would not say whether the Americans stayed on the helicopters throughout the operation.

I can tell you that U.S. military personnel served in an advisory role to enable the Somali operation, he said, but insisted that it was their mission. We were acting in an advisory role.

It seems that the United States is changing its strategy and upping the tempo of strikes against the Shabab. The reasons may be that the Shabab have taken over several towns in recent months; Somalia is looking shakier than it has in years; and the Shabab have shown a greater interest in somewhat sophisticated terrorism, like using a laptop bomb, which nearly brought down a jetliner flown by Daallo Airlines, an airline based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in February.

In the past, there was a list of targeted people that gets approved by the White House, said a former American official who worked in Somalia and insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive American policy. Now theres still approval from Washington, but the rules have loosened, and we can strike faster.

He said the American military planners had upped their game because these guys are out there in greater numbers than we thought.

Military officials say there are about 50 members of American Special Operations forces in Somalia working with Somali and African Union forces. But private contractors in Somalia said they had seen at least 150 American personnel recently on one Somali base.

One American defense official denied that there had been a policy change on attacking the Shabab.

We routinely maintain U.S. forces in the region to monitor terrorist activities, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss American strategy.

But a second official, also speaking anonymously for the same reason, said that there was increased worry about a resurgent Shabab, adding that We will act swiftly to address any threat to our own national security and that of our regional allies.

The raid in Awdhegle came after a major assault by American aircraft on a Shabab training camp on Saturday. That attack, which American officials said was carried out by American drones and warplanes, killed about 150 Shabab fighters assembled for what officials believe to have been a graduation ceremony.

The former American official said that American military planners probably arrived at that death toll by looking at aerial photos taken of the graduation right before the strike.

It was the deadliest assault on the Shabab in the more than decade-long American campaign against the group, and a sharp departure from previous American strikes, which have focused more on the groups leaders, not on its foot soldiers.

The Shabab have denied that 150 of their fighters were killed at the camp over the weekend, saying that the death toll cited by Americans was exaggerated. But the group confirmed that the attack took place.

In the raid overnight on Tuesday, the Shabab confirmed that one of their fighters was killed, but asserted that the assault against it had been unsuccessful. Residents in Awdhegle village reported hearing intense gun battles around midnight on Tuesday, causing confusion, shock and fear.

Abdulaziz Abu Muscab, a Shabab spokesman, said that two helicopters had dropped foreign soldiers outside the village. But he said Shabab fighters had repelled the attack, which he said lasted for about 30 minutes.

The Shabab have recently intensified their attacks against the government and in public places. On Wednesday morning, a car bomb exploded at a restaurant in Mogadishu, killing three police officers and the restaurants owner, according to Gen. Ali Hersi Barre, a police commander.

The Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that had targeted government officials at the restaurant.",[]
nytimes.com,2015-03-14 00:00:00,Cabaret and Hedwig Get Tougher Onstage,['Ben Brantley'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The things a girl has to endure to get ahead in show business. The humiliation, the rejection, the objectification, the manhandling and  worst of all  the being treated as if you didnt even exist. Its enough to make even the sunniest chorine feel burned out by the end of a working night.









If you dont believe me, ask one of those jaded ladies from Berlin who are currently plying their trade on Broadway: Sally Bowles and her sister in showbiz suffering, Hedwig. They know the score so well they can sing it in their sleep (or on their backs, anyway). While you may think youve heard quite enough of what they have to say, you might want to take another listen.

Thats because Sally, the coked-up, ginned-up heroine of Cabaret, at Studio 54, and Hedwig, the German-born wig wearer and rock singer from Hedwig and the Angry Inch, at the Belasco Theater, have been given new lives in their respective hit shows. And while theyve never looked wearier, theyve also rarely seemed more fully alive.

The movie actress Sienna Miller (Factory Girl, American Sniper) has shrugged on Sallys hard-won fur coat in Cabaret, while Hedwig, the transgender rock demi-semi-star of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, has been reincarnated by the man who created her back in 1998, the writer and actor John Cameron Mitchell. Each is the latest in a succession of starry names to have inhabited the parts.

But while youre watching them, Ms. Miller and Mr. Mitchell make you believe that they have exclusive rights to their roles. They have both brought additional grit to shows set in seedy environments, a sense of souls who have lived hard, fast and self-destructively. But these are tough gals, too. You just know that theyre going to survive the next car crash, the next failure, the next runaway lover.

That this should be the case with Mr. Mitchell is hardly a surprise. After all, he originated Hedwig, the East Berlin boy who became (almost) a woman and (almost) a rock idol, in the Off Broadway show he created with the songwriter Stephen Trask. And he committed the part to eternity in the 2001 movie version he directed.

For the Broadway Hedwig, which opened last spring under Michael Mayers direction, the show was scaled up and glammed up, to become an appropriate frame for its big-name star, Neil Patrick Harris, who deservedly won a Tony. Mr. Harris brought a master crowd-pleasers smoothness, flamboyance and comic timing to the role, as well as an energy that left the audience feeling highly caffeinated.

Mr. Mitchells Hedwig appears more bruised and battered by life, and on the verge of all-out exhaustion. This is partly because, at 51, this actor is 16 years older than the first time he played Hedwig. And, oh yes, last month he injured his knee, which forced him to leave the show for some performances. (Michael C. Hall, one of Mr. Harriss replacements, took over.)

Now hes back, with a leg brace and a crutch (which glitters like Hedwigs eye shadow) and a crate on which to prop his leg. The inventive uses to which Mr. Mitchell and his Tony-winning co-star, the fabulous Lena Hall (who plays Hedwigs put-upon boyfriend, Yitzhak), put said crate make this production worth revisiting all by themselves.

But theres a deeper sense of mortal shadows and ruefulness about this hobbling Hedwig, now transplanted to America. Shes still a sublime zinger of one-liners. But as Mr. Mitchell plays her, she seems to care a little less about what we think of her than when Mr. Harris had the role. Take me or leave me, she seems to say, with a Dietrich-worthy languor, her voice dropping into a gutter of bitterness.

She can be roused, too, to rage and to competitive rock-star fire power. And when Mr. Mitchell  whose appearance and song stylings often bring to mind a dilapidated David Bowie  turns on the anger, Hedwig stirs and scathes everyone around her. Theres no way this ones staying down for the count.

Nor is Ms. Millers Sally Bowles, who is on view only through March 29, when this revival of the Roundabout Theater Companys 1998 revival of Cabaret closes. I hate to keep telling people to go back to the cabaret, old chum, but Ms. Miller is a revelation here, the most realistic Sally since Natasha Richardson won a Tony for the part 17 years ago.

Yes, Emma Stone, Ms. Millers immediate predecessor in the role, was sensational, an immolating fireball of neurosis and vanity. But Ms. Miller brings something more subtle and pathetic to Sally. She looks gorgeous, but in the tense, artificial way of someone trying too hard to be attractive.

Shes more sexually predatory than most Sallys Ive seen, and more easily deflated when the erotic charm doesnt work. And in Ms. Millers body language, you can read an entire history of abuse, self-inflicted and otherwise. Watch how she reflexively cowers whenever a man raises a hand. Shes been hit before; she expects it.

Theres anger in her as well, which Ms. Miller channels most effectively in the man-stomping Mein Herr. And though you dont doubt that she loves her American boyfriend (Bill Heck) as much as she is able to, she knows that men are not to be relied on.

This Sally is a pragmatist, with a calloused core. When she sings the climactic title song, shortly after having an abortion, she makes it clear that while she may be shaken, shes going to soldier on.

Ive seen Ms. Miller onstage before twice, as Celia in As You Like It (in London) and in the Roundabouts production After Miss Julie, Patrick Marbers riff on Strindberg, and both times she seemed rather ill at ease. Any anxiety she displays here is strictly Sallys. Whod have thought shed find her comfort zone in Weimar Berlin on the eve of destruction?

Ms. Miller and Mr. Mitchell might want to swap war stories at some point. After catching Ms. Miller at last Saturdays matinee of Cabaret (which still stars the unquenchable Alan Cumming as the happily creepy M.C.), I learned that she injured herself that very night during the performance, sustaining a black eye and a wound that required stitches. Such are the dangers of life in the theater.",[]

Throughout the country, the arts are pumping new life into the bodies and minds of the elderly.

Two summers ago, a remarkable documentary called Alive Inside showed how much music can do for the most vulnerable older Americans, especially those whose memories and personalities are dimmed by dementia.

The film opens with a 90-year-old African-American woman living in a nursing home being asked about her life growing up in the South. All she could say in response to specific questions was, Im sorry, I dont remember.

But once she was fitted with an iPod that played the music she had enjoyed in her youth, her smile grew wide and her eyes sparkled as vivid memories flooded her consciousness. She was now able to describe in detail the music and dances she had relished with her young friends.

At another nursing home, a man named George with advanced dementia refused to speak or even raise his head when asked his name. He too was outfitted with an iPod, and suddenly George came back to life, talking freely, wiggling to the music in his wheelchair and singing along with the songs he once loved.

The Music and Memory project that provided the iPods was the inspiration of a volunteer music lover named Dan Cohen, and has since spread to many nursing homes and facilities for the aged around the country. Alas, not nearly enough of them. Medicaid, which fully covers the cost of potent drugs that can turn old people into virtual zombies, has no policy that would pay for far less expensive music players. So the vast majority of nursing home residents who might benefit are deprived of this joyous experience.

Nonetheless, across the country, the arts in their myriad forms are enhancing the lives and health of older people  and not just those with dementia helping to keep many men and women out of nursing homes and living independently. With grants from organizations like the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Institute on Aging, incredibly dedicated individuals with backgrounds in the arts have established programs that utilize activities as diverse as music, dance, painting, quilting, singing, poetry writing and storytelling to add meaning, joy and a vibrant sense of well-being to the lives of older people.

Through a program called EngAGE in Southern California, 90-year-old Walter Hurlburt, who once made a living as a sign painter, now decorates rooms at the Burbank Senior Artists Colony, a retirement facility where he lives, with lovely oil paintings he creates from pictures he finds in magazines and books. Mr. Hurlburt regularly attends classes on various art forms at the residence where, he told me, Im always learning something new.

His buddy at the residence, Sally Connors, an 82-year-old former schoolteacher, surprised herself by writing and directing a screenplay that was performed by fellow residents. Then, with Dolly Brittan, 79, a former early childhood educator, they both surprised themselves by writing their life stories in rap and performing their rap memoirs on a stage for at-risk teenagers they were mentoring.

Both she and Ms. Connors said their newfound involvement with the arts has made them feel decades younger.

Tim Carpenter, the executive director of EngAGE, is now working to expand this approach to senior living in other cities, including Minneapolis, Portland, Ore., and Raleigh, N.C. His goal is to create a nationwide network of programs for seniors that keep them healthy, happy and active through lifelong learning in every conceivable art form, enabling them to live independently as long as possible.

As in Burbank, Mr. Carpenter is promoting the development of arts colonies in senior residences where residents can study and create art in all its forms and where they can see their artistic creations come to life on a stage.

Dr. Gene D. Cohen, a gerontologist at George Washington University who died in 2009, was a staunch advocate for the mental and physical benefits of creativity for the elderly. He directed the Creativity and Aging Study, a controlled study sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts at three sites, including Elders Share the Arts in Brooklyn, N.Y., that showed after only a year that the health of elders in the cultural groups stabilized or improved in contrast to a decline among those in the control groups.

In a film called Do Not Go Gently, Dr. Cohen, who founded the Creativity Discovery Corps, featured an architect who, at age 96, submitted a plan for redeveloping the World Trade Center site. Dr. Cohen pointed out that creativity challenges the mind and results in the formation of new dendrites, the brains communication channels.

At 26 different facilities in the Washington, D.C., area, 15 teaching artists work with seniors in centers where they live or visit regularly. Janine Tursini, director of Arts for the Aging in Rockville, Md., seeks to get at what best jazzes up older adults. Groups of about 20 older adults get involved in what she calls art making  music, dance, painting or storytelling.

Ms. Tursini said the N.E.A.-sponsored study showed that when older people become involved in culturally enriching programs, they experience a decline in depression, are less likely to fall and pay fewer visits to the doctor. In another study among people with Alzheimers disease, a sculpting program improved the participants mood and decreased their agitation even after the program ended.

The arts open people up, giving them new vehicles for self-expression, a chance to tell their stories, Ms. Tursini said. The programs capitalize on assets that remain, not on whats been lost.

Naomi Goldberg Haas created the Dances for a Variable Population program to get older adults dancing. People who havent moved in years, even those who can no longer stand, can participate. Young professionals and older dancers go to various sites  libraries, churches, senior centers  where elders gather and encourage them to move more.

Social engagement, which nearly all these programs provide, has been repeatedly found in major population studies to prolong life and enhance healthy aging. Clinically, the programs have been linked to lowered blood pressure, reduced levels of stress hormones, and increased levels of the happiness hormones that are responsible for a runners high.

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,An Espresso Maker That Hums Along With Cecile McLorin Salvant,['Ligaya Mishan'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

To some, the Moka pot is a fetish and design icon as likely to be found at a museum (one is in the Museum of Modern Arts permanent collection) as in a young jazz singers galley kitchen in Harlem.

Invented in Italy during the Great Depression, the stovetop coffee maker liberated espresso from the caffe bar and made it something that Italians could brew easily and affordably at home. When Renato Bialetti, who sold millions of the little machines (his father, Alfonso, was the first to manufacture them), died last month, his ashes were interred in a giant Moka pot.

To Cecile McLorin Salvant, who won this years Grammy Award for jazz vocal album (For One to Love), the coffee maker is at once more mundane and magical: a quick means to what she calls a wonderful drug, and a reminder of her childhood home in Miami, where she grew up with the scent of coffee always at the ready, bubbling in any one of her parents three battered and beloved Moka pots.

Note that her pot is not the Art Deco original from Bialetti, with gleaming octagonal slopes of aluminum. (When Bialetti introduced the Moka Express, the fascist leader Benito Mussolini had imposed an embargo on stainless steel in favor of Italian bauxite ore.) Hers comes from Ikea and is stainless steel, which some coffee obsessives prefer, to prevent a metallic aftertaste.

But Ms. Salvant, 26, isnt so fussy. The pot was a gift from her mother, and it does the job. Water in the bottom chamber is heated slowly until steam pressure forces it through loose grounds in the basket above; coffee collects at the top.

It kind of settles me, Ms. Salvant said. She pours the coffee into a thermos and nurses it while she works at the piano.

She didnt start singing jazz until she was 18, while studying political science in Aix-en-Provence, France, after years of classical voice lessons. (She still fondly recalls Bachs Coffee Cantata, in which a worried father threatens to block his daughters marriage unless she stops drinking coffee.)

Photo

Three years later, she won the prestigious Thelonious Monk competition, which honors up-and-coming jazz artists. Nate Chinen, writing in The Times, has called her the finest jazz singer to emerge in the last decade.

In France, she started cooking, too, drawing on recipes from her mother, who is of French-Guadeloupean descent and spent her youth in Tunisia, Senegal, Bolivia and Cuba. Mafe, yassa, ragout de porc, Guadeloupe poisson, chicken with 40 cloves of garlic, boeuf bourgignon, Ms. Salvant recited, almost in incantation.

She owes her birth in part to her mothers cooking skills. Her father, a doctor from Haiti, tasted a batch of nem (Senegalese spring rolls) that her mother had made for a friend. I want to meet her, he said.

In season, her parents ship her mangoes from their backyard in Miami, and she hasnt had the heart to buy the fruit in New York. Instead, shes been eking out a jar of mango compote that her mother made last summer, scooping spoonfuls between sips of coffee.

Recently, her mother started experimenting with mango tarte Tatin. She posts it online, with pictures, Ms. Salvant said, half-offended, half-yearning. Thats just rude.",[]

Strategically skipping bread, pasta and other carbohydrates at dinner might improve subsequent athletic performance, provided those low-carb meals are combined with the right types of workouts, according to a new sports nutrition study. Its findings undercut some entrenched ideas about how athletes should eat in preparation for spring marathons and other endurance races.

As those of us who are athletes or spend time around them know, diets are a topic of consuming interest for the group, since an athletes diet affects how well he or she can train, recover, progress, chisel a physique and compete.

But the ideal sports diet remains elusive. Many dietitians and coaches advocate for heaps of carbohydrates at the training table. Carbohydrates, which break down during digestion into sugar, are the bodys first choice as fuel during exercise. But the bodys reservoir of stored carbohydrates is small, and even if athletes supplement their supply during exercise with sugary drinks or food, prolonged or intense exertion generally incinerates much of the bodys available carbohydrates.

Consequently, some experts suggest that athletic success may depend in part on making the body better able to use fat as a fuel. Even the leanest athletes body is girded with the stuff, theoretically providing enough energy for even the longest, hardest workouts. Low-carbohydrate diets will force the body to turn to fat. But working muscles must become used to burning fat, a process that can make exercising on a low-carb diet difficult in the short term. Indeed, athletes on extremely low-carbohydrate diets tend to struggle to finish hard workouts.

So researchers at the French National Institute of Sport, Expertise and Performance in Paris and other institutions began to wonder about the possibilities of modified forms of low-carb diets, and specifically about what they and other scientists call sleeping low.

With a sleep-low sports diet, an athlete skips carbohydrates at dinner. In the morning, his or her body should have low reserves of the macronutrient, and any ensuing workouts would force the body to turn to fat, its most abundant fuel. In past studies of the technique, however, it has produced mixed results in terms of whether it improves competitive performance.

The authors of the new study, which was published in January in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, suspected that the sleep-low diet needed to be integrated into a broader training plan in order to show desirable results.

To test that possibility, they recruited 21 experienced, competitive triathletes who bravely agreed to have their diets manipulated. The scientists ran their volunteers through a simulated triathlon and other tests of their current fitness and pace.

Half of the athletes were then randomly assigned to eat a standard sports diet, with large helpings of carbohydrates at every meal and after workouts.

The others were put on a sleep-low regimen. With this program, the athletes consumed the same amount of carbohydrates over the course of the day as the other group, but in a different sequence. Virtually all of their carbohydrates were consumed at breakfast and lunch, with none at dinner.

At the same time, all of the athletes also began a new training program. In the afternoon, both groups completed a draining, intense interval-training session, designed to increase fitness and deplete the bodys carbohydrate stores. The members of the control group then replenished their carbohydrates at dinner; the sleep-low group did not.

Next morning, before breakfast, the volunteers pedaled for an hour at a moderate pace on stationary bicycles. By this time, the sleep-low group was running on carbohydrate fumes and body fat.

Afterward, all of the athletes sat down to large, carb-rich breakfasts and lunches, meaning that both groups were flush with carbohydrates for the afternoon interval training.

This program continued for four days per week for three weeks. (On the remaining days, the athletes ran, cycled or swam at an easy pace and ate as they chose.)

After three weeks, the athletes in the sleep-low group were grumbling about evening hunger.

But when the researchers now repeated the simulated triathlon, those athletes in the sleep-low group showed notable improvement. Their times on the 10-kilometer running leg at the end of the race were faster by about 75 seconds, or 3 percent, than at the start of the study. The control group had not improved.

The sleep-low volunteers also had lost body fat, while the other athletes had not.

These findings suggest, said Laurie-Anne Marquet, a graduate student at the French National Institute of Sport who led the study, that exercising strenuously in the afternoon, depriving yourself of carbohydrates afterward, training gently the next morning and then swallowing a mound of pancakes might be a useful way to improve endurance and performance. The regimen seemed to have increased the athletes ability to access fat as muscle fuel, she said, allowing them to exercise harder during the workouts than the control group and gain additional fitness and speed.

Such a rigorous routine is not for everyone, of course. Those of us not training for a marathon, triathlon or similar event probably would not enjoy or benefit from sleeping low. Even serious athletes should thread the approach into their training cautiously, Ms. Marquet said, beginning a few weeks before a race and easing off in the days just before the event, when they should down carbohydrates at will.

Encouragingly for those tempted by the diet, though, most of the athletes in the study, Ms. Marquet said, have now integrated this strategy into their training.

The Public Art Fund, which in recent years has looked far outside its New York City base for artists and projects, announced Tuesday that it had enlisted Adrian Cheng, a prominent Chinese collector and the scion of a multibillion-dollar retailing empire, to join its board.

Mr. Cheng, 36, has become more visible in the international art world in recent years through the development of an unusual business-meets-nonprofit model in China for promoting shopping and fine art at the same time. Mr. Chengs K11 Art Foundation, a nonprofit, works with his familys business to organize museumlike exhibitions (a sizable Monet show last year in Shanghai) and displays of contemporary art in the familys high-end malls. Such arrangements, which are becoming more popular among retailers in Asia, were once common in the West, though their history is now little remembered. (Michael Kimmelman, writing in The New York Times about that history in 1995, noted that the first Cubist art show in America took place at Gimbels in Pittsburgh in 1913, at a time when department stores sought to elevate the taste of their patrons and you were more likely to find high culture at A.T. Stewarts giant store on Broadway and 10th Street, along Ladies Mile than at New Yorks fledgling museums.)

In a telephone interview from Seoul, where he was traveling, Mr. Cheng said he was interested in joining the Public Art Funds board  his first presence as a trustee for an art institution in New York  because he sees his foundations mission as fostering greater awareness of contemporary art in China, where public art institutions have often lagged. Its all about art for the masses, said Mr. Cheng, who was educated at Harvard and owns an apartment in Manhattan. So the Public Art Fund actually matches our mission.

Nicholas Baume, the Public Art Funds director and chief curator, said that as the fund became more globally engaged it was interested in a patron with a really key position in Asia.

A lot of the artists weve worked with he shares a passion for, Mr. Baume said of Mr. Cheng. I think the dialogue with Adrian could enrich both of our institutions.",[]

Recently, university researchers asked children and parents to describe the rules they thought families should follow related to technology.

In most cases, parents and children agreed  dont text and drive; dont be online when someone wants to talk to you. But there was one surprising rule that the children wanted that their parents mentioned far less often: Dont post anything about me on social media without asking me.

As in, no pictures of them asleep in the back of the car. No posts about their frustration with their homework. That victory picture after the soccer game? Maybe. The frustrated rant about the fight you just had over laundry? No way.

The answers revealed a really interesting disconnect, said Alexis Hiniker, a graduate student in human-centered design and engineering at the University of Washington who led the research. She, along with researchers at the University of Michigan, studied 249 parent-child pairs distributed across 40 states and found that while children ages 10 to 17 were really concerned about the ways parents shared their childrens lives online, their parents were far less worried. About three times more children than parents thought there should be rules about what parents shared on social media.

Sites like Facebook and Instagram are now baked into the world of todays families. Many, if not most, new parents post images of their newborn online within an hour of birth, and some parents create social media accounts for the children themselves  often to share photos and news with family, although occasionally in the pursuit of Instafame for their fashionably clad, beautifully photographed sons and daughters.

With the first babies of Facebook (which started in 2004) not yet in their teens and the stylish kids of Instagram (which started in 2010) barely in elementary school, families are just beginning to explore the question of how children feel about the digital record of their earliest years. But as this study, although small, suggests, its increasingly clear that our children will grow into teenagers and adults who want to control their digital identities.

As these children come of age, theyre going to be seeing the digital footprint left in their childhoods wake, said Stacey Steinberg, a legal skills professor and associate director of the Center on Children and Families at the University of Florida Levin College of Law. While most of them will be fine, some might take issue with it.

Some children and teenagers question both past and present sharing. I really dont like it when my parents post pictures of me on their social media accounts, especially after finding out that some of my friends follow them, said Maisy Hoffman, 14, an eighth grader who lives in Manhattan. I worry more about my dad. He doesnt always ask if he can post things, so I immediately turn away and ask if hes going to post it. Or Ill find out later because my friend saw something of me on his Instagram and Ill have to ask him to take it down.

Other parents can also present a problem for the child who prefers to control how she appears online. Wendy Bradford, a mother of three elementary-school aged children in Manhattan, said that when parent chaperones took pictures during a third-grade field trip to the zoo, her daughter hid when she saw the phones because she didnt want the pictures to be posted on Facebook with her in them.

Isabella Aijo, 15, a high school sophomore in Natick, Mass., said, I definitely know people who have parents who post things they wish werent out there. There was a girl in my eighth grade class whose mom opened a YouTube account for her in the fourth grade to show off her singing, she wrote to me in an email. Finally, on one of the last months of middle school, a peer played the song in class and almost the entire class laughed hysterically over it.

Those early posts from parents linger, not just online, but in our childrens memories  and the topics may be things we dont see as potentially embarrassing. The son of a friend (who asked that I not use her name) still brings up things she wrote about his picky eating when he was younger  years ago, she says.

But that kind of sharing  about food issues, potty training and tantrums  is exactly the kind of sharing that can be valuable. Children benefit from the community created when parents have the ability to share their stories, said Ms. Steinberg. Those posts about picky eating might have helped my friend find solutions, or a fresh wellspring of patience for a behavior her child would eventually outgrow.

When parents share those early frustrations, they dont see themselves as exposing something personal about their childrens lives, but about their own. As a society, says Ms. Steinberg, were going to have to find ways to balance a parents right to share their story and a parents right to control the upbringing of their child with a childs right to privacy.

Parents often intrude on a childs digital identity, not because they are malicious, but because they havent considered the potential reach and the longevity of the digital information that theyre sharing, said Ms. Steinberg.

In general, said Sarita Schoenebeck, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, who co-authored the research, both children and parents considered positive images, events and news more appropriate to share than negative ones. Parents can consider, too, the searchability and reach of the format (although those are always evolving). A frustrated tweet about a child who wont eat her cereal because its not in a red bowl is a lot less likely to resurface than a YouTube video of the resulting tantrum. Looking for advice or sympathy about a behavioral problem? Skip both the image, and your childs name, in a post to limit later searches.

At our house, I sometimes see the hesitation in my oldest son, who is 14, when I bring out the camera at a goofy moment, but we have a whole house rule: no sharing images of anyone else without their consent, ever. That trust means I get my candid shots, and he keeps his digital identity, whatever he eventually wants it to be, intact.

PARIS  A long, strange season it has been. One filled with ambiguity, rumor and infighting (Show now, sell now! Over my dead body!), that aside from some discernible trends  an elongated silhouette; leopard; the continuing popularity of lingerie dresses; the haute puffa jacket  has left most questions as yet unresolved.









Who will run Dior? Dont know. What about Lanvin? The latest name whispered in the wings is Bouchra Jarrar. Is Hedi Slimane staying at Saint Laurent? Your guess is as good as mine. Do shows matter, or is it all about Instagram now?

Ah, for that we have a response. Social media makes people think everything is accessible said Maria Grazia Chiuri, a creative director of Valentino, backstage before the show. She was standing next to Pierpaolo Piccioli, her co-creative director, both wearing black trouser suits and white shirts (Mr. Piccioli also had on a black tie; Ms. Chiuri, a handful of rings) and talking about performance art. Which for them is a synonym for a show.

But what social media cannot provide is a sense of the emotion of a group experience, she continued. We think our job is not just to do things you can consume, because you can see and love beauty without buying it. It is to give that shared happening. So they did.

Against piano music by John Cage and Philip Glass played live on a baby grand set amid the runway came an ode to dancers past: Merce Cunningham and Martha Graham, Pina Bausch and Diaghilev. Some of it was wearable (pristine white shirts wrapped like a warm-up sweater, with a dark ribbon at the waist and ribs; pleated schoolgirl skirts and exacting navy coats), and some of it less so (a nude suede dress with draped spaghetti-strap bodice, the skirt sliced into studded ribbons to play with, and expose, the legs; a crinoline tutu). Though that was not the point. The effect  material doing fouettes and chasses around the body  was.

The theme gave the designers leave to express their penchant for couture-level ornamentation via floating layers of tulle embroidered with clouds, or folkloric runes, or feathered wings. Its beautiful, no question, but its also beginning to seem almost rote. (Oh, look: another amazing bit of beading; uh-huh; whats next?) The best pieces had the strict perfection of silk jersey, shirred at the shoulders and prepped for an arabesque. Subconsciously, they made you point your toes.

But for that, you had, as they say, to be there. In the end, Paris was replete with these grace notes; felicitous, if occasionally head-spinning, reminders of why this circus exists.

They started with the surreal  Giambattista Vallis spun-sugar ode to the Swiss Alps in a fluffy fur, flowers and lederhosen fantasy at Moncler Gamme Rouge, complete with pretend snow and real cow bells. They moved to social commentary: Miuccia Pradas high/low melange of the bourgeois and the bohemian at Miu Miu with denim jackets done up like evening wear, cotton boxers, tapestry maxi skirts, tweed jodhpurs, little velvet dresses and bombshell brocades (and shorts). And they ultimately reached the sublime: Iris van Herpens 18 stations of the future.

Eighteen women faced 18 olfactory light screens, rectangular panels that refracted the light and reflected and distorted the woman (and dress) behind, doubling her image and transforming the audience into both voyeur and backstage visitor, and allowing the woman to dance, as it were, with herself. Thats not to mention the dress she might be wearing: a familiar neat little sheath, rendered extraordinary by technology and imagination.

One lacy spider web was laser-cut from wool; another knitted in micro-pleats from steel and wool to create a dense, swirling exoskeleton; another composed of glistening 3-D printed, transparent laser-cut hexagons (5,000 of them) as airy and alluring as soap bubbles. Yet another was made from intensely light tulle fused with iridescent strips so the fabric looked like liquid mercury. Why Ms. van Herpens name is not often mentioned in contention for one of the myriad creative director jobs available is one of fashions great mysteries.

If her clothes were singular, however, it was at Louis Vuitton that things got, literally, monumental. The artistic director Nicolas Ghesquiere constructed three enormous geometric shapes  a sphere, a square, a pyramid  and filled them with the ruins of a glittering Atlantis. The better to excavate not just his own aesthetic history (and that of his house), but that of the collections thus far.

Columns covered in shattered mirrors reflected a story of motor sports and the military told in patent leather and wool. The rise of the machines was woven into graphic knit bodysuits and dresses, and ivory silk slip dresses came paired with leather breastplates or etched with sequined scratches, like lace or mud (it was hard to tell), a train suspended from the narrowest strap on one side. Road warriors were spliced with romance and a bit of the weird  a combination that also pretty much describes the underlying genome of the womens wear month.

Julie Kent, a beloved ballerina who danced her final performance with American Ballet Theater last June after spending nearly three decades with the company, will be the next artistic director of the Washington Ballet, the company announced on Monday.

When Ms. Kent, 46, succeeds Septime Webre as artistic director in July, it will be something of a homecoming for her: She grew up in Maryland and began her dance training in the region at the Academy of the Maryland Youth Ballet in Bethesda.

She said in a statement that she looked forward to the opportunity to share my experience to train and nurture dancers so that they can develop to their full potential.

When she takes over in Washington, Ms. Kent, who has danced in more than 100 ballets, and found a wider audience when she appeared in the 1987 film Dancers opposite Mikhail Baryshnikov, will be one of the few women running a major ballet company.

Sylvia de Leon, the chairwoman of the board in Washington, said in a statement that while Julie is an iconic American ballerina, it is her deep understanding of ballet, the individual dancer, the audience and the role of ballet in humanity that makes her an outstanding choice.

Her husband, Victor Barbee, who has been the associate artistic director of American Ballet Theater for 13 years and was a principal dancer there before that, will join the Washington Ballet as associate artistic director.

Last year, after she retired as a dancer, Ms. Kent was named the artistic director of Ballet Theaters summer intensive program. It was not immediately clear who would assume that role.

Kevin McKenzie, the artistic director of Ballet Theater, wished Ms. Kent and Mr. Barbee well. Together, they epitomize ballet artistry at its highest level, he said in a statement.",[]

FOR more than two hours, Nancy Reagan sat behind the artist Everett Raymond Kinstler as he painted her husbands portrait in his New York City studio shortly after the Reagans left the White House. Mr. Kinstler, who had done several portraits of President Gerald Ford, was unnerved by Mrs. Reagans intensity. It was terribly distracting, he recalled. When he asked if she would wait in the living room, Mrs. Reagan replied, unmoved, No, I really would like to stay here while you work.









That was classic Nancy Reagan. Since her death on Sunday, she has been remembered as a powerful and stylish first lady. But she was much more than that. Many ambitious women have filled the role of presidential spouse. Mrs. Reagan understood better than any of them how to use the position to control her husbands image and legacy.

The title of first lady comes with a thorny combination of intense scrutiny, an incredible platform and no official mandate. We have traditionally seen the first lady as the embodiment of American womanhood, but that view is on its way out; largely thanks to Hillary Clinton, were now more likely to see the first union as a political alliance between equals.

Many first ladies have been unhappy in the role. Martha Washington called herself a state prisoner. Jacqueline Kennedy proclaimed: The one thing I do not want to be called is first lady. It sounds like a saddle horse. And Michelle Obama says that living in the White House is like living in a really nice prison. Mrs. Reagan, however, was unabashedly proud of her hard-won position and even put first lady as her occupation on her income tax forms.

She was crucial to her husbands electoral success: cultivating wealthy California friends who could aid his first campaign for governor in the 1960s and eventually get him to the White House. She was the human resources department, says a Reagan political consultant, Stuart Spencer, because she helped decide who was in her husbands cabinet.

Mrs. Reagan was content because she defined the role in a uniquely ambitious  and covert  way. There was no West Wing office like the one Mrs. Clinton had, nor sitting in on cabinet meetings like Rosalynn Carter. Mrs. Reagan insisted that it would have been embarrassing to attend such high-level meetings. But in many ways she wielded as much power as either of these women. I talk to people, they tell me things. And if something is about to become a problem Im not above calling a staff person and asking about it, Mrs. Reagan said in a 1987 speech. Im a woman who loves her husband and I make no apologies for looking out for his personal and political welfare.

President Reagan was a ready recipient of her steady guidance, and she performed the tasks, including firing underlings, which he found distasteful. Her love and loyalty were returned. On their anniversary in 1981 the president left her a note, telling her that he scrooches down at his desk in the Oval Office so he could see her window.

Susan Porter Rose, who was Barbara Bushs chief of staff when George H. W. Bush was vice president, remembers seeing the Reagans after an event and watching as the elevator door opened to carry the first lady to the second-floor residence. He was going to go back to the Oval, and he just put his hand on top of hers and looked at her and said, I so wish I didnt have to go back to the office. 

Mrs. Reagans image as an imperial first lady  she was referred to contemptuously in the press as Queen Nancy  was amplified by her more than $200,000 purchase of a new set of china (through private donations) and not helped by revelations that she spent $25,000 on her inaugural wardrobe and $10,000 on a single gown.

But this wasnt mere vanity. Mrs. Reagan understood the physical power of the executive mansion better than any first lady before her, with the exception of Mrs. Kennedy. Before the historic visit of Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, in 1987, Mrs. Reagan and her social secretary made a visit to the flower shop in the White House basement. The first lady gave simple instructions to blow Mrs. Gorbachevs socks off.

So we did, recalled a florist, Ronn Payne. We changed every single flower in the house three times in one day: for the morning arrival, for the afternoon lunch, and for the state dinner. Every single flower, three times, every one.

Mrs. Reagan was a self-proclaimed worrier, and her concerns became all-consuming after the attempt on her husbands life months into his presidency. She referred to the period after the assassination attempt as the lost year. She insisted that her husband go to the residence to take an afternoon nap. If she found him at his desk working, she would tell him: Horizontal. I want you horizontal.

As first lady she built walls around herself so that she could get the job done. But she was heartbroken when her favorite White House doorman died, and she was deeply saddened when the actress Katharine Hepburn ended their friendship because of their political differences.

Few people could intimidate Nancy Reagan, a woman who reveled in the power of her position, but during the portrait sitting with Mr. Kinstler, Mrs. Reagan noticed several paintings of Hepburn on the walls of his studio and reminisced about her old friend. When Mr. Kinstler picked up the phone and got Hepburn on the line, Mrs. Reagan suddenly became shy and pushed the receiver away. No, you talk to her first, she said.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Review: Mayhem! Gambling! Disco! In Disaster! Its All There for the Spoofing,['Charles Isherwood'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Alert the authorities! Theres a wayward nun on the loose in New York City, committing grand larceny eight times a week.









I joke, of course  though that story would be a fun diversion from the onslaught of election coverage, no? The crimes are fictional, and are taking place at the Nederlander Theater on Broadway, where Jennifer Simard, playing a singing sister with an unquenchable yen for slot machines, is pilfering every scene she adorns in the delirious goof of a musical, Disaster!

Perhaps petty larceny is a more appropriate charge, since this self-consciously silly spoof of the cheesy 1970s films that subjected assorted B-list stars to assorted calamities will never rank among the great musicals of our era  or even the great jukebox musicals of our era, a rather small demographic. But for anyone with a moist, albeit mortifying, affection for the oeuvre of that great auteur Irwin Allen (guilty), and the K-Tel era of pop music (guilty), Disaster! will provide a rush of giddy nostalgia thats just as pleasurable, at times, as the more substantial rewards of the musical theaters higher-reaching shows.

True, if you have to Google either Allen, the producer of The Poseidon Adventure, which provides the basic template for the musical, or K-Tel, which churned out albums of soppy pop hits in collections relentlessly flogged in television ads, you might want to give this baby a skip. Try Hamilton  and good luck with that!

Even so, Disaster!, written by Seth Rudetsky and Jack Plotnick, and directed by Mr. Plotnick, has such a sensational cast that musical lovers incognizant of the guilty pleasures of the movies being lampooned, and ignorant of the shows soundtrack  a staggering stack of 45s you loved to hate, or hated to love, or a little of both (Torn Between Two Lovers, Feelings, I Am Woman)  may still have plenty to savor.

My spouse, whose ignorance of both the movies and the music in question is absolute (he was born in Turkey, after the brief vogue of disaster movies had waned), had a fine time, enjoying the daffiness of the performances and the willfully crackpot plotting.

In addition to the heaven-sent Ms. Simard, the musical, which has had two prior Off Broadway runs, features tasty turns from familiar names: Faith Prince, sending up the warmhearted Jewish matron memorably portrayed by Shelley Winters in The Poseidon Adventure; Roger Bart, playing the sleazy owner of the floating disco-cum-casino in which the musical takes place; Rachel York, spangled in faux Bob Mackie and flinging around a fabulous Farrah wig, as the clubs headliner; and Kerry Butler as an intrepid reporter seeking to uncover the shoddy workmanship that causes havoc when an earthquake strikes the Hudson River, where the party boat floats.

Lets briefly run through the ditsy plot. Mr. Rudetsky, perhaps the biggest and most famous Broadway fanboy in town, himself plays professor Ted Scheider, soi-disant noted disaster expert. He has reason to believe a geological event of mighty proportions may be about to occur, because hes been extracting some unusually heated sediment from, er, somewhere. (The opening number, introducing most of the characters, is performed to the throbbing Hot Stuff, originally made famous by Donna Summer.)

Ted is most worried about this casino-disco, which is celebrating its grand opening and is stuffed to capacity, a further danger detected by Marianne (Ms. Butler), that nosy reporter who buttonholes the proprietor, Tony (Mr. Bart). His flirtatious evasions dont give her much help, requiring her to take him up on his invitation to join the party.

Once aboard, shes surprised to meet an ex-fiance whom she dumped, Chad, a cater-waiter played by Adam Pascal, whose leather lungs are ripe for his big power ballad, the ghastly Without You. Lets all sing along: I cant live/If living is without you/I cant live/I cant give anymore. (Try getting that out of your head now. Apologies.)

Also on board: Ms. Princes Shirley, resplendent in lurid Pucci swirls (the delicious costumes are by William Ivey Long), and her husband, Maury (Kevin Chamberlin, mostly wasted, alas); the washed-up disco queen Levora, played with seen-it-all weariness by Lacretta Nicole; and Ms. Yorks Jackie, who hopes to entice Tony into becoming stepfather to her twin tykes  a boy and girl played with ingenuity by Baylee Littrell, swapping genders within seconds.

Mr. Rudetsky and Mr. Plotnick (along with Drew Geraci, who co-conceived the show and wrote additional material) take their time getting to the titular calamity, or rather series of calamities: after the earthquake comes a tidal wave that capsizes the casino. The first act tends toward waywardness, and while it runs just an hour, it feels longer. When youre camping it up, its best not to spend too much time vamping. (The quick-change bit with the twins, for instance, becomes a running gag thats running a marathon.)

But the performances provide sufficient distraction. I will not soon forget the loopy sight of Ms. Princes Shirley tap-dancing her heart out (almost literally) to transmit messages in Morse code to passengers trapped a floor below her. The antic Mr. Bart practically springs an oil leak as the corrupt Tony, and Ms. Yorks lush junior-varsity version of Cher is amusingly vapid, all bugle beads for brains.

But the breakout star is unquestionably Ms. Simard, playing Sister Mary Downy, a guitar-strumming nun who comes to the boat to convert the partygoers from lives of dissipation (Gambling is a sin, youre going to hell, have a nice day, she tells one), but ends up performing an orgasmic pas de deux with a Hawaii Five-O-themed slot machine, to the tune of the disco classic Never Can Say Goodbye. (Connoisseurs will recognize Sister Mary as a nod to Helen Reddys singing nun in Airport 1975.)

Ms. Simard mines the sisters pious nerdiness for delicious comedy, but really comes into her own when Sister Mary succumbs to her gambling addiction and makes mad love to that machine. No more proof needed that sinning is far more entertaining, and much funnier, than saintliness.",[]

Sign up to receive an email We will inform you when the next Times report on this attempt at a uterus transplant is published.

The first uterus transplant in the United States failed, and the organ was surgically removed on Tuesday, officials at the Cleveland Clinic said on Wednesday.

The recipient, a 26-year-old woman, suddenly developed a serious complication on Tuesday, according to Eileen Sheil, a spokeswoman for the clinic. She did not specify the nature of the complication but said the uterus was being analyzed by pathologists to determine what went wrong.

The transplant was the first of 10 planned by the clinic, in an experimental program meant to enable women without a uterus to become pregnant and give birth. In a statement released Wednesday afternoon, the clinic said it would continue with that effort.

The study, which has been planned to include 10 women, is still ongoing with a commitment to the advancement of medical research to provide an additional option for women and their families, the clinic said.

The failure occurred only a day after the clinic held a news conference to describe what had seemed to be a successful transplant, with remarks from members of the surgical team and a brief appearance by the patient, who asked to be identified only as Lindsey. The transplant, which used a uterus from a woman in her 30s who had died suddenly, was performed on Feb. 24.

In its statement announcing the failure, the clinic said: While this has been difficult for both the patient and the medical team, Lindsey is doing well and recovering.

Lindsey, who was born without a uterus, and her husband, Blake, also released a statement. I just wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude towards all of my doctors. They acted very quickly to ensure my health and safety. Unfortunately I did lose the uterus to complications. However, I am doing okay and appreciate all of your prayers and good thoughts.

Doctors in Sweden have performed nine uterus transplants, resulting in five births.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Why Donald Trump Has Done Worse in Mostly White States,['Toni Monkovic'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Donald Trump has tended to fare worst in states that are mostly white.









That doesnt mean he hasnt had great success in appealing to white Republican primary voters  theres no doubt of that  only that he generally does better in states that have higher percentages of nonwhites, particularly African-Americans.

Mr. Trumps stances on, say, trade and Social Security, can strike a chord with voters. But studies have shown that his bigger appeal is as an authoritarian voice of the voiceless. Part of that has been rallying people  particularly those who havent gone to college  who feel a resentment toward racial, ethnic and religious others.

As Michael Tesler and John Sides wrote for the Monkey Cage at The Washington Post last week: Fifty years of research backs this up. Ethnocentric suspicions of minority groups in general, and attitudes about blacks in particular, influence whites opinions about many issues.

Some social science research suggests that the simple fact that President Obama is black might have contributed to a sense of lost power and resentment among whites, and, of course, Mr. Trump first came to political prominence by questioning whether Mr. Obama was even a citizen.

Photo

An appeal to white identity tends to work better in areas where that identity is felt to be under threat. The South, where Mr. Trump has performed well, has long been known for racially polarized politics.

Race essentially predicts political affiliation there, with blacks lining up for Democrats and whites for Republicans. A state like Mississippi, whose population is around 37 percent black, is an obvious example. If even 25 percent of white Mississippians voted for Democrats, the state could tilt blue  and perhaps elect the states first black governor, or first black senator since Reconstruction.

Democratic strategists dream of a blue North Carolina and Florida, and further in the future, a blue Georgia or Arizona.

But few dream of a blue Mississippi. The numbers have long been locked in. For example, according to the 2012 Mississippi exit polls, 96 percent of blacks voted for President Obama, but 89 percent of whites voted for Mitt Romney, who won by 55 percent to 44 percent.

Political scientists have written about the importance of tipping points in ethnic strife or resentment around the globe. It occurs when one group grows big enough to potentially alter the power hierarchy. Mark Potok, senior fellow for the Southern Poverty Law Center, has said that demographic change in this country is the single most important driver in the growth of hate groups and extremist groups. He wrote last month, Donald Trumps demonizing statements about Latinos and Muslims have electrified the radical right, leading to glowing endorsements from white nationalist leaders such as Jared Taylor and former Klansman David Duke.

Mr. Trumps anti-immigration language lands with force for people who fear the browning of America. Within three or four decades, several reports have indicated, non-Hispanic whites will no longer make up a majority of the United States population. The social psychology researchers Maureen Craig and Jennifer Richeson, working at Northwestern, studied whether people could become more politically conservative if they felt a threat to their status in the racial pecking order.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In their paper, they wrote that their experiments provide striking evidence that perceived group-status threat, triggered by exposure to the majority-minority shift, increases whites endorsement of conservative political ideology and policy positions.

What could change this feeling of anxiety and resentment? In both experiments, they wrote, the addition of a simple paragraph stating that whites are likely to remain at the top of the future racial hierarchy in a majority-minority America eliminated the conservative shift.

Studies have pointed to other correlations:

 Robert Putnam, the Harvard political scientist and author, discovered a decade ago that increased diversity in communities is correlated with distrust between and within ethnic groups. (It was perhaps not what he had hoped to find.)

 Greater racial diversity predicts less of a willingness to build a stronger social safety net: In other words, America would probably have more social spending if it were a whiter nation.

 One of the bigger predictors of support for Mr. Trump is the belief that affirmative action is taking away jobs from whites and handing them to blacks.

 Research by the Vanderbilt political scientists Marc Hetherington and Drew Engelhardt has helped shed light on one of the bigger puzzles of this primary cycle: the success of Mr. Trump among evangelicals. Among white Southern Republicans, evangelicals exhibit higher levels of racial resentment than do Southern Republicans who are not evangelicals, they wrote for The Cook Political Report.

If you set aside Mr. Trumps defeat in Texas because it is Ted Cruzs home state, Mr. Trumps other losses in states have come in mostly white Iowa, Maine, Kansas, Alaska, Minnesota and Oklahoma. Oklahoma, which is also in Mr. Cruzs home region, has the highest percentage of African-Americans among those states, around 8 percent, according to the 2010 census. Blacks make up about 13 percent of the United States population over all. Support for Mr. Trump was also probably limited in some of these states because they held caucuses, which tend to favor Mr. Cruz.

My colleague Nate Cohn has also identified North Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota, Idaho and Hawaii as other unpromising states for Mr. Trump. He narrowly won in Vermont, but the total vote (50 percent) of the establishment candidates Marco Rubio and John Kasich was unusually strong. Also, Colorado would have set up as a perfect state for Mr. Rubio had a contest been held there. Of these states, Nebraska has the highest black population by percentage, at 4.5 percent.

An interesting variation is found in Appalachian states like West Virginia and Kentucky, which tend to have small black populations but are still fertile ground for Mr. Trump. Racial polarization in voting there is relatively high, and its also a region where racially charged web searches are more common. In a Gallup poll this week in which residents of every state were asked if their city or area was a good place to live for racial and ethnic minorities, West Virginia finished last.

A map of voting patterns based on racial polarization suggests that Mr. Trump will not be able to mine as much resentment in the West. The industrial Midwest and Northeast, where memories of strife and white flight in urban areas are not that distant, may offer more opportunities. Immigration concerns were a potent weapon in New Hampshire. Mr. Trumps giant victory in Massachusetts is still something of a mystery, but as one reader said, Dont forget the antibusing protests.

Marc Ambinder, writing for The Daily News, argued that part of the response to all this should be empathy  for working-class whites who have been left behind economically and whose resentment has been exploited politically. Consider the most chilling correlation: that Mr. Trump is faring very well where middle-aged whites are dying fastest.",[]
nytimes.com,2013-05-17 00:00:00,"Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812 at Kazino",['Charles Isherwood'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The clash of armies is not to be heard during Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812, the vibrant, transporting new musical adapted from a potent slice of Tolstoys War and Peace. True, Napoleon is nominally present, presiding with a stern semi-smile over the proceedings from within a copy of a Jacques-Louis David portrait. But the roiling sounds of battle do not intrude on the romantic drama unfolding before us in Dave Malloys freshly imagined pop opera, which opened on Thursday night at a custom-built cabaret called Kazino, in the meatpacking district.









The clash of cutlery, on the other hand, occasionally echoes as Tolstoys tale of love, corruption and fateful meetings swirls like a feverish dream before us, above us, around us. Following its acclaimed, sellout run last fall at Ars Nova, the production has been given a stylish and sumptuous upgrade, and now comes with a full meal attached.

The show is performed in an elaborately appointed salon, with claret-colored velvet draperies and period paintings adorning the walls. Spiky candelabras modeled on the starbursts at the Metropolitan Opera twinkle from above. (Mimi Liens set designs form a crucial part of the mise-en-scene.) The audience sits at tables and banquettes clustered tightly together. Dinner service begins an hour before the performance. (The Broadway-size price tag is $125, but on Broadway you dont get borscht.) For those who truly want to enter into the spirit of the drama, carafes of vodka can be purchased.

Photo

Yes, bottle service has come to Off Broadway. (Where more appropriately than in the meatpacking district?) I suspect it was inevitable: audiences are flocking to productions that dispense entirely with the theaters traditional fourth wall and provide nightclub-style amenities. Punchdrunks Sleep No More, which allows patrons to dawdle for a drink before, during and after the show, remains a hot ticket. (One of its producers is among the presenters of Natasha.) The interactive musical Here Lies Love, at the Public Theater, invites the audience to boogie on down with Imelda Marcos and friends.

But those with anxiety issues surrounding audience participation need not fear for their nerve endings at Mr. Malloys romp, directed with propulsive sweep by Rachel Chavkin. Although the characters may occasionally plop down at a table, and much of the drama unfolds in a narrow alley between the tables, no enforced folk dancing will be required, and no one will offer an arm to pull you into a polonaise.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The close quarters do, however, bring the show an extra charge of excitement, as we are brought into whispering intimacy with the characters as they pursue their fates, happy and otherwise, in the grand houses of 19th-century Moscow. At the center of the story is the blooming young Natasha (a luminous Phillipa Soo), betrothed to the absent Prince Andrey (Blake DeLong), who is away at war, having agreed to heed the wishes of his crotchety father (Mr. DeLong again, in a ludicrously powdered wig) to postpone the wedding for a year.

Bad idea, buddy! At the opera one night Natasha falls under the bewitching, sinister spell of the heedless womanizer Anatole (Lucas Steele, a spiky blade of blond hair lending a slight menace to his boyishly handsome features), brother of the equally amoral Helene (the voluptuous Amber Gray). Frantically working to thwart their cruel machinations are Helenes miserable mensch of a husband, Pierre, played by Mr. Malloy himself; and Natashas loving cousin Sonya (Brittain Ashford).

The relationships may seem complex when thus briskly sketched, but really theres no need to crack open Tolstoys magnum opus before you attend the show. (For those interested, the action involved takes up the last hundred pages or so of the novels second book.) A synopsis is provided, but even if you spill that borscht on the program, Mr. Malloy introduces all the characters and establishes their relationships with humor and economy in the opening number. His lyrical voice is blunt, funny and forthrightly contemporary, as this opening chorale quickly establishes in introducing the principal players:

Helene is a slut

Anatole is hot

Mary is old school

Sonya is good

Natasha is young

And Andrey isnt here.

While the band of eight includes mostly instruments that might be found in a classical ensemble (cello and viola, clarinet and oboe and piano), the music matches the boho-hip flavor of the sometimes slangy lyrics. Its a blend of contemporary styles only slightly inflected by Russian flavors. The numbers range from yearning ballads in the Broadway-beloved manner of the British invasion to folk-flavored songs redolent of early 1970s Joni Mitchell or Hair (of all unlikely musicals). Theres also a thumping rave presided over by Anatole and his henchman, Dolokhov (Ian Lassiter), in which the conductor, Or Matias, plops a big pair of headphones on his ears and starts headbanging away as strobe lights flicker.

Neither the music nor the unrhymed lyrics reach any great heights of intricacy or sophistication. But the score matches the dynamics of the story line precisely, pausing for reflection during the quiet interludes in which Natasha searches desperately to sort out the truths of her heart, then revving up again as Anatole and Dolokhov rouse themselves into a wicked lather as they plot the lovers elopement. And while the sung-through nature of the score often requires the characters to literally narrate their actions and feelings even as they are experiencing them, the actors pour themselves into these roles with an intensity that erases any distance such a device might suggest.

Natasha, played by Ms. Soo with a soft ardency thats continually affecting, serenades the winter moon as she sings of her love for the absent Andrey. Later the new affection convulsing her spirit is plainly legible in the rounded contours of Ms. Soos face as she sings with awed passion of her sudden attachment to Anatole. Another touching song, featuring one of Mr. Malloys most fetching melodies, finds Ms. Ashfords Sonya vowing to save her beloved cousin from her own folly, even if it means betraying her confidence.

The elusive nature of earthly happiness is a major theme in Tolstoys novel, and I wish wed been allowed to spend some more time exploring the spiritual quest of the troubled, bearish Pierre, one of the most richly moving characters in fiction. Mr. Malloy imbues him with a rumpled delicacy of feeling thats just right.

But when that comet streaks through the sky at the hushed climax of the show, Pierre experiences an epiphany that had my heart leaping into my throat, as he sang with humble joy of the mysterious workings of human affections. Having come to realize that his abiding love for Natasha has grown even richer, Pierre is wonder-struck at the discovery that compassion for anothers suffering can bring us a pleasure as profound as the fulfillment of our own greatest desires.",[]

nytimes.com,2014-12-31 00:00:00,The surfer dude who rebuilt the Harvard Art Museums,[],"Tom Lentz, the director of the Harvard Art Museums, is seen in a gallery at the institutions Arthur M. Sackler Museum featuring Buddhist sculptures. (Damian Strohmeyer/For The Washington Post)

When Tom Lentz interviewed for the top job at the Harvard Art Museums back in 2003, the hiring committee received a strange warning. The soft-spoken director of the Smithsonian Institutions international art museums division could come across as laid-back, almost too calm.

I was told he seemed like a cool surfer dude, says Steven Hyman, then Harvards provost. I dont actually know what a cool surfer dude really behaves like.

What Hyman cared about more was the task in front of that new director. The Harvard Art Museums were in desperate need of an overhaul. Ceilings leaked, the plumbing was dangerously outdated and curators, trying to protect artworks without proper climate control, found themselves shuffling floor fans through galleries.

Harvard hired Lentz, and this fall, after an extensive renovation and expansion project that cost more than $350 million, the Harvard Art Museums reopened to the public.

On a recent weekday, Lentz, sitting in a conference room outside his office, did not sound like he was in the midst of a victory lap. Instead, he offered a confession. After all the time and money, after sitting on countless committees and giving more than 100 tours, he wouldnt mind chatting about something else.

Were tired of talking about it because weve talked about it for such a long time, Lentz says. And part of the exhaustion is the fact that were doing this at Harvard. Which is a place full of a lot of bright, ambitious people. There is no shortage of ideas.

Thats a polite way of saying that at Harvard, not only does everybody have an idea, but those ideas usually are better than yours. Or, at least, thats what they think. Which leads to more studies and debates and estimates. And then the next idea comes along. The wheels keep spinning.

Add to this the construction challenges when your institution is three museums.

The Fogg Museum, at its current site since 1927, needed renovations, but its historic facade had to be preserved. The Busch-Reisinger Museum, relocated to the backside of the Fogg in 1991, was riddled with structural problems and had to come down. The Arthur M. Sackler Museum, which opened in 1985 to house largely Asian art, was across the street.

How complicated was the project? The first report stating that the Fogg needed to be renovated came out in 1956. Directors came, directors left. The project remained unrealized, until Lentz arrived.

That is not to say that everyone appreciated his focus, with some now-former curators grumbling about the emphasis on fundraising. But with its completion in November, Harvard finally has a proper place to display its prized collection of more than 250,000 objects, which range from Roman artifacts to Degas, Picasso and Kiki Smith.

The project did suck up a lot of resources that might have otherwise gone to curatorial projects, says William Robinson, the museums longtime and soon-to-retire curator of drawings. But it had to be done. We would not have been reaccredited had we not fixed that building.

The man who led the way is Lentz, 63, a wiry figure with gray hair and a sense of humor as dry as desert sand. He is no museum-world MacArthur, rejecting what he calls the heroic model of a museum leader and takes pride in noting that he organized dozens of study groups during the planning and construction process.

Lentz talks constantly about collaboration, mentioning how he has appreciated working with the directors of other Harvard museums during the project and is proud to have incorporated works from their collections into galleries. He also doesnt want to take credit for the project.

During a recent interview, Lentz walked a reporter to an office where deputy director Maureen Donovan and chief curator Debi Kao were meeting. They stood by, slightly awkwardly, as he talked about how this project could not have been done without them.

Donovan, in an interview later in the afternoon, disagreed.

He was the first director who stopped everybody in their tracks when he came here and said, We have a plan and really galvanized the staff behind that thinking, she says. Nobody else had really done that before.

Lentz, the second of seven children, grew up in Los Angeles, the son of an RCA executive and a homemaker. The Lentz family moved around, to Houston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Indianapolis and then back to Los Angeles.

That rambling didnt stop after high school. Lentz attended the University of Arizona for two years, then transferred to Claremont Mens College (now Claremont McKenna), where he earned his art history degree in 1976.

He took time off while studying, traveling around the Middle East and, after graduation, washing dishes at an Indian restaurant and painting houses.

Eventually, Lentz enrolled at the University of California at Berkeley, and earned a masters degree in Near Eastern studies. It was there that Katharina Otto-Dorn, the German-born art historian, told Lentz that if he wanted to seriously study Islamic art, he needed to head east. Lentz earned his doctoral degree from Harvard in 1985.

Though he would leave town  spending the next two decades in curatorial and administrative jobs at the Rhode Island School of Design, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Smithsonian  Lentzs experience in Cambridge would be a key factor in his ability to pull off the Harvard project.

You were getting somebody for whom the map of Harvard is not going to be a new one, but rather a refresher, says Glenn Lowry, the director of the Museum of Modern Art and a colleague of Lentzs at the Smithsonian during the 1980s. He understood the relationship of the museum to the faculty, the faculty to each other. He knew how to navigate that terrain because its the terrain he grew up with.

Thats not to say the path to this falls opening was always smooth.

After his arrival at Harvard, Lentz tried to build a museum several miles from the Harvard campus on land the university owned in neighboring Allston. That idea collapsed.

Next, he turned his attention to the museums campus on Quincy Street. There was the issue of how to bring three museums under one roof. There also were the personalities to deal with.

Hyman remembers a discussion with Jeremy Knowles, Harvards longtime dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, who died in 2008.

Steven, we should not be in the art museum business, he recalls Knowles telling him.

The small problem, Hyman says today, is that we had already collected 250,000 objects of priceless art. So we were already in the business.

Lentz also had to contend with his own staff. Some of the museums curators disagreed with his approach.

He was Ahab with the white whale, and the white whale was getting this building done and keeping it within budget and keeping the Harvard administration happy, says one of the curators, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because, he says, he wants to maintain a relationship with the art museums.

The final project would take all three museums  the Fogg, the Busch-Reisinger and the Sackler  and put them under a new glass roof designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano. The project also would incorporate massive study centers, meant to allow students access to the tens of thousands of works not on display and fulfill Harvards mission as the countrys leading teaching museum.

In the end, Hyman says, the cool surfer dude side of Lentz proved key to finishing the job.

He was naturally calm, and that served him well, Hyman says. There were so many ups and downs in this project, and the fundraising and the financial meltdown. Im sure that, on the side, he had to have been emotionally stressed. But he didnt show it. And in some ways, that allowed him to succeed in the face of what seemed like an endless strain of obstacles.

Earlier this month, Lentz offered yet another tour of the completed museum building. He showed off the 17th-century Dutch gallery and talked about how much he appreciated the way the works by Rubens, Rembrandt and van Dyck were hung, given space and not crammed frame-to-frame. He walked through the spacious, brightly lit central courtyard, now a gathering spot open to the public for free.

Then he entered the museums impressive collection of 20th-century German works. A stunning pear tree by Klimt. A group of Max Beckmanns. Franz von Stucks curvaceous Wounded Amazon.

Turning right, Lentz got to Room 1510.

It is the edge of the building  a glass-walled space that Piano calls a winter garden. There are five small bronze sculptures here, but the real treat is the view. The neighboring Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts is the only Le Corbusier building in the United States.

Its an overcast day, and rain gathers in beads on a beam on the edge of the building. Outside, on the concrete ramp twisting from the Carpenter Center to one of the museums new entrances, a man walks his dog.

It is here, in this tiny pocket gallery, that Lentz sits on a bench and mentions a recent visit to the Louvre.

I was utterly exhausted afterward, he says. It was literally like going to Grand Central station.

Thats all he says for a minute, as the rain drops onto the lawn below.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE  I found this one very difficult for the day of the week, possibly because I approached it nonchalantly and filled in several words incorrectly, including a theme answer, then had to right my wrongs to finish.

When I solve I almost always scan once for gimmes before settling in. Im not sure if this is the most efficient approach but its reflexive, and Im always pleased when I find some substantial words that seem to fit the bill. For this puzzle, three of these were BURNOUT for 20 across, fatigue; ABOUTFACE for 29 down, complete reversal; and JELLYFISH for 25 across, translucent sea creature that drifts with the current, which was a mighty specific clue  one that I would have looked sideways at on Friday or Saturday, but blithely took at face value here.

I then went up to the northeast corner (Im a lefty  maybe thats why  habit again) and got far enough to replace BURNOUT with TIRE OUT, and figured out BOISE, where you need an ID (for Idaho) to get your mail, one of a few clever wordplays in this puzzle. I even worked west and figured out NATURE PRESERVES, which was enough to give me the cute theme. But then I got stuck on that JELLYFISH for a long time. Maybe Im stubborn, maybe Ive never in my life heard of MOON JELLY; but I confess that I sent a few brain cells back to my long-term memory to see if there could possibly be any other chipmunks than Theodore, Simon and ALVIN, because I was trying to smush JUKE in for a Karaoke need and keep ABOUT FACE.

Soon enough, though, that straightened itself out. I thought that a lot of the clues and answers in this puzzle were solidly beyond beginner-level. VOLTEFACE obviously stopped me for a bit; UPBRAIDED, PILASTERS, IRATER and ABBESS are all classic, more challenging fill.

It was easy to find chipmunks singing slow jams but that just didnt seem fair.

nytimes.com,2015-12-08 00:00:00,Review: David Bowie Songs and a Familiar Alien in Lazarus,['Ben Brantley'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Ice-cold bolts of ecstasy shoot like novas through the glamorous muddle and murk of Lazarus, the great-sounding, great-looking and mind-numbing new musical built around songs by David Bowie. These transfixing moments occur when Mr. Bowie feels most palpably present  that is, when one of the shows carefully stylized performers delivers a distinctly Bowie number in a distinctly Bowie style.









Lest I create a stampede on New York Theater Workshop, where Lazarus (which is largely sold out) opened on Monday night, let me add quickly that Mr. Bowie himself does not appear in the flesh in this sci-fi pageant of extraterrestrial angst, which has been staged by Ivo van Hove, the incredibly (and justifiably) fashionable director. But then, much of Mr. Bowies extraordinary longevity as a rock god has to do with the feeling that he has never really been with us in the flesh.

More than any of his peers or imitators, Mr. Bowie, an international star since the early 1970s, has always come across as his own spectral avatar, in a series of beguilingly designed alter egos who are both there and not there. Even in the midst of white-hot stage spectacle, his affect has been one of cool disassociation, matched by songs that are rhapsodies of alienation; cries of solitary pain turn into our collective pleasure, and we citizens of an anomic world swoon and think, We are David Bowie.

Photo

Except that we arent as famous. Look up here, Im in heaven, go the lyrics to the title song, one of several new numbers for the show by Mr. Bowie. Ive got scars that cant be seen./Ive got drama cant be stolen./Everybody knows me now.

Those words are intoned, exquisitely, by Michael C. Hall, in what might be described as a state of glazed desperation. Mr. Hall  best known as the television character Dexter, the serial killer youd most like to have a beer with  is portraying Thomas Newton, a familiar name to Bowie fans.

Newton, as hes usually called, is the title character in The Man Who Fell to Earth, the 1976 Nicolas Roeg movie starring Mr. Bowie  in a role he was born to play  as a fish-out-of-water alien, who has arrived among us in search of salvation for his dehydrated planet. Spoiler: He fails in his quest, but he survives.

Lazarus is a sequel to that film, or rather (officially) to the 1963 novel by Walter Tevis that inspired it. It is 40 years since we last saw Newton, then a bereft, alcoholic and eternally stranded creature. In the meantime, it seems, he hasnt aged a day (you have to envy those E.T. genes), and hes as rich as Croesus. But he exists in a stale time warp in a naked Manhattan penthouse, where he subsists on gin and Twinkies amid memories of his outer space family and of Mary Lou, the earthling who loved and left him.

He is, as described by Elly (a sinuous Cristin Milioti), whom he has just hired as his personal assistant, sorta sad, sorta unknowable in the way that you imagine rich, reclusive, eccentric men to be. Ellys new job puts a serious strain on her marriage to Zach (Bobby Moreno), since she finds herself not only falling in love with Newton but also turning into the late, lamented, blue-haired Mary Lou. Talk about ch-ch-ch-changes.

At the same time, Newton is visited by a fellow businessman (Charlie Pollock) and an otherworldly child (a radiant Sophia Anne Caruso) who knows all about him and promises to help him return to his little house in the stars. Shes as improbably innocent as a waif out of Dickens (or from the final scene of La Dolce Vita). But the hope she brings seems destined to be derailed by the sinister Valentine (Michael Esper, embodying Mr. Bowies cabaret side), a knife-wielding man in black.

Photo

This synopsis is a crude simplification, since identities are highly fluid in Lazarus. The script, by Mr. Bowie and Mr. Walsh (the fine outre Irish playwright who did the Tony-winning book for the musical Once), switches between passages of flat-footed, literal-minded exposition and cryptic collegiate dialogue in which its suggested that what youre seeing is only a Newton-spun illusion.

Listening to the characters talk, your response is likely to be either an irritated Oh, please, or a dumbfounded Huh? But then, the music (performed by a ravishing-sounding band, divided from the stage by a transparent wall) starts up. So do a host of visual effects that mirror and mock the people singing or suggest that they (and you) have tumbled into a three-dimensional television set that is perpetually changing channels.

A backup team of performers shows up in various guises, including Geisha girls, phantom teenagers and jaded nightclubbers. Mr. Hall, Ms. Milioti, Mr. Esper and Ms. Caruso  who all have more full-bodied voices than Mr. Bowie does  nonetheless capture the Bowie inflections and phrasing, while striking gorgeously gnarled and introverted poses, choreographed by Annie-B Parson. Whether the song is vintage Bowie (Changes, Absolute Beginners, The Man Who Sold the World) or one of the new pieces (loved the self-lacerating Killing a Little Time), you usually feel youve ascended to a special tier of heaven, one produced by MTV.

The voyage is overseen by Mr. van Hove, who is currently represented on Broadway by his stunning revival of Arthur Millers A View From the Bridge (with his take on Millers The Crucible scheduled for next year). Mr. van Hoves signature style  skeletal, shimmering and ominous  is as distinctive as Mr. Bowies, and in many ways, a perfect match for it.

Though no one is likely to describe Mr. Bowie as a minimalist, these artists share a vision of universal solitude and dislocation. In Lazarus, Mr. van Hove realizes that sensibility with the expert assistance of his longtime collaborators Jan Versweyveld (set and lighting design), An DHuys (costumes) and Tal Yarden (video design).

These elements often meld exactly as they should, which means that they create a haunting impression of dividedness, of life as a perplexing jumble of puzzle pieces that can never be fully assembled. Unfortunately, that sense of dislocation extends more clumsily to the relation of the script to the songs. The spoken story line, when its not opaque, brings to mind a young adult novel of the supernatural, featuring restless and winsome spirits longing to be put to rest.

Although Mr. Hall, a fabulous alien in chief, has mastered a perfect semi-anesthetized style of speech, the rest of the cast members dont always sound convinced by what they are required to say. You become impatient for the characters to stop talking and start singing again. When they do, their words and music require no labored annotations  and transport us to that lonely planet where all of us aliens at least sometimes feel we live.

On Thursday, we challenged Well readers to figure out the case of a 36-year-old man with a 20-year history of migrating joint pains along with other strange symptoms. Nearly 300 of you offered thoughtful suggestions of what he might have had. And one out of 10 of you were spot on.

The correct diagnosis is:

Ehlers Danlos syndrome

The first reader to correctly make this diagnosis was Bryley Williams, of New York City. She told me she knows nothing about medicine but found the answer on the Internet by investigating noninflammatory causes of joint pain and pneumothorax. All of the winners of this contest are extraordinary, but I think Ms. Williams may take the prize. She is 15 years old, a freshman in high school in New York City. Well done, Ms. Williams! Maybe you should consider a career in medicine once you graduate.

The Diagnosis

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or EDS, is a group of inherited disorders that affect the bodys connective tissues  the skin, muscles, tendons and ligaments that hold us together. Since the 1990s, the disease has been divided into six main types, depending on which connective tissues are most affected. Based on the gene study done in this patient, he was given a diagnosis of the least severe and most common variety, which primarily causes hypermobility of the joints as well as skin that is easily damaged and scars badly. EDS was probably recognized as early as 400 B.C., when Hippocrates noted that the nomads and Scythians had lax joints and multiple scars. This disorder came to more modern medical attention in the 17th century when, at a medical presentation in Holland, a Spanish sailor by the name of George Albes exhibited his remarkable ability to stretch the skin on his chest out an arms length. The first complete description of the condition was given by a Russian physician, Dr. A. N. Chernogubov, at the end of the 19th century. He presented a 17-year-old boy who suffered from recurrent joint dislocations and easily stretched and fragile skin. The boy had many scars resulting from minor injuries, because these patients do not heal normally. Based on these observations, Dr. Chernogubov predicted that the clinical manifestations were caused by an abnormality of the connective tissues. That report did not come to the notice of Western Europe for many years. So while the disorder still carries Chernogubovs name in Russia, in most places it referred to as EDS, after the two physicians who first characterized the disorder in Paris decades later: Dr. Edvard Ehlers and Dr. Henri-Alexandre Danlos.

How the Diagnosis Was Made

The patient, a 36-year-old man with a 20-year history of migrating joint pain, had been to dozens of doctors  internists, orthopedic surgeons, rheumatologists. All had examined him and seen nothing. Indeed, his last rheumatologist kept saying that she wanted to believe that he had this much pain but that she couldnt find anything physical to cause it. One orthopedist had asked him if his skin was particularly stretchy or if he was very flexible  obviously thinking of a diagnosis like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but the patient said no. He didnt think he was particularly flexible or that his skin was unusually stretchy. Later, once he had the diagnosis, he showed one of his doctors how he could move his thumb, and the doctor told him that he was popping it in and out of joint. And the geneticist told him that his skin was stretchy enough to fit the diagnostic criteria. Still, it all seemed normal to him. Not extraordinary in any way. Still, after 20 years of searching, the patient was finally willing to accept that he was just more prone to getting these pains. And he began keeping a list of the types of exercises or activities that seemed most likely to trigger the episodes of joint pain. His wife was unwilling to give up. She continued to search the Internet for answers.

Like Son, Like Father?

The final clue came not from the mans doctor but from his sons. The boy, age 11, went to see his pediatrician, Dr. Renee Brand, for his annual physical exam. He was tall and slender, like his father. He had a colt-like awkwardness about him, with arms and legs that looked just a bit too long to be well managed. And he had a stooped posture, as if he spent too much time gazing into a smartphone he didnt even have. Could he sit up completely straight? Dr. Brand asked. He couldnt, though he tried. Later the doctor asked him to bend over so that she could check his spine for scoliosis. He immediately flopped down, his chest almost touching his knees and his hands lying flat on the floor in front of him. Dr. Brand was surprised by this remarkable degree of flexibility. When the boy righted himself, she asked him to straighten his legs as far as they would go. When he did, his knees went well past straight, so that his legs bowed backward. Straightening his elbows produced a similar curve. I think maybe you should take him to see an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Brand suggested to the boys mother. Two weeks later the mom called Dr. Brand with a report. Shed taken the boy to see the surgeo,n and he had in turn recommended that she take him to see a geneticist. I thought so, replied Dr. Brand with satisfaction. Seeing how remarkably flexible the young man was, and how hard it was for him to stand up straight, Dr. Brand thought the boy might have a disorder known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

Getting a Diagnosis

After making the appointment with the geneticist, the boys mother sat down at the computer to read up on Ehlers-Danlos. As she read through the descriptions, she could definitely recognize her son. But in those pages she also recognized her husband. Joint pain, check; pneumothorax, check; osteoporosis, check; scoliosis, check. Ultimately this inherited disease was diagnosed in both father and son. Theres no cure for EDS, but its important to know that you have it. The son sees a cardiologist every couple of years, since EDS can lead to problems with heart valves and vessels. He was found to be at risk for a dangerous stretching of his aorta that, without repair, could lead to rupture. And both father and son now understand which exercises are going to be a problem for them  possibly causing joint dislocations or other musculoskeletal injuries.

PARIS  Paris Fashion Week went out with a bang on Tuesday, thanks to a scattering of glittering parties held on the penultimate night of the calendar. Hordes of high-heeled  if weary  industry revelers prepared their Instagram filters, determined to document the end of the season in style.

Days after announcing that revenues had topped $1 billion last year, Valentino hosted an after-party titled Its Happening at the Hotel Salomon de Rothschild, and Alessandra Ambrosio and Dakota Fanning came to let down their hair.

The British fashion biannual AnOther Magazine threw itself a 15th anniversary bash at the Chanel couture salon on the Rue Cambon, and Pharrell Williams, Kendall Jenner and the K-Pop singer G-Dragon stood by to watch Karl Lagerfeld  cover star of the latest issue  sing Happy Birthday alongside his young godson Hudson Kroenig and a gigantic tiered cake. And over in the 10th Arrondissement, Kenzo transformed a former cabaret club-turned-concert hall into a lush and leafy Champagne and ice cream-fueled rave scene, to toast a Disney collaboration related to the coming movie version of The Jungle Book.

Meanwhile, just south of the Arc de Triomphe, a constellation of women in scarlet  models to be precise  descended upon a private mansion for the LOreal Red Obsession party. The Formula One racing champion Lewis Hamilton, now a near-ubiquitous presence on the fashion circuit, looked like all his Christmases had come at once as he snapped selfies with the models Barbara Palvin and Irina Shayk on the red carpet. A Balmain-clad Eva Longoria posed with the president of LOreal, self-consciously standing a good head-and-shoulders below everyone around her despite towering five-inch heels.

I feel like a Power Ranger, announced Lara Stone with a grin, looking hot  in all senses of the word  in a red rubber PVC jumpsuit. Ive always wanted to be a superhero and will reveal my powers to you later with some magic moves.

Two rooms over, Karlie Kloss and Doutzen Kroes dutifully tried to get the party started in the corner on an otherwise deserted dance floor, joined at one stage by the rapper Chris Brown to the bemusement of several noncelebrity onlookers.

Later, Francois-Henri Pinault, chief executive of the luxury group Kering, arrived with Bradley Cooper, the actor and beau of Ms. Shayk, who was holding court in a plunging Dior minidress. The men, however, soon retreated into a deep conversation with Mr. Hamilton for much of the night, and Ms. Shayk explained that despite the curtain falling on fashion week, her work was far from over.

I cant go too wild tonight. I still have to walk the Miu Miu show tomorrow and then its back to New York for more work, work, work  I feel like I am always working, she said, a tuxedo jacket draped over her shoulders.

nytimes.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,Annie Dillards Impossible Pages,['Introduction Sam Anderson'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Its unclear what to call Annie Dillard, where to shelve her. Over more than 40 years, she has been, sometimes all at once, a poet, essayist, novelist, humorist, naturalist, critic, theologian, collagist and full-throated singer of mystic incantations. Instead of being any particular kind of writer, she is, flagrantly, a consciousness  an abstract, all-encompassing energy field that inhabits a given piece of writing the way sunlight clings to a rock: delicately but with absolute force, always leaving a shadow behind. This is an essential part of what it means to be human, this shifting between the transcendent self and the contingent world, the ecstasy and the dental bill. We all do some version of it, all the time. But Dillard does it more insistently. This month, she publishes The Abundance: Narrative Essays Old and New, a collection of pieces that spans her entire variegated career.

Dillard began publishing books in 1974. Tickets for a Prayer Wheel, a small collection of poems, was followed immediately by Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, a long nonfictional account of her experience embedding, Thoreau-style, for a year of close observation of the titular waterway in Virginia. Pilgrim won the Pulitzer Prize and unleashed upon the world Dillards radical style: prose right on the border of poetry, dense with dazzling effects  strong metaphors, heavy rhythms, bold verbs, sudden parables, outlandish facts harvested from the darkest corners of the library. From the start, this has been Dillards mission: to crowbar surprise, sentence by sentence, into all the tiny gaps of our ordinary experience. Water turtles smooth as beans were gliding down the current in a series of easy, weightless push-offs as men bound on the moon, she writes in Pilgrim. A pile of burned books flaked in my hand like pieces of pie. In Dillards writing, strange things are constantly becoming familiar, and vice versa. (Like mushrooms and engines, they didnt have hands, she writes of nuns.) Above all, Dillard refuses to fall into traditional expository rhythms, to calm down, to be normal, to proceed with caution. She feels driven, always, to summon revelations out of nothing  to call for fireworks, with only a ballpoint pen.









You will find, in the following pages, a small but rare bloom of Annie Dillards fireworks: three early essays, all short and characteristically strange, all appearing for the first time in this form. They have been revised multiple times over multiple decades, because Dillard is always revising, and then re-revising. When your project is to articulate all the intricately nested subtleties of a human mind in contact with the ever-changing world, your work, by definition, will never stop.

Two of these essays (Recalling Niels Bohr and Lonesome, With Snails) revolve around jokes  a favorite subject of Dillards. In one, the joke is that a fireplace, paradoxically, cools a room. In the other, a snail is described, absurdly, as short. Thats it. Those are the jokes. They are not, by normal joke-telling standards, particularly good; they are run-of-the-mill, everyday, lukewarm witticisms. But such everydayness serves Dillards purposes exactly. We dont need great writing to tell us that obviously amazing things are amazing, just as we dont need high-powered telescopes to tell us that the sun is warm. What we need from great writing, most urgently, is an understanding that the mundane itself  snails, fireplaces, shrubs, pebbles, socks, minor witticisms  is secretly amazing.

Poetry and jokes are each, as William Carlos Williams said of the former, machines made out of words, and Dillard is a highly trained mechanic. In An American Childhood, her classic memoir of growing up in Pittsburgh, Dillard describes life with her parents as a long and rigorous apprenticeship of wisecracking. Her description of the compressed power of a joke (A few words suggested a complete story and a wealth of feelings) applies equally well to the compressed power of poetry. Each form emphasizes the sudden turn, the improbable connection. Dillards brand of neo-Transcendentalist prose-poetry is, in this light, a distant cousin of stand-up comedy: a risky solo performance that depends, to a large extent, on the unusual motions of a mind, as rendered in a deliberately heightened style, with the goal of ecstatic density.

And so, in Dillards joke essays, Thoreau and Colette and Heisenberg and Niels Bohr commingle with an unnamed Tennessee mountain hermit who has invented the typewriter 50 years too late; snails feet, upon being touched, recoil, curling, like tickled lips. This is sit-down stand-up, to be consumed by a silent audience of one.

The second essay here, Utah, is less like a joke than a dream: a surreal flight of free-associative fancy. Dillard sees (or does not see) windshield wipers in the desert, clacking dry as hoofbeats over the glass and hurling themselves from side to side like dancers. She sees (or does not see) Native Americans the size of ants. But then, as she says near the end of the essay: Truth interests me less than contact.

One of these essays ends, out of nowhere, with a brief but bold artistic manifesto. Possible books abound; Id rather write an impossible page. This might help to explain why Dillard has written less and less over the years. There will always be the lure of the merely possible, and very few writers have the discipline to stay away.

I am beginning to bore myself with the following joke about the fireplace. Since it doesnt draw well, I open the door a crack, which circulates air through the room and up the chimney. This cools the room. I say Im going to get another couple cords of wood this summer for air-conditioning. I have not noticed that the innocent islanders in the captive audience on the receiving end of this little pleasantry are rushing it into print, but I have just found it in Werner of-all-people Heisenberg, in Physics and Beyond. One cannot be too careful of ones reading.

Heisenberg attributes the first remarking of this remark, quite correctly, to Niels Bohr (who loved paradoxical formulations)  for, although this might have been another of those many instances of simultaneous discovery by independent researchers which confound lay thinkers, but at which casehardened science historians merely shrug, it is, alas, not. The intervening decades are too embarrassingly long.

My belated discovery that fire cools is like the famous case of the Tennessee mountain hermit who called a newspaper reporter to his shack because he had, in the 1930s, invented the typewriter. (The typewriter had been invented in ever-improved forms since 1867 and was in common use by 1900.) This mans was an enormous, loom-size construction with a keyboard like a pianos, whose keys one depressed either by two slammed fists or by a wood-splitters maul. But that is another tale. Niels Bohr, according to Heisenberg, claimed that the fireplace had been especially put in as a cooling device. Surely now this joke is well wrung.

Werner Heisenbergs Physics and Beyond disappoints me. He is merely filling in the inches. He knows the material in this book cold  too cold. It is far behind him, not only in years, but in his thinking and, one hopes, in his sense of what writing is. But it is a book. People read books. If you have something to say, write a book. Thoreaus Kathmandu principle, the Colette principle (Break of Day as diary), still holds: You can write anything, anything at all, if youre honest, because we are each as bizarre and foreign to one another as the news from Kathmandu (as Colettes life was to me).

On the other hand. Writing is too hard to waste on the weirdness of your daily life, or at least on mine. I love to sock the reader into some odd time and place and let him breathe there and love it, and love the world for having such a place  and then to call for fireworks there with only a ballpoint pen. Possible books abound; Id rather write an impossible page.

Argument is penny-ante play, or talk with tea. It is the literary, pace Julia A. Moore (the sweet singer of Michigan), that is a work very difficult to do. Arguing draws a line linking corridors through chaos with reason. Art, by contrast, is the whole ball of wax  a system, coherent, chopped out from chaos and held.

Two. | Utah

August: Im trying to float this Plymouth over State Route 740. There has been nine years drought in this spot, and the canyons are cracking like pods. The heat heaves from the asphalt: No wonder the roadrunner runs. Show that bird cool grass and hell loll till kingdom come.

A truck comes along trailing a travois of dust, a Ford pickup, and the fellows got his windshield wipers on. Some drunk, I think; theres not a cloud. Next thing, an old Mustang rounds the bend, robed in dirt, full of dogs, and the wipers are on, the wipers are on, clacking dry as hoofbeats over the glass. The suns burned my eyes, I think; its a whiteout, heat exhaustion, delirium. I pass a Chevy pickup, meet a 58 Olds, and everythings normal; then here comes some young guy with a Pinto, and the wipers are on, hurling themselves from side to side like dancers.

That night in a motel in Moab I heard the story. Its a fad now, the last few years, with the local Native Americans. They flick on the windshield wipers when the land needs rain. Like a prayer wheel! I was amazed! You should have told me.

Actually, I was in line at the light on Peters Creek Road, coming back from the liquor store, clear day, and the lady in front of me had her wipers on. Just cleaning her windshield with water shot up from her car. Thats all. Believe what you will; take what you want.

Theres a May drought on. All day yesterday I followed Tinker Creek to its source. I drove north to the first place the creek cuts under a road, parked by a cedar and headed upstream, up the mountain, up under the flowering dogwood and into the laurel and pines. Early in the afternoon, I ate lunch. The creek bed narrowed, blackened and emptied. I climbed on stones. Soon I straddled the creek, and then it died, or was born, at a patch of sourgrass in a strip of sunlight torn by a windthrown oak. A rock marked the source, a chip of granite shoulder; I threw it aside and crouched.

There, under the granite, was a tiny traveling tribe of Native Americans, perfectly formed. They emerged, stuck with clumps of clay, from the right side of the red hole, brushed themselves off and filed to the left side, where they pried the earth apart and scrambled in. Their dogs ran alongside, barking minutely; their travois poles, slung from ponies, etched faint parallels in the ground. The adults kept catching their hair in grass roots coming and going. Streamers hung from their armbands, lodge poles and parfleche bags. Several women wore dresses that rattled from deer hooves sewn in pairs to hems. One woman  in this heat!  had wound fringed doeskin leggings over her calves. Over her back fell a sunbleached, hairless, elkskin robe.

I pressed my ear hard to the ground to catch their words. Wrakan, I heard in one song, repeated in a whining chorus  a word which I believe is Crow for water, but which in modern usage can also mean eel.

What I want, what any of us wants, doesnt, apparently, matter. Our daily rain-bread, our nightly salt-rising. I stuck a cedar bough under your windshield wiper upright, like a feather in a headband, in a hatband, like a feather in a mirror frame, flame. I have barely spit to lick a finger, barely a finger to stick upright for wind. Truth interests me less than contact.

My eyes need wiping; Ill wash the windows with whisky. Ill seed the clouds. I run roads, seeking sweetgrass or sour. I take off shoes; I run roads, clattering on split hooves. I bed down in laurel, leaving the faintest of tracks, till kingdom come.

Three. | Lonesome, With Snails

My best friends are two land snails. I feel very close to them sometimes; we each share all that we have, all that we know and are. They slide around slowly, up the mantelpiece and down. I sit or pace in my rooms, agitated, picking up and putting down a saxophone, changing my shirt, hefting by turns a china lamp, a leather pouch, trying to joke with the snails. One is tannish; one is yellowish.

They differ  the yellowish one is more. . . . Oh, if they were very different, if one were, say, a musician, wry, and one a muscular philosopher, say, what society I would enjoy! For the plain fact is, if you insist upon it, that they are much alike. So much alike that for most purposes, an outside observer, and even, to be perfectly frank, myself, would have to call them identical, more or less. Quiet.

After I have spent some long time absorbed with the snails and their ways, occasionally, or, in fact, almost always, I am struck by the incongruity of the picture we present. I am, after all, a human being, and, as such, almost six feet tall, give or take a few inches. I line up the snails on my palm and inspect their ranks. I carry them to my eye, while one snail or the other retracts and protrudes first one feeler, then another. I wait until all four of the knobby bulbs on their feeler tips are fully extruded and plump, until they are well forward, supplied with a dark drop of blood, and calm . . . and then I see myself suddenly and think, I treat my friends too curiously, too curiously for words! I put the snails under the philodendron, disgusted, and leave, walk to the newsstand, hail and greet the newsstand owner behind the counter with his wondering, joyous expression; and buy the foulest cigars at any price and carry a dozen to my rooms, triumphant.

Or I say to the snails, Friends, children, illiterates, you imbecilic nubs (and I stroke or pinch the furls of their feet, which recoil, curling, like tickled lips), The trouble with you, the ridiculous, ludicrous thing about both of you, is: You are too short.

Short! Look at them! It is unheard-of to be so short! Friends are friends, and I love these two on their merits and idiosyncrasies quite apart from their positions as my sole and best friends, and quite apart from the figures they cut  just as you love your friends, I am sure. But their size, once I notice it, strains my credulity.

Once this notion takes possession of me, as it has, I confess, now, the inappropriateness of the snails height, which at first seems so marvelously comical, takes on a lunatic air, the smack of a cosmic incongruity. It is an anomaly so endlessly comical that the very length of its humor pierces the bounds of the mind and touches the rim of mystery itself. It is too much to think about, and far too much to explain, that these snails are so impossibly short.

Sometimes in consequence I have taken a kettle from the fire and thrown it through a window. Sometimes, I jump on my own foot, I bite my finger, I run out and break a framed painting over the skull of a pedestrian (once); I throw things; I do, actually, love to throw many things. There is much I love. Because the world is so astonishing, the snails  to take just one of the many possible examples  are so short, and it is all too great for me to think about alone. Or at all.

On many fine mornings I do not concern myself overmuch with the mystery. And by controlling the depth of my thinking carefully, I permit myself a little joke.

Good morning, I say to each snail in turn: to the tannish one looking dead on the hearth, slowly turning her gelatinous head; to the half-dead yellowish one who rides a trail of slime up a window like Botticellis Venus afloat on a frilly foot  Good morning . . .  I say, narrowing my eyes, Shortie.

And a good morning it may be. Many are.",[]

On a gray Wednesday afternoon in Southeast Portland, Ore., someone flicked on the lights in Tango Berretin, a dance studio devoted entirely to Argentine tango. Alex Krebs, the owner, teacher and acclaimed dancer, pressed play on traditional music from the 1930s and 1940s, as students drifted in, tossing aside street shoes for strappy stilettos. Against a backdrop of tango sheet music on the walls, the dancers didnt wait for a formal invitation to the timeworn hardwood floor. One look with sustained eye contact (cabeceo) was a mutual agreement to dance. Within moments of arrival, dancers were locked in a cheek-to-cheek embrace, gliding to the music.









Tango took off in Portland in the late 1990s. The city is now a renowned destination for Argentine tango in North America, attracting dancers from around the globe with two annual festivals (Portland Tango Festival in October and ValenTango last month) and a thriving social dance scene.

The survival of ballrooms from their heyday in the 1920s has been central to the continued growth of tango in Portland, providing affordable and central venues for weekly milongas (tango social dances). In recent years, tango has expanded beyond the ballroom to anywhere with a suitable dance surface, including a local bakery.

Baking was just a cover for tango, Tissa Stein, the owner of Tabor Bread, said with a smile about the conception of her bakery in 2012. Even before it opened, tango was very much a part of the design.

Instead of concrete floors, Ms. Stein chose honey-colored hickory, a smooth surface ideal for tangos gliding steps. The countertops where bread is made by day are on wheels to open up space for dancing by night. Tango and baking are both deeply nourishing, Ms. Stein said. To me, tango is another type of nutrition for the body.

After hours, Tabor Bread hosts sultry tango soirees, attracting up to 50 dancers a night. Tables are cleared away and dancers spin around the floor, often to live music, against the backdrop of the bakerys wood-burning oven. Ms. Stein, 67, who began dancing about nine years ago, is planning a sunset, or happy-hour, milonga for dancers whose schedules dont allow them to dance into the wee hours (or as a warm-up for those who do).

The warm embraces of tango compensate for the lack of sunshine in Portland, said Antje Kalinauskas, one of the hosts of several past milongas there, including Chispa (Spanish for spark) at Tabor Bread. Originally from Germany, Ms. Kalinauskas, 40, found a welcoming tango community in Portland. Tango can be like speaking another language, she said. Think about how fun it can be to meet someone new and chat in their language.

The community has spread beyond the boundaries of the dance studio, too, with organized group bike rides. Jeff Mandel, a shoemaker, runs Tango by Bike, where free group rides are announced, gathering dancers to bike into the heart of the city to tango. What began as organized social rides in 2007 during tango festivals has grown exponentially to include all sorts of tango gatherings including ballroom milongas. They draw locals and often rope out-of-town visitors into the community before dancing begins.

Tango al fresco especially flourishes in the summer.  Tango in the Park began as a flash mob type thing, said Jim Labbe, organizer of the community group. At first we danced on cement, then began looking for suitable surfaces in Portland, and wed travel there by bike. One that they found is the hardwood boardwalk at Jamison Fountain in the Pearl District, a central landmark that often draws crowds who watch the dancers. Tango in the Park has grown to include a portable dance floor that can be put on top of most surfaces, from a concrete path along the Willamette River to a patch of grass in the abundant parks.

A devotion to tango in Portland is fed by two prime factors: Dancing is affordable and gatherings are easy to reach in this compact, mostly flat city. A milonga is held weekly on Thursdays at Norse Hall, a community center with a ballroom ($10), drawing up to 125 dancers a night. Wednesdays at Norse Hall attract a somewhat younger crowd for an alternative milonga ($8), a modern approach with nontraditional music.

The weekday Guided Practica at Tango Berretin ($8) is regularly full on Wednesday afternoons. Since Alex Krebs, 38, began teaching in 1997, his email list has grown to 1,200 students ranging from age 18 to 80. According to Mr. Krebs, on any weekend in Portland, you could fly in on a Thursday or Friday and dance Argentine tango all weekend long.",[]

SATURDAY PUZZLE  Roland Huget is back, and he says below that he might have filled his puzzle differently these days, compared with how he filled it when it was submitted. Thats reasonable. We all evolve over time. And at least Mr. Huget can claim to be the guy who first introduced BARE IT ALL in The New York Times crossword.

There is some less-than-desirable fill here, like ENOL, TALCUMS and ECH, but there is also some really good fill, like SILENT TREATMENT, ILL BE THERE (I defy you to fill that in without humming), NO SIREE BOB, CRIME SCENE, MENNONITE, PETER FALK, THE HEIRESS (great movie!), ARMWRESTLE, HERE AND NOW and I LOVE L.A. I enjoyed filling in JASMINE, but had never heard of it referred to as the name of a color. I drink JASMINE tea, though and, come to think of it, it is sort of a pale yellow. Live and learn.

There was a lot of good cluing in todays puzzle, but the one that nearly made me do a spit take was 38 Acrosss Bush native to the South, for JEB. It just sits there so quietly, waiting to be discovered, and of all the ways to clue JEB, that misdirection is the last way I would have expected to see it. Very clever.

Lets check in with Mr. Huget:

Constructors Notes

This is my third crossword in The New York Times. From now on, Ill stop keeping count in the constructor notes. The crossword we see before us is actually the third version that was submitted using this grid skeleton. I recall several aborted attempts at this grid before I completed a fill that I felt comfortable in submitting, in the summer of 2013. It was rejected, and from that effort only HERE AND NOW made its way into the final version, although not in the same word slot. The second version was submitted in late 2013, just when I was starting to get the hang of crossword construction. It too was rejected, but the top and bottom stacks and the vertical SILENT TREATMENT got a thumbs-up. The final version, incorporating these elements, was completed in June of 2014, and was accepted for publication in September of that year. Its interesting to revisit an early construction that one hasnt seen in a while. Thankfully, there arent any entries here that make me cringe, but my style definitely has changed since this puzzle was produced. More than I realized, this puzzle is tailored to the over-50 crowd. I hope younger solvers arent put off by that. My favorite clues are 26A: MENNONITE: [One speaking the language Plautdietsch] and 56A: ARM WRESTLE: [Try to win hands down?]. I cant claim credit for either.

nytimes.com,2011-08-12 00:00:00,Saturday: Celebrity Guest Blogger Daniel Okrent,"['Tim Croce', 'Deb Amlen']","Edward Hausner/The New York Times

SATURDAYS PUZZLE  Before anyone accuses me of being a troublemaker, I would like to say that Daniel Okrent is appearing here today as our celebrity guest blogger of his own free will and because he simply loves solving crossword puzzles. His contribution has nothing, and I mean nothing* to do with the fact that TIME Magazine contributor Joel Stein, who appeared here in June (Across Lite, Solution, blog), accused him of being smug or perhaps even too smart for his own good. This is a blog about crossword puzzles, after all, and it would certainly not be appropriate to use this forum to stoke the fires of competitiveness or to provoke two renowned journalists into a public face-off, no matter how much fun I could have doing it.

Still, fair and balanced is fair and balanced, so I asked Mr. Okrent to choose a puzzle to tackle and he graciously agreed to do Tim Croces grid. I have to say that I agree with Mr. Okrents assessment that the puzzle is clever, and in addition to his comments below, I got a kick (sorry) out of 15 Acrosss Trigger-happy NEIGH, as well as the very clever Clay target? clue for Sonny LISTON. Im also not familiar with Saabs, so 9-5, e.g made me think of working hours rather than car models.

Before we turn it over to Mr. Okrent, Im sure you all know that he is the author, most recently, of Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition; his Great Fortune: The Epic of Rockefeller Center was a finalist for the 2004 Pulitzer Prize in history. He was the first public editor of The New York Times, editor at large at Time Inc. and editor of Life Magazine. He finished 22nd in the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament about 10 years ago, and reports that its been all downhill since then. He is also the inventor of Rotisserie League Baseball  one of the first popular forms of fantasy sports  but apologizes to everyone for having done so.

Daniel Okrents Solving Notes

I think Ive been invited to comment on todays puzzle because Joel Stein invoked my name when he was the guest solver a few weeks ago. Joel may be too cool to do crossword puzzles (which, of course, isnt necessarily very cool at all), but his performance - on a Monday, yet!  was nonetheless pathetic. Having my name associated with his in this context is sort of like being a sponsor at the Special Olympics. Except being a sponsor at the Special Olympics is socially worthwhile, and not at all embarrassing. How addicted am I to the Times puzzle? Well, I do it every day  and have done so since the bad old days of Will Weng, and the nearly as bad and nearly as old days of Eugene Maleska. Its been at least 40 years, maybe longer  but in the late 60s I was in college, and the fog of recreational drugs has obliterated all memory of the period. Other evidences? Of course I do it in pen. When I return from an overseas trip, I unpack my bags, make a drink, and before I even open the mail (and sometimes before I even talk to my wife), I sit down to complete every puzzle Ive missed. Worse yet, I have timed myself every day since July of 1992 and keep a record of my times in a filthy, raggedy, possibly even smelly old composition notebook. When Wordplay had its premiere at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament several years ago, and I was shown flipping through the notebook, even this audience  crossword geeks all  audibly gasped. Saturdays, of course, are what we addicts live for (Sunday puzzles are just big Wednesdays.) I usually spend 13 to 18 minutes on a Saturday puzzle, with occasional 11s or 28s. On April 23, 2005, I completed the Saturday puzzle in a record 6:40. This was especially gratifying because I did this at the kitchen table in my brothers house. Larrys also a puzzler, and humiliating him in this fashion after years of his humiliating me at various other competitive endeavors was exceedingly rewarding. Barely a year later, I set another record: on July 16, 2006, the Saturday puzzle took me 63 agonizing minutes. I clocked in at 18:25 on todays puzzle, mostly because of the intransigence of the upper left quadrant. Upper lefts are especially vexing, of course, because more words begin here than anywhere else, and getting the starting letters of an answer is the key to speedy solving. The answer to 2 Down (GET A ROOM) was both very clever and somewhat diabolical, as Get a ride could have conceivably (if less cleverly) been the answer as well. The one that really stumped me was 31 Across. DOTS as the answer to City representatives? didnt make sense to me even as I filled it in; it took me another two or three minutes until I slapped my forehead in sudden comprehension. The other clue that most impressed me was 57 Across (Am or Fm stat); I didnt note the telltale lower-case ms until my second or third time through the clues. The puzzles weakness lies in its over-reliance on prepositional compounds (LISTEN TO, IN MONO, COMES INTO, ROLLED OUT, INTO IT), but I may just be bitter over my worse-than-average performance. My only comfort? Joel Stein could spend a week on this one and not complete it  even if he had the answers right in front of him.

Uh oh.

Since the dawn of time  or at least the dawn of social media  men have been maneuvering themselves and their loved ones into foolish situations to set the stage for jaw-dropping marriage proposals.

Some have taken it to the extreme  lighting themselves on fire, hurling themselves off buildings and staging their own fake deaths  to provide lucky ladies with maximum shock value. But this week, a 24-year-old man from Texas named Vidal Valladares Navas seemed to take it too far.

His offense? Stopping traffic.

Mr. Valladares Navas and a few of his friends got in the way of impatient drivers on Sunday so that he could propose to his girlfriend, Michelle Wycoff, 23. A shaky video of the proposal posted to Ms. Wycoffs Instagram account showed her suitor on bended knee under a cloudy sky, in the middle of Interstate 45, a busy highway that runs through the middle of Houston.

Drivers did not give them more than a few seconds to celebrate. As the ecstatic couple hugged, the blare of car horns could be heard as people in trucks and S.U.V.s began to drive around the couple and their entourage, who were also recording.

Last post but best moment ever and I am so happy, Ms. Wycoff wrote as a caption for the video.

People on the Internet did not entirely share in her joy, instead pointing out that Mr. Valladares Navas had put himself, his friends, his fiancee and everyone on the highway in danger.

The video from the couples social media pages was quickly shared and reposted, often with new headlines: Idiot Shuts Down a Major Highway for Marriage Proposal had more than 800,000 views on YouTube as of Wednesday morning.

The fulminations drew the attention of the authorities. The Houston Police Department did not have officers on the scene quickly enough to arrest the couple, a department spokesman told The Houston Chronicle on Tuesday, adding that the common charge would have been obstructing a highway, a class B misdemeanor under Texas law.

As the backlash grew, the couple did not respond to emails or phone calls from The New York Times for comment but defended themselves to local media outlets.

Im wanting to apologize to everyone if I caused any problems, Mr. Valladares Navas told ABC 13 on Tuesday. That wasnt my intention in the beginning. I just wanted to do something different.

Though his extreme proposal had a happy ending, his apology was apparently not enough. Jeff McShan, a public information officer with the Harris County District Attorneys Office confirmed in an interview that Mr. Valladares Navas would face the charge of obstructing a highway.

Mr. Valladares Navas checked in with a bail bondsman, and was scheduled for a court appearance on Dec. 23, Mr. McShan said.",[]

Its not a put-on. Bob Dylans Shadows in the Night, an album of 10 songs that were all recorded by Frank Sinatra, is a tribute from one venerated American musician to another, a reconsideration of a school of songwriting, a feat of technical nostalgia and a reckoning with love and death.









Mr. Dylan devotes the album to a particular subset of the Sinatra legacy. Its not Sinatra the airborne swinger or Sinatra the voice of confidence. Its the Sinatra who made thematic albums about separation and heartache  albums like Where Are You? in 1957, which included four of the songs Mr. Dylan revives, and No One Cares (1959) and All Alone (1962), which each supply one. They are ballads, mostly Tin Pan Alley standards, sophisticated enough to be utterly succinct. They never move faster than midtempo and they often luxuriate in melancholy; they testify, above all, to loneliness.

Shadows in the Night (Columbia) offers bait for trivia seekers. Sinatra was born in 1915, 100 years ago. The opening track, Im a Fool to Want You, is one of very few songs with a Sinatra songwriting credit. The front cover emulates the vertical-bar design of the jazz trumpeter Freddie Hubbards album Hub-Tones, which was released  like Mr. Dylans debut album  in 1962. The photo on the back poses Mr. Dylan and a masked woman in formal wear at a nightclub table, alluding, perhaps, to the 1966 Black and White Ball, a masked ball that gathered a glittering assortment of 1960s celebrities, including Sinatra and his new wife, Mia Farrow. In the photo, Mr. Dylan holds a Sun Records single, a touch of rock; its title is too grainy to decipher.

But theres no posing in the music. Mr. Dylan brought his touring band to a studio where Sinatra often recorded, Capitol Records Studio B, and he sang the songs with his five-man touring band. They recorded live and listening to one another in the room without headphones; turn the album up too loud and you can hear amplifiers humming as songs begin and end. There was no tuning and there was no fixing, the albums engineer, Al Schmitt, said in an online interview. Everything is what it was.

The arrangements are largely of a piece. The young, suave Sinatra found tragedy and melodrama in these songs, which he often sang as slowly as Mr. Dylan does. But where Sinatra had string orchestras, Mr. Dylan has Donny Herrons pedal-steel guitar, perpetually hovering and gliding, and Tony Garniers bass, often bowed with grave watchfulness. The guitars of Charlie Sexton and Stu Kimball melt into the chords; the drummer George Receli relies on brushes. And for these songs, Mr. Dylan presents yet another changed voice: not the wrathful scrape of his recent albums, but a subdued, sustained tone. Its still ragged; he is 73. But he carefully honors the melodies, even the trickier chromatic ones, and he fully inhabits the lyrics.

Hes not suave; he has seen too much. In Im a Fool to Want You, he begs, Pity me, I need you, knowing full well that hes embracing misery. Autumn Leaves isnt a throwaway jazz exercise but a reflection on solitude and advancing time. Full Moon and Empty Arms, adapted from Rachmaninoffs second piano concerto, becomes a ghostly country shuffle; even as Mr. Dylan sings about wishing for a reunion, his voice knows better than to hope. Mr. Dylan has been performing Stay With Me, sung by Sinatra for the 1963 film The Cardinal, to end his recent concerts; its a humble prayer, and Mr. Dylan sings it on the album with weary repentance.

Not every song thrives under Mr. Dylans treatment. Some Enchanted Evening is stiff, and Why Try to Change Me Now denies the songs humor. But even when it falters, Shadows in the Night maintains its singular mood: lovesick, haunted, suspended between an inconsolable present and all the regrets of the past. JON PARELES

DIANA KRALL

Wallflower

(Verve Records)

Photo

Diana Krall sounds glum and fatigued on Wallflower, a collection of songs mostly from the 70s and 80s associated with the Eagles, Elton John, the Carpenters and others, that sustains a mood of quiet desperation. The muted, wistful tone is established with the opening cut, California Dreamin, the Mamas and the Papas first hit in which Ms. Kralls somnolent delivery suggests a snowbound New Englander longing for brighter days and happier times on a frigid winter evening. It is deepened by her rendition of Desperado, the Eagles ballad comparing a rock stars grueling life on the road to the exhaustion of an aging cowboy reluctant to come in from the range.

The most evocative cut is the Carpenters hit Superstar, the plea to a rock star by a besotted fan to remember her long after their dalliance. As Ms. Krall murmurs Loneliness is such a sad affair, sounding like Peggy Lee in her sultry boudoir mode, those words define an album whose other depictions of unhappy relationships include I Cant Tell You Why, Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word, Dont Dream Its Over, Im Not in Love and Alone Again (Naturally), sung with Michael Buble.

Wallflower was produced and arranged by the megahit maker David Foster, whose lush but static string arrangements, written by William Ross, couch each song on a soft feather bed. Where Ms. Krall usually plays vigorous keyboards on her albums, here her pianism is all but absent. Most of the fills, played by Mr. Foster, are strictly routine. Its all the more mystifying because Ms. Krall, when prodded by a rhythm section, can really swing. But on Wallflower, drums are minimal.

The record, whose title song is an obscure, country-inflected Bob Dylan number, has the feel of a sullen concept album by a woman who feels abandoned. It is tempting to imagine that it reflects the frustrations of her marriage to Elvis Costello. These two great musicians, after all, are driven workhorses who are on the road much of the time on separate tours. Loneliness is such a sad affair. STEPHEN HOLDEN

VIJAY IYER TRIO

Break Stuff (ECM)

Photo

The pianist Vijay Iyer publishes his compositions under the name Multiplicity Music, and that word goes to the heart of his enterprise as an artist. Hes led an important jazz-tradition trio for most of the last decade, but hes also been writing music inspired by other traditions and functions, working with poets and M.C.s and string quartets. He doesnt just improvise, he teaches a class in aesthetic and social theories of improvisation, at Harvard; he makes music that not only intersects different strategies but lingers over the places of intersection.

Hood, from Break Stuff the third and best record by Mr. Iyers trio, and the first on ECM  was inspired by the Detroit techno producer Robert Hood. Its a kind of process piece, an analysis of an intersection, that you could imagine being used as an excerpted interlude on someone elses record. On this one its an event, a centerpiece, amid other blocks of material. Mr. Iyer and the drummer Marcus Gilmore fall in and out of sync, moving in repetitions with different rhythm and tempo; the bassist Stephan Crump negotiates between them in small strokes, subtly connecting. Sometimes Mr. Gilmores playing sounds flexible, and Mr. Iyers sounds rigid; then their playing fuses, or swaps character. Mr. Iyers keyboard sound gradually changes, and his chords gradually change, too, widening and evolving, turning into arpeggiated motion.

The trio makes sense in a physical way, moving together as one unit. And its good how evolved that motion can sound in a piece as strange as Hood, because over the course of the record, the strength of the track takes the heat off Mr. Iyers versions of songs by his heroes (Thelonious Monks Work, Billy Strayhorns Bloodcount, John Coltranes Countdown). Those versions arent formal stunts  least of all the slow, elegant Bloodcount. Theyre just more refined representations of the way Mr. Iyer and his trio perform in real time, with a rhythmic logic and a coordinated bustle of breaks and intersections. Likewise, the albums reduced or evolved sections of two commissioned suites from 2013 dont seem like material from other assignments. The bands refractive language makes sense of whatever material it plays. You dont hear the record and seize on its sense of rupture or argument. Instead, it sounds whole. BEN RATLIFF

MATANA ROBERTS

Coin Coin Chapter Three: river run thee

(Constellation)

Photo

I like to tell stories, Matana Roberts says, with an offhanded frankness, at one point deep into the immersive experience of her new album, Coin Coin Chapter Three: river run thee. Its just one of many scraps of text and sound assembled therein, and far from the most gripping. But that plain-spoken declaration is a key to comprehending Ms. Roberts and the motivations of her art  in particular, Coin Coin, a 12-part cycle of personal, socio-historical and psychic inquisition.

An alto saxophonist and composer originally from Chicago, Ms. Roberts has found oblique but potent uses for narrative throughout her Coin Coin series, in performance and on two albums, released in 2011 and 2013. Working with folklore, family archives, public records and other faded ephemera, shes creating her own patchwork monument to African-American history, a tale of harrowing struggle and brittle stoicism.

Coin Coin Chapter Three is the first installment to feature no musicians other than herself, which puts a stark emphasis on the interiority of the work. Ms. Roberts recorded the album in layers, overdubbing parts in real time: vocal recitations; ribbons of song; keening saxophones; analog synth drones; ambient sampled material. In the notes, she refers to the album as a fever dream of sound, an accurate sensory impression. (Shell perform this material on Tuesday night at Union Pool in Brooklyn.)

Her tone wheels between dispassion and despair, neither side achieving the upper hand. Oh, why do we try so hard? she cries in All Is Written, the opening track. All is written in the cards. Later she reads clinically from the ships log of a 19th-century slave vessel and reflects with eerie calm on the double-crossing of a people. Every sonic element  her voice, her saxophone, the clip of a baby crying  comes woven into a tapestry, with no stable relationship of foreground to background.

One exception comes at the albums finish, with a recording of a speech delivered by Malcolm X on Feb. 14, 1965  the same day that his house had been firebombed, one week before his assassination. I am not a racist in any form whatsoever, he says, his voice fading against a glow of synthesizers, the ending of that story artfully left unsaid. NATE CHINEN",[]

SUNDAY PUZZLE  April of this year marks the 400th anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare, and David J. Kahn is back with a puzzle about some of the Bards characters.

But hark, as the Bard no doubt would have said: What hath happened to our clues? All of the theme entry clues say See blurb. In case you missed it, the blurb is a Notepad that says The answers to 23-, 31-, 45-, 62-, 69-, 90-, 103- and 115-Across are themselves clues to the names spelled by their circled letters. That means that you will have to first solve the puzzle to get the clues, and then you will find the answers to the clue/answers inside the shaded/circled squares. Got that?

Not really? O.K., lets spell it out (sorry). Did you note the puzzles title, In Character? Thats a big hint to the theme. If you can solve 23 Across using the crossings, you get COMRADE OF MERCUTIO, and the shaded/circled letters inside that phrase spell out ROMEO, who was, in fact a COMRADE OF MERCUTIO. The character is in the clue, which is also the answer. Forget it, you guys; its Stratford-upon-Avon.

Here are the rest of them:

31A: BANQUET GHOST / BANQUO

45A: ELDERLY MONARCH / LEAR

62A: SCHEMER AGAINST CAESAR / CASCA

69A: LOVE INTEREST OF OLIVIA / VIOLA

90A: EVIL ANTAGONIST / IAGO

103A: MACABRE THANE / MACBETH

115A: UNHAPPY MALCONTENT / HAMLET

Clue of the Day for me was Italian fine? for BENE, followed by One carrying a toon? for CEL. I thought that 118 Downs answer was N.F.L. for Packers org., and was unpleasantly surprised when it turned out to be N.R.A. Oh well.

Lets hear from Mr. Kahn:

Constructors Notes:

I had just seen Something Rotten!, a very funny Broadway musical, and I was looking to do something to commemorate the upcoming 400th anniversary of Shakespeares death. The theme came to me when I realized that FRIEND OF MERCUTIO (where FRIEND later became COMRADE) included the name ROMEO. Coming up with other answers and getting this puzzle accepted was a struggle. My original submission had a few themed answers Will and Joel felt were either contrived (OPHELIAS COMPLEX SUITOR, anyone?) or hid characters with only four letters in 21-letter answers (e.g., VILLAIN UNDOING OTHELLO). They liked the concept, though, so I focused on shortening the answers and adding some 5-, 6- and 7-letter characters. I stuck to Shakespeares more popular plays and Will/Joel offered a lot of feedback along the way. Finally, deleting SHAKESPEARE as an answer, which I did at the very end, makes for more of an aha moment.

If you would like to join the observance, which is being called Shakespeare400 online, you can start here.

And while were talking iambic pentameter, lets watch Robin Williamss brilliant take on the playwright:

The surprisingly dangerous Caitlin Lovinger will be sitting in for me while Im on vacation. Happy solving, and Ill see you all when I get back.

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Squares Loss Widens in Its First Report as a Public Company,['Mike Isaac'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Square, the mobile payments company, reported a wider loss than it had a year ago and posted a 49 percent revenue increase on Wednesday, in its first earnings report as a public company.

The company, based in San Francisco, reported a loss of $80.5 million, or 34 cents a share, for the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $37.1 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales totaled $374 million.

Excluding a payments processing agreement with Starbucks, which is winding down this year, Square reported adjusted revenue of $135 million. Square also said it processed $10.2 billion in gross payment volume, up 47 percent from a year ago.

We are off to a great start with fourth-quarter results that demonstrate both high growth and strong operating performance, the company said in a statement.

Squares earnings report is being closely watched as a barometer for how its chief executive, Jack Dorsey, is performing. Mr. Dorsey is also chief executive of Twitter, and investors have questioned whether he can juggle both companies at the same time. Twitter is grappling with growth problems, trying to attract more people to its service.

The earnings are also being scrutinized for the greeting that other technology companies might receive if they go public. Squares initial public offering in November on the New York Stock Exchange came in a tumultuous climate for tech offerings. Etsy, the online marketplace, now trades at around $8, a little more than half its offering price last April. Other companies recently taken public, like Box, are also trading well below their stock prices a year ago.

While Square has spent heavily to expand its business over the past few years, investor attitudes are growing more conservative when it comes to the bottom line.

If you look over the past few years at a lot of recent tech I.P.O.s, there was an almost myopic focus on growth, said Josh Beck, a research analyst for Pacific Crest Securities. Weve seen a correction and a different focus in the last year. Now everyone is really looking for a path to profitability.

Shares of Square rose after the company announced its earnings. The company went public at $9 a share.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Master of Go Board Game Is Walloped by Google Computer Program,"['John Markoff', 'Choe Sang-hun']","SEOUL, South Korea  Computer, one. Human, zero.









A Google computer program stunned one of the worlds top players on Wednesday in a round of Go, which is believed to be the most complex board game ever created.

The match  between Google DeepMinds AlphaGo and the South Korean Go master Lee Se-dol was viewed as an important test of how far research into artificial intelligence has come in its quest to create machines smarter than humans.

I am very surprised because I have never thought I would lose, Mr. Lee said at a news conference in Seoul, South Korea. I didnt know that AlphaGo would play such a perfect Go.

Mr. Lee acknowledged defeat after three and a half hours of play.

Demis Hassabis, the founder and chief executive of Googles artificial intelligence team DeepMind, the creator of AlphaGo, called the programs victory a historic moment.

The match, the first of five scheduled through Tuesday, took place at a Seoul hotel amid intense news media attention. Hundreds of reporters, many of them from China, Japan and South Korea, where Go has been played for centuries, were there to cover it. Tens of thousands of people watched the contest live on YouTube.

Go is a two-player game of strategy said to have originated in China 3,000 years ago. Players compete to win more territory by placing black and white stones on a grid measuring 19 squares by 19 squares.

The play is more complex than chess, with a far greater possible sequence of moves, and requires superlative instincts and evaluation skills. Because of that, many researchers believed that mastery of the game by a computer was still a decade away.

Before the match, Mr. Lee said he could win 5-0 or 4-1, predicting that computing power alone could not win a Go match. Victory takes human intuition, something AlphaGo has not yet mastered, he said.

But after reading more about the program he became less upbeat, saying that AlphaGo appeared able to imitate human intuition to a certain degree and predicting that artificial intelligence would eventually surpass humans in Go.

AlphaGo posed Mr. Lee a unique challenge. In a human-versus-human Go match, which typically lasts several hours, the players feel each other and evaluate styles and psychologies, he said.

This time, its like playing the game alone, Mr. Lee said on the eve of the match. There are mistakes humans make because they are humans. If that happens to me, I can lose a match.

To researchers who have been using games as platforms for testing artificial intelligence, Go has remained the great challenge since the I.B.M.-developed supercomputer Deep Blue beat the world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.

Really, the only game left after chess is Go, Mr. Hassabis said on Wednesday.

AlphaGo made news when it routed the three-time European Go champion Fan Hui in October, 5-0.

But Mr. Lee, 33, is one of the worlds most accomplished professional Go players, with 18 international titles under his belt. He has called the European champions level in Go near the top among amateurs.

AlphaGo has become much stronger since its matches with Mr. Fan, its developers said. It challenged Mr. Lee because it was ready to take on someone iconic, a legend of the game, Mr. Hassabis said. Google offered Mr. Lee $1 million if he wins the best-of-five series.

Mr. Hassabis said AlphaGo does not try to consider all the possible moves in a match, as a traditional artificial intelligence machine like Deep Blue does. Rather, it narrows its options based on what it has learned from millions of matches played against itself and in 100,000 Go games available online.

Mr. Hassabis said that a central advantage of AlphaGo was that it will never get tired, and it will not get intimidated either.

Kim Sung-ryong, a South Korean Go master who provided commentary during Wednesdays match, said AlphaGo made a clear mistake early on, but that unlike most human players, it did not lose its cool.

It didnt play Go as a human does, he said. It was a Go match with human emotional elements carved out.

Mr. Lee said he knew he had lost the match after AlphaGo made a move so unexpected and unconventional that he thought it was impossible to make such a move.

Mr. Lee said he now thought his chances for victory in the five-match series were 50-50.

Some computer scientists said Wednesday that they had expected the outcome.

Im not surprised at all, said Fei-Fei Li, a Stanford University computer scientist who is director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. How come we are not surprised that a car runs faster than the fastest human?

On Tuesday, before the match began, Oren Etzioni, the director of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a nonprofit research organization in Seattle, conducted a survey of the members of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

Of 55 scientists, 69 percent believed that the program would win, and 31 percent believed that Mr. Lee would be victorious. Moreover, 60 percent believed that the achievement could be considered a milestone toward building human-level artificial intelligence software.

That question remains one of the most hotly debated within the field of artificial intelligence. Machines have had increasing success in the past half-decade at narrow humanlike capabilities, like understanding speech and vision.

However, the goal of strong A.I.  defined as a machine with an intellectual capability equal to that of a human  remains elusive.

Other artificial-intelligence scientists said that humans might still find refuge if the goal posts for the competition were moved.

I wonder what would happen if they played on a 29 by 29 grid? wondered Rodney Brooks, a pioneering artificial intelligence researcher who is the founder of a robot company, Rethink Robotics. By enlarging the playing space, humans might once again escape the machines computing power.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,A Judges Message to the Xenophobes,['The Editorial Board'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

More than two dozen Republican governors were in a virtual stampede last fall to be first to bar the resettlement of federally approved Syrian refugees in their states. The shameless display of jingoism was prompted by the Paris shooting massacre in November and fears  wildly driven by the Republican presidential rivals  that terrorists could infiltrate the United States as refugees despite a resettlement process that is one of the strictest in the world.

A federal district judge in Indianapolis punctured this fiction last week in blocking the attempt by Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana to cut off federal resettlement funds for Syrian refugees who had passed a vetting process that took up to two years. Mr. Pences order was unconstitutional and clearly discriminates against Syrians compared with other refugees, Judge Tanya Walton Pratt ruled in a suit brought by a nonprofit resettlement agency. The judge found that Mr. Pences move to withhold resettlement funds was in no way justified by his claim that his main concern was the safety of Indiana residents.

The ruling delivered a jolt of reality to the xenophobic politics now inflaming the presidential primary campaign. The state was forced to concede that it does not really have the authority to bar refugees from crossing into Indiana, a concession that no Republican governor was willing to make in the states-rights bombast of last fall. Mr. Pence had simply cut off the funding the refugees were entitled to  a tactic the judge excoriated. This is essentially a policy of punishing Syrian refugees already in Indiana in the hopes that no more will come, she wrote.

Resettlement lawyers said the ruling was the first to address substantively the attempt by some governors, mostly Republicans, to exploit the terrorism issue. The presidential candidates, of course, have been vying furiously to keep up with venomous nativism coming from Donald Trump and from Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who told a conservative radio interviewer that I dont think orphans under 5 are being, you know, should be admitted into the United States at this point.

According to the State Department, 67 percent of the Syrian refugees referred to the United States for asylum are women and children under the age of 12. Mr. Trump has falsely suggested that federal officials steered Syrian refugees to states with Republican governors, when in fact resettlement decisions are made by mainstream social agencies like the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Mr. Trumps claim was one more example of propaganda being used to distort the truth on the refugee issue.

The fact is, the refugee resettlement program in this country involves a cautiously paced investigative process that contrasts sharply with the uncontrollable floods of refugees in Europe that Republican politicians are using to arouse terrorist fears in this country. Over three million people fleeing persecution and war have been investigated and welcomed to the United States in the last four decades. Syrian refugees must be no less welcome.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,Letter of Recommendation: Vanderpump Rules,['Naomi Fry'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

American reality television has a near-pathological focus on success. It makes no difference whether a show documents an actual competition (Survivor) or a milestone refigured as a competition (The Bachelor), or offers some version, however far-fetched, of everyday life (Keeping Up With the Kardashians). The trajectory is the same: relentlessly upward.









Over the last couple of years, however, Ive found an exception to this tendency in the Bravo series Vanderpump Rules. Watching it, especially after a long day at my own job, feels like a tonic for all that ails me. But this isnt only because the show helps me relax and forget. The experience of life that the show exemplifies  a miasmic forever-present where not a whole lot happens and the pressures of achievement appear mostly absent  parallels a utopian, even resistant, impulse in me.

The show is set in the West Hollywood dining establishment SUR (an acronym that stands, amazingly, for Sexy Unique Restaurant) and is a spinoff of another Bravo offering, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, in that a star of that series, Lisa Vanderpump, is one of SURs owners. Though Vanderpumps role as a kind but no-nonsense boss is central to the show, she isnt the protagonist. Instead, the series centers on SURs hard-bodied wait staff, few of whom seem keen on climbing the rungs of the management ladder.

Continue reading the main story The worlds most economically competitive countries, according to the World Economic Forum: 1. Switzerland 2. Singapore 3. United States 4. Germany 5. Netherlands 6. Japan 7. Hong Kong S.A.R. 8. Finland 9. Sweden 10. United Kingdom

Early on in the shows run, its cast members all dreamed big of a life beyond SURs walls. Among these conventionally attractive aspirants was Jax, a leathery bartender-model who wanted to become a sweater designer; his fellow bartender Tom Sandoval, an actor and musician; Kristen, Toms erratic waitress girlfriend, a model and actress; Stassi, another waitress and aspiring stylist; and Scheana, a hostess and performer of club music who has Its all happening tattooed on her forearm. As Kristen explained in the first season, Vanderpump doesnt want us to be lifelong waitresses or bartenders but to kind of use it as a steppingstone to get into whatever it is that we aspire to be.

I really began to think of Vanderpump Rules as a true outlier in the reality-show world, though, when it abandoned the conceit that there should be any trajectory  upward or even downward  to the plot of its characters lives. Four seasons in, while some strong personalities have been added to the mix (among them James, a cunning busboy and D.J., and Lala, a flirty hostess and lingerie model), most of the original cast is still working at SUR. The plot centers almost exclusively on the staffs love lives, the twists of which are mostly carried out, near incestuously, among a closed loop of SUR regulars. Matters of the heart are cyclically worried and fought over during breaks in the alley behind the restaurant, not far from the Dumpsters.

The familiar reality-show arc of development has been traded for a Simpsons-like freezing of time, in which the characters never change or even seem to naturally age. Of course, stasis was a given on television for decades, but in the personal-growth-obsessed universe of reality TV, Vanderpump stands apart. The SUR staff members, with their stardom-primed appearances  their snugly sheathed gym-toned bodies and smooth Botox-injected brows  have been locked in a state of readiness that hasnt yet led to ascent.

You would be correct to point out that the characters lives have, in fact, developed, and that theyre most likely ambitious and success-oriented in a manner that lies outside the shows plotted purview, being that they are now reality-show celebrities who make nightclub appearances and hawk protein supplements and teeth-whitening devices on social media. But this has left no mark where it really counts for the viewer. The series remains a near-pure portrait of motionlessness, a still point in the turning world. Watching it is like having my brain stroked to a very low-grade, consequence-free orgasm  a pleasurable sort of noninvolvement. And I never once have to compare myself unfavorably with the people onscreen.

I moved to America more than a decade ago from Israel and found myself half-seduced and half-flummoxed by the very American fixation on growth and improvement. Seduced because it seemed the law of the land to side with the winners, no matter the circumstances or cost; flummoxed because there appeared something unsustainable, and maybe even slightly fascistic, in this unswerving focus on worldly achievement. Over the years, as Ive nervously jumped my way through a succession of professional and personal hoops, with varying degrees of effort, Ive thought a lot of a moment in Tama Janowitzs 1985 short story Spells, in which the protagonist, Eleanor, is forced to listen to her boyfriend go on glowingly about his overachieving ex-girlfriend. When he pauses, Eleanor responds: I like to rest, myself. Reading it, I remember thinking: Exactly.

Id rather poke out my own eye with a stick than participate in a so-called opting out. But thinking of stasis as one possibility among others  even if just for limited periods of time, even if just in the sense of loosening the hectoring voice in your own head that urges you to always keep marching forward  seems a culturally viable, emotionally necessary option. Vanderpump Rules is like that burnout friend who always urges you to take that smoke break, to have another drink, to call in sick to work. And see, now: Dont you feel better already?",[]

Tuesday nights surprise win in Michigan for Bernie Sanders was a humbling night for political prognosticators.

He had trailed in pre-election polls by around 20 points  a bit less in some polls, a bit more in others. My colleague Nate Cohn has written an excellent post-mortem; Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight declared it to be among the greatest polling error in primary history.

Its worth juxtaposing this with a less-noticed fact: Hillary Clinton beat the (admittedly sparse) polls in Mississippi by an average of 22 points. Those polls had predicted Mrs. Clinton to win, but by a much smaller margin than 66 points. It may be less embarrassing for pollsters when they miss the margin badly but correctly pick the top vote-getter, but when delegates are awarded proportionately, its no less consequential.

Perhaps we shouldnt be surprised: Polling response rates, particularly for robocalls, are down around the single digits. Some pollsters still havent fully adjusted to the fact that landlines are now a historical curiosity in many households.

And as a Michigander  albeit one in living in a liberal college town  I can report that the race may also have been distorted by the #NeverTrump movement, leading some mainstream Democrats to ask for a Republican ballot instead.

Indeed, there was a notable spike within Michigan in Google searches for How to Stop Trump.

But, to be clear, its also a result whose implications can be oversold.

Mrs. Clinton had accumulated a solid delegate lead, and she only increased that lead. As Mr. Cohn has noted, the proportional delegate allocation rules make it very difficult for Mr. Sanders to make up this lead in the remaining races.

For all the breathless commentary Ive seen, I think that the prediction markets basically have it right. They gave Mrs. Clinton a 95 percent chance to win the nomination as of Tuesday morning, and by Wednesday morning, she was at 93 percent.

nytimes.com,2016-03-04 00:00:00,Ask Well: The Best Exercises to Improve Balance,"['Reader Question', 'Http Topics Nytimes Com Topics Reference Timestopics People R Gretchen_reynolds Index Html', 'Gretchen Reynolds']","A

Your options are legion. Tai chi, for instance, with its flowing movements and poses, rapidly builds balance. A study published last year found that older people who completed several weeks of tai chi classes performed much better afterward on a variety of balance tests than they had at the studys start. They also generally performed better than another group of volunteers who had spent those same weeks learning ballroom dancing. But dancing did have benefits; the waltzers and fox-trotters could now close their eyes and stand much more steadily than they could before.

Similarly, yoga generally enhances balance, even among people who enjoy fine bodily equilibrium. In a study published in January, for instance, collegiate male athletes displayed better balance after 10 weeks of yoga classes than a control group of athletes who did not change their routines.

But you also can become less wobbly without attending classes or even leaving your living room. All you need is some space, a table or wall nearby to steady yourself if needed, and a pillow, said Jay Hertel, a professor of sports medicine at the University of Virginia and expert on balance training.

Simply stand near a wall and raise and bend one of your legs. Press that leg against your other leg, stork style. Try not to sway. If you start to topple, steady yourself against the wall. Hold this stance for as long as possible, then switch legs and repeat.

Seem easy? Do it with your eyes closed, or stand on a thick pillow, Dr. Hertel said, which makes the ground unstable. (A wobble board also works, but pillows are cheaper.) It may help, too, to ritualize the practice. Stand on one leg while you brush your teeth, Dr. Hertel suggested, and close your eyes if its too easy. It may sound ridiculous, but if you do that for two or three minutes a day, youre working your balance really well.",[]

Her entrance applause was so loud, and lasted so long, that it must have been difficult to hear the orchestra during her first few steps. After the curtain went down on the last act, she received a 23-minute ovation and enough bouquets to stock a small flower shop. They were tributes to Julie Kent, who danced her farewell performance with American Ballet Theater on Saturday night after 29 years with the company  a final Romeo and Juliet  and stirred strong emotions among fans and fellow dancers. Through social media, the moment reverberated far beyond the Metropolitan Opera House. Heres a sampling of how her fans and colleagues shared the experience on Twitter.

It was not a night when the prohibition on photography was very strictly enforced:

Or video, for that matter:

Excitement began building earlier in the day. David Hallberg, a principal dancer with Ballet Theater and the Bolshoi Ballet, got things going before the performance with a question:

Fans were soon responding with votes for her performances in A Month in the Country, Swan Lake, Manon and Romeo and Juliet, among others.

Even before the curtain went up, colleagues posted tributes:

Once the ballet started, fans gave updates throughout the evening:

Musicians applauded from the orchestra pit. The concertmaster, Benjamin Bowman, reported:

nytimes.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Ask Well: Booster Shots for Grown-Ups,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Reference Timestopics People R Roni_caryn_rabin Index Html', 'Reader Question', 'Roni Caryn Rabin']","Should 20-somethings and older folks be getting boosters for childhood immunizations that may have lost potency? Which ones?

A

By your early 20s, theres a good chance you are due for some boosters, said Dr. Wanda Filer, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. You may also need to play catch-up if youve missed any vaccines or failed to complete a series, she said.

Everyone needs a tetanus and diphtheria booster every 10 years; the shots are often combined. So if you were 12 the last time you had a tetanus shot, youre due for one at 22.

Adults ages 19 to 64 should also get a pertussis, or whooping cough, booster. Pregnant women should be vaccinated against pertussis toward the end of each pregnancy in order to protect their newborns from this disease, which can be devastating for a baby.

If you are not pregnant but may become pregnant, its a good idea to plan ahead and be tested for immunity to two other childhood diseases: rubella and chickenpox. If you do not have evidence of immunity -- and are not pregnant -- you should be vaccinated.

If you were not vaccinated against the human papilloma virus, or HPV, or did not complete the recommended series of three doses, women can complete the series through age 26, and men through age 21, with more leeway for men who have sex with men and those with compromised immune systems, who who may be vaccinated through age 26. The HPV series protects against viruses that cause cervical cancer, head and neck cancers and anal cancer.

Beyond childhood immunizations, flu shots are recommended every year for just about everybody, Dr. Filer said. The shingles vaccine is also recommended for older adults.

You may also want to check whether youve been vaccinated against meningitis, said Dr. Carolyn Bridges, associate director for adult immunizations at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Its a good idea to obtain a record of your vaccinations, she said, and to encourage your physician to input your record into a state vaccine registry.

The above recommendations are for the general population. Additional vaccines may be advised for anyone with a chronic health condition such as a compromised immune system, asthma or diabetes; those who work in the health care field; men who have sex with men; people who travel to certain parts of the world; and adults 60 or older. Talk with your doctor.

You can find out if youre due for shots by taking the C.D.C.s online vaccination quiz, Dr. Bridges suggested. Vaccine recommendations are confusing.""",[]

nytimes.com,2010-12-21 00:00:00,Interview With Will Shortz,['Jim Horne'],"Don Christensen

This is my final interview for Wordplay, and Ive saved the best for last. The name Will Shortz is on every crossword that The New York Times has published since Nov. 21, 1993. He doesnt create them himself. Rather, he relies on a carefully nurtured army of freelance constructors who flood his mailbox with submissions, all competing for that most coveted spot in puzzledom, the crossword page in The Times. Only a fraction make it to print.

Selecting puzzles is only the first step. Sometimes puzzles are returned with suggestions, noting areas of the grid that need to be cleaned up or completely rewritten. Almost always, clues are tweaked or rewritten. Then there is the endless fact-checking and test-solving to oversee. Oh, and table tennis to play, too.

All of this makes Mr. Shortz the most powerful man in puzzles. His personal style, aesthetic, humor and sensibility set the standard for what makes a great crossword in this publication and beyond. I started our conversation by asking about his background.

Q.

Most people enjoy puzzles, but you seem to have made it a lifelong pursuit. When did you first catch the bug? What puzzles did you enjoy when you were growing up?

A.

My favorite kinds of puzzles when I was growing up were ... almost any kind. Word puzzles, math puzzles, you name it. Sam Loyd (1841-1911), the great American puzzle genius, was my childhood hero. I bought his puzzle collections from Dover Books. The works of Henry Ernest Dudeney and Martin Gardner were other favorites. Of course, I solved crosswords. But I was especially interested in offbeat things, such as the novelty word puzzles of Gerald Lynton Kaufman and Puns and Anagrams edited by Margaret Farrar. In the eighth grade, when asked to write a paper on what I wanted to do with my life, I said I wanted to be a professional puzzlemaker. Looking back, I wonder what sort of kid thinks like that? No one else in my family solved puzzles. I picked up the bug entirely on my own.

Q.

You, famously, engineered a unique college degree at Indiana University. How were you able to pull that off?

A.

I.U. has an innovative program called the individualized major program, which was new when I was there. If youre accepted, you can major in absolutely anything. As a kid, Id joked about majoring in puzzles in college, never dreaming that this might be possible. During my sophomore year at I.U. (1971-72), my mom read about the program and encouraged me to investigate. I liked the idea but was cautious. During my junior year, I took one independent study course on puzzles each semester  things I arranged one on one with professors within the regular department framework. One was on 20th-century American word puzzles, through English. The other was on popular mathematical puzzles, through math. These worked out so well that I switched my major from economics to enigmatology in my senior year. Subjects I studied included crossword construction, logic puzzles, math puzzles, anagrams, crossword magazines and the psychology of puzzles. My thesis was on The History of American Word Puzzles Before 1860. For that, I spent literally months in the I.U. library poring over the microform and microfiche of every American magazine, newspaper or almanac published before 1860 that I thought might contain puzzles. I.U. had given me a grant the previous summer to study puzzles at the Library of Congress in Washington, so Id done more research there.

In most individualized program majors, students take a combination of existing courses and tutorials. As I.U. had no courses on puzzles, not surprisingly, every course in my major was independent study. I may have been the only student at I.U. who knew more about his field than any professor!

Q.

What was your path to becoming editor of Games magazine, and what were your goals there?

A.

In the summer of 1974, after graduating from I.U., I worked for Penny Press in Stamford, Conn. Penny was one of maybe a dozen crossword magazine companies then, and it was the only one that offered me a summer job. I had a blast, and I returned there in the summers of 1975 and 1976, between years at the University of Virginia School of Law.

My worry had always been that puzzles wouldnt pay the bills. Thats why I went to law school. My plan was to practice law for 10 years, then retire to do what I really wanted  puzzles. After my first summer at Penny Press, though, I realized that I could make a living as a puzzle editor, not just as a creator. When I graduated from U.Va. in 1977, I skipped the bar exam, never practiced law and never looked back.

Games magazine started in 1977, and I was a charter subscriber, while working for Penny Press full time. When the first issue arrived, my reaction was an intense combination of love and jealousy. This was the quality, fun, wide-ranging puzzle magazine that Id literally dreamed about starting myself. I devoured it.

Early in 1978, I saw a classified ad in The Times for a puzzle-related editorial position. It mentioned quality and innovation, and I supposed it was for Games. The copy didnt say whose ad it was, though, and interested parties were supposed to respond to a blind box number. I thought Id beat the competition by applying for the job personally. So I put on a coat and tie, took the train into New York, walked into Gamess offices on 53rd Street and announced I was there for their position. It turned out the ad was not theirs, and no position was open. The editor, Mike Donner, saw me anyway. We hit it off. I got freelance editing work within a few months and a staff position by the end of the year.

It was a dream job for a young puzzler, and it had a talented staff, which at one time or another included Henry Hook, Mike Shenk, Peter Gordon, Emily Cox/Henry Rathvon and other notables of the modern puzzle world. Whenever Merl Reagle was in town, he stopped by. Games was like a laboratory of innovative puzzle ideas for a new generation of puzzlers. Most of the rules of modern crosswords originated there.

Q.

How soon did you have your eye on the most prestigious job in puzzles, crossword editor of The New York Times? What was the hiring process like? It must have been an exciting time for you.

A.

Being editor of the Times crossword wasnt something I dreamed about, because, frankly, I didnt consider myself educated or cultured enough. I grew up in rural Indiana. The job also felt restrictive. Im interested in all kinds of puzzles, not just crosswords. But when my predecessor at The Times, Eugene T. Maleska, died in 1993, I applied for the job. Im told that three candidates were seriously considered. Jack Rosenthal, the editor of The Times Magazine, interviewed each of us and asked us to submit samples of our work. The first question I was asked was what I would do differently if I were the crossword editor. I said my goal would be to continue the tradition of culture and quality, but I would do several new things: 1) add bylines to the daily puzzles, so the constructors would no longer labor anonymously; 2) reduce crosswordese and obscurity; 3) broaden the cultural references in the crossword to include modern subjects; and 4) encourage young constructors. Whatever I said must have worked.

Q.

I remember very well when you made your debut with a Sunday puzzle that delighted many but set off controversy. You seemed to have been trying to make your mark right away, but not everyone was pleased. What was that time like?

A.

Yes, my first puzzle  a Sunday by Peter Gordon in which solvers were to fill certain squares not with letters but with colors of the rainbow  caused a lot of comment pro and con. (Download that crossword in Across Lite format or view the solution.)

Mainly, I remember my start as being a very stressful time, because all my predecessors were deceased, and none of them could give me advice. Id just bought and moved into my first house, besides. Having devoted my life to puzzles, including being at Games for 15 years and founding/directing the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament since 1978, I thought I knew just about everything there was to know about crosswords. But The Times has a special audience - older, more educated, and more cultured than I was used to.

At the start, I was bombarded with complaints that my puzzles were too easy and that I was dumbing things down. I was getting at least 75 letters a week, all of which The Times expected me to answer personally, which was stressful as well. And I thought, All right, you want hard? Ill show you what hard is! So I went to the other extreme ... and complaints poured in the other way. After about six months, I settled into my eventual routine, in which I created a fairly steep slope of difficulty through the week - easy/medium on Monday (probably easier than the Monday puzzles had ever been) and very hard on Friday and Saturday (harder than theyd ever been). Eventually, most solvers seemed satisfied.

Q.

You get credit for evolving puzzles considerably over your 17 years at The Times. What changes are you most proud of?

A.

Im proud of:



enlivening the puzzle themes with fresh ideas and pushing the boundaries of the crossword form.

greatly lessening the amount of crosswordese and uninteresting obscurity.

introducing in-the-language phrases as puzzle entries and encouraging their use.

broadening the cultural references in both the clues and answers to include modern subjects alongside the old ones.

introducing a variety word puzzle (Split Decisions, Spiral, 3-D Word Hunt, etc.) in the Sunday Magazine rotation, once every six weeks.

in general, including more playfulness and brain-twisting in the puzzles.

Q.

You clearly make a conscious effort to keep puzzles fresh and, in particular, you foster new constructor talent and encourage innovation beyond the standard formats. How do you strike the right balance?

A.

I try to include something for everyone. Probably nobody will like every Times puzzle I edit, but I hope everyone likes enough of the puzzles to keep coming back. If, for example, several wacky Thursday puzzles appear in a row, chances are the next few will be more straightforward. And vice versa.

As for the constructors, I try to include as broad a range of talent as possible. In the whole history of the Times crossword up to me (1942-93), only three teenagers are known to have been published. Ive published 23 teenagers in just 17 years. At the other extreme, Bernice Gordon is still going strong at age 97, and Mel Taub is continuing his 50-plus-year Times tradition of Puns and Anagrams.

Q.

Thats remarkable. Youre a big name in conventions and tournaments as well. Youre involved with the National Puzzlers League, your American Crossword Puzzle Tournament has become a huge success and you founded the World Puzzle Championship. Why are these important to you?

A.

If one theme runs through my career, it is my effort to bring people together and touch peoples lives through puzzles. All the above activities  as well as my weekly NPR puzzle  further this purpose.

Q.

I like that. Thanks so much, Will, for agreeing to chat with me. One final question: The world is changing and more people get both their news and their entertainment online. Have you had to adapt how you think about your product in a changing market? What is the future of crosswords and other puzzles?

A.

In my opinion, crosswords and most pencil puzzles are better suited for print than online, so I think the popularity of crosswords will decline a little when print dies. But they will always be with us. Im told that more than 50,000 people are currently subscribed to the Timess crosswords online, which is a testament both to the quality of the puzzles as well as to the enduring appeal of the form.",[]

INDOORS: The multilevel 2007 house was designed by Glenn Vogel, a sculptor and architectural metal fabricator who runs a wine-rack fabrication business called De Botello Wine Systems. Inspired by mining structures in California and Colorado, the exterior is corrugated Cor-Ten steel, with walls of glass facing Mount Evans in the Front Range.

The interior has an open, industrial ambience, with hydronically heated concrete floors, corrugated metal ceilings and exposed metal beams throughout. The front doors open to a foyer with a 26-foot ceiling and a water feature made of descending copper bowls. Eight 400-gallon Cor-Ten planters hold tropical plants. Stairs lead up to the main-level great room, a 2,000-square-foot space with a 28-foot ceiling from which copper and aluminum lanterns are suspended by metal cables, all designed by Mr. Vogel.

The living area has a fireplace with a copper surround and two old chairlift seats bolted to the ceiling that rock back and forth. The kitchen has a granite bar with seating for 12. The dining area is a few steps away. Surfaces and cabinets in the kitchen are either stainless steel or copper, while appliances include a heavy-duty Imperial range and a GE Monogram refrigerator and freezer. Glass doors throughout the main level open to a wraparound concrete patio on the grade of the land.

The upstairs master suite and gym are reached by a curving staircase and connected by a steel-grate walkway over the great room. A two-sided fireplace in the bedroom separates the sleeping area from a jetted tub; a hand-carved wall of frosted glass slides away to open the suite to the great room below. The bedroom also opens to a private deck. The picture windows in the gym face the Front Range. Another staircase on the main level leads to the other three bedrooms, as well as a family room and office.

The studio is detached, and has its own deck. The property also has a three-car attached garage.

OUTDOOR SPACE: The house is on an acre. The concrete patio off the main level has an outdoor kitchen with a granite bar, a 48-inch grill, a Garland range and oven, stainless-steel counter space and a sink. Also on the property is a small granite amphitheater with a wood-burning fire pit. The house is framed by large granite outcroppings, jutting out of the ground.

HOW MUCH: $1,795,000, fully furnished

SIZE: 2,980 square feet

PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT: $602

SETTING: Coral Gables is a coastal city of about 50,000 people, just south of Miami. This house is in Chinese Village, one of a handful of themed neighborhoods designed during the 1920s to add architectural diversity to the citys predominantly Mediterranean palette. The village was designed by Henry Murphy, an architect and scholar who worked in both the United States and China, including for Chiang Kai-shek on a modern capital for China in Nanjing. The eight houses are linked by a shared wall with ornamental gates, creating the ambience of a compound. Downtown Coral Gables is about two miles away; downtown Miami five miles; and Miami Beach about 15 miles.

INDOORS: The house was built in 1926 and updated within the last two years. Renovations were done in part by Alicia Kossick, who runs a store called the Polished Coconut in nearby Coconut Grove. Most of the furniture in the house comes from the store, which specializes in handcrafted goods made by women.

The two-story house is set back from the street, behind a 10-foot wall and courtyard. Almost all of Mr. Murphys original designs, including circular moon gates marking transitions between the front and side courtyards, a roof with Ludowici tiles, and second-story balustrades with ornately interlocking beams, have been maintained or replicated by the current owner.

The entryway, on the side of the structure, opens to a living room with intersecting walls of leaded-glass doors opening to the backyard. Similar doors in the dining room open to the front courtyard. The kitchen has been updated with a Sub-Zero refrigerator, a Miele dishwasher and a Viking range. Where possible, the original octagonal white tiles were kept in the bathroom floors.

Two bedrooms are on the main floor; the other three, including the master, are upstairs. The master bedroom is a large suite with a walk-in closet and an en-suite bathroom. It has two Juliet balconies. The upstairs hallway has three sets of doors opening to an outdoor walkway along the side of the house, leading to an upstairs terrace. The property has a two-car garage.

OUTDOOR SPACE: The house is on a fifth of an acre, walled and gated, with a landscaped yard.

Fashion Month comes to an end today in Paris, and weve seen plenty of trends on the runways: from extra-warm shearling and new plays on puffer coats to reimagined check and leopard patterns, plus deliciously goth black velvet and lace.

We heard some trends, too: most notably, gleeful throwbacks to the late 70s and 80s. Throughout the shows in New York, London, Milan and Paris, designers dialed back the soundtracks by three decades, from the drama-fueled synth pop of the Pet Shop Boys Left to My Own Devices (at Philosophy di Alberta Ferretti) to Rick Jamess funky Mary Jane at Brandon Maxwell to Madonnas Oh Father at Hood By Air and the MJ classic Dont Stop Til You Get Enough at Tommy Hilfiger.

But the undisputed king of the fall/winter season was David Bowie: Multiple shows paid tribute to the late singer, on models hands, on jackets and on their soundtracks. A sampling: Brandon Maxwell played Under Pressure, his collaboration with Queen, BCBG Max Azria played a remix of Lets Dance and Donatella Versace closed out her show with Ground Control to Major Tom.

Even before revelations that the Fox Sports reporter Erin Andrews was secretly videotaped naked by a stalker in a hotel room in 2008, female sportscasters have understood how frightening obsessed fans can be.









Andrea Kremer recalled being in a hotel room while she was at NFL Films in 1988 when a man called late at night as she was falling asleep.

He started saying all these things he wanted to do to me, and it scared the living hell out of me, Kremer, who is now with NFL Network and HBO Sports, said. I hung up, called downstairs, and said: I got a really threatening call. Can you trace it? They said it was coming from inside the hotel. Then he called back  it was so chilling and terrifying. I was shaking. My heart was beating fast.

After another call to the front desk, she said, the hotel stationed a security guard outside her door.

I told the men on my crew, and they were livid, she said. They said: Why didnt you call us? We would have slept on the floor.

In an age of round-the-clock sports broadcasting and the widespread dissemination of their work across social media, female sportscasters have unparalleled reach. There are more of them now than ever, across multiple channels and websites.

But the flip side can be unwanted attention from an audience that is male dominated, from stalkers or even from self-described fans who recognize them and simply get uncomfortably close.

Female newscasters and celebrities have long faced such harassment and threats  one newscaster in St. Louis two years ago said she had to quit her job under repeated threats from a stalker  but some sportscasters work in potentially vulnerable and highly visible places like stadiums and arenas where they are in close proximity to passionate fans, many of them males.

They routinely take precautions like asking hotel clerks not to say their name loudly when checking in, refusing to step in elevators if they see glaring male eyes, and opting for private transportation in late hours, to avoid the flock of people who often gather outside studios, innocently or not. Some check to make sure the hotel door peephole has not been tampered with, as it was in Andrewss case.

In one of the most disturbing episodes faced by a female sportscaster, a determined fan named Michael David Barrett used a hacksaw to alter the peepholes of Andrewss hotel rooms in Nashville and Columbus, Ohio. Jurors on Monday found Barrett and the companies that manage the Nashville Marriott responsible for invading Andrewss privacy and awarded her $55 million in damages.

Jessica Mendoza, an analyst on ESPNs Sunday Night Baseball, said that what happened to Andrews made her wonder about taking more than minor precautions like closing the blinds in hotel rooms.

You think about all the times youre in a room  and how scary that someone could see me in there, she said.

But even less egregious encounters can leave female sportscasters unsettled and almost always on guard.

Ill try to avoid ever being in the hall of a hotel by myself, Kim Jones, a reporter for NFL Network, said. And Ill allow whoever is behind me to pass me before I put my card or key in the door. You have to be so aware because unfortunately that one time out of 10,000 something can happen.

Alyssa Roenigk, a reporter for ESPNs magazine who also appears on ESPN television, primarily covering action sports like the X Games, said she rarely gave her security much thought. For years, she usually walked from venues to her hotel, even late at night. But as she began to do more television, and was recognized more often, she was told by her bosses to start taking the courtesy car provided by the network.

At first I thought I was getting special treatment, and I dont want special treatment, Roenigk said. Its not special treatment. Its being safe.

Jamie Little of Fox Sports, who primarily covers Nascar and other motor sports, said: Just last week, I got on an elevator and there were some race fans in there, and they were drinking and it made me a little nervous. And they were kind of watching what floor I was going to, so I pressed the wrong floor. So I go to the wrong floor, get off the elevator, wait for them to go and get back on.

In another instance, she said, she was on an airport shuttle on her way to pick up a rental car when a man approached her. She is still not sure if he was an ardent fan, or something else.

This guy turns right into me and says, Hey, Jamie, so you going to so-and-so today? I was like, Whoa, hey, well, Im here for Nascar,  she recalled. And he kept trying to make small talk. I went down another escalator, and when I looked over, he was literally standing there staring at me, on his phone.

That kind of stuff makes you worry, she continued. You want to give people the benefit of the doubt. Yeah, Im on TV, its not a big deal. But you have to watch the mannerisms, the body language, the constant following you as they try to ask questions. I tend to be overly nice to people. When weird things happen, I honestly kind of forget about it because its your job and Ive got to get on a plane the next week.

Laura Okmin, a sideline reporter for N.F.L. games on Fox, dealt with a stalker in the mid-1990s when she was working at a TV station in Chattanooga, Tenn. The man became angry when she did not respond to letters he sent her and gifts he dropped off for her. Eventually, police officers escorted her home several times and security was provided at events that she covered. Later, a man kept calling her at every hotel she checked into.

She uses these experiences at seminars she holds for aspiring female sportscasters at her company, Galvanize.

I tell them that sometimes someone will be lovely and pay you a great compliment, but if you dont respond the right way in person or on social media, they turn angry and belligerent, she said. Nowadays, it can be 24/7 with all the ways they can come at you.

After the jury award, Andrews was thankful for the encouragement she said she had received from other victims of harassment, and she suggested the cases outcome would improve safety.

Ive been honored by all the support from victims around the world, she said on Twitter. Their outreach has helped me be able to stand up and hold accountable those whose job it is to protect everyones safety, security and privacy.",[]

She joined the papers staff in January of last year after graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she was named College Photographer of the Year in a separate national competition associated with POYi.

Todd Heisler of The New York Times placed second in the Newspaper Photographer of the Year category and Alon Skuy of The Times in Johannesburg took third.

Paolo Marchetti, an Italian freelance photographer represented by Getty Images, was named Photographer of the Year, with Espen Rasmussen of the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang taking second and Chip Somodevilla of Getty images third.

The New York Times was named Best Publication by POYi, which is a program of the University of Missouri School of Journalism. The Times also won first place in the Newspaper Visual Editing category as well as 14 other awards. Mr. Heisler took first place for Sports Picture Story for Hardwood, a look at a New York City high school basketball team. Joshua Z. Weinstein received the top award in Multimedia Feature Story for a Times Op-Doc video, Holocaust Survivor Band.

In news photography contests, the top-prize winners are most often entrants who travel far from their homes to cover dramatic events. Those doing strong work in their own communities, unless they live in a war zone, are more likely to be passed by.

This year, the Pictures of the Year International competition tried to alter that dynamic by tweaking its two divisions. The open category, which Mr. Marchetti, 41, won, continues to be for all photographers working anywhere in the world. But the newspaper categories are now focused on those working in their local areas. This does not prohibit newspaper photographers from entering the open categories if they traveled outside their region.

There are so many important local stories and issues that often get overshadowed in competitions by the big global news events, said Rick Shaw, director of POYi. We wanted to recognize great photo stories produced in photographers own backyards.

Ms. Van Houten, 25, said that there are stories everywhere, though they may sometimes be more subtle or harder to find.

National Geographic won the Angus MacDougall Overall Excellence in Editing Award as well as the Documentary Project of the Year for its environmental issue Cool It.

The Timess sports photo editors Becky Lebowitz Hanger and Jeffrey Furticella received first and second places as well as an award of excellence in the Print Feature Story Editing.

Andrew Ellis of MediaStorm was named the Multimedia Photographer of the Year. Second place went to Katie Falkenberg of The Los Angeles Times and third to Jonah M. Kessel, a video journalist for The New York Times who was also was cited in two other categories.

Al Bello of Getty Images was named Sports Photographer of the Year. Hossein Fatemi took the World Understanding Award for An Iranian Journey, which was first published on Lens. Casper Dalhoff received the Community Awareness Award for A Commitment to Life. The Environmental Vision Award went to Brent Stirton of Getty Images for Ivory Wars, while Stephen Dupont received the Best Photography Book Award for Generation AK.

Yunghi Kim took first place in the General News category for a photo of the funeral of Freddie Gray, a black man from Baltimore whose death from an injury suffered in police custody set off nationwide protests.

Robin Hammond took first place in Portrait Series for his images of L.G.B.T. people living in countries where homosexuality is illegal. The series was featured on Lens last September. Mark Peterson took first for his political photos in the News Picture Story category and Gabriella Demczuk took third for work made on assignment for The Times. Ms. Demczuk also received special recognition from the judges in the Community Awareness category. Bryan Denton, a freelancer for The New York Times, received third place in the Feature category.

The Times also took first in the Online News and Issues Story Editing category for Walking in Wars Path, with photographs by Tomas Munita, text by Jodi Rudoren and Isabel Kershner and produced by David Furst, Jon Huang and Sergio Pecanha. The Times also placed third in the category with Josh Haners Greenland Is Melting Away, produced with Coral Davenport, Larry Buchanan and Derek Watkins.

Mr. Furst, The Timess international photo editor, was also part of a team that placed second in the Online Feature Story Editing category for David Guttenfelders Illuminating North Korea. It was produced by Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Douglas Schorzman, Rumsey Taylor and Mr. Furst.

In Multimedia News Story, Francesco Zizola of Noor placed first and Samantha Stark of The Times took second for How a Love Story Triumphed in Court. Is Nadia Sussman received an honorable mention for The Times for In Rio, Pacification Without Peace.

A Syrian freelance photographer covering his countrys conflict for Agence France-Presse won first place for Spot News and an award of excellence for News Picture Story. The same photographer took second in the World Press Photo contests General News category this year. Although AFP sends out the photographs under the name Abd Doumany, it is a pseudonym.

When asked about the use of pseudonyms last week, Francis Kohn, AFPs photo director, confirmed that Abd Doumany was not the photographers real name. He said that local Syrian photographers and their families might be in danger if their actual names were published.

We thought it was fine for these guys, he said. They chose their own names. And we agreed to that. We have a policy that we use real names, but in some really extraordinary circumstances we agree to use other names. The alternative would be to just use stringer, which we do sometimes.

Photo

The New York Times does not use pseudonyms in credits to avoid the risk of misleading readers, but will omit photographers real name if they might be in danger. The Times has previously published AFP photos using the credit Abd Doumany both online and in print without knowing it was a pseudonym. The Times has also published AFP photographs credited to Sameer Al-Doumy, another name that Mr. Kohn confirmed was a pseudonym.

Until he was contacted by Lens today, Mr. Shaw, of POYi, said he was not aware that Abd Doumany was a pseudonym.

We understand that there are situations that we would not want to put somebody in jeopardy, Mr. Shaw said. I think its acceptable under certain circumstances that Anonymous or a pseudonym can be used as a credit, as long as we can be transparent and divulge that to our audiences.

Mr. Shaw also said that he would contact AFP and ask for a clarification, which would be added to the list of winners.

My heart is with the photographers in the trenches working in conflict, he said. I want to do the right thing so they can continue to bring the images of conflict that we need to see.

Admission fees, normally $18 for adults and $12 for children, seniors and students, will be waived from 7 pm on April 15 through closing on April 17.

We have four terrific exhibitions on view, live classical music and jazz, and a variety of programming throughout the museum, Colin Bailey, the Morgans director, said in an email. I can think of no better way of marking this milestone than by sharing it with the people of New York.

Ten years ago, an expansion designed by the architect Renzo Piano added 75,000 square feet to the Morgans existing campus. A new, modern steel-and-glass entrance on Madison Avenue took the place of the smaller, more old-fashioned entrance to the museums original Gilded Age building around the corner on East 36th Street. Until then, the institution had been known simply as the Morgan Library.

LONDON  Buckingham Palace said on Wednesday that it had filed a formal complaint against The Sun, Britains biggest tabloid, after the newspaper reported that Queen Elizabeth II supported the countrys departure from the European Union.









A referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union will take place on June 23. It is a major test for Prime Minister David Cameron, who in 2013 promised a vote on the issue. After recently securing concessions from Brussels to reflect Britains special status in the European Union, he is calling on Britons to vote to remain in the 28-nation bloc.

The Sun, citing anonymous sources, reported on Tuesday that the queen had made her skepticism of the European Union known during a lunch at Windsor Castle with Nick Clegg, who was the deputy prime minister under the previous government, and at a reception at Buckingham Palace with members of Parliament. The newspaper did not provide dates or any other details of the two occasions.

A spokeswoman for the royal family denied the report.

The queen remains politically neutral, as she has for 63 years, the spokeswoman said Tuesday evening, speaking on the condition of anonymity under palace rules. We will not comment on spurious, anonymously sourced claims. The referendum is a matter for the British people to decide.

In a statement on Wednesday, the spokeswoman added, I can confirm that we have this morning written to the chairman of the Independent Press Standards Organization to register a complaint about the front-page story in todays Sun newspaper.

The organization, which was founded in 2014, is the independent news media regulator in Britain. It has the power to compel members to publish corrections, and, in cases where failings are particularly serious and systemic, it can impose financial penalties.

The spokeswoman for the royal household said the complaint, the first the monarchy has made with the new regulator, was filed under Clause 1 of the Editors Code of Practice, which states: The press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text.

The Sun stood by its article. Its political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, was quoted by the BBC as saying that its information came from two different and impeccably placed sources. On Twitter, Mr. Clegg called The Suns article nonsense. He said that he had no recollection of this happening, and that it was not the sort of thing I would forget.

The palaces decision to file a complaint is unusual. In 1999 and 2012, the royal household opened cases with the Press Complaints Commission, the predecessor to the Independent Press Standards Organization, after embarrassing images of members of the royal family were circulated online.

The queen, who acceded to the throne in 1952 and in September became the longest-reigning British monarch, is expected to stay out of politics under Britains unwritten Constitution.

However, there are occasional glimpses into her personal views.

In September 2014, before a referendum on whether Scotland should leave the United Kingdom, she told a well-wisher in Scotland that she hoped people will think very carefully about the future, a remark that was interpreted as suggesting that she opposed Scottish independence.

Last month, the queens grandson Prince William, who is second in line to the throne, after Prince Charles, was seen as supporting staying in the European Union when he said at a speech in London, For centuries, Britain has been an outward-looking nation, and added: We have a long, proud tradition of seeking out allies and partners.

In both instances, the royal household denied that the monarchy was taking a political stance.",[]

Tilikum, the orca whose killing of a trainer at a SeaWorld park in Orlando became the focus of the documentary Blackfish, has been found to have a respiratory disease that could likely end in death, his caretakers said.

According to a statement by SeaWorld, the killer whale, known to his caretakers as Tili, has been in captivity since 1983, and is estimated to be around 35 years old.

In an accompanying video, Tilikums veterinarian, Dr. Scott Gearhart, said that the bacteria found in the orcas lungs is found also in wild marine animals, and that theres no doubt in my mind that care at SeaWorld prolonged his life.

I wish I could say I was tremendously optimistic about Tilikum and his future, Dr. Gearhart said, but he has a disease which is chronic and progressive, and at some point might cause his death.

As Tilikum grows more lethargic, workers at SeaWorld have also been struggling to keep his teeth, which have been damaged for years, free of bacteria. (A 2010 report by Outside Online said that Tilikum had developed a habit of chewing on metal pool gates during his time in captivity at a park in Canada, before he was moved to SeaWorld in 1992.)

Tilikum, a whale that has been involved in the deaths of three people, has been central to the scrutiny SeaWorld has faced since February 2010, when the 12,000 bull orca bit down on the ponytail of Dawn Brancheau, a 40-year-old trainer, before dragging her underwater and killing her. The whale has also been involved in the deaths of two other people: Keltie Byrne, a 21-year-old student and part-time trainer who slipped into a pool containing Tilikum and two other orcas in 1991, and Daniel P. Dukes, a 27-year-old man who slipped into SeaWorld after hours in 1999. He was found dead, draped over Tilikums back.

After Ms. Brancheaus death, SeaWorld conducted an extensive review that resulted in trainers further isolating themselves from the animals for safety. But Tilikums problematic history has made him a unique case.

Tilikum is basically psychotic, the marine biologist Ken Balcomb told Outside Online in 2010. He has been maintained in a situation where I think he is psychologically unrecoverable in terms of being a wild whale.

In 2013, the scrutiny returned, and intensified, when the documentary Blackfish probed the death of Ms. Brancheau by examining the mental state of whales that are taken from their pods in the wild and raised at marine parks. The film essentially makes the point that whales, which are perceptive and highly intelligent animals, suffer mental and physical harm after they are plucked from the wild.

Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox. Monday  Friday.

SeaWorld has been aggressive in its rebuttal of the films accusations, but the company continues to deal with claims that trainers are improperly trained, and is combating scrutiny over breeding whales in captivity. In October, California banned the breeding of captive whales, and a month later, SeaWorld San Diego said that it would phase out its killer whale performances.

Animal rights activists have now seized upon SeaWorlds announcement about Tilikums health. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals posted a series of messages to Twitter, blaming the water park for isolating Tilikum and subjecting the whale to emotional stress over a period of decades, causing him to succumb to mental illness resulting in aggression and now to some incurable illness.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,The Politics of the Hoodie,['Troy Patterson'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

On a recent night, shopping online for a light jacket or a cotton sweater  some kind of outerwear to guard my body against a springlike breeze  I clicked on the new arrivals page of the website of a popular retailer and encountered, unexpectedly, another instance of the complex oddity of race. Here, projecting catalog-model cordiality in the sterile space of an off-white backdrop, was a young black man in a hoodie.









On the street, a black guy in a hoodie is just another of the many millions of men and boys dressed in the practical gear of an easygoing era. Or he should be. This is less an analysis than a wish. The electric charge of the isolated image  which provokes a flinch away from thought, a desire to evade the issue by moving on to check the sizing guide  attests to a consciousness of the hoodies recent history of peculiar reception. In a cardigan or a crew neck, this model is just another model. In the hoodie, he is a folk demon and a scapegoat, a political symbol and a moving target, and the system of signs that weighs this upon him does not make special distinctions for an Italian cashmere hoodie timelessly designed in heather gray.

Watching Beyonces recent video for Formation, with its set piece showing a black child in a hooded sweatshirt disarming a rank of riot police with his dance moves, most Americans grasped the outfit as a rhetorical device serving a dreamlike declaration about protest and civil rights. During the N.F.L. playoffs, football fans saw the quarterback Cam Newton, the locus of a running dialogue about blackness, wear hoodies to interviews, and they read tweets that called him a thug for it. The boxing movie Creed,  starring Michael B. Jordan opposite Sylvester Stallone, who made the hoodie a fixture in Rocky (1976)  features rousing scenes of Jordan jogging across Philadelphia in a gray hoodie. The transfer of the garment from the old white champ to the young black contender plays as an echo of the films broader racial politics.

At the computer, prodded out of the rhythm of browsing, I tried to imagine the meetings that led to this catalog model being placed in this hoodie, in the vacuum of commercial space. Beyond the usual earnest discussion of the styling of his pushed-up sleeves and the asymmetrical dangle of his drawstrings, there had to have been delicate conversations, informed by H.R. policy and P.C. etiquette, straightforward aesthetic concerns and knotty social ones. It is impossible that the production designers were ignorant of the ghost of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed 17-year-old fatally shot four years ago while wearing much the same thing. Did the model present a distraction from the reality on the streets? Did the art director start feeling somehow guilty for even considering such a question? The choice to put the kid in the picture must count as a modest political act, given the rich absurdity of the codes pertaining to a harmless piece of clothing.

The hooded sweatshirt emerged as a pop political object after decades of mundane hard work. In the 1930s, the company now known as Champion Athletic Apparel began turning them out to keep football players warm on the sidelines, also attracting business from men who operated backhoes and cherry pickers and forklifts  the forefathers of style for the guys who top their hoods with hard hats turned backward.

But the hoodie did not warrant enough consideration to earn its diminutive nickname until after it was processed by B-boys, graffiti artists and break dancers in the 80s. Youth culture did the work of tugging it from the sphere of sportswear, where clothing exists to enhance performance, into the world of street wear, where clothing is performance in itself. By the 1990 release of the video for Mama Said Knock You Out, with LL Cool J styled as a boxer in his corner, his lips visible beneath a hood that shielded his eyes, the hoodie had accomplished its transformation into an element of style.

Continue reading the main story Slide Show

Like their peers in the suburbs, bundled up on BMX bikes or skateboarding in sweatshirts with the logo of Thrasher magazine, a generation of hip-hop kids found the hoodie suitable for the important adolescent work of taking up space and dramatizing the self. There was and is a theater of the hood: pulling it up with a flourish, tugging it down to settle in its energetic slouch. The hood frames a dirty look, obscures acne and anxiety, masks headphones in study hall, makes a cone of solitude that will suffice for an autonomous realm. And if, in its antisurveillance capacity, the hood plays with the visual rhetoric of menace, it is heir to a tradition in teen dressing stretching back to the birth of the teenager, when he arrived fully formed in leather jacket and bluejeans. The cover of the Wu-Tang Clans first album catches the mood: Members of the group wear black hoodies and white masks, as if to abduct the listener into a fantasy of ninja stealth.

But this was just a prologue to an era in which the hoodie became at once an anodyne style object and a subject of moral panic, its popularity and its selective stigmatization rising in proportion. A glance at almost any police blotter, or a recollection of the forensic sketch of the Unabomber, will confirm the hoodie as a wardrobe staple of the criminal class, and this makes it uniquely convenient as a proxy for racial profiling or any other exercise of enmity. The person itching to confirm a general bias against hip-hop kids or crusty punks imputes crooked character to the clothing itself.

Which brings you to the transcript of the 911 call made by Trayvon Martins killer. Dispatcher: Did you see what he was wearing? George Zimmerman: Yeah. A dark hoodie, like a gray hoodie. Trivial details can bear serious import. Surely there would have been demonstrations after the killing and the killers acquittal regardless of what the victim wore. As it happened, those demonstrators  legislators on chamber floors, marchers in the street  picked up the sweatshirt as an emblem, donning hoods in solidarity. Instantly a symbol aggrieved at having to be one, the hoodie was jolted into a curious space: Where the basic hoodie means to defend against the elements, the protest hoodie seeks to offend the right people. In the paranoid view of stodgy shopkeepers, the hoodie is to be feared for extinguishing individuality; in its politicized life, it mutes identity to signal alliance, not unlike a resistance groups uniform.

All that potential subtext is attached to a generally evocative item of clothing. The white working-class hoodie still glows with the Rocky Balboa ideal of grit and tenacity. The yoga-class hoodie is sold on a promise of snuggly virtue that may explain why in Saskatchewan they call the thing a bunny hug. The tech-sector hoodie made default by Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg carries on the garments proud juvenile tradition of informality and defiance. Once perceived as an affront to professionalism, it has since settled in as a convention.

In January, there emerged a debate in the business press regarding the rituals of dress in the tech industry and their relationship to the fields hospitableness to women. The argument proceeded in an article on Quartz headlined The Subtle Sexism of Hoodies and in counterarguments suggesting, for instance, that hoodies represent a rejection of old ideas and an openness to new ones. I was struck by the ready acceptance of the notion that a Silicon Valley hoodie was not just a prerequisite in its field, like Gucci loafers on Wall Street, but also a costume of dominance. Its visual strength abets its powers as a cultural marker, needing just a nudge to create its own contexts.

You must have seen a sitcom or TV commercial in which black actors wear hoodies in new millennial colors  mustard, maroon  to portray coders. In a current General Electric ad, for example, the costume functions as characterization, and the cheery color of the cotton somehow trumps that of the skin in terms of mass iconography. But the ascent of casual wear does not quite disguise the unchanging strictness of social codes, and the hood continues to frame matters of class and race in ways that tend to satisfy the interest of power. The lingering question of the hoodie is simply: Who enjoys the right to wear one without challenge?",[]

The Public Art Fund, which in recent years has looked far outside its New York City base for artists and projects, announced Tuesday that it had enlisted Adrian Cheng, a prominent Chinese collector and the scion of a multibillion-dollar retailing empire, to join its board.

Mr. Cheng, 36, has become more visible in the international art world in recent years through the development of an unusual business-meets-nonprofit model in China for promoting shopping and fine art at the same time. Mr. Chengs K11 Art Foundation, a nonprofit, works with his familys business to organize museumlike exhibitions (a sizable Monet show last year in Shanghai) and displays of contemporary art in the familys high-end malls. Such arrangements, which are becoming more popular among retailers in Asia, were once common in the West, though their history is now little remembered. (Michael Kimmelman, writing in The New York Times about that history in 1995, noted that the first Cubist art show in America took place at Gimbels in Pittsburgh in 1913, at a time when department stores sought to elevate the taste of their patrons and you were more likely to find high culture at A.T.

In a telephone interview from Seoul, where he was traveling, Mr. Cheng said he was interested in joining the Public Art Funds board  his first presence as a trustee for an art institution in New York  because he sees his foundations mission as fostering greater awareness of contemporary art in China, where public art institutions have often lagged. Its all about art for the masses, said Mr. Cheng, who was educated at Harvard and owns an apartment in Manhattan. So the Public Art Fund actually matches our mission.

Nicholas Baume, the Public Art Funds director and chief curator, said that as the fund became more globally engaged it was interested in a patron with a really key position in Asia.

NBCs The Carmichael Show has a simple message: America, we need to talk.









Returning after a six-episode tryout late last summer, this family sitcom starring the standup comic Jerrod Carmichael has a lot to say  about topics from guns to race to the downfall of Bill Cosby. There are more inventive sitcoms, more visually artful ones. But few are as devoted to the bracing power of strong voices in a room, talking.

Running Sunday nights on NBC (with a preview on Wednesday), The Carmichael Show is built on the barest of premises. Jerrod (Mr. Carmichael), a young man in Charlotte, N.C., finds himself caught between his liberal girlfriend, Maxine (Amber Stevens West), and his old-fashioned parents, the blue-collar Joe and the deeply religious Cynthia (David Alan Grier and Loretta Devine). An issue will arise  it will be pretty clear what, as the episode titles are along the lines of Prayer and Gender  and were off.

Yet The Carmichael Show consistently feels surprising, not formulaic, partly because of the talent assembled, partly because of Mr. Carmichaels comic philosophy of prodding his audience. (The episode in which Jerrod and Maxine argued over firearms, for instance, spoofed gun ownership and captured its allure at the same time: Its like listening to Beyonces album, Jerrod said of packing heat. You just feel stronger and prettier for some reason.)

The Carmichael Show is part of a mini-revival of issues-oriented sitcoms, in the spirit of the 1970s comedies of Norman Lear, who produced All in the Family and Good Times (and is rebooting One Day at a Time for Netflix with Latino characters). CBSs Mom tells stories about addiction and recovery, Foxs Bordertown is rooted in the immigration war and Louis C.K.s self-distributed Horace and Pete has dabbled in commentary on the 2016 election.

Thematically, The Carmichael Show has most in common with black-ish  also about an African-American family, albeit a more affluent one  which in its second season has redoubled its social commentary. Black-ish has recently done episodes on handguns and the Black Lives Matter protests, subjects The Carmichael Show tackled last summer.

Where black-ish has a more contemporary look, shooting single-camera and using more locations, The Carmichael Show is unapologetically old-school, shot multiple-camera on sets. (Joe and Cynthias living room even recalls Edith and Archie Bunkers.)

The staging determines the shows style. Its more playlike and hermetic; big events largely happen offstage, and the characters recount and debate them in the home and apartment sets. The action is almost all verbal.

This is a more theatrical style of sitcom, and the show benefits from the brassy stage duet of Mr. Grier and Ms. Devine. Mr. Carmichael, in the grand tradition of stand-ups-turned-actors, can deliver a bone-dry punch line, but needs a seasoned cast around him.

The new season kicks off with Everybody Cheats, a moral-dilemma story  Cynthia sees a friends husband with another woman  that unfolds into an argument about ethics, double standards and power. Cynthia worries about hurting her friend, Maxine argues that a good friend has to tell, and Jerrod cynically argues that successful men cheat, and the world accepts it: Hillary Clintons running for president, and we think shes weak because she should have left, he says. But if Bill Clinton walked through that door, wed all go, Oh my God, its Bill Clinton!

The second new episode, Fallen Heroes, is about Bill Cosby, and it is on fire. Jerrod surprises Maxine with tickets to Mr. Cosbys stand-up show, which she rejects because of the dozens of accusations of sexual assault against him. The ironic part, Maxine says, is you would have to knock me unconscious to get me to go see Bill Cosby.

The episode doesnt much debate whether Mr. Cosby is guilty. Instead, it turns on the audience: Can you separate love of the art from knowledge of the man?

Airing on Mr. Cosbys old network, this episode feels like a leaders statue being pulled down in a public square. Even when the family laughs warmly at a rerun of The Cosby Show, Mr. Carmichael caustically deflates the moment: Damn shame what he did to those women, though.

That gaspworthy kicker is the essence of The Carmichael Show, which is less interested in persuading its audience than denying them easy refuge. This sitcom is trying to say a lot right off the bat, and it sometimes knocks up against the cardboard edges of its characters. But its on its way to becoming one of TVs finer discomfort zones.",[]

By Barb Rosenstock. Illustrated by Gerard DuBois.

Dorothea Langes life is an example of art triumphing over many of the tougher, grimmer realities, and its also the story of an innovator who forged new ways of looking at things. This biography covers some difficult ground by breaking down Langes story into simple ideas, like her commitment to always seeing with her eyes and her heart. We learn of Dorotheas bout with polio at age 7, which left her with a forever-withered leg, and her decision during the Great Depression to leave her comfortable life  and, though its not explicitly mentioned, her two young sons  to document the lives of the poor and suffering. DuBoiss art creates a kind of vintage paper doll effect, with figures set against white space and little rubbed-out areas of acrylic paint. Not until the text is done do we get to see a few of Dorotheas photographs, which might seem like a curious editorial decision, though perhaps the images enormous emotional impact is heightened by the wait.",[]

A Hedwig and the Angry Inch reunion of sorts will arrive at Cafe Carlyle this month, set to the music of ... Radiohead.

Lena Hall and Michael C. Hall, who appeared opposite each other in Hedwig in 2014-5, will perform a tribute titled Radiohead: Obsessed, on March 19.

The duo (who are not related) will perform songs from the bands early days, when it originated with the 1992 single Creep, to its last album, The King of Limbs, which was released in 2011. Radiohead will play several festival dates this summer, and a new album is expected this year.

Ms. Hall, a Tony winner, performed at the Carlyle last spring, and has made Radioheads Karma Police part of her recent repertoire. (Last month, she wrote on Twitter that she had recorded the song.) Mr. Hall recently played in the lead role in the musical Lazarus, one of David Bowies last projects.

nytimes.com,2016-03-03 00:00:00,The Puerto Rican Lower East Side,"['David Gonzalez', 'Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Reference Timestopics People G David_gonzalez Index Html']","When I first came across Arlene Gottfrieds vintage pictures of Puerto Rican New York, Bacalaitos & Fireworks, I chuckled. Her reference to the siren call of a Lower East Side street vendor hawking codfish fritters and firecrackers struck me as having all the ingredients for a Fourth of July party (just add Bacardi). My second reaction was nervousness  given the areas devastation from poverty and drugs during the 1970s and 1980s, how would the photographer portray this world?

With love and humor, it turns out.

This is not to say that Ms. Gottfried glossed over the untidy parts of the local narrative. It was impossible not to notice the empty lots, the dazed junkies, the weary-faced couples. But she did not let herself be mesmerized by that. She delved into the community, where her mother had moved after decades in Crown Heights, and connected with its residents who, in turn, embraced her and her camera.

She documented birthday parties in spotless living rooms (with chairs sheathed in plastic slipcovers); whole pigs roasting on a spit in an empty lot; religious services and funerals, first communions and parades. Her camera also singled out critical, if sometimes overlooked, cultural figures like Jorge Brandon, considered to be the father of Nuyorican poetry. In more than a few images, she has Miguel Pinero, the poet, playwright, addict and criminal whose life was as complicated as it was short.

Most of the images were from the Lower East Side  Loisaida  although she also took some in Brooklyn and the Bronx, as well as along the Fifth Avenue route of the Puerto Rican Day Parade.

It was a mixture of excitement, devastation and drug use, said Ms. Gottfried, who will be exhibiting a selection of these images at Daniel Cooney Fine Art in Chelsea from March 3 through April 16. But there was more than just that. It was the people, the humanity of the situation. You had very good people there trying to make it.

Photo

Ms. Gottfrieds ability to connect to communities of color is something she credits to her family having stayed in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, even after many of her white neighbors fled during the 1960s. She became friends with the newcomers.

By the 1970s, her mother had moved to the Lower East Side  where she herself would live in the 1990s  and she visited often. Looking beyond the jarring landscape, she found the people to be welcoming. She ended up taking pictures for years, not with any specific project in mind.

In some cases, she would be struck by what she encountered, like the procession of girls about to make their first communion, walking down the street past televisions perched on cars and connected by extension cords to lampposts. Or the time someone told her to keep walking down the street.

Wait until you see what you find down the block, she recalled being told. And there was this pig roast. You get exposed to all that being outside. It was a lot of fun.

Her pictures reflect that, including touches of humor and warmth familiar to anyone who grew up during that time, when residents often had only each other for support.

The humor comes from being with the people, Ms. Gottfried said. Part of it is how I see life. You know, the humanity. There was openness, and I felt really comfortable. It was a mixture of excitement, joy and warmth. There was this striking beauty the people had.

Photo

Her pictures of some of the areas cultural figures  whom she often encountered at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe  also show the areas rich creativity.

It was a big mixture of people involved in all kinds of things, she said. I used to enjoy having conversations with people and bumping into people you knew. The musicians and the actors, there was a lot of theater going on at the cafe and other places. We could go to Henry Street Settlement and there would be a free Tito Puente concert.

Ms. Gottfried would go on to other projects, other assignments. The area would undergo a major transformation, attracting newcomers to renovated tenements and luxury buildings. Some pockets of the old world remain, which makes her feel sentimental.

Money came in and changed everything, she said. But it was an experience I had and others didnt. I was able to go to places other people would only see in pictures.

And not all change was unwelcome. Over the years, she had photographed Johnny Cintron, looking rough and covered with tattoos. She even visited him in jail and took a picture of him there. She always remembered him as a smart guy who went astray.

Two years ago, Mr. Cintron tracked her down on Facebook. The two decided to meet at Tompkins Square Park.

Walking through there, I was bumping into people I knew, Ms. Gottfried recalled. I was sitting there thinking, how will I recognize Johnny? Then, I saw a man standing with his back to me. I recognized him from behind, how he stood. There he was. Hes all cleaned up, married, looking good and doing well. Thank God for that.

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Real Madrid Advances in Champions League but Has Reason to Worry,['Rob Hughes'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

LONDON  Real Madrid needs to win the Champions League the way a capsized crew needs a life raft. Its team, one of the most expensive ever assembled, won at home, 2-0, to complete what looked like a rout of Roma over the two legs.









Looks can be deceiving.

Though Cristiano Ronaldo scored again for his 90th goal in 123 Champions League appearances, the evidence is that the good ship Real Madrid is less of a force and less complete than Barcelona or Bayern Munich, the two most impressive teams in this years tournament.

For more than an hour Tuesday in Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, it was Roma that created the better chances.

Created, and squandered.

If only Roma had a finisher remotely like Ronaldo, it would have comfortably wiped out the two-goal deficit it dug for itself after losing the first leg. Im asking my team to do the impossible, Roma Coach Luciano Spalletti had said before the game in Madrid. The way they are training allows me to ask that. But we mustnt be weak mentally.

Roma has excelled in Italy this year  it has won seven straight in Serie A  and Spalletti easily identified the obvious flaw in Madrids lineup. He told his players, particularly the speedy Egyptian winger Mohamed Salah, to get behind Madrids left back, Marcelo, and create havoc there.

Salah did that part to perfection. Marcelo is adventurous at going forward and linking up with Ronaldo, but the Brazilian has barely any inclination to fulfill his defensive duties.

Madrid Manager Zinedine Zidane, a marvelous player who now is a rookie coach, appeared happy enough to pick Marcelo. Why? Perhaps because what Zidane best knows and loves about soccer is attacking and exploiting the opponents weakness. He did it par excellence as a Real Madrid forward. And earlier this week, one of his players, Raphael Varane, said, He is a coach who loves the game and loves attacking football. He likes movement, moving the ball around quickly and playing higher up the pitch.

Marcelo, then, is a definite Zidane pick. But the risks are obvious: On Tuesday night, Salah (twice), Edin Dzeko and Alessandro Florenzi were in good position to score, one on one, against the Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas.

Only once did the goalkeeper need to show his agility to make the save. The other three shots went wide. And Spallettis face on the sideline showed that he feared that once such opportunities came Real Madrids way, there would be no such wastefulness.

Madrid, to be sure, was carving out its own openings: Statistics had Real having 37 shots on goal to Romas 12. But that statistic didnt tell the whole truth.

Most of Real Madrids attempts came from long range, against a well-organized double line of Roma defenders. And most were either off target or so tame they were mere catching practice for Roma keeper Wojciech Szczesny.

When he was finally beaten, it was by Ronaldo, of course. A week or so back, when some in Madrids media were prematurely calling time on Ronaldos career, his response was to tell them to look at the statistics because they never lie.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Ronaldo was booed by a sizable portion of the crowd Tuesday, but in a handful of minutes, between the 64th and 68th, he scored the first goal and set up the other by James Rodriguez.

Neither finish was a work of art. Rodriguezs shot went straight through the legs of the goalkeeper, and Ronaldos was tapped in from close range, although it did require him to think and move quickly to reach the low cross by Lucas Vazquez.

Vazquez is that rarity, a player actually produced by the Real Madrid youth system. The 24-year-old had to wait a long time for his breakthrough season in Reals white, and he spent last season at Espanyol, the other club in Barcelona. Vazquezs role on Tuesday was to come off the bench and replace Gareth Bale  recently returned from injury  once he tired.

After linking up with Luka Modric, Vazquez danced past a defender and demonstrated that he had the talent to shine, if his club allowed him to show it.

Ronaldo now has 353 goals in 336 games with Madrid, and no one would deny that he is a superstar. Yet, the Madrid fans boo him. The older supporters look beyond the goal totals and want less hubris. They saw it in previous stars like Alfredo Di Stefano and, later, in Zidane.

And Tuesday, the crowd that harangued Ronaldo gave a standing ovation to a man who never played for them. As the game neared its end, Roma sent it its longtime magician, Francesco Totti.

Now 39, Totti first wore Romas distinctive purple and golden yellow when he was 16. Real once bid for him, but Totti always was a one-team kind of a guy.

He can no longer inspire his beloved team to victory, as he once could with instinctive and almost insolent guile.

But as he made a cameo during his 595th game for Roma  most likely his last appearance at the Bernabeu  Totti was given the ovation denied to the man who scored the game winner, Ronaldo.

Spalletti reiterated after the contest that his team needed, somehow, to toughen up on the mental side of the game, something Totti never had a problem with.

But by fielding Totti at the end, he demonstrated that Roma is also woefully short in what Madrid has in abundance: the ability to score goals. And Real, which has no chance to win its league and has only the Champions League left to play for, advanced to the quarterfinals for the sixth year in a row.",[]

WARSAW  A political crisis in Poland entered a new and dangerous phase on Wednesday, as the countrys Constitutional Tribunal struck down a new law limiting its powers. The nations right-wing government, which adopted the law in December, said it would ignore the courts ruling.









The legal showdown is the latest manifestation of a rightward lurch that began after the conservative Law and Justice Party swept to power in elections in October.

The government is facing growing pressure from the European Union and the United States to respect the decisions of the Constitutional Tribunal, the only court empowered to review national laws. In January, the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, opened an unprecedented inquiry into whether the government had violated democratic norms, a condition of membership in the 28-nation bloc.

Poland, the sixth-largest economy in the European Union, is a major net recipient of economic development aid. It is also a member of NATO and an American ally against an increasingly belligerent Russia.

In some 20 cities across the country in the past two months, democratic activists have staged huge demonstrations against the government, which has also cracked down on the news media.

But so far the government has remained defiant. Even before the court issued its latest ruling, Prime Minister Beata Szydlo had said her government would not abide by it.

The constitutional crisis began in October. Sensing it was going to lose the elections, the previous party in power, Civic Platform, appointed five judges to the court, including two to fill terms that were not due to expire until after the election. The president refused to swear them in.

Upon winning power, the Law and Justice Party appointed five judges of its own choosing, who were promptly sworn in. In December, however, the tribunal ruled that the old government had properly appointed three of the five judges it tried to install; the president has refused to seat them.

Parliament then passed a law reorganizing the court, requiring a two-thirds majority for any decision to be binding, instead of a simple majority, and requiring that 13 of the 15 judges hear a given case, instead of 9. The decision announced on Wednesday was heard by only 12 judges, and the government argues it is therefore not valid.

This situation  described by the media as paralysis, which unfortunately is not far from the truth  means that fundamental constitutional principles have been abused, Judge Stanislaw Biernat, a member of the tribunal, said at the court on Wednesday.

Judge Biernat said that the Law and Justice party  the first party since the fall of Communism in Poland in 1989 to hold an absolute majority in Parliament  had abused the rule of law, separation of powers, independence of the judiciary and the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals.

The court also rejected the new two-thirds requirement as unconstitutional.

The Constitution requires that the government publish all rulings by the Constitutional Tribunal immediately in the official Journal of Laws. The justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, said the prime minister would do no such thing.

Mr. Ziobro said that the court appeared to have made up its mind before it even heard the case on Tuesday.

This whole thing could have been a put-up job, he said. Its outrageous. The judges dont want to reach a compromise.

The Constitution does not specify what should happen if a sitting government ignores a ruling of the Constitutional Tribunal.

This will lead to a complete anarchy in our country, Eugeniusz Klopotek, of the opposition Polish Peoples Party, said. Social tensions will escalate. I can already feel it.

Adam Bodnar, the human rights ombudsman at the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, told the tribunal during a hearing: The Constitutional Tribunal will survive, but the question is whether its function will not be purely decorative. This court guarantees the real protection of citizens rights and freedoms, but the Parliament intends to deprive citizens of this fundamental instrument to protect their rights.

The ruling on Wednesday came just days before the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe, a human rights watchdog, plans to issue a report on the status of political freedom in Poland, including the recent laws changing the powers of the Constitutional Tribunal and control of public broadcasters.

According to a draft report, the commission will find that these changes endanger not only the rule of law, but also the functioning of the democratic system.

Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is the head of the Law and Justice Party and the power behind the prime minister, Ms. Szydlo, said that Poland must stand up to external attempts to intervene in its internal affairs.

Poland is and must be a sovereign country, Mr. Kaczynski said.

If the European Union finds that Poland has violated democratic norms, it could strip the country of its voting rights, though it is not clear whether officials in Brussels would be willing to go that far.",[]

TUESDAY PUZZLE  This was a straightforward circled-answer puzzle with a good number of long clues for early in the week  potentially slow going for a new solver, but the corners used crossword standards like ASSUAGE, THANE and UPROOT that you will encounter again. Odd little semi-words like AHH, URL and SLR contributed to the challenge here.

For some reason, I knew OTTO PREMINGER had directed Anatomy of a Murder. Right away and right across the middle, then, my answers spread quickly in all directions. I cant for the life of me remember seeing the movie itself, but, like most of us, I did go through a Jimmy Stewart phase so it could have happened. I registered otter at that point, but the nature of the beast didnt become clear until I got MINUTE STEAK. SETTHETABLE and FUSEBOX came fairly easily after that.

The spelling and definition of MESHUGA sent me to the archives and the Internet, because I had heard and spoken so many variations and it looked funny on paper, but that is The New York Times-ordained spelling, so that was something I learned today, my bubelehs.

David Steinberg corroborates my findings, and, as it turns out, I did get lucky with that Jimmy Stewart thing:

Constructors Notes:

I constructed this puzzle just over a year ago. At the time, I was making almost all themelesses, so I decided to construct a themed puzzle for the sake of variety. Im not sure where the inspiration for this puzzle came from, but I was fortunate to find just enough types of fur to scrape together a theme set. Interestingly, both OTTO PREMINGER and OTTO KLEMPERER wouldve worked for the center theme entry  I chose OTTO PREMINGER because I felt he would be more familiar to early-week solvers. I settled on this grid pattern because I wanted to give solvers something a little different from the several theme entries with a pair of long downs structure used in most themed 1515 crosswords these days. I personally use the traditional layout the majority of the time, but when I end up with a theme set that I could go a different direction with, I like to switch things up. The 74-word grid with all the 7s was definitely a challenge, but I was pleased to work in MESHUGA, JUNIPER and BLASTER. Keeping the less savory bits to a minimum was significantly harder, but Im pleased with how the fill turned out over all (with the exception of NATALE, which the Tuesday solver in me is grumbling about!). I hope you enjoy my puzzle. One of the R.A.s in my dorm just started solving The New York Times crossword  as of right now, he only attempts Mondays, so Im hoping this puzzle will persuade him to graduate to Tuesday!

It is Science Times Tuesday, and I was reminded by this puzzle of the Russian Fox experiment, a decades-long project that dissipated along with the Soviet Union, but still pops up on nature shows and in genetics classes. An attempt was made to breed foxes that were less aggressive and less inclined to bite their captors on a fur farm; the result was a complete and rapid domestication, and the new, sweeter foxes proved more lucrative as exotic pets for the ultrarich than fabric for same.

Lucky little critters. Although, you never know...

nytimes.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Hopping Freight Trains With the Dirty Kids,['Rena Silverman'],"If you combine the tinge of loneliness in Jimmie Rodgerss Waiting for a Train with the outcast mentality of Bob Dylans I Am a Lonesome Hobo, you might understand the millennial hippiedom of a group called Dirty Kids. Theyre not a band, but a self-proclaimed set of countercultural vagabonds: a new wave of nomadic, homeless youth traveling state to state hitchhiking, sleeping in cars and hopping on freight trains.

Last autumn, Emily Kask, a photojournalism student at Western Kentucky University, took a semester off to document  and become  part of the Dirty Kids family.

I had to panhandle, I had to eat out of Dumpsters, said Ms. Kask, 21. Everything that they had to do to survive, I had to do the same thing, too. They didnt cut me any excuses because I was a college kid or a journalist.

Her project started with a search for subjects on Hippie Hill in Christiana, Tenn., where the homeless can find temporary housing, comradeship and free expression. Contacts there led Ms. Kask to Southern Illinois, where she attended a rainbow gathering, a traveling convention that aims to inspire peace, love and community among multigenerational hippie types. It was there that she met Bambi, then 20, who had left her suburban home in North Carolina for the open road.

We were both kind of the same age, young women, Ms. Kask said. So I kind of felt at ease with her.

Photo

Bambi, who preferred to be identified by only her street name, had just parted ways with another group and was getting ready to learn how to hop freight trains with her friend Travis Sauter. Ms. Kask asked if she could come along. They agreed, and Ms. Kask drove them to Kentucky.

On arrival, Mr. Sauter, 41, was arrested over a prior panhandling incident, but Bambi and Ms. Kask continued with a new friend, Matt Johnson, or Smerph, who grew up in a family of train riders. He taught them the moves. Later the group met up with others, including Deverayn Armstrong, 26, who had been in and out of foster homes before taking to riding the rails.

Ms. Kask hopped on her first freight train  a gondola car full of scrap metal  near Bowling Green, Ky. She and the others got off in Nashville, about 65 miles away.

That is an exhilarating feeling, jumping on a train, Ms. Kask said.

Shooting it was a different story. She tried to use her Nikon D4 or smaller Fuji, but in the end many of her train photos were shot with her iPhone for safety.

Photo

There are two ways to get on a train, she said. You can either get on a side off or hop on the fly. When youre siding off, the trains going to stop for a little bit. That is the easiest way to get on. When youre hopping on the fly, you are going to wait for the train to slow down to a speed where you can get on. Thats different for everybody. I wouldnt be able to do it more than a couple miles per hour, but there are some kids who can do it up to 10.

Train hopping is hardly new to American society. Even before the Great Depression (think John Steinbecks Of Mice and Men), there was the post-Civil War railroad scene when war veterans, westbound drifters or migrant workers headed across the country via freight train.

I think it is absolutely this wild revolution, Ms. Kask said of the Dirty Kids. I think its this blend of these Great Depression train riders and the hippies of the 60s and 70s, and, I think its come to blend together with the millennials.

SHANGHAI  Inside the K11 Art Mall, an elevator ride away from Burberry, Chloe, Balenciaga and other high-end shops, hundreds of people line up each day to see very different kinds of luxury items on display. An exhibition of 40 paintings by Claude Monet, billed as the largest-ever show of the Impressionists work in China, opened in March in a basement gallery space of this retail magnet. On a recent Sunday, 600 people at a time filled the two rooms of the gallery space to see Monet: Master of Impressionism, on view until June 15.









The approximately 300,000-square-foot art mall opened in May 2013, and its not the only one. Many malls in China now make art-viewing part of the shopping experience, with some devoting themselves equally to exhibiting art and selling merchandise.

The K11 Art Foundation claims to have pioneered the concept, known as museum-retail: Each of its art malls have an in-house team that programs the gallerys offerings and coordinates how other work appears throughout the building.

Photo

As art and commerce mix in China, this art-retail concept has become a formidable trend in shopping-happy Shanghai. Here, art is used as a marketing tool to lure shoppers away from competitors. Those at the helm also see such exhibitions as viable forms of art education in a country where access to art can be limited to the rich and malls are destinations for young people and a new generation of wealthy women.

K11 Art Foundation, a nonprofit organization registered in Hong Kong, showcases around 20 works by emerging Chinese artists and blue-chip staples at each of its two K11 Art Malls in Hong Kong and Shanghai, along with holding regular exhibitions.

Over the coming five years, K11 aims to open iterations of its museum-retail centers across China  in Beijing and Guangzhou, and in rapidly developing cities like Shenyang, Tianjin, Haikou, Ningbo and Guiyang. Two will open in Wuhan.

Usually the shows are free, but for the Monet show, tickets cost 100 renminbi, about $16, to offset the cost of shipping, handling and security for the works, which have been loaned by the Musee Marmottan Monet in Paris. After leaving the show, visitors can buy ephemera like framed posters of water lilies at a gift shop.

The works on view at K11 are not meant to be for sale. Other art malls, however, tack on the dressings of the museum or gallery experience by adding rentable gallery space or staging sporadic mall-wide exhibitions in collaboration with artists, curators or galleries, sometimes making works available for purchase.

K11s first mall opened in 2009 in Hong Kong, the hometown of its founder and chairman, Adrian Cheng. Retail-empire building runs in his family: His grandfather is the jewelry-store mogul Cheng Yu-tung, one of the richest people in Hong Kong. Mr. Cheng, an avid art collector who was educated in the United States, started the foundation in 2008 after moving to China.

At that time, China was like the Great Gatsby, he said in Hong Kong, where he organized a show of Zhang Enli paintings under the K11 banner during the Art Basel show there.

He said his malls provided education, like tours and lectures, about new Chinese artists and art in general. I have the resources, Mr. Cheng said, adding, Chinese audiences, or even Western audiences, are not really sure whats going on with contemporary emerging Chinese artists.

Mr. Chengs foundation often supplies its two art malls with work from its two K11 Art Villages, in Wuhan and Guiyang, where Chinese artists can apply for residencies. Just before the Monet exhibition, the gallery space held a show produced by artists at these villages. Within the mall itself, Eric Chan, K11s director of operations in south China, said the focus was on creating a nonthreatening setting for viewing art.

A lot of people in China think that art is for very rich people and get intimidated, Mr. Chan said. Galleries aim to attract 25- to 50-year-old women  the sophisticated lady, he said  with childrens art classes and collaborations within stores. The MaxMara store at the mall, for example, exhibited works by three Chinese artists that all used the brands signature coat.

Other malls in Shanghai have begun to capitalize on the publicity that high-profile exhibitions can bring. Last fall Jingan Kerry Center, a chain throughout the city, held a 25-year retrospective of photography from Elle China; LVMHs LAvenue held an exhibition of works by the conceptual artist Xu Zhen last year; and in November the new IAPM Mall threw an exhibition opening for David LaChapelles photographs of the new line of Tods handbags.

Contemporary art in China is categorized within the realm of luxury goods, said Mathieu Borysevicz, the founder and director of BANK gallery in Shanghai, who has worked in the Chinese art world since the 1990s. Now the malls themselves have taken the initiative to embrace contemporary art. Of course what starts out as grossly superficial may, hopefully, lead to sincere interest in the future.

Not all the shows are tied to fashion. On May 30, Reel Shanghai Department Store opened an exhibition titled In and Out with works by artists from ShanghART, one of the citys premier galleries. The monthlong exhibition focuses on installations best served by the large space, like a small aircraft mounted on wheels by Shi Yong, whose work encompasses photography, performance art and installations.

The painter and installation artist Han Fengs floating city of parchment paper is featured, as is work by Xu Zhen, who produces pieces with a company of around 30 people under his name.

The opening also inaugurated a new gallery space on the top floor of the mall.

The idea of an exhibition at the mall, located at the busy Jingan subway stop, intrigued ShanghARTs director, Lorenz Helbling. Art needs to be shown to the public, said Mr. Helbling, who founded the gallery in 1996. As long as it is done honestly and with respect to the art and artists. He said that in Shanghai, mixing art with commerce was not just a trend, but a tradition: One of the citys first major contemporary art exhibitions, Art for Sale in 1999, was staged in a shopping center.

Inside the Monet exhibition, Mr. Chan, K11s director of operations, pointed out a painting of the bridge in Giverny. It closely resembled Monets Le Pont Japonais (The Japanese Bridge), which was sold to an Asian bidder at Sothebys in New York on May 7 for $15.9 million.

We have a lot of collectors visit, Mr. Chan said, smiling. We wonder: Maybe he was inspired by our exhibition?",[]

Where Ms. Merkel, the chancellor, has welcomed refugees, Ms. Petry, a rising far-right leader, has said border guards might need to turn guns on anyone crossing a frontier illegally.

Where Ms. Merkel has urged tolerance, Ms. Petry has embraced the angry populism now running through Europe and the United States.

The preachers of hatred was how the news weekly Der Spiegel characterized the new German right on its cover last month, emblazoned with a portrait of the petite Ms. Petry.

But this brisk, garrulous 40-year-old is more than Ms. Merkels foil. She is a disruptive, new force on the German political scene.

She and her party, the Alternative for Germany, have ridden a wave of discontent over the chancellors embrace of more than one million refugees to their strongest poll ratings ever.

They are now roiling Germanys placid, consensus-driven politics and threatening to alter its political landscape as insurgent parties have done in less stable or prosperous countries around Europe.

Not unlike Donald J. Trump in the United States, she is also breaking open a political dialogue and liberating a new and impolitic  critics say racist  language in the mainstream.

The power of the established parties is crumbling, a jubilant Ms. Petry told supporters after her party took 13.2 percent of the vote in normally sleepy local elections in the central state of Hesse last Sunday.

This Sunday is another test, with elections in three larger and more important states  one in the east and two in the west  that are being closely watched as a referendum on the chancellors refugee policies and a bellwether for the nation.

In the east, support for the Alternative for Germany now nears 20 percent  about double that in the west.

But even in the west, the far-right rebellion is chipping away at the chancellors conservative Christian Democrats, as well as its Social Democratic coalition partners, in a country where the Nazi past looms large.

The Alternative for Germany party has already elbowed its way into five state Parliaments, and is predicted to sail into three more with up to one-fifth of the vote on Sunday.

Ms. Merkels push this week for European Union leaders to hammer out a deal with Turkey to stem the refugee flow was intended in no small part to beat back the challenge Ms. Petry represents.

There is no doubt that the migrant crisis changed the fortunes of Ms. Petrys party.

Initially founded in 2013 as a protest against the euro, the Alternative for Germany shifted emphasis to protecting German identity as hundreds of thousands of migrants entered the country last year.

Ms. Petry and other nationalist-minded leaders ousted the more Europe-oriented founder of the party, then locked onto the identity issue as the embodiment of how Ms. Merkel and the German establishment were ruining the country and ignoring ordinary folk, said Hajo Funke, a politics professor at the Free University in Berlin.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Starting in the former Communist East Germany, in Ms. Petrys home state of Saxony, they whipped unhappiness about political and economic alienation into anger and double-digit scores in opinion polls, Professor Funke said.

Ms. Petry has stood out, he added. She seems like a split personality, not integrated, cold and intelligent, but above all power-conscious, he said. She wants power, she wants to get into government.

Professor Funke and other leading political scientists are doubtful her success will last, pointing to former right-wing parties that briefly emerged in the 1990s and then faded. But the immediate impact of the migrant crisis is undeniable, cutting across age, education, social class, region and political persuasion.

Street protests rapidly descend into right-wing chants of Merkel must go! and left-wing cries of Out with Nazis! Violent attacks on asylum seekers and their housing have increased.

Now, the elections in three of Germanys 16 states on Sunday will be the first significant voter test of both Ms. Merkels policy and Ms. Petrys rapid ascent.

Both women are from former East Germany, both hold doctorates in science and both have connections to the Lutheran church  Ms. Merkels father was a Lutheran pastor, as is Ms. Petrys estranged husband.

There, however, the similarities end.

Unlike the 61-year-old chancellor, Ms. Petry sees 1990 as a missed opportunity to really reunite.

Much that was successful in the East was simply swallowed by the West, she said in an interview. In the next 25 years, she argued, a view of Germany evolved that demeaned the country, with policies against families, against nuclear power and against German traditions.

In this atmosphere, it is not surprising that a party which argues for a self-conscious nation-state in a Europe of Fatherlands is seen as reactionary, she said.

That only shows how one-sided the discussion in Germany has been for years, said Ms. Petry, a mother of four.

As for the Nazi past, she said, the uniqueness, the singularity of German guilt has stood much too often in the forefront, and distorted the view that there are also enough positive aspects to our history.

In a shabby hall on the outskirts of Mannheim, a city of almost 300,000 about 60 miles south of Frankfurt, Ms. Petry got a sympathetic hearing from some 250 listeners.

Germany is crazy, said Katja Kornmacher, 46, who said she works in a publishing house and holds two university degrees. We have the feeling that we cant say anything against the leftist view in Germany. It starts in school, where we are told what is correct.

And those who follow this line land better in life, she continued. The line is: Right is bad, left is good. And then the leftists are outside shouting against this democratic event.

Ms. Kornmacher was referring to perhaps 30 leftists who jeered those who came to hear Ms. Petry. More than 200 police officers were on duty to ensure there were no clashes.

Emotions are high since the local newspaper, the Mannheimer Morgen, ran a now-infamous interview with Ms. Petry in which she contemplated border guards using guns to keep out refugees.

While not averse to the attendant publicity, Ms. Petry says her words were twisted by what she calls the Pinocchio press to say that she favored an order to shoot, similar to that in East Germany.

The political establishment in Germany has mostly dealt with Ms. Petry and her party by refusing to appear with them in public, and ruling out any coalition government with them.

Hotels and other institutions have even declined to rent halls to the party, stoking the resentment of its supporters.

In Merseburg, a picturesque town of 36,000 in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, which votes on Sunday, the Christian Democrat mayor, Jens Buhligen, 49, has managed to accommodate about 2,800 refugees, mostly spread through the town in empty apartments.

He said he has defused protests by going to them, and listening. It works, he said.

But some of Sundays prospective voters had a very different view. When about 150 people rallied for the Alternative for Germany, the anger of a cluster of women, all 60 or older, was palpable.

We were not asked! about the refugees, they yelled. We are here for our children and grandchildren!

A burly 63-year-old woman in a red anorak, who like the others declined to give her name, said she had worked for 42 years and gets 621 euros a month, about $685, from her pension.

Watching how the refugees are treated, she said, I have never had so much hatred inside me.",[]

The Harvard Art Museums, which have been without a director since last July, announced Wednesday that they had chosen Martha Tedeschi, a longtime curator and administrator at the Art Institute of Chicago, to lead the institutions.

She will succeed Thomas W. Lentz, who directed the museums for more than a decade and shepherded them through a long and sometimes contentious $350 million renovation and expansion, designed by Renzo Piano, that was completed in 2014.

Ms. Tedeschi, 57, a specialist in British and American art with expertise in the history of printmaking, began her career at the Art Institute in 1982 as an intern and became a full curator in 1999. Since 2012, she has served as the deputy director for art and research, overseeing the institutes libraries and archives, publishing and imaging, academic programs and conservation departments, while also serving as its academic liaison to local universities and foundations.

In a statement, Harvards president, Drew Gilpin Faust, said that Ms. Tedeschis experience would serve the museums well as the university seeks to elevate our extraordinary collections and integrate them more fully into Harvards intellectual life.

Ms. Tedeschi, who will take over in July, said in a telephone interview that she was drawn to the job because of her deep interest in how the visual and the creative and intuitive can be meaningful to students regardless of the field in which theyre working and training, and that she believed that Harvard was a campus that is so clearly ready to collaborate with the museums.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,The Costumes That Obscure Doctor and Patient,"['M D', 'Abigail Zuger']","Photo

Hard Cases Dr. Abigail Zuger on the everyday ethical issues doctors face.

Is it time for new costumes in the long-running improv act featuring doctor and patient? The white coat and the cotton gown are tattered, under continual assault for their practical deficiencies and outmoded symbolism.

Along with ties and long sleeves, Britain banned white coats for most doctors almost 10 years ago. Our priestly garb turns out to harbor quantities of bacteria, including the hospital-associated germs we try to keep away from patients.

Presumably all garments carry bacteria, including the vestments of priests. The clergy, though, probably tote a less noxious load  and probably change robes more often. Doctors report that they do so only every couple of weeks, long enough for grime to accumulate.

Most American medical schools now bestow a fresh white coat on every new student, a symbol of our exalted professional aspirations. Some American hospitals now discourage those selfsame coats in the name of hygiene. Draw what moral you will. Many pediatricians would no more dress in a white coat than in a gorilla suit, lest they scare the little ones. Some adult doctors, reasoning that we are all children in illness, feel likewise. Some of us just need the pockets.

The best clinician I ever knew was draped in a grayish shabby thing spilling over with scraps of paper, vaguely redolent of his usual weekday lunch of pea soup. Whether you were a patient or a trainee, you didnt really want him near you, until you quickly figured out that you really did.

One of the worst specimens of doctor Ive run into wore snowy white, changed daily. You really didnt want that guy near you, period, as many of his patients ultimately realized, including the ones who took him to court.

The symbolism surrounding patient gowns is just as fraught. They are cheap, demeaning, undignified and chilly. One way to cope is to wear two of them, one opening to the front and one to the rear. Thus encased, the patient is snug and warm, and also extremely well defended from inquisitive fingers and probing stethoscopes. It turns out that actual clothes are far easier to push aside for an examination than are two johnnie gowns firmly knotted together.

But patient gowns are out of style in some places mostly because they clash with the dominant medical fashion these days: doing everything at top speed. People need time and privacy to dress and undress. Medical settings without time or extra space find their stacks of clean gowns going undisturbed.

Instead, patients disrobe incompletely, or sometimes not at all, just opening little portals in their clothing through which what passes for a physical examination can be performed. Such accommodation is regrettable, but necessary to maintain our cruising speed. Call it laparoscopy for the nonsurgeon.

For my professors, the physical exam was a sacred ritual. I sometimes wonder which would distress them more: the thought of treating a rash glimpsed only on a cellphone screen, or the idea of asking a patient to open two shirt buttons under his tie for a quick inspection of that thing on his chest. Ive been guilty of both.

A couple of months ago, on a frigid winter day, a stolid, silent patient came in because her knee hurt. Just give me something, she said. I was sorely tempted, but I couldnt do it: I had to examine both unclad legs. She cast me a look of pure disgust and hauled herself to her feet.

It took almost 10 minutes for her to peel off the layers of tight, ill-fitting jeans, socks, pantyhose, more socks, more hose, long underwear, down to the arthritic knee. It took another 10 minutes to put it all back on.

My professors would have stepped out to give her some privacy. For some reason, I stayed where I was.

Those 20 minutes were death to the days schedule, but invaluable for showing the harried doctor something of the grim labor of everyday life for this patient, a heart-rending discomfort of binding elastic and straining seams she could never have articulated, and, of course, one that would have been invisible with her on display in a hospital gown.

It was the process that educated, not the final tableau.

We are never more human than when we are dressing and undressing, and yet for our medical care, we have, for some reason, decided to posture in front of one another fully costumed, pretending that, encased in our separate roles, we will get to the bottom of the pain.

Perhaps we need not new costumes but new stage directions. Perhaps doctors should routinely watch patients undress and then dress again. Perhaps, for that matter, patients should watch doctors washing their chapped hands yet again and putting on their white coats, checking the pockets for tools, phone numbers, reminders, lists of urgencies, looking at those coffee stains and wincing, vowing to get to the laundry and then forgetting.",[]

FRANKFURT  The German carmaker BMW reported on Wednesday that its operating profit was better than expected, thanks to healthy sales of high-margin sport-utility vehicles. The company, however, disappointed investors with its dividend.

The companys earnings before interest and tax rose to 9.59 billion euros, or $10.6 billion, above the average forecast of 9.55 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts. The results gave the producer of BMW and Mini cars an operating margin in its automotive division of 9.2 percent.

Last year, BMW retained the title of the worlds biggest luxury carmaker, with sales of BMW-branded cars reaching 1.91 million, a 5.2 percent increase from the previous year. It was the 11th year in a row that the Munich-based company held the title.

Harald Kruger, BMWs chief executive, said the company aimed to continue increasing sales.

We are again targeting a new sales volume record in 2016, with sales expected to be slightly up on the previous year, Mr. Kruger said on Wednesday in a statement.

BMW said it would recommend a dividend of 3.20 per share of common stock and 3.22 for preferred stock, which was below the 3.38 per share expected in the Reuters poll.

Analysts at Evercore ISI said that although results beat market expectations, the lack of any announcements about higher dividend payments was disappointing.

The lack of any special dividend and the flat payout ratio disappoint, said Arndt Ellinghorst, the head of global automotive research at Evercore.",[]

Normally on Land Day, I would not have gone to school. In Syria, where I grew up, they usually let Syrian-Palestinians march to remember the day, March 30, 1976, when Israeli forces killed six Palestinians and wounded at least 100 who had been protesting Israels expropriation of Palestinian land. But when I was 15, the government banned the commemoration.









Twelve of us lived in my familys three-bedroom house in Yarmouk, a Palestinian neighborhood in Damascus that began as a camp for refugees. (My parents fled to Lebanon in 1948, then fled to Syria 10 years later.) I slept on a mattress near the kitchen with three older brothers. We got up at 7 a.m. to eat breakfast  yogurt, halloumi, Arabic pita bread and sweet tea  before my father and older siblings went to work or university. Then I headed to school in my khaki uniform, down our street, which was scented and soundtracked by a big, raucous market. All the houses had gardens out front. Ours had lemon and loquat trees.

As it turned out, our teachers decided to end classes early that day and send us home. Some Syrian-Palestinians were defying the ban, and some students had joined in. Guns were going off, and tires were burning. Security forces showed up. Students threw stones at them. There was a lot of shouting and fighting as people were arrested. But I was a shy, skinny boy who stayed away from politics and protests. I just wanted to go home.

The youth wing of the Baathist party, led by President Hafez al-Assad, had many offices in our neighborhood. I saw a young man standing in the doorway of one. He was a couple of years older than I was and looked a little like one of my brothers: chubby, with fair skin, a light beard and curly brown hair. I knew who he was; his name was Kamal. He was holding a gun.

I walked faster through the rush of people. He can see Im just carrying my books, I told myself. He can see I dont want to protest. But Kamal looked right at me, aimed his gun in my direction and shot.

As I ran, my left calf began to burn. I staggered into my yard and bled on the lemon and loquat trees. Once inside I saw a big chunk of my flesh was missing. The bone was exposed. But I was relieved.

My family said not to report the shooting. One of my sisters was a nurse and treated my wound. The next day, she took me to the hospital for an X-ray to make sure the bone wasnt fractured. We said I fell down the stairs. When school reopened two days later, I returned in my khaki uniform. I tried not to limp. I never told my classmates what happened.

I saw Kamal every day. When we passed each other, he looked at me with a blank stare. He didnt seem to know he had shot me. I went on to graduate, go to college, get a job in sales, marry and start raising three wonderful children.

One afternoon, I was buying fish from a chubby, bearded man nicknamed Abu al-Bara. He looked familiar. We knew many of the same people. We went to the same school. I dont remember you, he said, shaking his head.

Abu al-Bara was friendly, and he happened to live on the same floor of our building. Sometimes he sent us fresh fish or squid, and I would reciprocate with a tub of homemade tarator, a tahini, garlic and parsley sauce that goes really well with fried seafood. Then one day, I found out his formal name: Kamal.

I hadnt thought about my scar in years. When I realized I had been buying fish from him, the scar  now a wafer-size crater  throbbed. Everything came back to me: how he shot me as I carried my books, how I bled on the lemon and loquat trees.

After that, I stopped buying fish from him. I refused his offerings. He drank a lot. One winter day, his wife knocked hard on our door. My husband has fallen, she said. I called an ambulance right away.

I went inside Kamals home and saw him slumped on the floor, white foam coming out of his mouth. He was gasping and smelled heavily of alcohol. The paramedics gave him an injection. I sensed they wanted money, so I gave them everything in my pocket, about 400 Syrian pounds.

Kamal survived that day. After a few months, we moved to another neighborhood. The war separated my family, and now Im in Germany. (I applied for asylum two years ago but havent received an answer.) I wear shorts in the summer, something I never did in Syria. Sometimes people ask about the scar. I usually say I fell down the stairs. Its a long story to tell in German, which Im struggling to learn.

I dont know if Kamal is alive or died of alcoholism or died in the siege of Yarmouk, when so many people starved. We all lost our homes and livelihoods in the war. We lost family and friends. Yarmouk is gone, and we are all refugees now.",[]

Its 2 a.m. The bar is closing. Republicans have had a series of strong and nasty Trump cocktails. Suddenly Ted Cruz is beginning to look kind of attractive. At least hes sort of predictable, and he doesnt talk about his sexual organs in presidential debates!









Well, Republicans, have your standards really fallen so low so fast? Are you really that desperate? Can you remember your 8 p.m. selves, and all the hope you had about entering a campaign with such a deep bench of talented candidates?

Back in the early evening, before the current panic set in, Republicans understood that Ted Cruz would be a terrible general election candidate, at least as unelectable as Donald Trump and maybe more so. He is the single most conservative Republican in Congress, far adrift from the American mainstream. Hes been doing well in primaries because of the support of extremely conservative voters in very conservative states, and he really hasnt broken out of that lane. His political profile is a slightly enlarged Rick Santorum but without the heart.

On policy grounds, he would be unacceptable to a large majority in this country. But his policy disadvantages are overshadowed by his public image ones. His rhetorical style will come across to young and independent voters as smarmy and oleaginous. In Congress, he had two accomplishments: the disastrous government shutdown and persuading all his colleagues to dislike him.

There is another path, one that doesnt leave you self-loathing in the morning. Its a long shot, but given the alternatives, its worth trying. First, hit the pause button on the rush to Cruz. Second, continue the Romneyesque assault on Trump. The results on Saturday, when late voters swung sharply against the Donald, suggest it may be working.

Third, work for a Marco Rubio miracle in Florida on March 15. Fourth, clear the field for John Kasich in Ohio. If Rubio and Kasich win their home states, Trump will need to take nearly 70 percent of the remaining delegates to secure a majority. That would be unlikely; hes only winning 44 percent of the delegates now.

The party would go to the convention without a clear nominee. It would be bedlam for a few days, but a broadly acceptable new option might emerge. It would be better than going into the fall with Trump, which would be a moral error, or Cruz, who in November would manage to win several important counties in Mississippi.

This isnt about winning the presidency in 2016 anymore. This is about something much bigger. Every 50 or 60 years, parties undergo a transformation. The G.O.P. is undergoing one right now. What happens this year will set the partys trajectory for decades.

Since Goldwater/Reagan, the G.O.P. has been governed by a free-market, anti-government philosophy. But over the ensuing decades new problems have emerged. First, the economy has gotten crueler. Technology is displacing workers and globalization is dampening wages. Second, the social structure has atomized and frayed, especially among the less educated. Third, demography is shifting.

Orthodox Republicans, seeing no positive role for government, have had no affirmative agenda to help people deal with these new problems. Occasionally some conservative policy mavens have proposed such an agenda  anti-poverty programs, human capital policies, wage subsidies and the like  but the proposals were killed, usually in the House, by the anti-government crowd.

The 1980s anti-government orthodoxy still has many followers; Ted Cruz is the extreme embodiment of this tendency. But it has grown increasingly rigid, unresponsive and obsolete.

Along comes Donald Trump offering to replace it and change the nature of the G.O.P. He tramples all over the anti-government ideology of modern Republicanism. He would replace the free-market orthodoxy with authoritarian nationalism.

He offers to use government on behalf of the American working class, but in negative and defensive ways: to build walls, to close trade, to ban outside groups, to smash enemies. According to him, Americas problems arent caused by deep structural shifts. Theyre caused by morons and parasites. The Great Leader will take them down.

If the G.O.P. is going to survive as a decent and viable national party, it cant cling to the fading orthodoxy Cruz represents. But it cant shift to ugly Trumpian nationalism, either. It has to find a third alternative: limited but energetic use of government to expand mobility and widen openness and opportunity. That is what Kasich, Rubio, Paul Ryan and others are stumbling toward.

Amid all the vulgarity and pettiness, that is what is being fought over this month: going back to the past, veering into an ugly future, or finding a third way. This is something worth fighting for, worth burning the boats behind you for.

The hour is late and the odds may be long. But there is still hope. Its a moment for audacity, not settling for Ted Cruz simply because hes the Titanic you know.",[]

That was Robert De Niros booth, Al Pacino would sit here, Johnny Depp and Kate Moss sat there.









Michael Cecchi-Azzolina, a short, excitable man sporting an early-Cher wig, gestured toward the booths and banquettes inside the packed bar area of Raouls, a French bistro and discreet celebrity hangout in SoHo that recently celebrated its 40th anniversary with an unusual dinner party that brought together regulars and former servers like himself.

I was a waiter here for 20 years, said Mr. Cecchi-Azzolina, who now runs the West Village restaurant Bobo. When asked why he stayed so long at one place, he spread his arms out and tried to embrace the room. This is all my family.

Its not often that you see waiters and busboys hugging patrons in a New York restaurant, but that was the rule at this epic 10-hour birthday bash that doubled as a family reunion for a SoHo institution that remains a refuge for the neighborhoods bohemian old guard.

Opened in 1975 by Serge Raoul, who was a sound man for France 2, and his brother Guy, who was a chef, Raouls is the rare family operation that caters to actual families, as well as waves of actors, producers, models, journalists, gallery owners, designers and other assorted downtown glitterati who have made this their living room for four decades.

Mr. Raoul, 78, is now retired and living in Nyack, N.Y. His son, Karim Raoul, 37, started managing in 2010 after his father had a stroke, and is keeping the familys social legacy alive.

We wanted the real regulars in tonight: those people who had 90 reservations and upwards, said Karim Raoul, as he made his way through the packed bar, shaking hands and squeezing shoulders of old friends. We have three generations of customers: the parents, the grandparents and the kids.

Raouls started off as a place for his fathers journalist friends to hang out after restaurants in the neighborhood, then quiet, shut down for the night. SoHo artists and dealers from the budding 1970s gallery scene adopted it as their boozy canteen. It got its first taste of celebrity a few months after opening, when a young TV producer named Lorne Michaels arrived with his troupe from Saturday Night Live.

I worked at S.N.L. from the inception with Lorne and John and Danny, said James Signorelli, 73, a producer on the show for decades, referring to John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. At that time we were finishing up our work at 11 p.m. and no one was serving. Then we discovered Raouls, and it was like going to heaven, and we were here midnight to 2 a.m. three nights a week.

Were there any memorable antics? I wish I could tell you, he said with a demurring grin.

Others were a tad more forthcoming. I get all weepy thinking about all the great times I had to pour myself out of here, said Barry Tubb, 52, an actor from Friday Night Lights who may be best known as Wolfman in Top Gun. Mr. Tubb had so many fond memories of Raouls, he flew in from Marfa, Tex., for the night. I first came here in 1985 with Kelly McGillis and we had dinner with Jennifer Beals, he said. Wow, it was like all the good things about New York in one room.

Though not officially an after-hours club, Raouls seemed to operate like one at the height of its popularity in the mid-1980s, led by a charismatic headwaiter at the time, Rob Jones. After midnight, Mr. Jones was known to descend the circular staircase in Dusty Springfield drag, lip-syncing and leading the crowd in dance that more than once ended with patrons shimmying naked on the bar.

The party ended abruptly when Mr. Jones died of AIDS in 1989. In the 1990s, Raouls became a hangout for members of the indie film set, with the producer and former Raouls waiter Laurence Bender bringing Quentin Tarantino and the Pulp Fiction cast to celebrate the movies debut at the New York Film Festival. Other regulars of that era included Sarah Jessica Parker, Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman.

But Serge Raoul did not set out to create a bacchanalian celebrity magnet. Indeed, the genesis of the place was something of a lark.

A colleague of his from French television, Jim Szalapski, took him to an Italian restaurant at 180 Prince Street at the time. They were so taken by the quaint spot that they approached the owner and jokingly said that they had heard that the business was for sale. The owner, who was ready to retire, liked them and sold the restaurant to Mr. Raoul for $15,000 with two odd conditions: the owners husband and their cat Inky could stay.

Mr. Raouls parents owned an upscale restaurant back in France, so he and his brother, Guy, decided to open a low-key bistro. The original idea was to try to create something where people could come, feel at home, said Guy Raoul, 65, who is still an owner of Raouls. A place to eat with their fingers if they wanted to and just give that nice leisurely atmosphere.

Like his father, Karim Raoul did not plan to get into the family business, studying filmmaking at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts a few blocks away. But in 1995, he started working weekends there, doing everything including washing dishes, assisting the butcher and waiting tables.

When he graduated, he took up residence in an apartment above the kitchen and, after a short stint running his own restaurant in Brooklyn and working in film, he returned to Raouls after his fathers stroke.

We come from a long legacy of people who didnt want anything to do with the restaurant business, he said, with a knowing smile.

As Raouls enters its fifth decade, Karim sees a bright future for the restaurant, even as he pursues filmmaking, directing a documentary about the changes in SoHo. The current chef, David Honeysett, has broadened the menu beyond traditional bistro fare to include seasonal dishes. But the steak au poivre remains firmly in place.

I think they drug everybody with that steak, Mr. Tubb said. I think the steak au poivre sauce has some kind of LSD effect on people and they have to have it. They crave it.",[]

Many people long to live near water for the pleasures of swimming, boating, fishing, or just to contemplate.

But, says Manu Prakash, a scientist at Stanford with broad interests, the surface of an alluring lake or pond, the boundary where water meets air, can be far less inviting for certain insects.

Water is about 100 times as viscous as air, and insects that live on its surface must somehow negotiate movement in both realms. Most seem to choose one or the other. Some, like long-legged water striders, maintain a small measure of distance from the water with a cushion of air that lets them skate on the surface. Others, like whirligig beetles, embrace the water and swim.

The lily pad beetle, which Dr. Prakash and his colleagues report on in The Journal of Experimental Biology, has evolved a unique solution to moving in water and air at the same time.

It flies, beating its wings for propulsion much as it would if it were taking off into the air. But it remains tethered to the water by claws at the end of its legs that break through the surface and act as anchors so a strong wing beat wont unexpectedly lift the beetle.

The movement is unusual, a bit like windsurfing, except that rather than having a sail to catch the wind, the beetle uses its wings to generate power.

Dr. Prakash runs a laboratory devoted to projects as varied as economical paper microscopes, water computers and biophysics. He conducted the study of the lily pad beetle with Haripriya Mukundarajan and Dong Hyun Kim at Stanford and Thibaut C. Bardon of the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris. He described the research as just good old natural history, with a large dose of physics.

It began some years ago when he saw, on a pond, something that moved so fast that I couldnt actually see it. He stayed for a couple of hours trying to track the culprit down and finally found the beetle, which eats holes in lily pads and zips from one to the other on the waters surface.

He thought its technique was a great way to move around and had a hunch that the physics would be intriguing. And he was attracted, he said, to a creature that had really claimed this harsh environment.

With high speed video and mathematical analysis of the movements and forces involved, the team made several discoveries.

The beetles legs repel water, which keeps it afloat, except for claws at their tips, which penetrate the surface of the water and tie it to the surface.

As the beetle flies, or surfs, the up and down force of its wings and the attachment of the claws make the surface of the water bounce up and down like a trampoline. The tips of the wings almost touch the surface of the water, and the beetle copes with aerodynamics, surface tension and another kind of drag that appears only when the insect is moving faster than about nine inches a second. The beetle actually travels close to a foot a second. Its called capillary wave drag.

The whole system, Dr. Prakash said, is right at the edge of chaos, mathematically speaking. A chaotic system is one so complicated that given the initial conditions, one cant predict what is going to happen. One way or another, the beetle manages to navigate this environment.

The self-powered surfing actually demands more energy than fully airborne flight, which the beetle can also do. It seems to prefer this sort of locomotion. Dr. Prakash said that may be because its a good way to find new food sources, or because predators havent figured it out.

He said that he and his colleagues were now turning to a fly that seemed to do something similar but in the sea. There are, of course, ways that one could imagine applying the findings to robotics, but the research really was done, he said, for pure scientific curiosity.

One thing the remarkable beetle did not evolve is a braking system. In the lab, it runs into the edge of a dish and just topples over. On a pond, Dr. Prakash said, they seem to stop the same way.

They hit the leaf, he said.

nytimes.com,2013-06-22 00:00:00,Champion at Opera Theater of Saint Louis,['Vivien Schweitzer'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

ST. LOUIS  Toward the end of Terence Blanchards Champion, which received its premiere this week at the Opera Theater of Saint Louis here, the protagonist, Emile Griffith, relives the terror of being attacked by homophobic thugs. I killed a man and the world forgives me; I love a man and the world wants to kill me, he sings despairingly.









That line in Michael Cristofers libretto was inspired by a quote from the real Emile Griffith, the world welterweight champion who killed the boxer Benny Paret, known as the Kid, during a bout in 1962. Some 50 years later, with a spate of attacks against gay people in New York City and the N.B.A.s Jason Collins becoming the first openly gay athlete active in a major American team sport, the opera certainly strikes a resonant chord.

Mr. Blanchard, a jazz musician who has written scores for some 50 films and composed for Broadway shows, had never written for singers before Champion, the 24th premiere that Opera Theater (which commissioned the work with Jazz St. Louis) has presented in 38 seasons. Mr. Blanchard has described the work, scored for full orchestra and jazz trio, as an opera in jazz. Remarkably, its the second opera with a boxing connection to receive its premiere this month, following the Washington National Operas thoughtful Approaching Ali at the Kennedy Center. That work was billed as a family opera in one act, but much of the profanity-heavy Champion libretto isnt suitable for a family newspaper.

Photo

The opera takes place in 10 rapidly shifting scenes that unfold with cinematic fluidity, opening with the elderly Emile, poignantly rendered by Arthur Woodley, struggling to get dressed. The real Mr. Griffith, who has dementia, now lives in a nursing home on Long Island. The operatic Emile, like the living Mr. Griffith, is assisted by his adopted son, Luis Rodrigo Griffith (sung by Brian Arreola).

On the day he is to meet Benny Paret Jr., son of his dead opponent, he relives his past in a series of flashbacks, beginning with a carnival scene in his boyhood home in the Virgin Islands.

The production, directed by James Robinson, is visually a treat, with Allen Moyers sets and James Schuettes colorful costumes framed by digital images and video. The young Emile initially hoped to become a hat maker; in one alluring scene a group of female hat makers unfold ribbons to create a boxing ring, a neat segue way into the following scene. Emelda Griffith, Emiles delinquent, foul-mouthed, glamorous mother  brilliantly enacted by the mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves  pulls up in a yellow convertible and confuses her son with another of her seven abandoned children. The mezzo-soprano Meredith Arwady offered a powerful performance as Kathy Hagen, the boisterous owner of a gay bar frequented by drag queens.

The comic interludes are in contrast to the many poignant elements of the narrative, like Emiles abandonment of his wife (expressively sung by Chabrelle Williams), his confusion about his sexuality, and the dramatic duet between Emile and Benny Paret (an effective Victor Ryan Robertson), seen here in a coma on his death bed after the match.

George Manahan conducted the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra in a confident performance of the jazz-inflected score, woven through with bluesy harmonies and Afro-Caribbean beats. The music at times sounded thin and the dramatic pace sometimes flagged, but over all the scores cinematic flow aptly complemented the action on stage.

Mr. Blanchard included several introspective arias for the main characters, including one for the young Emile, convincingly portrayed by Aubrey Allicock. A boy soprano, Jordan Jones, vividly represented Emile as a child.

In an aria before the famous fight, in which the real-life Emile Griffith was taunted about his sexuality by his opponent, the operatic Emile muses: What makes a man a man?

In the last act Emile asks for forgiveness during the visit with Bennys son, who tells the old man that he needs to forgive himself. Emile finally does, the drama coming full circle as his emotional conflict gives way to his mundane, but equally poignant, struggle to dress himself.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,Art as Collateral in a Fickle Market,['Scott Reyburn'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

LONDON  Art and money have long been closely linked, but in the 21st century, it seems, the two have become synonymous.









One way to extract the latter from the former is art-based lending, in which paintings or sculptures are used as collateral for loans. Now that the notoriously fickle and opaque art market is seemingly headed toward a downturn, with money tighter and the prices of many artworks lower, will this kind of niche financing become more attractive to collectors?

Carlyle Group, the private-equity behemoth, certainly thinks so. In October, the company started Athena Art Finance Corporation, a collaboration with Banque Pictet that would use $280 million of Carlyle equity to enable owners of high-end art to tap the liquidity of their collections.

Crucially, Athena is offering nonrecourse loans, exclusively secured by art works rather than other assets. Those loans can be attractive to borrowers, because the lender can lay claim only to the art in the event of a default.

Art lenders who have offered full-recourse loans, secured by a range of personal assets, have faced unfavorable publicity. During the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the photographer Annie Leibovitz pledged her four homes and the rights to her images to secure a $24 million loan from Art Capital. She was unable to service the debt, and a high-profile court action ensued.

This is an opportunity, Andrea Danese, a co-founder of Athena and the companys chief executive, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Danese said there was potentially about $150 billion worth of art in private hands that could be collateralized. He identified three groups to whom his companys products might appeal.

First, there are billionaires who put the money into private equity deals, where they make 20 to 25 percent, he said. Then there are collectors with, say, $30 million of art they leverage to buy another piece. And thirdly there are the art-rich and cash-poor in their 70s and 80s who dont want to sell because of capital gains or estate taxes.

Athena offers loans of at least $1 million over six months to seven years based on a maximum of 50 percent of the low valuation of a collection or artwork. It typically charges annual interest of 7 to 9 percent, including origination fees.

Athena is just one of two big self-financed lenders offering nonrecourse loans secured by art. Falcon Fine Art in London is the other. Since opening in January 2015, Falcon has arranged about $50 million in loans against high-value artworks, again at annual interest rates of about 7 to 9 percent.

Larger banks, even those with art advisory facilities like Citi Private Bank, offer full-recourse loans to wealthy clients for as little as 2.5 to 3 percent a year, said Paul Ress, the managing director of the art lender Right Capital in London.

Art lending is quite limited because of the affordability conundrum, he said. If youre a high-net-worth individual, you dont need to use art solely as collateral for a loan.

But art lenders, like pawnbrokers, can get a boost when markets dip.

On Monday in New York, the evening session of Phillipss New Now auction of contemporary art, designed to kick-start the week of the Armory Show, contained a meager 23 lots, 13 of which managed to sell, raising just $1.7 million. The only work that was sold significantly above its estimate was a 1983 Jean-Michel Basquiat drawing of a snarling dogs head, estimated at $80,000 to $120,000, which drew the nights top price of $257,000.

There is a process of attrition at the moment. Its cyclical, and its healthy for the market, said the Los Angeles entrepreneur Carlos Rivera, the founder of Art Rank, a website that uses algorithms to analyze contemporary artists as stocks to be bought, held or sold.

Mr. Rivera has a new venture, Levart, that  much like the new-age pawnbrokers Borro  aims to provide liquidity at a much lower level of the market than Athena. Levart says it can provide nonrecourse financing within 12 hours, if backed by suitable contemporary works valued at as little as $5,000.

The monthly interest is a hefty 4 percent for loans under $250,000. But that has not deterred art insiders from using the site to finance profitable short-term resales.

Levart cites, for example, the $20,000 borrowed by a client to buy Newz!, a 2014 painting by the Los Angeles artist Math Bass. The work was then sold at Phillips in November for $81,250 against a low estimate of $25,000, reflecting the original purchase price.

If the market does take a serious dip, lenders believe they can play a role in preventing a fire sale. People dont want to sell when things are going down in value, said Tim Hunter, the vice president of Falcon Fine Art, but they might need to take liquidity out of their collection.

Wealthy art buyers certainly took plenty of liquidity out of their collections last year at Sothebys. Throughout 2015, the auction houses finance division had an average of $733 million of full-recourse loans on its books, generating $65 million of income, according to fourth-quarter results released on Feb. 26.

Those figures might not seem much compared to the companys $6 billion in auction sales, but Sothebys 2015 auction commissions of $719 million were 5 percent less than in 2014, while income from financing rose 38 percent.

For many, art collecting today is all about maximizing returns on an investment portfolio. But an auction in France last month is a reminder of the premium buyers place on collections put together without commercial considerations.

On Feb. 22 and 23, the Paris auctioneer Artcurial sold the collection of Pierre Hebey, a French intellectual property lawyer who died last year at 89. The sale raised 8.9 million euros, about $9.8 million, well above the estimate of 6 million, with 85 percent of the 564 lots sold. Top price was the 845,000 paid for Roberto Mattas 1938 surrealist painting Morphologie Psychologique de lAngoisse.

Hebey, who counted Max Ernst and Marc Chagall among his friends, had been well-positioned to acquire 20th century art. But he was also a lifelong collector of Art Deco, 19th-century bronzes and other antiques, and he could often be found at flea markets around Paris, flashlight in hand, at five in the morning.

One of his most striking purchases was Emmanuel Fremiets gilded bronze sculpture Pelican Gastronome, showing the bird feeding its chicks, commissioned in 1890 by the president of the Banque de France. The Petit Palais museum in Paris bought the work at the Artcurial auction for 76,200.

Fabien Naudan, the vice president of Artcurial, explained why he thought buyers were so eager to bid at the Hebey sale.

They were trying to buy part of his life, said Mr. Naudan, who added that Mr. Hebey was motivated as a collector solely by his love of an object. People are ready to pay much more for this charge emotionnelle.

How much? Maybe 20 percent, Mr. Naudan suggested.

The financial industry sometimes classifies art as an investment of passion. Paradoxically, passion, rather than portfolio planning, seems to be the thing that ensures above-average financial returns.",[]

Kenneth had a moment of global fame about a year ago after sharing the Cheryls Birthday problem, a simple challenge that went wildly viral (covered in Numberplay here). The problem generated quite a storm on Twitter, including suggestions for more puzzles. I asked Kenneth if he had a favorite, and he pointed to a suggestion by Igor Diev, who introduces his puzzle this way: Frankly speaking, the task of #cherylsbirthday youve showed the world is rather easy and its a shame to be unable to solve it. Let me give you a task that Russian 14-year-old students solve. Thats what should really blow your mind.

Well, nothing activates the neurons like a playful taunt. Lets try 



Ali Babas Cave

Ali Baba found a cave full of gold and diamonds. A bag full of gold weighs 200 kilograms, a bag full of diamonds weighs 40 kilograms. Ali Baba can carry only 100 kilograms at a time. A kilogram of gold costs $20, and a kilogram of diamonds costs $60. What is the greatest amount of money Ali Baba can earn for the gold and diamonds he can carry out at once (in one attempt in one bag)?

Paris  Twenty-five years ago, in February 1991, the leaders of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary met in Visegrad, a Hungarian town overlooking the Danube. Those three countries had recently broken free of the Soviet bloc; their newly elected leaders, Lech Walesa, Vaclav Havel and Jozsef Antall, had taken an active part in the liberation. Two, Mr. Havel and Mr. Walesa, had been jailed for their activities.









The Visegrad meeting had one central purpose: to accelerate the integration of the three countries into a free, democratic and prosperous Europe, through NATO and what was then the European Economic Community of 12 member states. Western European leaders looked favorably on the Visegrad Group: Central Europeans could practice regional cooperation before joining the adults group of what would become the European Union.

Visegrad was where the kings of Bohemia, Hungary and Poland parlayed in 1335. Since then, these nations had gone through many wars and occupations, their borders redrawn several times, or even dissolved altogether.

Today, the Visegrad bloc is experiencing a resurgence of sorts. In a splintering familiar to Central Europe, the Visegrad Three became four: Czechoslovakia ceased to exist in 1993, giving way to the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

All four joined the European Union in 2004. But when they get together today, it is to fight the union. Over the centuries, they have been dominated by Prussia, Austria, Germany and Russia; in 2016, the common enemy is Brussels. To Western Europeans, it is unsettling to see a new East-West divide emerging, threatening to fracture the European Union itself.

The Visegrad countries opposition to Brussels is different from Britains. They dont want to leave the union, they just refuse to abide by some of its rules. The Romanian-born French political scientist Pierre Hassner has reminded us of the concept of collective neurosis, a notion devised by the Hungarian philosopher Istvan Bibo in his 1946 book The Misery of the Small Eastern European States. Bibo described the existential angst of Eastern and Central European states leading sometimes to political hysteria.

Political hysteria reigns today over the European Commission initiative to assign refugee quotas to each member state. Mr. Havel and Mr. Antall, the voices of reason, have passed away. Mr. Walesa, the hero of the Solidarity movement, is fighting accusations of collaborating with Polands former Communist authorities. In parliamentary elections in Slovakia, where Prime Minister Robert Fico has indulged in fierce anti-immigrant rhetoric, a far-right party with neo-Nazi ties just won 14 seats.

The new rulers in Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava and Budapest flatly refuse Muslim refugees. They dont want the ethnic, religious and cultural homogeneity of their societies to change. They see multiculturalism as a failed model.

Hearing such messages from Donald J. Trump or Marine Le Pen is bad enough, but from the leaders of these new democracies?

The way these leaders practice democracy, bending the rule of law as far as they can within an elected government, is equally unsettling to the older democracies of Western Europe. Another French political scientist, the Czech-born Jacques Rupnik, has identified two converging trends.

We are witnessing a democratic regression and identity-related tensions on migration, and both phenomena are strengthening each other, he told me. The same nationalist conservative authoritarianism at work in domestic politics also applies to the response to the refugee crisis, notably different from the European Commissions and most other member states responses.

Once the poster children of post-Communist transition, these countries were not supposed to take such a turn. With its so-called goulash socialism, Hungary was the most liberal of the Soviet satellites and eased peacefully into democratic rule. Poland was more restless, but once it had been the catalyst for the collapse of Communism, it managed the shock therapy of moving to a market economy with impressive discipline. The Czechs and Slovaks, it was hoped, would behave as Mr. Havels enlightened heirs.

But no Communist country had ever experienced these radical shifts to democracy and market economics. Only Czechoslovakia had enjoyed genuine democratic rule, between the two world wars. The end of the Cold War made Europeans euphoric: Once democratic institutions were built, free elections held and centralized economies replaced with capitalist ones, everyone assumed the job was done.

Joining NATO and the European Union was the icing on the cake. In 2008, with end of history hubris, a World Bank report proclaimed that the transition was over. Mission accomplished.

Obviously, it was not. The effort to transform the economy was so demanding for the new democratic elites that little attention was paid to nurturing a new political culture. Modern Hungarian and Polish politics look riven with the legacy of Communism, trouble with sharing power, conspiracy theories and exclusionary discourse toward opponents.

Another, overlooked, factor is that most people in these countries are still poor. Despite nonstop economic growth since 1992, Polands gross domestic product is only 68 percent of the European Unions per capita average. When Polands foreign minister, Witold Waszczykowski, says the world should not move in one single direction  toward a new mix of cultures and races, a world of cyclists and vegetarians  he is rejecting the progressive social values perceived as part of the Western European economic model.

The Visegrad bloc has welcomed European Union subsidies, so crucial to their development. But we in Old Europe never really insisted that a democratic culture and diversity were also part of the deal; we didnt think we had to.

Is the rise of so-called illiberal democracy threatening the unions cohesion? Maybe. But Euroskeptic populist movements are far from a purely Central European phenomenon; they are also on the move in the unions founding member states. Twenty-five years after the Visegrad summit, Europe is still searching for unity  but the mood has shifted: from solidarity to recrimination.",[]

nytimes.com,,How Do I Find and Operate Across Lite in Windows 8?,[],"If you are upgrading your PC to Windows 8 (which will not have the familiar Start button), here are some helpful hints from LitSoft on how to find Across Lite on your computer, as well as information on whether or not you need to download Across Lite again. Please note that Across Lite has been fully tested in the new Windows 8 environment, and we have been assured that it works.

If you are upgrading an existing installation of Windows 7, it may or may not be necessary to download and install Across Lite again depending on how you upgrade. If you do not see Across Lite in the Home Screen, download and install again. The free download can be found here.

From LitSoft:

As you might already know, Windows 8 has changed its user interface somewhat and may create some confusion as to where to find the Across Lite program after installation (Windows 8 does not have the Start menu in the desktop view). The following might help in answering any questions you may have.

1. Across Lite v2.x for Windows as currently distributed is completely compatible with Windows 8. Across Lite is NOT available for Windows 8 on tablets yet, only on desktops and laptops. Use of a mouse is recommended rather than a touch screen on desktops and laptops that do come with a touch screen.

2. The installation process is the same as before. Simply download the installation program currently being distributed and run it to install Across Lite.

3. Windows 8 has two different usage modes. The first is a tiled screen where applications are seen as square/rectangular tiles. This is the screen Windows 8 boots to and is called the Home/Start Screen. There are apps that run in this screen and designed for it. Regular apps like Across Lite run in a desktop screen that looks like the Windows 7 screen.

When Across Lite is installed, a tile is created on the Home screen with the Across Lite icon in it. One may have to scroll this screen to the right to see it depending on how many programs you have installed. Clicking on this tile will launch Across Lite in the desktop mode which will look identical to Windows 7 screen (except for no Start button  you can think of the Home Screen as the Start menu for Windows 8). Clicking the Windows key in the keyboard in the desktop mode brings up the Home Screen with the tiles.

One of the tiles in the Home screen is to get to the desktop/laptop mode. The tile will display the wall paper that is used to identify it. This tile and the Windows button on the keyboard is used to switch back and forth between the two modes.

So the most likely question while you get used to the Windows 8 interface will be Where is my Across Lite that I installed on my PC?

First, please make sure that you have installed Across Lite by running the downloaded installation file. The process for this is the same as in earlier Windows downloading via the web browser.

If you have run the installation program, go to the Home screen (the tiled screen) if not already there and look for a tile with the Across Lite icon in it. Click it to start Across Lite. Once again, think of the tiled Home screen as the equivalent of Start->Programs in earlier versions.

Downloading a crossword after installing Across Lite will automatically start Across Lite with the puzzle loaded just as before. No further configuration is necessary.

But Deb, if I am upgrading to Windows 8 from Windows 7, do I really need to re-download and re-install Across Lite?

The safest answer is YES, although for a few people the upgrade will have moved the programs as well. However, weve been told that a re-install will not hurt. For new Windows 8 PCs, of course, please download and install Across Lite the same way as in Windows 7.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-02 00:00:00,"Young Africans, Wrapped in Tradition",['Whitney Richardson'],"The young woman sat proudly, firmly placing her hand below her chin to profile her face. Colorful silk fabric was neatly wrapped around her chest, while the studio light and golden backdrop bathed her gently oiled skin. Small circular tribal markings were tattooed on her upper body. Her neck and wrists were adorned with layers of beaded jewelry.

Just a few hours before, she had been wearing jeans, a button-up shirt and stiletto heels.

This transformation was spurred by Joana Choumali, a photographer from Ivory Coast who has been documenting modern African women wearing their familys traditional clothing. She said these portraits allow her subjects to reconnect with their family history in a physical way.

Even if we dont speak the language or dont go to the village every day, we are still African, Ms. Choumali said. I think its time to redefine what being African is.

That motivation came from her own experiences. Ms. Choumali, 41, was born and raised in Abidjan  Ivory Coasts economic capital and West Africas most populous French-speaking city. She attended international schools and was surrounded by students from all over the world.

But at least once a year, her family would travel to Adaou, a small town in the southeast, to visit her paternal grandmother, Ettien Amalan Louise. The visits were brief, and Ms. Choumali often felt a cultural disconnect with her grandmother: They didnt speak the same language or have relatable life experiences. Ms. Choumali eventually got a top-level job at an ad agency, while her grandmother spent her life in the village working as a farmer and a trader.

When her grandmother died in 2001, Ms. Choumali realized how much of her family history would be lost because she had not been able to talk with her about her life.

I felt like a part of me was going and part of my family was fading away, she said. For a long time, I felt guilty. I thought, I dont speak the language, maybe Im not that African.

Photo

In her portrait series, Resilients, which was recently featured at the Photolux Festival in Lucca, Italy, sponsored by the African Artist Foundation, Ms. Choumali sought to document young, professional African women  mostly Ivorian  who also struggled with the lingering guilt of not being able to relate to their familys traditional past. Over the course of several months, each portrait session required intense research on the specific details of how the clothes, jewelry, skin and hair needed to be styled based on the specific tribe the family was from.

She initially found most of her subjects  lawyers, students, doctors and managers  on the streets of Abidjan. Her sole requirement for the portrait was that the women had to wear traditional clothing already worn by their grandmother or an older female relative. This was intended to emphasize the link between past and present, and also the cultural heritage, Ms. Choumali said. Inspired by the golden hues of Rembrandts paintings, she handmade a backdrop to give the portraits a feeling of time travel, she said.

Ms. Choumalis interest in portrait photography began when she was 13; like many West African families, her parents hired a professional photographer to do a traditional family portrait at home. That same year, she received a camera for Christmas and said she had since been exploring how photography can address social issues. After quitting her job as an art director in an advertising agency, she became a full-time freelance photographer and has created her own studio in Abidjan.

Over the course of her Resilient series, women began reaching out to her to participate. Of her more than 30 subjects, a student studying in France came to her studio with her mother wearing a miniskirt and Converse sneakers. They had descended from the royal family of Grand Bassam, a city that was briefly the French colonial capital in the late 19th century. She had asked the king of Grand Bassam if she could wear her great-grandmothers outfit for the portrait session (image above).

The mother was so emotional, Ms. Choumali said. We dont even know why we cried, but the energy was really special. I feel that they were feeling the same feeling as I felt  relieved and kind of reassured that they were also part of their culture.

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Republican Delegate Math Favors Donald Trump After Latest Wins,['Trip Gabriel'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Donald J. Trump drew closer to grasping the Republican presidential nomination with his victories in three states Tuesday night, and the chances of party leaders wresting it from his hands at a contested convention were a bit remoter on Wednesday.









By winning Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii, Mr. Trump captured the greatest share of the 150 delegates at stake Tuesday, and his mathematical path to a majority of 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination is increasingly brighter than his rivals. He needs about 54 percent of outstanding delegates; his closest rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, needs 62 percent.

But Mr. Trump gained something even more valuable than delegates on Tuesday: momentum as the race heads into a watershed moment, March 15, when the first states that award delegates winner-take-all hold their primaries. They include Senator Marco Rubios home state, Florida, and Gov. John R. Kasichs, Ohio. Both men now have their backs to the wall, fighting for their political lives.

The only person that has a shot of getting 1,237 is us given how well we did last night, said Barry Bennett, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, who is closely tracking the delegate race for him. He said the clock is ticking on other candidates but not necessarily on us.

After Florida and Ohio, Mr. Bennett said, if we win both those states, Cruz will be 300 delegates behind. The winner-take-all states are the rocket fuel.

Mr. Cruz did better than polls predicted in Michigan and Mississippi, and he won a commanding victory in Idaho. In all, he netted an estimated 57 delegates to Mr. Trumps 71.

But Mr. Cruz, who trails Mr. Trump in delegates awarded so far by an estimated 462 to 358, is facing a primary map of big states in the North and West that are demographically more favorable to Mr. Trump. He seemed to acknowledge the difficulty of overtaking Mr. Trump before the convention even if the race becomes the two-man contest he has long sought.

Look, Reagan and Ford battled it out in a contested convention, Mr. Cruz told Fox News in an interview released on Wednesday morning. Thats what conventions are for.

Tuesdays results were a reversal for Mr. Cruz, who performed well in four states that voted on Saturday, winning two, Kansas and Maine, and emerging ahead of Mr. Trump in the days delegate haul.

Mr. Kasichs third-place finish in Michigan, a blow after he predicted as late as Tuesday night that he would come in second, is a sign of potential trouble for him in Ohio because of the demographic similarity of the two states.

Mr. Kasichs chief strategist, John Weaver, sought to make the case that the governor was in a good position as the nominating race moves away from the South.

After March 15, more than 1,000 delegates will still be available, and the electoral map shifts significantly in our favor, with the delegate-rich states fitting Governor Kasichs profile, Mr. Weaver wrote in a strategy memo late Tuesday.

But even if Mr. Kasich wins Ohio and its 66 delegates, along with some of the others at stake on the same day in Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina, his chances of gaining a majority of 1,237 is close to a mathematical impossibility. Only 1,000 delegates will remain after March 15.

His path to the nomination during regulation time, primary season, is narrow enough to be invisible, said Joshua T. Putnam, a political science lecturer at the University of Georgia with an expertise in delegate selection. His only path is to survive with some delegates into the convention.

Similarly, Mr. Rubio is facing a daunting mathematical roadblock. In failing to reach 15 percent of the votes in Michigan and Mississippi, and 20 percent in Idaho, he was shut out of delegates entirely in the three states holding primaries on Tuesday. He may have picked up only as few as two in Hawaii.

Mr. Trumps rivals seized on a new poll from The Wall Street Journal and NBC News on Tuesday showing a tight race among all four candidates in states that had not yet held primaries or caucuses. Mr. Trump was the favorite of 27 percent of likely Republican primary voters in those states. Mr. Cruz was favored by 25 percent, Mr. Kasich 24 percent and Mr. Rubio 23 percent.

The poll also suggested that if the race were to narrow to a one-on-one contest, Mr. Trump could be in trouble. In two-person matchups, all of Mr. Trumps three rivals were preferred by voters.

Next week will give us our first real clear indication, Mr. Putnam said. If Trump is shut out in Florida and Ohio, that portends a long battle in a race for a plurality rather than a majority.

On Tuesday, Mr. Kasich said that if Mr. Trump had a plurality of delegates coming into the convention, but fewer than a majority, the Republican party should not assume he deserves the nomination.

Its like being in school and you know that a 90 is an A and you get to 88 and everybody else is below you, he said. We dont grade on a curve when it comes to conventions.

But Republicans would be playing with fire if Mr. Trump is leading the delegate race and is denied the nomination at a contested convention.

It would tear the party in two, Mr. Bennett said. Whoever gave his sham acceptance speech would be doing it to a lot of empty chairs.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,ISIS Detainee Tells U.S. of Militants Plan to Use Mustard Gas,"['Helene Cooper', 'Eric Schmitt']","Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

WASHINGTON  An Islamic State detainee currently in American custody at a temporary detention facility in Erbil, Iraq, is a specialist in chemical weapons whom American military officials are questioning about the militant Sunni groups plans to use the banned substances in Iraq and Syria, defense officials said.









The detainee was identified by officials as Sleiman Daoud al-Afari, a chemical and biological weapons expert who once worked for Saddam Husseins Military Industrialization Authority.

Mr. al-Afari, described by the military as a significant Islamic State operative who was captured a month ago by commandos in an elite American Special Operations force, has, under interrogation, provided his captors with details about how the group had weaponized mustard gas into powdered form and loaded it into artillery shells, the officials said.

One official said that the gas was not concentrated enough to kill anyone, but that it could maim people.

As is protocol, Defense Department officials notified the International Committee of the Red Cross, which monitors the treatment of detainees, that they were holding an Islamic State fighter. The Red Cross acknowledged in a statement on Tuesday that it had visited the detainee but gave no other information.

Defense Department officials insist that the United States had no plans to hold the detainee or any other captives indefinitely, and that they would be handed over to the Iraqi and Kurdish authorities after they had been interviewed. The officials say they did not intend to establish a long-term American facility to hold Islamic State detainees, and Obama administration officials have ruled out sending any to the United States military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Mr. al-Afari was captured last month, shortly after the arrival in Iraq of a new Special Operations force that is made up primarily of Delta Force commandos. They are the first major American combat force on the ground there since the United States pulled out of the country at the end of 2011.

Before this, the American military has largely fought the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, with airstrikes, killing large numbers of Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria. But the 200-member Special Operations team has been given the task of killing and capturing Islamic State operatives, the latter in particular to use in gathering intelligence.

Defense officials said the team had set up safe houses and worked with Iraqi and Kurdish forces to establish informant networks and conduct raids on Islamic State leaders and other important militants.

Senior Defense Department officials say the model for handling Mr. al-Afari came from a Delta Force raid last May, when two dozen American commandos from Iraq entered eastern Syria aboard Black Hawk helicopters and V-22 Ospreys, killed a man known as Abu Sayyaf, described by American officials as the Islamic States emir for oil and gas.

Abu Sayyafs wife, Umm Sayyaf, was captured and taken to a screening facility in northern Iraq, where she was questioned and detained. American forces seized laptop computers, cellphones and other materials from the site.

Umm Sayyaf was kept for three months by the American authorities and provided them with information, officials said. Last August, she was transferred to Kurdish custody, and last month the Justice Department filed an arrest warrant charging her with conspiring to provide material support to the Islamic State in an offense that officials said resulted in the death of Kayla Mueller, the American aid worker who was killed in Syria in February 2014.

Officials say that Umm Sayyaf provided information on the Islamic States kidnap-for-ransom networks.

The United States has long suspected the Islamic State of using sulfur mustard, a chemical warfare agent, and last year officials said that they had confirmed the presence of the mustard gas on fragments of ordnance used in Islamic State attacks in Syria and Iraq. Laboratory tests, which were also performed on scraps of clothing from victims, showed the presence of a partially degraded form of HD, also known as distilled sulfur mustard, a substance banned internationally that burns a victims skin, airways and eyes.

Chemical warfare agents, broadly condemned and banned by most nations under international convention, are indiscriminate. They are also difficult to defend against without specialized equipment, which many of the Islamic States foes in Iraq and Syria lack, and they are worrisome as potential terrorist weapons, though chlorine and blister agents are typically less lethal than bullets, shrapnel or explosives.

It was unclear how the Islamic State obtained sulfur mustard, a banned substance with a narrow chemical warfare application. Both the former government in Iraq and the current government in Syria previously possessed chemical warfare programs.",[]

Oh, yes, theyre just politicians. This is how they think, and this is who they are. And thats why Donald Trump is killing them.









Trump may be many things, but he is not much of a politician, at least in any traditional sense. Everyone else on the Republican debate stage last night was. I almost forgot that for a few hours. It was easy to lose sight of amid the high dudgeon over Trump from so many prominent Republicans. There were so many frantic declarations that Trump was a liar/know-nothing/potentially catastrophic con man, and whatever else Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio were throwing at La Grande Orange in Detroit last night.

But in the end, the Republican debate came down to the one question I really wanted answered by the non-Trumpeters: Would they still commit to supporting the nominee of the Republican Party, even if he were Donald Trump? I mean, if he were as pure evil as they have been suggesting, shouldnt that, er, trump whatever musty notions of party loyalty they still cling to?

Even with all the breathless predictions of catastrophe from many Republicans in recent weeks, relatively few elected officials have actually come out and said they would not support Trump in November under any circumstances  whether that meant staying home, holding out for some still-unseen third-party alternative or actually pulling the lever for Hillary Clinton. Governor Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska and the former New Jersey governor, Christie Whitman, have all said they would choose one of those alternatives. Im sure there have been others, but not many. The band has been more of an a cappella group than a full orchestra to this point. That would have changed instantly had Cruz, Rubio or John Kasich actually joined them, which I would have thought  given some of the scorched-earth rhetoric  at least Cruz and Rubio would be ready to do.

But nuh-uh. All three of them answered the question by reiterating their vow to support the Republican nominee, even if it were Trump. Wow. This was the moment where Vince McMahon and all the W.W.E. performers came out and assured everyone not to worry, that they would never let things get really out of hand here. They were all just following a script and putting on the same old show.

If it were Trump in second or third place, and he felt as aggrieved as Rubio and Cruz supposedly do, there is no way he would promise to support the nominee. No way. Thats not how he thinks. He is not constrained by orthodoxy. And again, its probably a big reason hes winning. On the other hand, Im sure the non-Trumps were all thinking about what it might mean for their political futures if they said they would not support the nominee. Perhaps they want to run again, in 2020 or whenever, and want to remain pure in the eyes of the people who still define pure by fealty to whoever has the R next to his or her name. Whatever. Given all the noise and delirium of recent weeks  and some of the things Trump has also said about Cruz and Rubio  this still struck me as a monumental walk-back.

For his part, Rubio had even taken to selling #NeverTrump T-shirts and stickers on his campaign website, punctuating tweets with #NeverTrump and, as recently as yesterday, posting a #NeverTrump image on Instagram. That should now be amended to a hashtag version of Never Trump  unless hes the nominee of this party, which is a much better than average possibility, so Im covering my backside.

Or better yet, just change the hashtag to #NeverMind.",[]

If all goes to plan, a postponed mission to probe beneath the surface of Mars will launch in two years, NASA announced Wednesday.

The InSight spacecraft was to head to space this month, but in December, NASA delayed the mission when it realized that there was not enough time to fix stubborn leaks in a vacuum enclosure housing a key instrument.

NASA is now aiming to launch InSight in May 2018, the next time that Earth and Mars are close enough to allow a quick six-month trip. (Because Mars is farther from the Sun than Earth and orbits more slowly, the two planets line up just once every 26 months.)

Im thrilled, said W. Bruce Banerdt, a planetary geophysicist at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who is the missions principal investigator. We were hoping we would get the opportunity to give this another try.

InSight  a shortening of Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport  would land on Mars on Nov. 26, 2018.

However, the space agency does not yet know exactly how much the delay would add to the missions $675 million cost. Dr. Banerdt said his team had given officials at NASA headquarters a rough estimate on the order of $150 million, more or less.

Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Science Times Newsletter Every week, we'll bring you stories that capture the wonders of the human body, nature and the cosmos.

CNES, the French space agency, is in charge of the seismic instrument that turned troublesome.

InSight is designed to listen to what is going on in the deep interior of the planet including the shaking of tiny quakes. Measuring the change of velocity of seismic waves as they pass through the planet could also offer clues about Marss crust, mantle and core.

The three seismometers in the instrument, sensitive enough to detect movements as small as half the radius of a hydrogen atom, require a near-perfect vacuum to operate with precision. Tests in August revealed a small leak in the enclosure, a flattened sphere about nine inches wide. Engineers attempted to patch it, but the leak persisted.

NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managing the mission, is to redesign and build a new enclosure.

Dr. Banerdt will travel to NASA headquarters in Washington in about six months to present a more detailed cost estimate and report on the fixes. Theyll be watching that very closely and making sure were making good progress, he said.

NASA officials could still cancel the mission, but Dr. Banerdt said he was extremely optimistic that InSight would get off the ground.

Last month, Lockheed Martin, which built InSight, shipped the spacecraft back from the launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California to Denver, where it is now being prepared for storage.",[]

MIAMI  Carly Fiorina endorsed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas on Wednesday, supplying his campaign with a high-profile supporter and an eager critic of Donald J. Trump.

Mrs. Fiorina, the former presidential candidate and Hewlett-Packard chief executive, took to the role quickly, appearing as a surprise guest at Mr. Cruzs morning rally in Florida.

Some people are now saying: Well, Donald Trump wouldnt be so bad. O.K., maybe hes a liberal, maybe hes a fraud but at least hes a deal-maker,' Mrs. Fiorina told a crowd of about 200 people. The truth is that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are two sides of the same coin. They arent going to reform the system. They are the system.

For Mr. Cruz, who has increasingly moved to frame the primary season as a two-man race against Mr. Trump, the endorsement provides a crucial boost.

Our message today is one of unity, he said after Mrs. Fiorina  who suspended her campaign after the New Hampshire primary in February  spent several minutes praising him.

He surmised that, as news of the endorsement spread, We just heard a whole bunch of Democratic activists and Hillary supporters go, Whoa, what was that?

Mrs. Fiorinas history as a vocal critic of both Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump leaves her well-positioned to act as a major Cruz surrogate. Few candidates have been as successful as Mrs. Fiorina in knocking Mr. Trump off balance during debates.

In her first act as a Cruz supporter, Mrs. Fiorina even managed to praise the senator using a favored Trump phrase.

He has won over and over and over, Mrs. Fiorina said of Mr. Cruz. He has won.",[]

It looks like he is still getting inspiration from Film Noir (se picture above). The director, Otto Preminger also made Frank Sinatras best film, The Man With The Golden Arm.

It seems to be a sequel of sorts of his last album and will most probably consist of Frank Sinatra standards (songs Sinatra did).

At least some of the work on the album is done in Studio B at Hollywoods famed Capitol Studios (According to producer Al Schmitt, Feb 11).

It seems like he is brushing up on already recorded material.

nytimes.com,2016-03-04 00:00:00,Review: Memoirs From Two Eras Testify to Prisons Corrosive Effect,['Michiko Kakutani'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Two newly published prison memoirs  one contemporary, the other written in the late 1850s  provide harrowing portraits of life behind bars. They also speak to the personal consequences of what is today an epidemic of mass incarceration: America has the largest prison population in the world, and one in 35 African-American men are in prison.









The Life and the Adventures of a Haunted Convict is a memoir by Austin Reed, a free black man, born in the 1820s in upstate New York, chronicling his years at the New York House of Refuge, an early juvenile reformatory, and at the Auburn State Prison. The manuscript was found several years ago at an estate sale in Rochester, and was later identified by scholars at Yale working with the universitys Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library as the first known prison memoir by an African-American.

Mr. Reed writes in an utterly idiosyncratic pastiche of styles and genres  part confession, part jeremiad, part lamentation, part picaresque novel (reminiscent, at times, of Dickens and Defoe). But his story also reads like a bookend to Writing My Wrongs, a gritty, visceral memoir by Shaka Senghor, a Detroit drug dealer in the 1980s, who pleaded guilty to second degree murder in 1991 and served 19 years in prison, seven of them in solitary confinement.

Both men knew a measure of security in their early childhoods, which was shattered by family upheavals. After his father died, the young Mr. Reed was indentured, at the age of 8 or 10, to a white farmer, who tied him up like a slave and whipped him, and he soon ended up at the Refuge, where boys were so severely beaten with a cat-o-nine-tails that their backs were shredded into coats of red stripes.

Mr. Senghor had once dreamed of becoming a doctor, but after his parents separated and his mother began beating him, he left home and fell in with crack dealers. After being shot himself, he took to carrying a gun, and one night, shot and killed a man whom he felt threatened by.

In their books, both Mr. Senghor and Mr. Reed recount the horrors and humiliations they experienced in unblinking detail, conveying not just physical abuse (which in Mr. Reeds case included a form of waterboarding administered by prison officials) but also the psychological fallout that left them filled with rage and fear.

What helped sustain both men was writing, which provided a means of regaining a measure of control over their lives. Writing enabled Mr. Reed to document his defiance, and to leave future readers a record of the early days of a prison system that would bridge the era of slavery and our own age of mass incarceration. His book chronicles his dehumanizing treatment in two penal institutions in antebellum America and, at the same time, it looks forward to 20th-century prison writings like The Autobiography of Malcolm X and George Jacksons Soledad Brother, which, in turn, would help inspire Mr. Senghors book and the poet Reginald Dwayne Bettss fierce 2009 memoir, A Question of Freedom.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In Mr. Senghors case, writing helped him atone for his wrongs  and the life he had taken. It also provided a respite from the harsh day-to-day realities of his cell. With a pencil and a piece of paper, he recalls, it was almost like I could travel outside of prison and go wherever I desired. I could stand on the corner in my neighborhood, and no one could stop me. I could drive down the freeway to see my ex-girlfriend in Ohio, and the bars and wired fences couldnt hold me back. Writing was freedom, so I wrote till my fingers were sore.

Reading, too, became a refuge: Alex Haleys Roots, Stephen King novels, Malcolm Xs autobiography, the Bible, the Quran, revolutionary works by George Jackson and Assata Shakur, and books on African history. When books arrived from the prison library, he says, it felt as if Santa Claus had just come sliding down the chimney, and he began taking part in study groups with other prisoners to discuss what theyd read.

Such literary pursuits belie the brutality of prison life. Mr. Senghor writes that during his first six weeks at the Wayne County Jail, he witnessed everything from rape and robbery to murder, and that life behind bars was defined by violence  oppressed against oppressor, predator against prey. Just as Darwinian rules of survival held sway on the streets during the crack epidemic, so the law of the jungle prevailed in prison.

If you and another male exchanged glances, he writes, youd better be up to the challenge, or you would be considered weak. And in our world, the weak became prey. Even ball games in the yard could be deadly: It was common for inmates to play basketball with a shank in the sole of their shoes. A hard foul could lead to a stabbing or, worse, a riot.

Writing and studying provided Mr. Senghor with a refuge from the chaos of prison and a growing awareness that he wanted to turn his life around. It was a resolution galvanized by his correspondence with the godmother of the man he had killed, who told him she forgave him, and by a letter from his 10-year-old son, Lil Jay, who had learned that his father was in prison for murder. Its the anger in my heart that hurts me the most without a dad in the house, Lil Jay wrote. My mama said I am the man of the house. She tells me I have to take over the anger so I wont be in jail.

Mr. Senghor was released from prison on June 22, 2010, the day after his 38th birthday, and after a series of part-time writing jobs, he started a mentoring program for at-risk youth. He delivered a TED Talk, and eventually received fellowships with the M.I.T. Media Lab and the W. K. Kellogg Foundation.

Mr. Senghor writes about the process of atonement and the possibility of redemption, and talks of his efforts to work for prison reforms that might turn a system designed to warehouse into one aimed at rehabilitation. The ending of Mr. Reeds story is murkier: He was released from prison in May 1863, and may have been arrested again.

The story Mr. Reed tells is one of being broken, his youthful hopes of self-betterment whipped out of him and drowned in the shower baths.

When I first entered this prison in the days of my boyhood, he writes, the cheerful respects and good manners bloomed and shined in my face like a midsummers day, but, he goes on, these hard and cruel hearted tyrants have taken my education, my good reason which God had given me, all away, and made me to become the harden convict of a gloomy prison where all is dark, cold, chilly, and dismal.

Though Mr. Reeds book suggests he found some solace in the act of writing, it is also a chilling reminder to the reader of the roots of an American prison system that has grown no more humane and grown so exponentially that it now houses a startling 2.2 million people, taking a devastating toll on the countrys poorest and least educated, and wreaking further desolation on entire families and neighborhoods.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,The Costumes That Obscure Doctor and Patient,"['M D', 'Abigail Zuger']","Photo

Hard Cases Dr. Abigail Zuger on the everyday ethical issues doctors face.

Is it time for new costumes in the long-running improv act featuring doctor and patient? The white coat and the cotton gown are tattered, under continual assault for their practical deficiencies and outmoded symbolism.

Along with ties and long sleeves, Britain banned white coats for most doctors almost 10 years ago. Our priestly garb turns out to harbor quantities of bacteria, including the hospital-associated germs we try to keep away from patients.

Presumably all garments carry bacteria, including the vestments of priests. The clergy, though, probably tote a less noxious load  and probably change robes more often. Doctors report that they do so only every couple of weeks, long enough for grime to accumulate.

Most American medical schools now bestow a fresh white coat on every new student, a symbol of our exalted professional aspirations. Some American hospitals now discourage those selfsame coats in the name of hygiene. Draw what moral you will. Many pediatricians would no more dress in a white coat than in a gorilla suit, lest they scare the little ones. Some adult doctors, reasoning that we are all children in illness, feel likewise. Some of us just need the pockets.

The best clinician I ever knew was draped in a grayish shabby thing spilling over with scraps of paper, vaguely redolent of his usual weekday lunch of pea soup. Whether you were a patient or a trainee, you didnt really want him near you, until you quickly figured out that you really did.

One of the worst specimens of doctor Ive run into wore snowy white, changed daily. You really didnt want that guy near you, period, as many of his patients ultimately realized, including the ones who took him to court.

The symbolism surrounding patient gowns is just as fraught. They are cheap, demeaning, undignified and chilly. One way to cope is to wear two of them, one opening to the front and one to the rear. Thus encased, the patient is snug and warm, and also extremely well defended from inquisitive fingers and probing stethoscopes. It turns out that actual clothes are far easier to push aside for an examination than are two johnnie gowns firmly knotted together.

But patient gowns are out of style in some places mostly because they clash with the dominant medical fashion these days: doing everything at top speed. People need time and privacy to dress and undress. Medical settings without time or extra space find their stacks of clean gowns going undisturbed.

Instead, patients disrobe incompletely, or sometimes not at all, just opening little portals in their clothing through which what passes for a physical examination can be performed. Such accommodation is regrettable, but necessary to maintain our cruising speed. Call it laparoscopy for the nonsurgeon.

For my professors, the physical exam was a sacred ritual. I sometimes wonder which would distress them more: the thought of treating a rash glimpsed only on a cellphone screen, or the idea of asking a patient to open two shirt buttons under his tie for a quick inspection of that thing on his chest. Ive been guilty of both.

A couple of months ago, on a frigid winter day, a stolid, silent patient came in because her knee hurt. Just give me something, she said. I was sorely tempted, but I couldnt do it: I had to examine both unclad legs. She cast me a look of pure disgust and hauled herself to her feet.

It took almost 10 minutes for her to peel off the layers of tight, ill-fitting jeans, socks, pantyhose, more socks, more hose, long underwear, down to the arthritic knee. It took another 10 minutes to put it all back on.

My professors would have stepped out to give her some privacy. For some reason, I stayed where I was.

Those 20 minutes were death to the days schedule, but invaluable for showing the harried doctor something of the grim labor of everyday life for this patient, a heart-rending discomfort of binding elastic and straining seams she could never have articulated, and, of course, one that would have been invisible with her on display in a hospital gown.

It was the process that educated, not the final tableau.

We are never more human than when we are dressing and undressing, and yet for our medical care, we have, for some reason, decided to posture in front of one another fully costumed, pretending that, encased in our separate roles, we will get to the bottom of the pain.

Perhaps we need not new costumes but new stage directions. Perhaps doctors should routinely watch patients undress and then dress again. Perhaps, for that matter, patients should watch doctors washing their chapped hands yet again and putting on their white coats, checking the pockets for tools, phone numbers, reminders, lists of urgencies, looking at those coffee stains and wincing, vowing to get to the laundry and then forgetting.",[]

This weeks GIF science lesson might give you a newfound appreciation for how simple it is for most humans to consume a shrimp cocktail.

No, this tiny aquatic creature is not that multi-headed sea beast of Greek mythology that regenerates a head every time some daring hero chops it off. It doesnt even have a head. But like the mythical hydra, the real hydra does regenerate, which is why scientists have been studying it for decades. Over time, researchers have learned one fact creepy enough to fuel nightmares: Every time this pond-dweller wants to eat  for example a little brine shrimp  it rips a hole through the center of its bodys outer layer. When dinner is done, it closes back up.

Photo

Researchers have been aware of the hydras unusual mouth for quite some time. But the GIF above, pulled from a 25 second video clip published Tuesday by biophysicists at the University of California, San Diego, helps show whats going on at the cellular level.

Just seconds after the researchers applied a chemical present in shrimp, the hydra detected the possible snack and ripped open a mouth. Later, the mouth sealed back up so the hydra could digest.

It looks a little bit like the control of the pupil in the human eye, said Eva-Maria Collins, who led the research team, noting that the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems control dilation of the pupil.

When a human detects a threat, the sympathetic nervous system prepares the body to respond, dilating the pupils to help see better. In the absence of the threat, the parasympathetic nervous system brings the pupil back to normal. Dr. Collins thinks the hydra opens and closes its mouth for food by a similar process.",[]

This weeks puzzle was suggested by Kenneth Kong, a TV personality in Singapore. Kenneth had a moment of global fame about a year ago after sharing the Cheryls Birthday problem, a simple challenge that went wildly viral (covered in Numberplay here). The problem generated quite a storm on Twitter, including suggestions for more puzzles. I asked Kenneth if he had a favorite, and he pointed to a suggestion by Igor Diev, who introduces his puzzle this way: Frankly speaking, the task of #cherylsbirthday youve showed the world is rather easy and its a shame to be unable to solve it. Let me give you a task that Russian 14-year-old students solve. Thats what should really blow your mind.

Well, nothing activates the neurons like a playful taunt. Lets try 



Ali Babas Cave

Ali Baba found a cave full of gold and diamonds. A bag full of gold weighs 200 kilograms, a bag full of diamonds weighs 40 kilograms. Ali Baba can carry only 100 kilograms at a time. A kilogram of gold costs $20, and a kilogram of diamonds costs $60. What is the greatest amount of money Ali Baba can earn for the gold and diamonds he can carry out at once (in one attempt in one bag)?

Thank you, Kenneth Kong, and spasibo to Mr. Diev!

MONDAY PUZZLE  The main challenge I faced while solving this nicely symmetrical Monday puzzle was swallowing the emotions that surfaced, a tasty mix of fondness and revulsion for the cute little decade sandwiched between the Awesome 80s and the terrifying era we live in now. Im Generation X, though. Eating our feelings is one of our specialties.

The four clues to 90s phenomena were clear enough for me, therefore, although I wonder if that was the case for everyone. As the puzzles center readily admits, these are 90SFADS  for anyone unconcerned with the zeitgeist of that slice of time, solving could have been a challenge.

One wonders if THE RACHEL, for example, will really stand the test of time, and although THE MACARENA is probably an earworm for many of us, does anyone wonder what really happened to Los Del Rio? TAMAGOTCHI is a portmanteau that means absolutely nothing in English but is pretty fun to say out loud, so maybe the word will last longer than the demanding little trinkets it refers to ever did.

DRMARTENS are classic, however, and will be with us until the end of time. Even post-apocalyptic zombies wear Docs.

As a funny twist to this nostalgia trip, this is the first time that any of these definitions appeared in a New York Times puzzle. Itll be interesting to see if any of them come back and when.

Some other nice related touches by the constructor were references to earlier pop culture phenomena  the SAYHEY kid is a moniker that supposedly dates back to the early 50s, and WHAMO is older (although the Frisbee will turn 60 next year). I believed the SMURFS to be pure 80s, weakly reprised this decade, but to my surprise the little blue characters actually began as a 1950s Belgian cartoon, so maybe the Smurfs of my memories are also a weak reprise of Les Schtroumpfs. What goes around, comes around, right?

If the Macarena is still playing in your mind, this should knock it out:

Location Los Angeles

His Favorite Place The Spanish-style duplex apartment Mr. Maggio rents near Beverly Hills. Dark and masculine, the space is filled with, as Mr. Maggio put it, those rich textures that are cliche pimp 70s.

What do you love about it here? Its very me, the weird mix of stuff. I have these big, comfortable modern sofas, and then that burlwood credenza, and then I have this ridiculous river rock coffee table. Its the cheesiest, but I thought it would be so rad to mix it with this stuff. Its obvious that a designer didnt put it together. Nothing in my house makes sense. I have an 80s Santa Cruz skateboard banner framed.

What I love about your house is the way it refutes the light, airy image of the Southern California interior. When I think of L.A. interiors, I go to Tony Duquette and the old-school Hollywood dark and opulent homes. The rich tones, the jewel tones. Thats what I love about L.A. interiors. My place is just dark, so even if the walls are white, it would still be dark. Its a cave, but its a soft cave.

Do you have a girlfriend? What does she think? My girlfriend loves the place. She also likes white walls, too, so some things might have to change.

I see a Cire Trudon candle on the bookshelf. Im going to guess that its Ernesto. I do love the Ernesto, because it smells like Hemingways breath. But thats Carmelite.

I Took My Husband, Not His Name









I am getting married this May and do not plan on changing my last name. As a feminist, I feel this tradition is outdated, sexist and insulting. My fiance does not care either way. However, he is very tight with 10 of his former high school friends who are all married to educated, smart and career-minded women, all of whom proudly changed their last names. Those friends are part of our close circle of friends (even though they live in another state). Ms. Post, they are already using the labels the future Mrs. Smith or the Smiths, and we are already getting holiday cards with just his last name on them. How do I (as a newcomer to the group) make this stop without insulting their values? Or is this worth it at all?

Forever Ms.

Even though this particular group of women has stuck with the custom of taking their husbands names, there are women of all ages and walks of life who have done as you plan to do.

You care greatly about keeping your given name, and it is entirely your prerogative to do so. To keep your friends from making a wrong assumption about your name it is important that you communicate your decision in a factual, upbeat, nonjudgmental way to others. Is it worth it? Yes, it is. Otherwise, their error will continually grate.

You do not have to go into a big explanation or defend your desire to keep your name. No lectures extolling your stance that, in your opinion, it is an outdated tradition for a woman to take her husbands name. Simply state you are keeping your last name. Word of mouth works well, Im going to keep my given name after Jeff and I are married. The other women in the group shouldnt be insulted by the information if you skip an editorial on the topic.

You can also get the point across on the return address of the thank-you notes written after your wedding, or on other correspondence you send them in the future. Another way to communicate that you plan to continue to use your last name is with a statement on your wedding website, Kristy is keeping her name after we tie the knot, or post your new address using your preferred style: Mr. Jeffrey Smith and Ms. Kristy Hoving, 555 South Street, Anytown. (By the way, either your or your husbands name can be listed first.)

After your wedding, give it a little time for the others to get used to not calling you Mrs. Smith. If someone slips, you can gently offer your friendly reminder, Im thrilled that Jeff and I are married, but remember, Im still using my last name. Be patient as they get used to your preferred name and get to know you and your fiance as newlyweds.

Its basically a matter of respecting others choices. If you show respect to the other women by not commenting on their married names and your opinion of that decision, Im sure they will be respectful of you, too. After a little time, you will likely get to know your husbands friends better. Once they remember your choice of name, Im sure they will honor it.

Wanting to Throw Something Else Instead of Rice

I received an email in January from my friend and the mother of the bride saying that they hoped we would be able to join them in March for my friends wedding, adding, Formal invitations will be mailed in early January.

The email went on to say where the reception is being held and the name of the hotels where they had blocked rooms and by what dates to book.

About a week ago (one month before the wedding), I asked another friend if she had received her invitation in the mail. She said that she had received it.

After that, I received an email from the mother of the bride to say that she was sorry for the awkwardness (apparently my other friend said something), but that the wedding couple had included more of their friends and that she, therefore, had to cut their list of friends. In other words, I would not be receiving the formal invitation. My husband and I had been cut!

I would have expected a personal call or would have expected my friend to tell me personally when we recently saw each other. Should I say something to my friend to express my surprise and disappointment in the way she handled things? Was this all incredibly rude?

Anonymous

This unfortunate turn of events can be labeled rude because it was thoughtless and hurtful to you. The scenario is a prime example of why one really cant retract an invitation, even one that was through an initial save-the-date email.

Your friend, the mother of the bride, sounds as if she let the details of the wedding get out of hand. The planning was obviously not managed well if it meant the guest list was so drastically chopped when the invitations went out. Clear communication and decisions about a wedding guest list have to occur before save-the-date notices are sent. Even a casual, early comment of I hope you can come to the wedding needs to be valid and followed up with an invitation. Otherwise, its a slap in the face to be omitted, as you have discovered.

Ideally, the brides mother should have stood up to the couple and explained that all of the guests who had received a save-the-date notice must receive an invitation. As that wasnt the case, it is clear that she could have done a better job of damage control  that is, of communicating with you. It might have been less hurtful to you if she had immediately called, or even seen you in person, to explain the problem. But whether she was overwhelmed with wedding planning, embarrassed or just plain clueless, time went by, and she skipped making the effort to have an immediate conversation with you. In a delicate situation like this, sending an email rather than speaking in person does tend to add salt to the wound. At least your friend said she was sorry. My hunch is that she did feel terrible and did not know what to do about the situation.

You have to be the judge about whether you and this friend have a relationship that you want to get back on track. Friends are precious commodities. Maybe you and she were never really that close and youd prefer to let the relationship fade. If thats your decision, try to at least forgive her enough to be civil and gracious. In time, some of the hurt should dissolve.

On the other hand, you might want to forgive her if the friendship means enough to you. Allow yourself to cool off before reaching out to her. After the wedding  she probably wont be able to focus on your friendship until the wedding is over  contact your friend and arrange to get together. Its O.K. to tell her how surprised and hurt you have been, but also let her know you would like to mend fences. Your friend will probably be grateful for your forgiveness and glad that you want to continue your friendship. (She might need a friend, as it sounds as if others were cut from the list, and my guess is they were offended, too.) Lets hope she learned a good lesson about the importance of keeping commitments. Good luck!

A jury on Wednesday found a former United States serviceman guilty of seeking to support a foreign terrorist organization after trying to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State.

The former serviceman, Tairod Pugh, 48, hung his head as the jury foreman announced the verdict in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.

The trial, which began on Feb. 29, was the first case related to the Islamic State to reach a verdict in an American courtroom, although there is another trial underway in Phoenix involving a man accused of conspiring to support the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Over the last two years, dozens of other people have also been arrested on charges of trying to travel to Syria and Iraq to fight with the Islamic State or of plotting terrorist attacks in the United States on behalf of the organization.

The evidence in the case demonstrated that Mr. Pugh, an itinerant airplane mechanic at airports across the Middle East, had researched border crossings to Syria and had boarded a flight to Istanbul, a common jumping-off point for would-be foreign fighters seeking to make their way to territory controlled by the Islamic State in neighboring Syria.

Mr. Pugh, an Air Force veteran, consumed slickly produced Islamic State propaganda and watched scenes of beheadings, crucifixions and other atrocities. And the evidence showed that he had alienated his American colleagues by making inflammatory statements in support of the Islamic State.

He had drafted a letter to his wife, promising to bring her along to paradise after he died a martyr. In the letter, he had pledged to use the talents and skills given to me by Allah to establish and defend the Islamic State. But he had not sent the letter, giving his defense an opening to argue that although Mr. Pugh was an ardent ideological supporter of the Islamic State, his visions of joining the group were just fantasies.

The jury rejected that defense, convicting him of crimes that carry a potential 35-year sentence. In addition to the material support charge, Mr. Pugh was found guilty of trying to destroy a number of flash drives that the government claimed contained evidence against him.

One aspect of the case against Mr. Pugh remained a mystery. When Mr. Pugh landed in Istanbul in January 2015, the Turkish authorities detained him and ultimately deported him, through Cairo, back to Kennedy International Airport, where the Federal Bureau of Investigation was waiting for him. But it remained unclear whether the Turkish authorities had grown suspicious of Mr. Pugh on their own, or whether they had been alerted to Mr. Pughs possible intentions by the United States government.

The trial also demonstrated that Mr. Pugh, a solitary figure drifting between jobs in places like Kuwait and Dubai, had managed to cultivate a network of like-minded strangers over Facebook, including, prosecutors claim, a Queens woman named Noelle Velentzas.

Their Facebook conversations were among the contents of Mr. Pughs computer that were shown to the jury. Three months after Mr. Pughs arrest, Ms. Velentzas was arrested in Queens on charges related to plotting a terror attack. Prosecutors say that she had declared that she and her roommate, who was also arrested, were citizens of the Islamic State.",[]

FRIDAY PUZZLE  When you dont have a theme to cling to and the clues are ramped up to weekend-level, it can be difficult to conquer a crossword puzzle. If you are just dipping a toe into the late week, themeless puzzles, there are only two things you will need to be successful, and they are 1) patience and 2) more patience.

There are two ways to approach a late-week puzzle. You can scan the clues looking for something, anything that you definitely know, or you can take an educated guess. I highly recommend starting out with the former approach. Nothing boosts your solving self-esteem like filling in that first entry in a blank grid. This first entry will vary, depending on your personal wheelhouse. In my case, I started with 57 Downs Janies got A GUN' and Almond ROCA at 60 Down (I know. Aerosmith and candy. Sorry, Mom.) If those are not your speed, how about Al JOLSON at 9 Down, who sang the timeless Toot Toot Tootsie (Goobye)? Or perhaps you are a bit of a dandy, and you are all about the PERIWIGS. I can remember reading The Bobbsey Twins as a child, so NAN went in right away.

No matter what you know, fill it in and pat yourself on the back for embarking on a late-week solve. From there, branch out and try to connect as many of the entries as you can. The patience comes in when you feel stuck. Put the puzzle down and go do something else. Your brain will continue to process what youve seen in the clues and when you come back to it, youll be surprised at how much more you suddenly know.

The second approach, which can also work, is to take an educated guess at entries that might not be what they seem. At 61 Across, the clue One who can see right through you? is obviously misdirection, what with the question mark at the end. So it probably doesnt mean someone who can see that youre not being honest, which is one possible definition of ... see right through you. Who else can see right through you? My first guess was SUPERMAN, but that doesnt fit. The only other person that could possibly see through you is a RADIOLOGIST.

Having fun yet? You should be. Remember, this is a game. Its a pastime, and its supposed to be fun. Getting angry because you dont know or like a certain word or you think that crosswords should be a strict test of intelligence is pointless and bad for your health. So, if youre having trouble with the puzzle, put it down and come back to it when you can solve it in the fun spirit in which it is meant to be solved.

Evans Clinchy offers us this Friday puzzle and has quite a bit to say about it, so Ill stop lecturing and let him take the mic:

Constructors Notes

So this is my second crossword published in The Times, and if you compare this puzzle with my previous one, youll notice a host of similarities. Both are themeless, both feature stacks of 11-letter entries across the top and bottom three rows, and both are built around the seed entry of a famous N.B.A. player. Last time, back in 2014, it was KEVIN DURANT; this time, I give you Kareem ABDUL-JABBAR. I swear, I have other ambitions in life beyond cramming as many basketball players as possible into Times puzzles. Eventually Ill have no names left to play with besides FESTUS EZELI or someone equally obscure. I should quit now while Im ahead. Anyway. This puzzle was a joy to construct  I remember it began with the realization that the fun CARTOONLIKE fit perfectly beneath ABDUL-JABBAR, and it all flowed from there. I liked getting to sneak in PERIWIGS (which Ive always thought is a cool word, no?) and ONE-TWO PUNCH. Including the name LOUIS C.K. in a puzzle was always something of a bucket-list goal, as the comedian has always been a favorite of mine. Funny, though  I thought I was so original for including Louie at the time I wrote this puzzle, as hed never been featured before. Then his name showed up three times shortly thereafter  in November 2014, January 2015 and March 2015. Great minds think alike, or something? At least I had the neat twist of crossing the comics name with TITLE ROLE, since he has one on his FX show. Its the little victories. As for the clues, Im happy with a few that I wrote (especially the pyramid scheme wordplay for CHEERLEADER), but Im equally grateful for Will sprucing up some of my duller clues with some flavorful ideas of his own. One who can see right through you? for RADIOLOGIST is great. Wish Id thought of that. Also, a picture in one of the clues! [The picture is in the print version only. D.A.] Thats crazy  didnt even know it was a thing. I understand its very, very rare, so Im honored that Will chose my puzzle to decorate. Thanks for reading (and solving), everyone. Ill be back with a Sunday puzzle next time, obviously, because how else am I gonna fit GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO into a grid?

And now for something completely different: a PERIWIGged game of charades:

A great new neighborhood bar slides in seamlessly, filling a hole without unraveling the local fabric. Lovers Rock, a mellow reggae-themed bar that opened in Bedford-Stuyvesant over the summer, is this rare kind of place.

On a Saturday in December, a Japanese D.J. spun tunes to visitors with au courant mom jeans, tattoo sleeves, quilted bombers and stocking caps. At a table near the bar, a 30-something couple praised the diversity. The music makes everyone tolerate everyone, a contractor from Flatbush said.

THE PLACE

An unassuming storefront on a Tompkins Avenue intersection that is undergoing rapid changes (bodega, farm-to-table soul food restaurant, building demolition). The room is a warm, low-ceiling box with checkerboard floors, posters for Sly and Robbie, and overhead lights that resemble maraschino cherries. A gravel patio has picnic tables, strung pepper-shaped lights and an occasional jerk-chicken pop-up. On summer nights, its a major melting pot, said Shane Feirstein, an owner. Its lit. When we close the yard at midnight, thats when the music vibe gets popping.

THE CROWD

Bartenders in Supreme hats and Ramones T-shirts sling fruity drinks to a lively rundown of locals and transplants. One night, the backyard resembled Fader Fort during SXSW, with unisex Huaraches and Chuck Taylors, guys in clasped baseball caps and women dressed in vintage ensembles befitting Billy Crystal circa City Slickers. Whatever the drinking population, everyone wants a nice bar, Mr. Feirstein said, pointing out that Lovers Rock could refer to reggae, the Clash or Sade.

THE PLAYLIST

D.J.s spin Sleng Teng, dub and dancehall on vinyl several nights a week. Theres an R&B party called Pure Grind. New Years will feature Deadly Dragon Sound System from the Lower East Side record store of the same name.

GETTING IN

21 and over, usually no cover.

DRINKS

Affordable beverages sway tropical, with copious rum and tequila; the Old Jerk ($10) mixes Appleton with spicy jerk syrup. A bottle of Red Stripe costs $5. Curry fish and other varieties of empanada are $4.",[]

TUESDAYS PUZZLE  What reaction do you usually get if you dare to share your fondness for crossword puzzles with others at cocktail parties? One of the most frequent comments I get when I tell people that I construct puzzles is, Oh, I can never do those, followed immediately by, Who ate all the dip? I cant help it; I like dip. But that is not my point.

My point is, people have a tendency to make assumptions about what they can and cant do without even trying, and that seems to go double for crossword puzzles. Solving is one of those skill sets we acquire only by doing, so the best way to do them is to ... well, do them. Even if you need to call in reinforcements to help you out, the next one will be easier. It might not become your new favorite pastime, but thats O.K. I believe you gain something just for having solved.

In order to prove my point, I called in the fabulous Michael Musto, writer of The Village Voices popular La Daily Musto gossip column and author of the coming Fork on the Left, Knife in the Back (Vantage Point, September, 2011) to be our guest solver today. Michael is a self-professed non-finisher when it comes to crossword puzzles, but he agreed to give todays festive grid a try. Not only did he and a friend finish it, but they had fun doing it.

Here is his experience:

Ive always appreciated crossword puzzles because theyre a challenging test of your intellect and character. Besides, no one really needs to know how well you did on them. And I dont do that well on them! Even though I graduated from an Ivy League college with a degree in English Literature and have made a living at language for decades, I usually find that The New York Times puzzle tends to remind me of how many arcane yet fascinating things I simply dont know. Still, I gamely gave this a whirl and found it more up my tin pan alley than usual since there were show bizzy items in there about SHIRLEY TEMPLE and David Bowie. Easy! When I even managed to figure out things like Something found in an old board, maybe  which was so not me  I was beside myself with the realization that these puzzles are not always as un-doable as Id thought. Even so, the lower left patch wasnt completely filled, since Most played part of a 45 and Transport in a western were stumping me, even though I still own 45s and I just saw True Grit. I had to use a lifeline, namely my friend Lynn Yaeger, whos also a writer and is much better at crosswords than I am. It became a really fun social experience as we giggled over lunch and she explained the answers to me  ASIDE = A side and STAGE. We had a gratifying time solving the rest of these clues  and then I promptly went back to my stack of 99-cent Word Search books.

Thats O.K., Michael. Thanks again for playing, and even if youre not a convert, I still think youre a MENSCH.

Barely four minutes into Jerrod Carmichaels 2014 debut comedy special, Love at the Store, he makes a joke about the death of Trayvon Martin. Money changes you, Carmichael tells the audience, recounting how he recently entered his upscale apartment building wearing a hooded sweatshirt and made it through the lobby unquestioned by his doorman. I was concerned, he says. I pay a lot of money  like, a lot of money  so that niggas in hoodies like me cant waltz by you. Addressing the doorman, he adds, Next time, stand your ground. The laughter that greets this phrase is scattered and uneasy, but Carmichael only digs in. Really? he says.  Cause, like, that Trayvon [expletive] is really affecting your day to day ... you wake up, have your cup of coffee, and you do this  he blows a kiss  to a picture of Trayvon. And then you start your day. Is that what you do? Carmichael grins genially.  Cause you dont.

Carmichael has one of stand-ups most unorthodox approaches to exploring race and class, and in building to his Martin joke, he assumes an unexpected voice: that of the race traitor. While working on Love at the Store, Carmichael argued about this bit with Spike Lee, who signed on to direct the special at his request. I just didnt think it was funny, Lee wrote in an email, and it was too soon to be making a joke about Martins coldblooded murder. Carmichael  insisting that his aim was not to mock a dead teenager but to explore what it means to truly care about his death  kept it in. I want to be a voice that challenges, Carmichael told me recently.









He takes this mandate to extremes that can verge on perverse. Consider the bit, soon after the Martin joke, about how Carmichael cant wait to grow rich enough to say Republican things out loud such as: I dont think people on welfare should be allowed to eat breakfast . . . which is kind of true when you think about it. Like, youre building up your strength for what? The satire and ironic distance here is sliced razor-thin; it gets thinner still when Carmichael, declaring that some people are more important than others, describes looking at my little cousin, and you can just tell hes gonna work at Wendys. Like, you could see it in his eyes: He has Wendy eyes. By the time Carmichael arrives at his own account of police brutality  he was once slammed to the ground by L.A.P.D. officers, their guns drawn, because I fit a description  he is on the way to a point about how Americas racist legacy is worth accepting because, were it not for slavery, I would be in Africa right now. Africa. Are you hearing what Im saying to you? Like, they have AIDS there. Jammed end to end with such jokes, Carmichaels special is unrelentingly bleak  even toxic in its nihilism. And yet Carmichael remains supremely affable, speaking in a slow, honeyed voice and smiling throughout. Your groans, he tells the crowd, will only make me go deeper.

At 28, Carmichael is one of Hollywoods fastest-rising young comics, and his preoccupation in Love at the Store is black-American success: systematically thwarted, highly politicized and something he enjoys all the same. In 2011, impressed by his stand-up, the makers of New Girl asked Carmichael to test for Winston, a main character, but he turned them down, uninterested in tying himself to someone elses sitcom. That self-assurance paid off. NBC eventually picked up his own sitcom, The Carmichael Show, and the same week that he shot Love at the Store, the hit feature comedy Neighbors  which starred Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne  arrived in multiplexes, with Carmichael in a scene-stealing role. (Initially envisioned as a white Jewish kid, the part was rewritten for him.) This month, The Carmichael Show returns for its second season; a Neighbors sequel, again featuring Carmichael, arrives in May.

The comedian Neal Brennan, a creator of Chappelles Show, was an early mentor. Praising the way that Carmichaels disarming, bright-eyed delivery belies the grimness of his message, he told me that at its best, Jerrods stand-up shows America/humanity at its worst  capitalist, cutthroat, cynical, narcissistic. Even so, the speed of Carmichaels ascent took him by surprise. In 2010 or so, we got something to eat, and I explained everything that was gonna happen in his career, Brennan said. And I was right, except I mapped out way more hardship than he encountered. A more recent admirer of Carmichaels is 93-year-old Norman Lear, the man behind classic sitcoms like All in the Family and The Jeffersons and, according to Carmichael, a major influence on The Carmichael Show. Lear told me that Carmichaels comedy helps America look at itself in the mirror, adding, He sees the foolishness of the human condition  he understands that there is humor to be found in the darkest of places.

In late January, Carmichael was at his sitcoms production offices, trying to find the humor in a particularly dark place. The week before, he taped Episode 202, in which the Carmichael family  a working-class North Carolina household modeled on his own  struggles with the tarnished legacy of Bill Cosby, the master comedian and suspect in multiple rapes. Standing in an editing room, Carmichael, who is 6-foot-1, wore a hoodie, fitted jeans and Timberland work boots. He faced a monitor as his editor, Kirk Benson, dialed up the Cosby episodes closing minute.

I did a line off the top of my head at the very end that might ruin the entire episode, Carmichael said as he watched David Alan Grier, who plays Carmichaels father, Joe, do a virtuoso, sweet-natured impression of Cosby holding court. This cracked up the other fictional Carmichaels and elicited big laughs from the studio audience. Amid this jubilation, Jerrod smilingly interjected, Damn shame what he did to those women, though. Although the line was unscripted, Grier gamely caught Carmichaels splash of cold water, dropping the smile from his face.

The Carmichael Show is, among other things, an attempt to prove that a multicamera sitcom, in the venerable but dusty tradition of All in the Family, can command a place in the pop-cultural vanguard while attracting broad audiences. The success of series like Empire and black-ish has hammered home the fact that black-led shows need not be considered niche entertainment. Carmichael theorizes that these shows helped strengthen NBCs resolve in supporting The Carmichael Show, which features an entirely black cast. The shows chief selling point  besides the prodigious talents of Grier and Loretta Devine, a veteran actor who plays Jerrods mother  is its social relevance. Carmichael and his staff build scripts around hot-button issues, producing episodes like Gender, which involves a transgender teenager and features a cold-open riff about the drawbacks of removing Confederate flags from government buildings. The only thing worse than racism is surprise racism, Jerrod says in the show, making the case for letting the flag fly.

Carmichael says that, whereas rebuttals to his stand-up jokes can only be implied, on the show he and his writers are able to stage counterarguments via the other characters. The premise of Episode 202, titled Fallen Heroes, is that Jerrod scores tickets to see Cosby perform; his girlfriend, Maxine, is appalled; debates ensue. (The shows creators solicited outside opinions on the episode, including from Judd Apatow  one of Cosbys most prominent Hollywood critics  and Darnell Hunt, a professor of sociology and director of African-American studies at U.C.L.A., whom Carmichael brought on last year as a series consultant to help him navigate controversial issues.) Carmichael offered few details about the Cosby story line, but if one of his old stand-up bits is any indication, the results will not be milquetoast: Arguing that talent is more important than morals, Carmichael cites the abhorred 2014 RoboCop remake, deeming it so atrocious that halfway through it, I forgave Woody Allen.

In the editing room, considering his damn shame line, Carmichael said, It might be more interesting to fade out on the warm feeling, because the line I say is, sadly, implied the whole episode, anyway. He pursed his lips and walked into the hall. I try to avoid having a message,  he went on. The risk here is that the whole episode is a gray area, and that lines black  I wanted to watch my delivery, to see if it allowed for gray.

In Carmichaels comedy, the line between unflinching provocation and outright trolling can grow fuzzy. He says hes fueled by a Socratic curiosity: What about this? What if what you think is right is wrong? This manifests most shockingly when, breaking the unwritten comedy rule against punching down, Carmichael makes some of societys most disempowered people the objects of seeming cruelty. In the joke about his Wendys-destined little cousin  delivered in the aftermath of Trayvon Martins death and mere months before the killings of Michael Brown and Tamir Rice  the target is a black boy. Elsewhere its black women, as when Carmichael mocks Beyonces single Run the World (Girls) as too ambitious for most of the bitches in her fan base, suggesting she sing instead about being a shift manager at Arbys, or a dental hygienist. You can watch this joke on YouTube courtesy of an anti-feminist account called F3MH8R, which underscores the queasy way that some of his lines could be transplanted into bigots mouths almost verbatim. Carmichael takes this, however, as a point of counterintuitive pride: Its become increasingly easy, in art, to only listen to people you already agree with, he told me. Thats boring.

If a black comics audience includes many white fans, as Carmichaels does, the dynamics surrounding such jokes can be particularly fraught. Some liberal-minded whites doubtless enjoy hearing black comics make jokes at white peoples expense because they like to imagine, in a self-congratulatory way, that their laughter constitutes an act of penance and expiation: by chuckling, they may feel they are insulating themselves against charges of racism and demonstrating their own enlightenment. But Carmichaels jokes, routinely directed not at the perpetrators and beneficiaries of racism but at its victims, dont permit any such easy feelings  if I, well-intentioned liberal, laugh at a joke about a black boys scarce self-worth, what does that say about the sway that negative black stereotypes have over me?

Then there is the white fan who laughs with no such unease. Dave Chappelle has invoked this figure in explaining why he stepped away from his hit sketch series: in part, he worried that some white viewers appreciated his anarchic treatment of black stereotypes for misguided reasons  that, in effect, his comedy risked compounding rather than dismantling those stereotypes. Neal Brennan touched on this issue while interviewing Carmichael during a 2015 podcast, identifying something almost anti-black in Love at the Store. Its not anti-black, Carmichael replied. Its anti-allowing-yourself-to-be-a-victim.

When I raised this topic with Carmichael, he reiterated that his jokes were intended as motivational tough love. He said he heartily rejects the pull up your pants mantras and bootstrap narratives of black respectability politics but aims nonetheless to encourage personal responsibility: Its not saying Im on the systems side; its me saying Im determined to beat it, and join me, why dont you? As for the reactions and possible misinterpretations of white fans, these were not foremost among Carmichaels concerns. Im not talking to you; its not about you, he told me. Im not talking about that cousin with Wendy eyes for anyone but that cousin with Wendy eyes.

Elaborating, Carmichael pointed to his joke about turning Republican and denying poor people breakfast. Id taken it as a layered critique of right-wing callousness. He acknowledged this but added that the joke also represented an extreme argument for freedom. Being black, you hear sentences like, Black people dont blank. How inhibiting is that? Like, how come I havent gone snowboarding? Because embedded in me is a belief that black people dont snowboard. So its a challenge of saying, Im not supposed to be a Republican, but I can do anything. Im breaking the ultimate rule, politically  Im so free in that joke its almost disgusting.

Growing up, the kids in Carmichaels neighborhood werent expected  or set up  to amount to much, he said. There was a path laid out for me by circumstance, decided at birth, that I sent back. He characterized the Morningside Manor section of Winston-Salem, where hes from, as all black, lot of very nice, hardworking, honest people, some people that werent, adding, It was the type of neighborhood where my mothers only goal was that I get a high-school diploma. Cynthia Carmichael worked as a secretary; Joe Carmichael is a truck driver. Joe told me that Jerrod displayed an early taste for show business: I built a clubhouse in the backyard, and when he was 8 or 9, he and his friends decorated it into a haunted house and charged admission. Jerrods older brother, Joe Jr., recalls Jerrods constantly toting around the video camera hed begged for one Christmas: If I was playing ball, hed be on the side, taping us, interviewing the players.

In adolescence, I was kinda awkward, kinda quiet, Carmichael said. My sneakers were wack. Id get picked on. Toward the end of middle school, however, I remember discovering humor and a boldness that came with it. Other parts of growing up in Morningside were far harder: A friend of mine, Marcus, was murdered. A friend of mine, Hasan, was murdered. These things would just happen. Very regular moments could hurt you a lot: I remember getting a ride home with a buddy of mine. Were talking about algebra II, and suddenly he says, I need to stop really fast, takes the air vent off the dashboard and pulls out some crack to sell. And that was not unique.

Carmichael had an autodidactic drive, spurred by his parents, who engaged their boys in debates replicated on his show  about entertainment, religion, politics. Being from the hood, I had no access to certain things  its a cliche, but I didnt know who Paul Thomas Anderson was, he said. I didnt know who the Coen Brothers were. He recalled staying up till 3 a.m. reading about the Defenestrations of Prague on Wikipedia, or spending eight hours at the Barnes & Noble, posted up in an aisle with a cup of coffee. This was also a reaction to institutional failure. I remember when I was in eighth grade, the assistant superintendent came to my school. Id visited a white middle school recently and noticed a difference. More computers. Nicer. I remember raising my hand and asking, Why dont we have those things? His response was: You see those new tables in the cafeteria? Were looking out for you. Right then, I said, Im not relying on this system to get where I need to be.

Carmichael sold sneakers at a Finish Line, nursing abstract dreams of a stand-up career that friends stoked. I didnt want to start in North Carolina, he said. I went to a club in Greensboro once, and knew I wasnt gonna start there. Im competitive; I wanna go up after Louis C.K. His thinking, he continued, was: Where are the best people doing this? Take me to them. One day at work, a guy came into the store, said he was an actor in L.A. I said, Man, L.A., I really wanna move there. And he said: Then just move. Go to Craigslist, Westside Rentals, find a place. I said, O.K. 

Carmichael headed west in 2008, crashing in shared studio apartments and hitting open-mike nights not just at proper clubs but also in living rooms and bars. I annoyed so many people who were trying to watch hockey games. The comedian Hannibal Buress, who befriended Carmichael, recalls being impressed by the tough angles he took into risque material, and his willingness to lose a crowd in the service of an idea  he doesnt care about bombing. Of the apparent audacity of his move to Los Angeles, Carmichael told me: I dont like safety nets. Like, a lot of comedians, they bring friends to their first show. And their second and third. You have a net there, crutches, guaranteed pity laughs. I dont want that.

On the day I first met him, in January, Carmichael was due to rehearse scenes from the next episode of his show, 203, on the soundstage near Beverly Hills where The Carmichael Show is made. Episode 203 takes place largely at a funeral parlor: Jerrods paternal grandfather, William, dies, sending Griers Joe into an ambivalent funk, because William was an abusive alcoholic; Joe wonders if he doesnt owe him a sanitized eulogy anyway. The episode would be taped twice the next day and assembled from both performances: if a joke didnt go over at 4 p.m., alternative lines, or alts, could be tried at 7. The production crew had constructed a spacious set for the funeral-service scene. Adjoining it was a cramped, impressively ugly antechamber  floral-print settee, chintzy sconces, sad carpet. An open brown coffin with a dummy corpse jutted toward the cameras. Most of this episode plays really claustrophobically, in this room, with the coffin, Carmichael said. There was originally supposed to be just one moment in here, but I expanded it to, like, 25 pages. Its not that long now, but I like pushing to see how far you can go within a limitation.

Carmichael aims to at once embrace and break the format of multicamera sitcoms, and visual monotony is just one of his strategies. In Episode 201, Jerrod makes a harsh joke about cancer, and in the cut I saw, the crowd responded with an audible disapproval that hadnt been scrubbed from the laugh track. Usually you dont keep that take, you use an alt, Carmichael said. But at the taping, I just kept saying that same line, so there is no alt. The crowd kind of winces. You hear them react to it unhappily. Im like, keep that reaction.

Thanks to Season 1s ratings, which were strong enough to bolster executives faith in him, Carmichael has some creative leeway. In Episode 203, Joe recalls Williams abuse in graphic detail, delivering tough lines about beatings and chokeholds. Carmichael said, The studio read this script and they were like  he inhaled sharply, miming pain  and I told them, Its gonna get sad for a bit. We can stay heavy. Its O.K.

Carmichaels willingness to stay heavy  to create prolonged moments of discomfort  may be the most formally radical thing about him. In his sitcom and his stand-up, he can seem as satisfied provoking groans, or awkward silence, as he is provoking laughter. At work here is a fundamental reconsideration of a joke tellers function: With Carmichael, the goal is not only to orchestrate a series of raucous eruptions  signaling, as they do, a simpatico mind meld with the audience  but to generate rifts of displeasure, confusion and anger too. Danielle Sanchez-Witzel, the showrunner on The Carmichael Show, said that such emotions can be productive: Jerrod likes to make people uncomfortable not for the sake of making them uncomfortable, but to shake them out of their regular way of seeing the world.

I saw this in action a couple of nights later, when Carmichael invited me along for an unannounced appearance at the Comedy Store in West Hollywood  the site not just of his HBO special but also of his first-ever L.A. open mike, in 2008. Carmichael had scribbled some notes earlier that night, but mostly he winged his set. I dont know what to talk about, he said onstage, but in a good way. Im open. Wearing a bomber over a gray hoodie, he paced, took long pauses and fussed with different things  his lip, a bottle cap, the mike stand. This was not a result of nerves, he told me later, but a deliberate technique to think through jokes and inculcate the crowd in his unhurried cadences. At one point he took off his jacket: I wasnt hot, he explained. Its to let you know: Relax. Listen. Lets explore. 

The Iowa caucuses loomed, and Carmichael had politics in mind. He got medium-size laughs with a medium-grade Bernie Sanders joke  Hell be the first president in history to broker a nuclear deal with a mustard stain on his shirt  then grew more familiarly challenging as he defended Donald Trumps proposed wall along the Mexican border: You dont just have an open wall at your apartment, like, I like my neighbors to be able to come in if they feel oppressed. 

Where this riff led, however, was wholly unexpected: Im thinking about not voting, Carmichael said. I dont trust America anyway. Can I say: I dont think we went to the moon? For the next few minutes, he contended that the manned Apollo missions had been faked. All of you are crazy for believing it, but we dont have time to get into the real facts because its not funny. People tittered, but with notes of hesitation and befuddlement, as they tried to suss out Carmichaels relationship to this bizarre tangent. I think its kinda cool we made it up, he went on. Thats so American. Lying about a moon landing? Thats so us.

Later that night, he told me that the moon-landing material reflected a deep-seated mistrust of authority that animates nearly every joke he tells and that has been with him since his youth in Morningside. You think we went to the moon? he said. Well, the same people said the drinking water is safe in Flint, Mich. His point was that conspiracy theories about nefarious government action  which circulate not only among crackpots but also among marginalized people with legitimate social grievances  were sometimes revealed to be the stuff of actual government behavior. I dont want people to be comfortable in the black-and-white that were handed, he continued. When you grow up and a lot of things people tell you arent true, you learn to challenge and question everything. If youre in Flint and the government said the water is safe to drink, and you find out it wasnt, and they knew. . . .

Carmichael trailed off for a moment, shaking his head, then declared, Its up to you to figure out the truth for yourself.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,New U.S. Rule Extends Stay for Some Foreign Graduates,['Liz Robbins'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Shruthi Aramandlas education and her job are geared to New York Citys skyline. She did not want to go back to her native India and start all over again.









Ms. Aramandla, 24, who has a masters degree from the Tandon School of Engineering at New York University, has been waiting anxiously for the federal government to publish its new rule on a foreign-worker training program so she would know whether she could stay longer  and perhaps one day permanently  in the United States.

The federal government will publish the rule on Friday, saying that international students earning degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields in the United States will now be eligible to stay for three years of on-the-job training. This is seven months longer than under the 2008 rule it replaces for the STEM Optional Practical Training program, known as OPT. The new rule will take effect on May 10.

Beyond offering graduates more experience in their fields, the extension serves another purpose. If my work visa gets denied this year, I still have two more opportunities to apply, and I can keep working within the country, said Ms. Aramandla, who wanted to be an engineer since she was 10, growing up in Chennai, India. She graduated from N.Y.U. in May; under the previous 29-month rule, she would have been able to stay only through October 2017.

Ms. Aramandla will apply in April for a visa, known as an H-1B, for so-called skilled foreign workers. But Congress caps those yearly at 65,000, with an additional 20,000 slots for graduates with advanced degrees like Ms. Aramandla. The government received nearly four times as many applications for those visas as were accepted in last years lottery.

This rule is yet another flash point in the controversy over immigration reform. Industry leaders who say they are desperate for skilled talent and those defending the rights of American workers see the training programs extension as an end-around to stalled reform. But that is all they agree upon.

Its an ongoing assault on American workers, said John Miano, a lawyer for a technology workers union in Washington State, whose lawsuit last summer was what forced the government to vacate the previous rule and create a new one, this time for public comment.

They are just trying to double down on what theyre doing before, he said of the government. O.K., you didnt like 29 months? Well make it 36 months.

Mr. Miano says his group, the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers, is still arguing the legality of the program in an appeal. The next hearing will be in May at the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

The government posted a similar version of the rule in the federal register in October, drawing more than 50,500 comments. (Death threats to President Obama were removed, officials said.) A large number of commenters who said they were foreign students supported the rule. But there were also comments from people who identified themselves as unemployed technology workers or concerned citizens who believed the government was destroying this country, and thought that it showed the government was standing with illegals.

I hope you rip it up, one commenter said.

The new rule states directly that a STEM OPT student would not replace a full- or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. worker, and that the salary offered would be commensurate to American workers.

Officials with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said they tried to tighten training programs, mandate oversight of employers and make sure that the students come from accredited universities in an effort to prevent fraud.

In our mind, it enhances training and puts safeguards in to make sure that if you are an employer that you are not unfairly disadvantaging U.S. workers, Rachel Canty, deputy director for the agencys Student and Exchange Visitor Program.

The agency said it would provide help sessions for eligible students, employers and academic institution on its website on Friday.

Ms. Aramandla, who works for Loring Consulting Engineers and designs heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems for schools in New York, said her training would not be applicable in India, nor would she find the same work environment there; as a woman in India, she feels she would not be as respected as she is in the United States.

Michael DesRochers, the president of Loring, said Ms. Aramandla was an integral employee in his technical work force, which is 7 percent foreign.

The labor market is tight, Mr. DesRochers said. We dont look at it as the international students are taking away American opportunities. We feel were offering to all.

His companys work may intersect again with the new rule: Recently, his engineers replaced the ventilation and mechanical systems for the United States Supreme Court.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-02-25 00:00:00,Free Coffee? Starbucks Saves Its Loyalty for Big Spenders,['Josh Barro'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Wheres the loyalty?









Starbucks is changing its My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program so that rewards are tied to dollars spent instead of number of visits. To no ones surprise, some customers feel that the coffee house chain is less than loyal.

This is a huge slap in the face for people who enjoy regular coffee, said Matt Baumann, an editor in Philadelphia who has been a Gold Level My Starbucks Rewards member since 2007. He probably would not have made that proclamation if Starbucks directly raised the price of his cup of coffee by 31 cents  even if such a price increase would have caused him to buy his coffee elsewhere.

Mr. Baumanns hurt feelings are easier to understand when you realize the company is not just raising the effective price he will pay for coffee. It did so by changing the rules of a program that was supposed to be about how they like seeing customers like him.

Currently, Starbucks rewards customers based on how often they visit. Every transaction gets you a star, and 12 stars get you a free drink. On Monday, Starbucks announced that will change in April to reflect the #1 request we heard from members: more Stars awarded based on what you buy, no matter how often you visit.

Indeed, Starbucks customers will soon get a lot more stars: two for every dollar they spend. But instead of 12 stars for a free drink, they will need 125. This is probably not what customers meant when they asked for more stars.

The change mirrors recent revisions to airline reward programs. In 2015, both United Airlines and Delta Air Lines started giving out reward points based on how much customers spend on airfare. This change means that the frequent flier mile is no longer directly related to distance traveled, and that high-spending corporate travelers get a lot more rewards than bargain hunters. American Airlines will make a similar change in July.

There is a logic to these shifts: Companies want to reward their most profitable customers, not necessarily their most frequent ones. At Starbucks, small spenders will lose out. A customer who likes drip coffee at $1.95 per cup will have to buy 32 of them to qualify for a free drink. But the change is good news for those who spend at least $5.21 per Starbucks visit, the minimum amount at which customers will earn rewards faster under the new program than the old one. And its especially good news for people whose job requires them to make Starbucks runs for the office.

Some Starbucks customers on the losing end of the shift, despite disappointment about the deterioration of their rewards, acknowledged the companys rationale in emails to me.

It feels like Starbucks values my business less because Im spending less per visit, regardless of the fact that Im in the drive-thru four to five days a week, said Megan Johnson, a television news producer in Portland, Ore. And on the surface, thats fair, because obviously running a company is about profit, and Im providing less of that.

In the past, Starbucks said its rewards program was about bonding with all its customers, not about rewarding those who generate the most profit.

At Starbucks, our rewards program comes from a different philosophy, the marketing manager Justin Tidmarsh wrote in 2012 on the My Starbucks Idea blog, explaining why the company does not give more stars for buying more items per transaction. At its simplest, we like seeing you, regardless of whether your purchase is a short-brewed coffee or four Venti White Chocolate Mochas. My Starbucks Rewards is designed to show our appreciation simply for stopping by.

If you step back, the we like seeing you, regardless is a nonsensical statement from a company. Starbucks as an entity has no feelings, and its shareholders want profits, which come in greater quantity from customers who buy more. And sure enough, in just a few years, the company realized it actually does like seeing customers more when they spend a lot.

With the we like seeing you framing, Starbucks fell into a trap that is common with loyalty programs: establishing not just an exchange relationship with its customers based on mutual benefit, but a communal relationship based on mutual caring and support. The norms surrounding communal relationships  the fiction that a company is your friend  can strengthen customers bonds with a company. But they also set up customers for disappointment.

That said, Starbucks has not been the only violator of communal norms in the Starbucks customer relationship. I have it on good authority that many Starbucks customers  including at least one Upshot editor  have been gaming the existing system by splitting their transactions: for example, being rung up once for a coffee and again for a muffin, in order to receive two stars when they might otherwise get just one.

You might say, hey, Starbucks is a big company, and theres nothing in the My Starbucks Rewards terms and conditions that would seem to prohibit transaction-splitting. And thats fair enough in an exchange relationship, but taking advantage of a technicality is probably not how you would treat a friend.

If customers are going to take a hey, its just business approach to their relationship with Starbucks, they should expect the company to do the same  and it has.",[]

Personal Health Jane Brody on health and aging.

I had no idea the world of food was so big. There are so many simple, tasty foods from all these cultures that are so easy to make. You dont have to eat them in a restaurant or be a trained chef to prepare them.

This is what Lynn Fredericks, the creator of FamilyCook Productions, discovered when, divorced with two young sons, she sought to reduce tension in her household by enlisting the boys help in the kitchen and introducing them  and herself  to cooking healthful, easy-to-prepare and delicious foods, and eating them together in a civilized fashion.

You might call it gracious dining: cloth napkins in rings, tea lights, flowers occasionally and, most important of all, no TV, mail or toys at the table.

The food industry keeps telling parents to go out to eat and order from the childrens menu for the kids, Ms. Fredericks said. As an alternative to the ubiquitous burgers and fries, mac n cheese and sodas, she said, I began offering cooking workshops for young mothers, encouraging them to use some time each day to connect in a happy way with their children.

What began as a personal mission grew into a nonprofit organization, now 20 years old, that teaches schoolchildren and their families the delights that can ensue from preparing affordable, fresh and tasty foods that benefit their health and well-being.

Though lacking credentials in dietetics, Ms. Fredericks was aided by two experts, Mercedes Sanchez, a food-loving dietitian who grew up in Spain and who specializes in one-pot cooking, and Antonia Demas, founder of the Food Studies Institute and creator of the Food Is Elementary curriculum that teaches children about organic gardening, environmental issues, plant-based nutrition and healthy cooking.

With support from foundations and government agencies, Ms. Fredericks and a number of professional collaborators created curriculums that teach nutrition through cooking for preschoolers through high schoolers.

No elaborate equipment is needed. Classrooms can perform culinary miracles with just a sink, a portable induction stove and a good knife or two, Ms. Fredericks said.

Parents initially looked at me as if I had six heads, and wondered why I was having the kids make Thai-inspired fish chowder and not mac n cheese with broccoli, she said. Despite parental protests that my kids would never eat that, the children really enjoyed the more exotic dishes they prepared, she added.

The programs, which have been field-tested with great success, provide nutrition education through hands-on cooking in schools and community organizations, on farms and in other settings around the country. The organization estimates it has reached more than 200,000 families, some members of which have gone on to become health educators themselves.

Fatima Basir of Brooklyn started in the program at 16 and lost so much weight  some 50 pounds  that her first summer out of college, she got a job at a weight-loss camp for children. Now 22, Ms. Basir works for theHarlem Childrens Zones healthy eating initiative.

Joel Allette, 21, who lost about 20 pounds as a teenage participant, is jointly talented in cooking and music. He now teaches Teen Battle Chef, a FamilyCook program, at Urban Assembly School of Music and Art in Brooklyn and has composed three songs for Ms. Frederickss endeavor to promote healthy eating and exercise.

You wouldnt believe how many kids lose weight in our program, Ms. Fredericks said. No crash diets allowed. The kids know its a lifestyle change.

But good health is hardly the only goal of her programs. Cooking by the children in schools is coordinated with lessons in mathematics, science and culture. For example, young children learn both math and portion control when divvying up a recipe for six among themselves. They learn where food comes from and the importance of sustainability, as well as food science and safety.

In preparing meals together, the children learn teamwork. And teens who participate in groups of six in the semester-long Teen Battle Chef program (fashioned like a TV show competition) hone their public speaking skills when describing the cultural background and nutritional value of the dishes they prepare.

Teens do presentations for their parents, who are then more inclined to let the kids prepare foods at home, said Ms. Fredericks, who is also the author of Cooking Time Is Family Time and Get Your Family Eating Right!

The program inspires insight into other cultures and tolerance. While learning about Japan, for example, elementary school students might prepare a Japanese tea ceremony. The world of food is a much bigger place, and it can be fun to explore the cuisines of other cultures, Ms. Fredericks said.

The emphasis, too, is on simple ingredients that can produce tasty and colorful dishes. Theres no need for special ingredients, she said. In making a stir-fry dish, the children learn to use whatever is in the fridge.

The program for preschoolers focuses on introducing children to a wide range of colorful fruits, vegetables and healthy snacks. An evaluation in Women, Infants and Children centers showed it increased the amount and variety of fruits and vegetables purchased at farmers markets by participating families.

The 15 weeks of the elementary school curriculum are seasonally linked, and emphasize these nutritional priorities: breakfast, portion control, juices, avoiding fast food, understanding food marketing, restaurants and snacking. At family night sessions, parents help their young chefs prepare a meal at school.

FamilyCook Productions uses a business model to train facilitators around the country. Some come from departments of public health, others from nonprofit organizations, as well as schools and community groups. Parents, too, can become facilitators. In addition to food preparation and teaching techniques, trainees learn how to store food and equipment, and must pass an assessment in food safety.

We now have the capacity to train anyone anywhere because everything is online, Ms. Fredericks said.

She added that FamilyCook Productions is constantly retooling our programs. For example, with a research grant from the National Institutes of Health, trained Teen Battle Chef students are working to improve high school wellness by sharing easy ways to make healthier foods and drinks with their peers.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE  I found this one very difficult for the day of the week, possibly because I approached it nonchalantly and filled in several words incorrectly, including a theme answer, then had to right my wrongs to finish.

When I solve I almost always scan once for gimmes before settling in. Im not sure if this is the most efficient approach but its reflexive, and Im always pleased when I find some substantial words that seem to fit the bill. For this puzzle, three of these were BURNOUT for 20 across, fatigue; ABOUTFACE for 29 down, complete reversal; and JELLYFISH for 25 across, translucent sea creature that drifts with the current, which was a mighty specific clue  one that I would have looked sideways at on Friday or Saturday, but blithely took at face value here.

I then went up to the northeast corner (Im a lefty  maybe thats why  habit again) and got far enough to replace BURNOUT with TIRE OUT, and figured out BOISE, where you need an ID (for Idaho) to get your mail, one of a few clever wordplays in this puzzle. I even worked west and figured out NATURE PRESERVES, which was enough to give me the cute theme. But then I got stuck on that JELLYFISH for a long time. Maybe Im stubborn, maybe Ive never in my life heard of MOON JELLY; but I confess that I sent a few brain cells back to my long-term memory to see if there could possibly be any other chipmunks than Theodore, Simon and ALVIN, because I was trying to smush JUKE in for a Karaoke need and keep ABOUT FACE.

Soon enough, though, that straightened itself out. I thought that a lot of the clues and answers in this puzzle were solidly beyond beginner-level. VOLTEFACE obviously stopped me for a bit; UPBRAIDED, PILASTERS, IRATER and ABBESS are all classic, more challenging fill.

It was easy to find chipmunks singing slow jams but that just didnt seem fair.

Being out of shape at age 18 may increase your risk for eventually developing Type 2 diabetes, regardless of your weight and family history, a new study says.

The study looked at data from more than 1.5 million Swedish men, using tests of muscle strength and aerobic capacity when they were conscripted for military service at age 18, between 1969 and 1997. Their muscle strength had been measured with hand grip and other tests, and their aerobic capacity calculated as they exercised on a stationary bicycle.

With this data in hand, researchers checked the mens medical records from 1987 to 2012. They found 34,008 cases of Type 2 diabetes over an average 26 years of follow-up. The study is in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

Both low aerobic capacity and low muscle strength at 18 were associated with a higher risk for Type 2 diabetes; poor aerobic capacity was a slightly stronger risk factor. Having both weak muscles and low aerobic capacity more than tripled the risk for future diabetes. The effect was independent of other risk factors  body mass index, family history of diabetes, education and socioeconomic status.

Early life interventions are really important, said the lead author, Dr. Casey Crump, a professor of family medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. Prevention of Type 2 diabetes should begin early in life, and should include both aerobic fitness and muscular strength. This is important regardless of peoples weight.",[]

His project An Iranian Journey, which was published on Lens in 2013, earned Mr. Fatemi the World Understanding award in the Pictures of the Year International contest last month.

Im trying to get away from the stereotypes and cliches that Western cultures have about the Iranian people, said Mr. Fatemi, 35. Most Americans have a third world perception and cant even separate Arab culture from Persian culture.

Mr. Fatemi says there is a lifetimes worth of photographs for him to make in his country.

But he cannot.

Photo

The day after Mr. Fatemis story was featured on the website of his photo agency, Panos Pictures, he received the first of many emails from conservative hard-liners who wield power in political parties, official news media and the government. They accused him of undermining Islam and of having a Western ideology and perspective, Mr. Fatemi said. Similar emails were sent to his photo agency, and its website was blocked in Iran.

At the time, Mr. Fatemi was visiting a photo festival in San Diego, and it quickly became clear to him that it would be too dangerous to return to Iran.

Although he settled in Chicago, he did not give up on documentary photography in Iran. He enlisted eight of his former students and started A Journey Inside, a documentary project on social issues in Iran. Although he could not be there physically, Mr. Fatemi stayed in contact through Skype, social media, email and phone.

The stories the participants  four men and four women from different parts of the country  chose focused on the place of women in Iranian society, university students, drought and a disabled war veteran. Mr. Fatemi did not tell them to take any particular point of view or political position.

I just want them to be free and take the pictures they need to, he said. I chose a subject that would not cause them to be arrested or get into any trouble if they were published. There are many subjects that could force photographers to leave the country as I did.

Photo

Indeed, scores of photographers have fled Iran since the post-election protests and 2009 crackdown, he added.

Mr. Fatemi arranged and led virtual workshops throughout Iran to teach his students how to be better visual storytellers and to have an open-minded viewpoint. At times, local government officials banned his workshops because they included men and women together and because a critical documentary viewpoint was politically unacceptable.

The project lasted 14 months, including training and photographing under the supervision of Mr. Fatemi and Panos Pictures, with the assistance of Maryam Athari. The photographers included Zahra Ostadzadeh, Bahar Aslani, Hossein Heidarpour, Hamid Akhlaghi, Negin Kiani, Saeed Zeidi, Mahya Rastegar and Ali Tajik.

Ms. Ostadzadeh, who has a masters degree in sociology, concentrates on womens issues in her photography and video work. For the project, she documented an all-girls boarding school in Kerman Province where, she said, the girls were satisfied by what they have, even though in the larger society women are sometimes seen as inferior.

I wanted my photos to improve their life, she said. My approach wasnt looking down at them. I dont want my photos to only show poverty. Instead I want to show lifes happiness and the great goals they envision. I want to show that despite all the poor conditions and poverty that should be changed they are still content.

Photo

For Mr. Fatemi, receiving the award from POYi was a little bittersweet. Although he cannot return to Iran for now, he has forged a new way forward  with his students. The Journey Inside project was, he said, another way to get at the truth.

Iran is a very complex and complicated country, he said. We photographers think that through this kind of photography we can understand ourselves, our beliefs and our viewpoints.

nytimes.com,2016-03-03 00:00:00,The Puerto Rican Lower East Side,"['David Gonzalez', 'Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Reference Timestopics People G David_gonzalez Index Html']","When I first came across Arlene Gottfrieds vintage pictures of Puerto Rican New York, Bacalaitos & Fireworks, I chuckled. Her reference to the siren call of a Lower East Side street vendor hawking codfish fritters and firecrackers struck me as having all the ingredients for a Fourth of July party (just add Bacardi). My second reaction was nervousness  given the areas devastation from poverty and drugs during the 1970s and 1980s, how would the photographer portray this world?

With love and humor, it turns out.

This is not to say that Ms. Gottfried glossed over the untidy parts of the local narrative. It was impossible not to notice the empty lots, the dazed junkies, the weary-faced couples. But she did not let herself be mesmerized by that. She delved into the community, where her mother had moved after decades in Crown Heights, and connected with its residents who, in turn, embraced her and her camera.

She documented birthday parties in spotless living rooms (with chairs sheathed in plastic slipcovers); whole pigs roasting on a spit in an empty lot; religious services and funerals, first communions and parades. Her camera also singled out critical, if sometimes overlooked, cultural figures like Jorge Brandon, considered to be the father of Nuyorican poetry. In more than a few images, she has Miguel Pinero, the poet, playwright, addict and criminal whose life was as complicated as it was short.

Most of the images were from the Lower East Side  Loisaida  although she also took some in Brooklyn and the Bronx, as well as along the Fifth Avenue route of the Puerto Rican Day Parade.

It was a mixture of excitement, devastation and drug use, said Ms. Gottfried, who will be exhibiting a selection of these images at Daniel Cooney Fine Art in Chelsea from March 3 through April 16. But there was more than just that. It was the people, the humanity of the situation. You had very good people there trying to make it.

Photo

Ms. Gottfrieds ability to connect to communities of color is something she credits to her family having stayed in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, even after many of her white neighbors fled during the 1960s. She became friends with the newcomers.

By the 1970s, her mother had moved to the Lower East Side  where she herself would live in the 1990s  and she visited often. Looking beyond the jarring landscape, she found the people to be welcoming. She ended up taking pictures for years, not with any specific project in mind.

In some cases, she would be struck by what she encountered, like the procession of girls about to make their first communion, walking down the street past televisions perched on cars and connected by extension cords to lampposts. Or the time someone told her to keep walking down the street.

Wait until you see what you find down the block, she recalled being told. And there was this pig roast. You get exposed to all that being outside. It was a lot of fun.

Her pictures reflect that, including touches of humor and warmth familiar to anyone who grew up during that time, when residents often had only each other for support.

The humor comes from being with the people, Ms. Gottfried said. Part of it is how I see life. You know, the humanity. There was openness, and I felt really comfortable. It was a mixture of excitement, joy and warmth. There was this striking beauty the people had.

Photo

Her pictures of some of the areas cultural figures  whom she often encountered at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe  also show the areas rich creativity.

It was a big mixture of people involved in all kinds of things, she said. I used to enjoy having conversations with people and bumping into people you knew. The musicians and the actors, there was a lot of theater going on at the cafe and other places. We could go to Henry Street Settlement and there would be a free Tito Puente concert.

Ms. Gottfried would go on to other projects, other assignments. The area would undergo a major transformation, attracting newcomers to renovated tenements and luxury buildings. Some pockets of the old world remain, which makes her feel sentimental.

Money came in and changed everything, she said. But it was an experience I had and others didnt. I was able to go to places other people would only see in pictures.

And not all change was unwelcome. Over the years, she had photographed Johnny Cintron, looking rough and covered with tattoos. She even visited him in jail and took a picture of him there. She always remembered him as a smart guy who went astray.

Two years ago, Mr. Cintron tracked her down on Facebook. The two decided to meet at Tompkins Square Park.

Walking through there, I was bumping into people I knew, Ms. Gottfried recalled. I was sitting there thinking, how will I recognize Johnny? Then, I saw a man standing with his back to me. I recognized him from behind, how he stood. There he was. Hes all cleaned up, married, looking good and doing well. Thank God for that.

My sister is the greatest blessing in my life. My parents and I were at the hospital when her birth mother went into labor, so she has been with us for her entire life. My parents never told her that she was adopted, and they asked me not to say anything. They planned on telling her when she was old enough to understand, but they kept putting it off. They know that I believe they have done her a serious disservice.









I think she suspects shes different. She asks me sometimes why shes so much shorter than the rest of us, for example. I do my best to deflect her questions, but it hurts every time. My sister and I are very close, and we see each other often. Keeping this lie feels like a giant burden, but, at this point, I dont know that it would do her any good to know the truth. She was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder and has been working hard to keep her life balanced. Finding out now that shes adopted could throw her into a depression. I fear, however, that with the mail-in DNA tests available these days, or should a medical emergency arise, shell find out the truth and she wont forgive me.

I want my sister to feel as deeply loved as she is, and I am at a loss for what to do. Name Withheld

How do we end up in these binds? Easily. And, in a way, rationally. Sorites  from the Greek for heap  is the name of a philosophical paradox. A grain of sand isnt a heap, and adding one more grain cant make it a heap, and as you add grains of sand, you reason that another grain cant turn your pile into a heap. Yet at some point, a heap is what you have. In the temporal realm, theres an analogous problem. Very often, it wont do any harm to wait one more day to do something. So you put the deed off until, at some point, youve waited too long.

Sorites sins can creep up on well-intentioned people. Maybe your wife meant to tell you, when you first started dating, that she once had a fling with your brother, but the time never seemed right. There was no particular moment when she crossed the line from permissible deferral to culpable silence. A decade later, though, a spiny eel wriggles in her stomach whenever she thinks about it. She prays you never find out. Sorites sins can rock relationships.

They can sometimes rock nations. When the German novelist Gunther Grass, often called the conscience of his country, was in his 70s, he revealed that he had served in the Waffen-SS as a teenager. The public was dismayed. Not because of the consequences of a youthful decision, but because he kept quiet about it for so long. If you rewind to the start of his career, there was never a specific day when it was incumbent on him to discuss this painful happenstance. Then decades passed, and it became a shame-heaped secret.

Now, to your predicament. Your parents had a responsibility to tell your sister the truth, and no doubt they meant to  just not at any specific time. (On what day of the calendar does old enough to understand fall?) Then so much time elapsed that they couldnt justify not having told her.

The sorites model helps explain how we can gradually end up in a dire state through inaction. It doesnt, alas, offer solutions. But I can make one general suggestion about the form of procrastination your parents evidently succumbed to. If its unclear when someone is ready to be told something, then the question May I tell her today? will get you there quicker than Must I tell her today?

So now what? Your folks asked you not to tell; the promise you presumably made should be taken seriously. But it matters that your parents extracted the promise from you when you were a child; it also matters that they didnt live up to their side of it. Your sister really is entitled to know this basic fact about her life and they arent entitled to command your silence indefinitely (though you should tell them if youre breaking it).

The main argument against informing your sister is that shes currently in a precarious condition. Because you know her well, youll have to gauge how the revelation will affect her. You might seek guidance from her doctor as to when and how its safe to tell her. To do so, it would probably make sense to ask your sister, first, if she would let you talk to her doctor about ways in which you can help her.

Maybe today isnt the best time to break the news. Maybe tomorrow isnt, either. But dont let too many more days go by.

My 66-year-old sister was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005. Within two years, she died. During her illness, she would not tell our 88-year-old mother of the severity of her condition. She lived 100 miles away, so Mom couldnt see her easily. She called when she had the strength. Mom would say to me: What is wrong with your sister? She doesnt sound right, and she never invites me to come for a visit anymore. I would answer: I dont know, Mom. Did you ask her? All the while, my sisters time was running out.

I begged my sister to tell her the truth. (My sister had extracted a promise from me that I would not tell Mom; she said she would get better and then tell our mother why she hadnt invited her.) I spoke with friends in the counseling profession. Most agreed that I should honor the sick persons wishes. And I did so until two weeks before the end.

I took my mother to see my sister, who was so weak she couldnt sit up. To this day, I feel that I made the wrong decision in hiding the truth. I could see the hurt in my mothers eyes that she was not allowed to spend more time with her dying child. Five years later I lost my own beloved daughter to the same ravaging disease. I was able to tend to her in her last year. Should I have given my mom that privilege? Name Withheld

It was your sister who made the wrong decision. No doubt, she wanted to spare your mother, but it also seems that she wasnt willing to face the reality of her situation. By the time the truth was clear, she may have felt it was too late to come clean. Another sorites situation.

Though your sister was wrong, its hard to hold it against her. Its tough to make the right choices when you are terrified by the prospect of a painful death. She might have been comforted by asking her family to gather around. But it was her choice to make, and you cant blame yourself for doing what she asked, especially once you promised to do so.

What about your decision to tell your mother when it was clear your sister was dying? You dont say how your sister felt about it. Even if she didnt agree, the moral gravity of the promise may have been outweighed by the consideration that guided you: allowing your mother and sister to be together one last time.",[]

LONDON  Less than a year after his unexpected general election victory, Prime Minister David Cameron has undertaken an even greater challenge. Staking his future on the outcome, he is holding a referendum on June 23 to decide whether Britain should stay in the European Union, or leave.









Mr. Cameron is said to be a lucky politician, good in a crisis. But is this a gamble too far?

Not since 1975 have Britains voters been given a specific say on their countrys participation in the union, which has undergone a transformation in the intervening years, evolving from a free-trade pact into an integrated political and economic alliance with many of the features of a superstate. Those who favor Britains departure, or Brexit, claim that too much control has been lost to the European Commission in Brussels and the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

Like a majority of Conservatives of his generation, Mr. Cameron himself is a euroskeptic, firmly opposed to European federalism. Yet he believes with no less vigor that Britain can have the best of both worlds, and would suffer economically, diplomatically and strategically outside the union.

Photo

As evidence of his determination to strike a sensible balance, the prime minister promised to renegotiate Britains terms of membership before putting the matter before the electorate. This deal, struck in Brussels on Feb. 19 after more than 30 hours of talks, is considerably better than most of the critics will admit. On a range of issues  Britains exemption from the goal of ever closer union, the benefits it must pay to European Union migrants, the position of the City of London, the ability of national parliaments to resist European law  Mr. Cameron won significant concessions.

The Leave camp claims that this so-called special status is flimsy and will lack the status of law until enshrined in a European Union treaty. But as those around Mr. Cameron admit, the fine print of the agreement was never going to be the deciding factor in the referendum.

Inasmuch as such surveys can be relied on after failing to predict the wide margin of Mr. Camerons victory in last years general election, opinion polls suggest that 15 to 20 percent of voters are undecided. It is their support that both campaigns must now chase. And that battle became all the more dramatic when Boris Johnson, the charismatic Conservative mayor of London, declared himself a supporter of a Brexit.

Like Mr. Cameron, Mr. Johnson is an upper-middle-class product of Englands most famous private school, Eton. But their styles could scarcely be more different.

In his statement to members of Parliament about the deal and referendum, Mr. Cameron made scathing references to Mr. Johnsons position and ambitions. These were ill received by the mayor. Neither man looks in any mood to back down. Whichever side prevails at the ballot box, this particular breach may be irreparable.

Mr. Johnson was only a political friend. But Michael Gove, the highly regarded justice secretary, has been close to Mr. Cameron for years. On the night of the 2010 election, Mr. Goves wife looked after the Cameron children. Mr. Gove also helped to write most of Mr. Camerons key speeches. So his decision to champion Britains exit from the union is a blow to Mr. Cameron personally as well as politically.

Another longtime ally, Michael Howard, a former party leader and now a Conservative peer, has also abandoned the prime ministers camp. On Feb. 25, he wrote in The Daily Telegraph that Mr. Camerons quest for a better deal for Britain had met with failure. The only step that might shake Europes leaders out of their complacency, he went on, was the shock of a vote by the British people to leave.

So much has been imperiled by this referendum. Membership in the European Union is not the essence of the countrys nationhood, but it gives Britain global punch and secures its economic prosperity. If Britons vote to leave, they will also be voting, in effect, for Mr. Cameron to quit Downing Street, his home of six years. After the distraction of the long referendum campaign, the Conservative Party would then be embroiled in a monthslong leadership contest. This would probably involve a runoff between George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. Johnson, his prospects enhanced by backing the winning side in the referendum.

This would be merely the local consequence. As Britain formalized its withdrawal, it would find its status in the world dropping like a bad stock. Britains special relationship with the United States would doubtless endure in rhetoric and sentiment. But America would need a new best friend for its negotiations with the European bloc.

Within Britains borders, most Scottish voters would be deeply aggrieved at exiting the European Union. One of the first tasks confronting the new prime minister could well be to grant a further referendum on the union of England and Scotland. The last such vote, in September 2014, resulted in a defeat for Scottish independence (by 55 percent to 45 percent), but the Scottish National Party has tightened its political grip since then. A Brexit could then be enough to drive Scotland and England apart  if only to allow the Scots to negotiate continued membership as a distinct nation.

A leadership crisis, the breakup of Britain and a shrinking role on the global stage as a commercial, diplomatic and strategic force: The stakes could hardly be higher. When Mr. Cameron won last years general election, he called it the sweetest victory. Doubtless it was. But losing the referendum would be the most bitter defeat imaginable.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Limit the Next Presidents Power to Wage Drone Warfare,"['Jameel Jaffer', 'Brett Max Kaufman']","Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

WHEN Barack Obama took office as the reluctant heir to George W. Bushs war on terror, he renounced some of his predecessors most extreme policies. There is one Bush-era policy, though, that President Obama made emphatically his own: the summary killing of suspected militants and terrorists, usually by drone.









In less than a year, the president will bequeath this policy, and the sweeping legal claims that underlie it, to someone who may see the world very differently from him. Before that happens, he should bring the drone campaign out of the shadows and do what he can to constrain the power he unleashed.

President Bush started the drone wars, but Mr. Obama vastly expanded them. Almost entirely on his watch, United States strikes have killed as many as 5,000 people, possibly 1,000 of them civilians. The president approved strikes in places far from combat zones. He authorized the C.I.A. to carry out signature strikes aimed at people whose identities the agency did not know but whose activities supposedly suggested militancy. He approved the deliberate killing of an American, Anwar al-Awlaki.

The president also oversaw an aggressive effort to control the public narrative about drone strikes. Even as senior officials selectively disclosed information to the news media, his administration resisted Freedom of Information Act lawsuits, arguing that national security would be harmed if the government confirmed drone strikes were taking place.

The administration also argued in court that federal judges lacked the authority to say whether drone strikes were lawful. It refused to release the evidence that it claimed made Mr. Awlaki a lawful target. In lieu of information, the administration offered assurances that the president and his aides were deeply moral people who agonized over authorizing lethal force.

But as this election season has underscored, powers this far-reaching should not rest solely on the character of the president and his advisers. In a democracy, the ability to use lethal force must be subject to clear and narrow limits, and the public must be able to evaluate whether those limits are being respected. Mr. Obama observed almost three years ago that the same human progress that gives us the technology to strike half a world away also demands the discipline to constrain that power. At the very least, the president has the responsibility to ensure that drone strikes are subject to meaningful oversight.

The president should begin by publishing the Presidential Policy Guidance, a document that has provided the legal and administrative framework for the drone campaign since 2013. In response to litigation, the administration informed a federal judge last week that it would release parts of the document, but it remains to be seen how extensive the disclosure will be and whether it will be accompanied by a broader reconsideration of the secrecy surrounding the program.

The president should also release the legal memos that purport to justify drone strikes away from battlefields. Courts have compelled the administration to release portions of two of these memos, but the public should have access to all of the governments legal reasoning about who may be targeted, where and for what reasons. The government has a legitimate interest in protecting properly classified information, but the law behind the drone program should not be a secret.

The president should also make it the countrys default practice to acknowledge all drone strikes  not just those carried out on conventional battlefields, as in Iraq and Syria. To facilitate this shift toward greater transparency and to strengthen congressional oversight, he should withdraw the C.I.A.s authority to carry out drone strikes and provide that any future strikes will be authorized and carried out by the Department of Defense.

On Monday, the presidents chief counterterrorism adviser said that the government intended to disclose annual assessments of casualties from lethal strikes outside areas of active hostilities. This information will be of limited use to the public, however, unless the government also discloses information about individual strikes  when and where they took place, and numbers of casualties.

Finally, the president should establish a policy of investigating and publicly explaining strikes that kill innocent civilians, and of compensating those victims families. After an American drone strike last year killed two Western hostages, Warren Weinstein and Giovanni Lo Porto, the government apologized, opened an investigation and said it would offer compensation. It should do the same when drone strikes kill or maim innocent Pakistanis, Yemenis and Somalis.

These kinds of changes, of course, will not quiet the drone campaigns critics. Many of those critics believe, as we do, that the campaign is broader than international law permits, that congressional oversight should be far more stringent and that, at least in some circumstances, the lawfulness of strikes should be subject to after-the-fact review by the courts.

But at a minimum, the changes we propose would allow for a more informed debate about a subject that urgently needs one, and they would create new, if modest, checks against overreach and abuse. Equally important, the president could make the changes we propose on his own in the limited time he has left in office.

A second sibling from the film-directing duo that created The Matrix series came out as a transgender woman on Tuesday after a reporter from The Daily Mail appeared on her front porch to ask questions about her gender identity.









The director, Lilly Wachowski  who with her sister, Lana, are the first major Hollywood directors to come out as transgender  condemned the British publication for sending the reporter to her home on Monday night and released her own statement to The Windy City Times in Chicago.

I knew at some point I would have to come out publicly, she wrote. You know, when youre living as an out transgender person its ... kind of difficult to hide. I just wanted  needed some time to get my head right, to feel comfortable. But apparently I dont get to decide this.

Ms. Wachowski thanked friends and family for their support, saying it had given her the chance to actually survive this process.

With her announcement, Ms. Wachowski, previously known as Andy, joined a growing list of openly transgender people in Hollywood, including her sister and filmmaking partner, who was known as Larry before coming out in 2012; the reality stars Caitlyn Jenner and Chaz Bono; the writer and musician Our Lady J; and the actresses Laverne Cox, Alexandra Billings, Trace Lysette and Hari Nef.

The Wachowskis created The Matrix films before transitioning, and have collaborated on a number of other high-profile projects over the past two decades, usually works of science fiction that include a lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender element, including Bound, V for Vendetta, Jupiter Ascending and the Netflix series Sense8.

Lilly Wachowski recounted the exchange with The Daily Mail reporter in her statement to The Windy City Times, saying that he told her she had to sit down with him to tell her inspirational story and to have her picture taken  adding that she didnt want to have someone from The National Enquirer following me around, did I?

In a statement Wednesday, The Daily Mail said it categorically denies trying to coerce Ms. Wachowski into revealing her transgender identity.

Our reporter was extremely sympathetic and courteous at all times a spokesman for DailyMail.com said, referring to an unreleased transcript of the conversation with the director.

We wish Lilly Wachowski well with her journey, though we are surprised as to how she has reacted, given the courtesy and sensitivity with which the reporter approached her, he added.

The Daily Mail was harshly criticized for its handling of transgender issues after it ran a column about Lucy Meadows, a British teacher who transitioned over Christmas break in 2012, under the headline Hes not only in the wrong body ... hes in the wrong job.

Ms. Meadows killed herself three months later, citing debts, job stress and the recent death of loved ones, according to The Guardian. But the coroner in Lancashire, England, condemned the news media after her death and singled out The Daily Mail for what he called its character assassination and ridicule and humiliation of a private citizen.

In its statement, Wednesday, The Daily Mail rejected the argument that its coverage had played any role in the death of Ms. Meadows.

Ms. Wachowski said Monday was not the first time that she had been approached by a reporter.

Her agent called several times over the past year to tell her a media outlet was about to publish an article on her gender transition and had requested a comment, she said.

She prepared a mega-sarcastic statement to release in the event that a publication wrote about her transition without her consent, Ms. Wachowski said, but each time, the media outlet backed down.

And now here they were, at my front door, almost as if to say  Theres another one! Lets drag em out in the open so we can all have a look! Ms. Wachowski wrote about her exchange with The Daily Mail reporter.

Transgender people in the United States face far higher rates of murder, poverty and unemployment than the rest of the population, and in the past year several states have considered laws that would make it illegal for a transgender person to use a public restroom that fits his or her gender.

Ms. Wachowski said she hoped the decision by other news media outlets to decline to publish articles before she came out reflected a growing awareness of the potentially fatal effect of publicly outing someone.

Faced with a reporter on her doorstep, however, she decided to take control of the information herself, she said.

So yeah, Im transgender, she wrote. And yeah, Ive transitioned.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-02-26 00:00:00,Video Review: Restoring Diesels Good Name With a New Range Rover,['Tom Voelk'],"Diesel is a dirty word these days thanks to the Volkswagen scandal.

Thats a shame, because the engine technology offers the kind of performance thats quite appealing, namely serious muscle off the line and significantly improved fuel economy over gasoline-powered engines.

Into this hostile environment, Land Rover brings its first diesel for the American market. Do not judge by the misdeeds of others; the Td6 3-liter turbodiesel motor may be the best way to motivate a Range Rover. Diesels stump-pulling power encourages off-roading, perfect when tossing this $103,925 (as tested) luxury vehicle on the Rubicon Trail.

Lets address the gaseous elephant in the room: emissions. Like other automakers, Land Rover uses a fluid called urea, which mists the exhaust to knock down emissions, turning harmful nitrogen oxide into plain old nitrogen. The urea tank gets filled every 10,000 miles or so. Theres low-pressure exhaust gas recirculation, too, but then Id be getting all technical on you.

The Td6 packs 254 horsepower and enough soul-satisfying torque to drag Lucifer back to Hades, 440 pound-feet to be precise. Five minutes behind the wheel of this rig is the best publicity diesel could have. Only those outside the car might, and I emphasize might, know this is a diesel. The telltale grumble is replaced with a sonic quality closer to gasoline direct-injection. Inside, the Range Rover is whisper quiet even as it cranks from rest to 60 miles an hour in about seven seconds. Fuel economy is officially rated by the government at 22 miles per gallon in the city, 29 on the highway. I averaged 28 in mixed driving, heavy on urban slogging.

Power is routed through an 8-speed transmission (its controller knob glides strikingly from the console on start-up). Most will leave Land Rovers Terrain Response four-wheel drive system in auto mode. For severe traversing, dial in the symbol of the terrain you plan to cross (much like sorting socks, only theres always a match). In everyday use, this deftly maneuvers the concrete canyons it will see most. Its no Miata, but its well controlled for the breed.

Imagine fording 35 inches of water while cocooned by fine leather and woodwork. In an S-Class Mercedes, that would mean something is terribly wrong. Everything seen and touched inside the Range Rovers cabin has a stout, hefty quality about it, even the floor mats. The Meridian sound system delivers on its lofty sonic promise. I want the carpet in my house.

The rear seats dont slide fore and aft to max out leg or cargo room. But if passengers complain about the space, feel free to kick them out. They get their own climate control, seat heaters and a great view of the sky. Cargo room is vast enough to haul furniture to the summer place. The air suspension drops the back for easier loading.

Land Rovers have a four-year, 50,000-mile warranty for those concerned about reliability. To be straight-up honest, my practical Midwest upbringing once saw the luxurious appointments of a Range Rover to be a little much. Who pushes a vehicle that begins at $85,945 through knee-deep mud on the way to boulder-strewn paths? I now find the amalgamation of opera house refinement and mountain goat ability perversely appealing.

The $1,500 premium for the diesel engine is a wise investment, less for the fuel economy than its driving pleasure. For the wealthy, a Range Rover can be a money saver, combining luxury car and off-roader into one purchase. S.U.V., in this case, stands for supremely upscale vehicle.",[]

DUBLIN  Nearly two weeks after an inconclusive general election, Irelands chances of forming a stable coalition government revolve around a single question: Can the two center-right parties that have long dominated Irish politics put aside nearly a century of enmity and find a way to run the country together?









The current prime minister, Enda Kenny, is still expected to be nominally in charge of the country when he visits the White House next week for the annual St. Patricks Day shamrock presentation. But his center-right Fine Gael partys big losses and the decimation of his junior coalition partner, the center-left Labour Party, have left him with few options for forming a new government.

After years of cutbacks that turned Ireland into the poster child for austerity in Europe, a furious electorate chose to overlook substantial job creation and economic growth, preferring instead to vent its anger at the Fine Gael-led government over the issues like record homelessness and long waits for hospital treatments.

Fine Gael remains the biggest party after the Feb. 26 general election, with 50 seats in the 158-seat assembly, despite having lost 27 seats. Its center-right rival, Fianna Fail, has 44 seats; left-leaning Sinn Fein has 23; and Labour has seven. The remaining seats are filled by a rainbow of smaller parties and independent candidates of every political hue.

Either Fine Gael or Fianna Fail has usually led the country, typically by relying not on the other but on a minority coalition partner or independents to give it a majority in Parliament.

This time out it is different: For the first time, neither of the big two has the numbers to form a government without the support of the other. But despite their ideological similarities, they have been split over differences evolving from the Irish Civil War and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921.

Fine Gael prides itself on fiscal responsibility, contrasting this with what it described as Fianna Fails free-spending policies that contributed to the last economic crash. In turn, in the prelude to an election that hinged to a large degree on a debate over budgetary austerity, Fianna Fail described Fine Gaels claim to have righted the economy as self-congratulatory bluster.

Since the election, the main two parties have been busy seeking support from the smaller parties and independent candidates but have studiously avoided public acknowledgment of contact with each other. Few political analysts believe an alliance between the pair would be a recipe for stable government.

It would be like Republicans and Democrats going into government together  to us in Ireland there doesnt seem to be much difference between one American president and another, but we know thats not the case, said Johnny Fallon, a political analyst based in Dublin. They simply dont trust each other, and trust is the basis of any government.

Mr. Fallon said he believed the pair would most likely be forced together in the short-term. But he predicted that the eventual outcome would be another election as the two parties jockey to undermine each other for longer-term advantage.

Although it would constitute an enormous gamble for either party, an immediate election remains an option. During the campaign, both parties ruled out any form of coalition and are now warning they will not go into power at any cost.

Charlie Flanagan, a member of Fine Gael and minister for foreign affairs, said in a statement on Friday that the country was still grappling with the aftermath of the economic crash, but he failed to answer the question directly as to whether Fine Gael would be open to forging a new beginning with Fianna Fail.

We will work in a progressive manner toward the formation of a new government, but not at any cost, Mr. Flanagan said. It is critical that any government formed is a lasting one. Stability is key at this point in the countrys recovery. Forming an unstable government is not in the peoples interest.

The skirmishing will begin in earnest when the new Parliament convenes on Thursday, but few expect much progress as an extended vacation period is on the horizon and Ireland is already becoming consumed with a series of public events to commemorate the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising, a seminal event in the states eventual independence from Britain.

Sinn Fein, the party founded as the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, has repeatedly ruled itself out as a minority partner in government, citing ideological incompatibility with either of the larger parties. Analysts say Fianna Fail in particular is wary that Sinn Fein could make further gains in the next election and become a potential governing party.

Sinn Feins leader, Gerry Adams, who had tried to rebrand his party as an anti-austerity voice of the left, appears keen to keep up the pressure on the larger parties and their inability to begin addressing the countrys problems.

The health and housing crises cannot be put on hold, Mr. Adams said last week. There are still people on hospital trolleys, some 425 across the state yesterday. There are still children being brought up in hotels, and this morning men and women woke up in the snow on the streets.",[]

nytimes.com,2011-03-14 00:00:00,Tuesday: Celebrity Guest Solver Merrill Markoe,"['Deb Amlen', 'Jeremy Newton']","Katie Orlinsky for The New York Times

TUESDAYS PUZZLE  We have a very funny guest today, so Im going to keep my own comments brief.

This is a very cool puzzle. The theme goes deeper than the ordinary horizontal, long entry theme. There are those, too, of course, but they all add to the pattern of circles that traipse across the grid. When youre finished, you might feel like humming. Or tickling the ivories. Providing the ivories dont mind.

In nontheme entry news, I found the southwest particularly entertaining, with the crossing of SEEDY and SCUZZ. I also liked seeing SIC EM BOY in the grid, although good luck trying to command Rex Parker to do anything, Mr. Newton. Oh, sorry. I think he meant it to be a canine command.

Merrill Markoe is a very funny writer, and she has accomplished so much that it is hard to know what to highlight. Youve read her books, seen her on television and listened to her on radio. She has won Emmy awards for, among other things, Late Night with David Letterman, and she was an on-air reporter for Michael Moores TV Nation and Not Necessarily the News. Merrills partner, Andy Prieboy, is a talented musician (he is a former member of the group Wall of Voodoo) and an author, having co-written The Psycho Ex Game with Merrill for Random House.

Merrill Markoes Solving Notes:

The only reason I can think of to explain why I am not usually a regular at the crossword puzzle party is that as a writer I spend my days locked in a catacomb, hiding from a horde of angry, incomplete sentences of my own design. Also, I am way behind on my YouTube videos of people feeding capybaras.

But I was so looking forward to doing this puzzle that the moment it arrived Tuesday evening at about 6 I invited my partner, singer-songwriter Andy Prieboy, to spend some time helping me solve it. I imagined a rousing back and forth, since we both work with words for a living. We would conquer it quickly, then feel smart, important and smug.

That lasted until I read the first nine Across clues out loud and learned that the only one we knew for sure was the name of an actress.

Come on! I said to Andy, You know war stuff. Who or what is a five-letter Sioux Adversary?

Look it up online he replied, sounding edgy.

I dont think were allowed to use the Internet, I said.

Whos going to know? he shot back, This reminds me of homework. Lets just do whatever it takes and get it over with.

In a few short minutes, we had both reverted to our eighth-grade personalities. I was afraid of getting a bad grade and he had become surly. So I did a quick Google search, hoping it wasnt considered cheating, only to find that some actual eighth grader had entered The Krawdjasndjgnfg under Sioux adversary on Answer.com.

My brain doesnt work this way, Andy fumed, heading back to his war video games. Im going to land on Normandy Beach. Have fun finding a seven-letter word for composite board.

After he left, and I quickly identified a Pulitzer Prize winner, a writer and a volleyball champion, my optimism returned and I became obsessed with finishing the rest of the puzzle. The more I accomplished, the more obsessed I became.

By 10 that night, when Andy wandered back in, high from a few hours of virtual bloodshed, I was about 75 percent done. But I still dont understand the clues inside these circles, I complained, I can see an alphabetical pattern but I dont get how it works.

Andy stood staring down at the puzzle over my shoulder for a few seconds, then laughed out loud, pointed to the letters and began to sing what he saw. In that moment, he also unlocked the solution to a couple of other clues that had me completely stumped. And now that the puzzle wanted to play with Andy, it had also become his friend. By about 11:30, he had filled in all the rest of the blanks.

And thus did we end our evening as I had hoped: feeling smart and important, if not very smug. Though Im still kind of proud we only used the Internet once.

Thanks for playing, Merrill and Andy!

nytimes.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Donald Trump Doesnt Understand Common Core (and Neither Do His Rivals),['Kevin Carey'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Donald Trumps presidential campaign has not been driven by detailed policy papers. But on one issue at least, his position is clear: He hates the Common Core State Standards. They are, he says, a total disaster, and he promises to abolish them upon assuming the presidency, because education has to be at a local level.









This is revealing, and not just because it shows Mr. Trumps ignorance of how American education actually works. He is promising to solve a problem that doesnt exist by using power the president doesnt have. His plan may also have the unintended effect of stultifying American greatness.

The president cant end the Common Core, because the federal government didnt create the Common Core. Governors and state boards of education developed and voluntarily adopted the standards in reading, language and math. Some states subsequently un-adopted them, as is their right. When Congress passed a new version of the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act last year, it prohibited the secretary of education from requiring or even encouraging states to adopt any uniform standards, Common Core or otherwise.

Mr. Trump has another claim about education: that Americas weak educational results will be improved by returning power to local school districts. Thats a notion, widely held, that is at odds with research, common sense and the education agenda of every president, Republican and Democrat, for the past 40 years.

Jimmy Carter elevated the Department of Education to a Cabinet-level agency. Ronald Reagan was initially cold to education standards, preferring to focus on vouchers  until his secretary of education, Terrel Bell, released the landmark A Nation at Risk report in 1983. It found that many locally controlled districts were letting students wander through their school years with few if any rigorous courses in math, science, literature or history.

President George H.W. Bush took up the banner next, collaborating with Bill Clinton, then the governor of Arkansas, to rally the nations governors around high academic standards. As president, Mr. Clinton built on that idea by shepherding a new education law in 1994 that required states to develop common standards for all schools within the state, and hold schools accountable for helping students measure up. George W. Bush embraced that idea as governor of Texas, and strengthened it with the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. President Obama supported the Common Core by using money from the 2009 economic stimulus package to finance better standardized tests and reward states that adopted challenging standards.

Educational improvement over that time period was steady, if not fast enough for anyones liking. The nations elementary school students made remarkable progress. The percentage of fourth graders who are proficient in mathematics tripled from 1990 to 2015. While high school students have not improved as fast, they are graduating at the highest rate in history. One of the main obstacles to further improvement, you could easily argue, is that standards still arent common enough.

Mr. Trump is correct that education is at a local level. Local school districts hire the principals and teachers, and experiment with methods and curriculums that they think work for their children. Most districts still have substantial autonomy to raise school taxes, though some districts arent able to and this can lead to pervasive inequality between rich and poor districts and brings our national results down.

But states and localities, in a sense, dont actually have the ability to set educational standards, even if they choose to. The world around us ultimately determines what students need to learn  the demands of highly competitive and increasingly global labor markets, the admissions requirements of colleges and universities, and the march of scientific progress.

The only choice local schools have is whether they will try to meet those expectations. The Common Core is simply a way of organizing and articulating standards that already exist, for the benefit of students, parents and teachers, so that schooling makes sense when children move between different grades, schools, districts and states.

Indeed, while Mr. Trump on the stump frequently complains that American test scores lag behind those of other nations, he doesnt mention that many high-achieving countries have adopted common standards for all students.

Why, then, does he hate the Common Core? Because many voters hate the Common Core, which has been subject to an intense disinformation campaign in recent years. Did you know that the Common Core was funded by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and Bill Ayers as part of President Obamas plan to impose Sharia Law on American schoolchildren and create a new Islamic caliphate? It wasnt, but you might think so if you read The Washington Times.

In fairness, Mr. Trump is not alone. Marco Rubio has pledged that on his first day in office he will stop any and all work on imposing Common Core on this country. (That will be easy, since there is no such federal work.) Ted Cruz has denounced the Common Core and supported the Local Control of Education Act, which would have the perverse effect of keeping tens of billions of taxpayer dollars flowing to government schools and their unionized work force while removing any requirements that those schools show educational results in exchange.

But Mr. Trump, more than his rivals, has made opposition to Common Core a part of the pillar of his (admittedly thin) domestic agenda. Its an education vision that is ultimately neither liberal nor conservative. Its a repudiation of four decades of bipartisan effort, and a return to a time when children were at the mercy of whatever local schools decided they should or should not learn.",[]

nytimes.com,2001-04-08 00:00:00,How to Solve the New York Times Crossword Puzzle,[],"A crossword puzzle is a battle between the puzzle maker and editor on one side and the solver on the other. But unlike most battles, both sides here have the same goal -- for the solver to win. A perfect puzzle may put up lots of resistance. It may, in fact, seem impossible at first. Ideally, though, in the end the solver should triumph and think, Oh, how clever I am!

The perfect level of difficulty, of course, differs from person to person. This is why, as editor, I vary the weekday Times crossword difficulty from easy-medium on Monday up to what the actor and puzzle aficionado Paul Sorvino calls ""the bitch mother of all crosswords"" on Saturday. (He said this as a compliment.) The goal is to have something for everyone. I advise new solvers to begin on Monday and see how far through the week they can go. The Sunday Times puzzle, while larger than its weekday counterpart, averages only Thursday-plus in difficulty.

Step 1 in solving any crossword is to begin with the answers you're surest of and build from there. The fill-in-the-blank clues are easy to spot and often the easiest to solve. Focus in the early stages on the three-, four-, and five-letter words, because the English language has relatively few of these, and the same ones tend to repeat a lot in puzzles. This is especially so for vowel-heavy words like ALEE, IOTA, EEL, AGO, OREO, etc. Watch for the celebrity names (UMA, ARTE, ENO, AGEE) and geographical names (ADA, AMES, ELON, ORONO) that crop up with unusual frequency. Once you have a few crossing letters in the longer answers, you'll be more likely to get them from their clues.

Don't be afraid to guess. At the same time don't be afraid to erase an answer that isn't working out. For the clue ""Butcher's offering,"" I once watched a solver successively guess T-BONE, CHUCK and STEAK before finally hitting upon the correct answer, SHANK. Don't assume that because you have a few crossing letters that your answer is necessarily correct. And if nothing seems to cross the answer you have filled in, be very wary.

Mental flexibility is a great asset in solving crosswords. Let your mind wander. The clue ""Present time"" might suggest nowadays, but in a different sense it might lead to the answer yuletide. Similarly, ""Life sentences"" could be obit, ""Inside shot"" is x-ray and my all-time favorite clue, ""It turns into a different story"" (15 letters), results in the phrase SPIRAL STAIRCASE.

The New York Times crossword has not printed hints like ""2 wds."" and ""3 wds."" since the early 1950's, so be on your toes for multiword answers. One answer that always seems to trip solvers up is R-A-N-D-R, which was clued as ""Leave time?"" when it first appeared in a Times puzzle several years ago. Afterward lots of solvers called and wrote me saying that they couldn't find the word RANDR in their dictionaries, and where did I get it? I had to inform them gently that the answer was three words, R AND R, as in the time when one goes on leave.

A question mark at the end of a clue can mean several things. In the above clue for R AND R, it means ""This clue is tricky! Be careful!"" It can also indicate that the answer only loosely fits the clue. For example, ""Cause for a head-slap?"" (BONER). Making a boner may or may not be cause for slapping one's forehead. When question marks appear at the ends of the clues for all the long answers in a puzzle, usually the marks are signals for related puns.

No matter how tricky or misleading the clues, they will always follow a fairly strict set of rules. Most important, a clue and its answer will always be expressed in the same part of speech and as a rule must be interchangeable in a sentence, with the same meaning each way.

If a crossword answer is not a Standard English word, the clue will usually signal this fact. Thus, a slangy answer will have a slangy clue. The clue for an abbreviated answer will contain the tag ""Abbr."" or else a word that is not usually abbreviated (""Entrepreneur's deg."" = M.B.A.). Similarly, words that are strictly foreign will be signaled either directly (""Boy: Sp."" = NINO) or indirectly (""Son, in Sonora""). By convention, diacritical marks are ignored in American crosswords, so don't worry about that tilde in ""nino.""

True crossword cognoscenti observe the bylines on the crosswords and prepare themselves accordingly. Cathy Millhauser, a frequent Times constructor, is famous for puns. In a puzzle called ""M-M-M"" she changed N sounds to M's at the end of familiar phrases, like SAVINGS AND LOAM, AMERICA ON-LIME and AS CRAZY AS A LOOM. Knowing her tendencies helps you nail one or two of the long puns, and you have a big advantage in getting the others.

The constructor's age is sometimes reflected in a puzzle. Frances Hansen, 81, one of The Times's longest-running crossword contributors, produces elegant grids full of classical knowledge, while Brendan Emmett Quigley, 26, a guitarist for a rock band in Boston, conveys a younger, more pop-cultured sensibility.

If you get stuck on a puzzle, a time-honored technique is to put it aside and return later. Perhaps the brain works subconsciously on problems in the interim. Whatever the case, a fresh look at a tough puzzle almost always brings new answers.

A question I am asked often is this: ""Is it cheating to use references?"" In reply I always quote Will Weng, one of my predecessors as Times crossword editor: ""It's your puzzle. Solve it any way you want."" And is it cheating to call The Times's 900 number to get answers? Well, of course! But what nobody knows won't hurt you.",[]

Cold weather and natural ice barriers used to protect the shore, but now the municipal village, home to some 600 residents, faces the immediate threat of inundation.

A recent study noted that Alaskas glaciers have lost some 75 gigatons of ice every year from 1994 to 2013. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, Alaska has been heating up twice as fast as the national average over the last 50 years, and the rising temperatures melt sea ice and thaw permafrost along the coast.

Frozen ice used to form natural barriers that protected Shishmarefs shores from powerful storm surges in autumn. But rising tides now threaten the remainder of an eroded coastline.

We hear about climate change and we hear about foreign countries like Moldova or some such island that is sinking and its all very remote and nebulous, Mr. Taradji said. The Alaska folks are here in the United States. They are folks on our team that are immediately threatened. Its not something that is going to happen in several generations, it is something that is happening to them right now as we speak.

Residents of Sishmaref were so alarmed by the tides that in 2002 they voted overwhelmingly in favor of relocation. Yet few have budged. Mr. Taradji went there to photograph how the villages residents are coping with climate change, staying at the local high school because he said it was the only building with running water.

After talking to the residents, whom he described as divided between elders and a new generation, he didnt find much urgency about the need to move.

I felt a sense of what can we do about it?  he said. A sort of resignation and wait-and-see attitude and hoping for the best from the older people I spoke with. There are not many options. Moving costs money, and the situation is a Catch-22 sort of thing.

Photo

Mr. Taradjis project is centered on people. Each day he would wake up, have breakfast with the schoolchildren, then walk around the village and ask people if he could photograph them.

I had seen many photos of the falling house and the erosion and videos about the erosion, he said. I wanted to show what it is all about. Erosion without people being affected is irrelevant. I wanted to show the people who are actually impacted by climate change.

He photographed 26-year-old Andrew Ningealook, a lifelong resident of Shishmaref, breaking the ice to dip his fishing net underneath (Slide 1). He photographed the mayor, Howard Weyiouanna, at home as he was getting ready to attend a City Council meeting. He photographed residents playing bingo, which he says is a favorite  if expensive  pastime, in which players can win as much as $1,000.

Funds are still needed for relocation. Although the Army Corps of Engineers has taken steps to set up a rock revetment, it is only a temporary solution, and the government has not decided on the villages new location.

Additionally, moving could cost hundreds of millions of dollars, an obstacle for other threatened villages in Alaska, too.

Mr. Taradji said part of the resistance to moving is that Shishmarefs residents have ancestral and cultural ties to the land.

They have their own culture and art and ways to work the food, he said. Its understood, for example, the way they work the seal oil is the best. So all this is threatened by the fact that their home will disappear in a near future.

Maria Sharapovas announcement on Monday that she had failed a drug test at the Australian Open was shocking. But perhaps more surprising was how quickly some of her sponsors turned their backs on her.









Just hours after Ms. Sharapova, the worlds highest-paid female athlete, admitted she had tested positive for the recently banned drug meldonium, Nike said it was suspending its relationship with her.

We are saddened and surprised by the news about Maria Sharapova, the company said, adding that it would continue to monitor the situation.

Other sponsors quickly followed. Porsche echoed Nikes statement, saying it had decided to postpone planned activities. The Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer said it had suspended negotiations to extend Ms. Sharapovas contract, which had expired in December.

Not all of Ms. Sharapovas sponsors have suspended their relationships with her. Evian, for one, said only that it would follow closely the development of the investigation, according to a statement reported by Reuters.

The statements from Nike, TAG Heuer and Porsche were certainly not definitive  suspending ties is not the same as severing them. But in this fast-paced social media age, will people realize the difference?

The swift decisions, even acknowledging their nuance, are still puzzling. After all, isnt Nike the same company that stood by Lance Armstrong for years as he battled doping accusations? More than that, the company publicly defended Mr. Armstrong in 2012 after the United States Anti-Doping Agency released a report that supported the claims.

Lance has stated his innocence and has been unwavering on this position, Nike said at the time, before dropping him a week later.

Nike has also stood by other athletes in their times of trouble, most notably Tiger Woods and Kobe Bryant. Nike signed an endorsement deal with the quarterback Michael Vick in 2011 after he had served time in prison for his involvement in a dogfighting operation. (The company had dropped him in 2007, but only after he admitted in court papers that he funded the dogfighting ring and helped kill dogs that were underperforming.)

Nike declined to comment beyond its statement about Ms. Sharapova.

TAG Heuer, for its part, signed the New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady to an endorsement deal last fall after the team was caught using underinflated game balls.

The rush by companies to distance themselves immediately from Ms. Sharapova is perhaps a product of social media, where outrage spreads like wildfire. (It could also have something do with the fact that Ms. Sharapova, a five-time Grand Slam champion, is past the prime of her career and her marketing power may be waning.)

In recent months, companies have almost seemed to trip over one another to dissociate themselves from any whiff of controversy. Last May, brands including Crayola and Pure Leaf Iced Tea used Twitter to announce they were no longer advertising during TLCs popular reality show 19 Kids and Counting after a report that one of the shows stars, Josh Duggar, had been investigated on suspicion of molesting underage girls. In July Subway suspended ties with its longtime spokesman Jared Fogle, just hours after his suburban Indiana home was raided by investigators. Mr. Fogle later pleaded guilty to sex acts with minors and distribution of child pornography.

More recently, Nike terminated its relationship with the boxer Manny Pacquiao, who is also a politician in the Philippines, a day after he apologized for making anti-gay remarks in an interview.

If a company comes out and theyre proactive and they make a statement like that immediately, it removes the possibility of the spotlight being turned on them, said Bob Williams, chief executive of Burns Entertainment and Sports Marketing, which represents brands that hire celebrities for endorsements.

(Nike has also ended deals with the football player Ray Rice, who was caught on video punching his fiancee in the face, and the South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius, who was convicted of killing his girlfriend in 2013.)

On the surface, at least, Ms. Sharapova, 28, did everything right to avoid this kind of backlash. She held a news conference, acknowledged taking the banned drug and provided a plausible explanation for why she failed the test.

I would think in those circumstances that as a brand you would take a little bit more of a wait-and-see approach to see what the public court of opinion thinks, said Kevin Adler, president of the marketing company Engage Marketing.

But perhaps companies have simply had enough with athletes making excuses.",[]

You would think that if the leader of a country friendly to America likened a serious contender for the American presidency to two of the premier villains of the 20th century, it would set off an uproar.

But Donald Trump has so debased the tone of the presidential race that there was hardly a murmur when President Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico did just that this week. Not only was there no way Mexico would pay for Mr. Trumps wall along the border, but that sort of demagogy, Mr. Pena Nieto said, was how Mussolini got in, thats how Hitler got in.

That may be a natural reaction given all the hatred Mr. Trump has hurled at Mexico. But Mr. Pena Nieto is not alone among people around the world increasingly frightened by the irresponsible and ignorant pronouncements of a man who could be the Republican nominee. Mr. Trump won at least two more states, Michigan and Mississippi, on Tuesday.

In January, the British Parliament held an extraordinary debate on whether to bar Mr. Trump from Britain on the grounds that his comments about Muslims amounted to hate speech (no vote was taken). Last week, Mr. Trumps exercise in Japan-bashing set off panic in the Japanese Foreign Ministry. In China, his vacillation between proclamations of love for the Chinese and fiery pledges of stern action against China for ripping us off has left experts and politicians scratching their heads. At least one foreign government tried to learn more about Mr. Trumps policy positions by making direct contact with his campaign, but has been unable to figure out who is the authoritative channel, one diplomat told The Times.

Spleen and grievance are at the core of Mr. Trumps thinking about the world. China, Japan, Mexico, Europe all must be made to stop exploiting Americas economy, he says; allies must be made to pay more for American protection; borders must be made impermeable to drug dealers, rapists and criminals. The rest is a swirl of instinctive reactions: He welcomes Russias military intervention in Syria; he would bomb the hell out of ISIS in Iraq; hed resume waterboarding; hed keep Guantanamo open.

For Mr. Trumps supporters, such talk amounts to saying it like it is and promises to somehow make America great again. For Americas closest allies in Europe, who have long counted on the United States to be an anchor of liberal democracy, such talk conjures only alarm. They know from their own difficult experience, both past and present, what to expect of fascistic and xenophobic leaders who appeal to the worst impulses. Whether Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen or Geert Wilders  all these right-wing populists are not only a threat to peace and social cohesion, but also to economic development, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel of Germany told the newspaper Welt am Sonntag.

Ms. Le Pen, who has compared Muslim street prayers to the Nazi occupation, is the leader of the far-right National Front party in France, which campaigns mostly on anti-immigrant policies. Mr. Wilders, head of the Dutch far-right Party for Freedom, has also raged against Islam and demanded a ban on the Quran. Some Europeans also see Mr. Trumps reflection in Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian prime minister and wealthy businessman who embarrassed and harmed his countrys reputation with his quips about Mussolini, his vulgar behavior and his destructive policies.

Dealing with an enormously complex and dangerous world is a major responsibility of the president of the United States. And that is why to Mr. Pena Nieto and many others Mr. Trumps rise is so significant and distressing.",[]
nytimes.com,2011-09-13 09:00:27,How Will Shortz Edits a New York Times Crossword Puzzle,['Alex Hoyt'],"Every crossword in the Times is a collaboration between the puzzle-maker and the puzzle editor. On average, about half the clues are mine. I may edit as few as five or ten percent of the clues, or as many as 95 percent for someone who does a great puzzle but not great clues. Why accept a puzzle when I'm going to edit 95 percent of the clues? Well, if someone sends me a great puzzle with an excellent theme and constructionyou want fresh, interesting, familiar vocabulary throughout the gridI feel it would be a shame to reject it on account of the clues, because I can always change them myself.

Will Shortz has served as the crossword puzzle editor for the New York Times since 1993. The only known person to hold a degree in enigmatology, the study of puzzles, he has been the puzzle master for NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday since the program's inception in 1987. In 1978 he founded the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, a competition which became the subject of the 2006 documentary Wordplay . In that film, aficionados such as Jon Stewart and Bill Clinton attest to their love of Shortz's puzzles, which are in fact only partly his. Each crossword is drawn from a pool of freelance submissionsroughly 75 to 100 per weekwith the accepted puzzles edited and often heavily revised by Shortz. Accepted puzzles are arranged in ascending difficulty throughout the week, with the Saturday puzzle the most daunting and the Sunday edition the largest. Here Shortz shares a submission from Elizabeth Gorski, along with his edits and his thoughts on what makes a good puzzle.

This puzzle came from Elizabeth Gorski, one of the pros. Liz is great at putting fresh entries at the short spaces of a grid. That's very hard to do. There was one thing about the construction I didn't like, and that was at 35 Down. The answer was LORELAI, and the sirens on the Rhine are of course ""Lorelei,"" with an ""e-i."" Liz's clue was Rory's mom on Gilmore Girls, and I didn't think solvers should have to know that. Sometimes I'll do little fixes myself. But this was big enough that I asked her to revise the grid. You can see the new letters in blue, where I've amended the manuscript. Then the puzzle was accepted. I earmarked it for a Wednesday, because the theme consists of straight-forward English, but it's a little playful.

Click the images below to enlarge

Her clue for 1 Across was simply ""Coach Ewbank""perfectly finebut I thought there would be some solvers who didn't know who Ewbank is, so I added the words ""who led the Jets to a Super Bowl III Championship."" That way, if you don't know the name, you'll learn something. Fourteen across was simply out of date: the PAC-10 is now the PAC-12. ""Iroquoian language"" I changed to ""Iroquoian people""I don't really know it as a language. ""Mexican hat"" was too easyof course that's a sombreroso I said, ""A Mexican might sleep under it."" Thirty-four is a matter of style: ""Middle East"" is generally rendered as ""Mideast."" I'm always working on brevity.

For 26 Down, Liz's clue is ""ignited anew."" Any time a clue says ""anew"" or ""again"" at the end of it, you know the answer's going to be a word starting with ""re-."" If possible, I like to hide that fact, so I re-clued this as ""like a candle night after night."" Liz clued 28 as the name of a play. It's trivia, either you know it or you don't. I thought it would be fun to clue it in a misleading way: ""90 is a pretty high one."" Your first guess is that I'm referring to temperature, and when the answer turns out to be something else you slap your forehead.

One clue that's fun and twisty is 11 Down: ""Wet blanket"" for SNOW. I can check the databaseI bet she's not the first person to ever use that clue. That's just too nice a clue never to have been used before. Hold on one second, I'll see. There is a database of every clue back to my start. [A pause.] I see previous clever clues for SNOW that include ""winter fall,"" ""white blanket,"" ""winter blanket,"" ""white coat,"" ""falling flakes""that's not all that clever. This one's sort of cute""serial killer."" Snow on your TV, it's going to hurt your reception of a serial. Oh, one more. ""Drifter,"" with a question mark. Well, I don't see ""wet blanket."" Maybe it is fresh.

Will Shortz, as told to Alex Hoyt

A designer eager to be talked about can typically do one of three things. The first is to anticipate the cultural climate and hit upon something consumers want before they know they want it. The second is to manufacture a controversy. And the third is to mine the spirit and feed off it, often by aligning him or herself with a current celebrity phenomenon.









This is what Tommy Hilfiger is doing this week with the announcement of a new collaboration with the 20-year-old It girl, Gigi Hadid.

At first, Ms. Hadid was scheduled to become his brands new global ambassador, but Mr. Hilfiger has come to view that title as a boring descriptor, despite what the news release says.

Global ambassadorships are a bit overused and not too exciting, he said in a telephone interview. Were really doing something different. Were creating a line called Gigi by Tommy Hilfiger, using her style, her sense, her social media presence as the top supermodel in the world today.

Of course, some may see that pronouncement as something other than a self-evident truth, but the announcement represents yet another feather in the cap of a woman on the verge of serious fame.

Since January, Ms. Hadid has been on the covers of both V and W magazines. She has walked runways for Balmain, Marc Jacobs and Versace. Her Instagram account has more than 10 million followers. Although her sister Bella is known for late-night vehicular mishaps, Ms. Hadid has the poise of a budding leading lady, even if this one is still somewhat more likely to be photographed at a banquette with a former boy-band member than at the Kodak Theater during the Oscars.

Famous for being famous, Ms. Hadid is nevertheless well behaved enough not to be deemed offensive to the culture at large (or to big companies like Tommy Hilfiger and Maybelline, for whom she also shoots campaigns). Discussing her reasons for wanting to work with Tommy Hilfiger, she said, Im a big fan of the brand and the images that come out of it.

She recently did a Victorias Secret show and just loved it. The staff worked so hard, she said. Everyone was clapping throughout. It was inspiring.

The word she uses with greatest frequency to discuss her fans (and anyone else to whom she wants to express gratitude) is amazing.

Ms. Hadid grew up in Southern California, where her father is the real estate investor Mohamed Hadid. Her mother is Yolanda Foster, a former model and cast member of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, who after their divorce in early aughts, married David Foster (the music producer behind Whitney Houstons I Will Always Love You) and joined The Real Housewives cast. Mr. Foster had been married to Linda Thompson, whose former husband is now Caitlyn Jenner.

Ms. Hadid is close with the Jenners, Kendall and Kylie, their pictures blasted across social media and in the tabloids (although less for drama than for what they have worn here, there and everywhere). So it shouldnt come as a shock she wound up as the face of a big American brand, particularly after she walked the runway for Mr. Hilfiger in February 2015, flaunting her serious curves.

Mr. Hilfiger was impressed that Ms. Hadid was harnessing the power of social media to build her name and that she did not look like the emaciated models of yore.

Gigi Hadid: Runway Warrior Woman

Shes not anorexic, he said. Shes a real woman.

Afterward, he broached the idea of a larger collaboration, and she jumped at the chance. I ended up staying an extra five hours the first day, she said, discussing her time in the design studio. I think they were surprised I was that into it.

Her first capsule collection debuts next fall, and in tandem with it, Ms. Hadid will become the star of Mr. Hilfigers mainline fall campaign as well as those for his footwear, watches and new as-yet-untitled fragrance.

Recently, Ms. Hadids younger siblings, Bella and Anwar, entered the modeling business, too. This is one subject she is somewhat more forthcoming about. To put it bluntly, shes not convinced that they take modeling as seriously as she does.

My brother kind of does it to get new clothes, she said.

Its not the hardest job in the world, Ms. Hadid added of modeling, but I do work hard.

How could she not? There are rabid fans to satisfy, and she feels a responsibility to them.

Theyre there every day, she said. And the real hard-core fans put in a lot of work to maintain that connection. So it means a lot to me.

They are, in a word, amazing.",[]

Your options are legion. Tai chi, for instance, with its flowing movements and poses, rapidly builds balance. A study published last year found that older people who completed several weeks of tai chi classes performed much better afterward on a variety of balance tests than they had at the studys start. They also generally performed better than another group of volunteers who had spent those same weeks learning ballroom dancing. But dancing did have benefits; the waltzers and fox-trotters could now close their eyes and stand much more steadily than they could before.

Similarly, yoga generally enhances balance, even among people who enjoy fine bodily equilibrium. In a study published in January, for instance, collegiate male athletes displayed better balance after 10 weeks of yoga classes than a control group of athletes who did not change their routines.

But you also can become less wobbly without attending classes or even leaving your living room. All you need is some space, a table or wall nearby to steady yourself if needed, and a pillow, said Jay Hertel, a professor of sports medicine at the University of Virginia and expert on balance training.

Simply stand near a wall and raise and bend one of your legs. Press that leg against your other leg, stork style. Try not to sway. If you start to topple, steady yourself against the wall. Hold this stance for as long as possible, then switch legs and repeat.

Seem easy? Do it with your eyes closed, or stand on a thick pillow, Dr. Hertel said, which makes the ground unstable. (A wobble board also works, but pillows are cheaper.) It may help, too, to ritualize the practice. Stand on one leg while you brush your teeth, Dr. Hertel suggested, and close your eyes if its too easy. It may sound ridiculous, but if you do that for two or three minutes a day, youre working your balance really well.",[]

When Malcolm Gladwell was asked to write a blurb for the 2005 book Freakonomics,  he did not explain that it explored the dynamics of the Ku Klux Klan or the impact of naming a child Loser. Instead, the New Yorker writer and best-selling author of The Tipping Point and Blink simply wrote, Prepare to be dazzled.









Freakonomics became a best seller.

And a decade later, Mr. Gladwells name adorns scores of book covers not his own. He has praised tomes by celebrity restaurateurs (Dan Barber of Blue Hill), Academy Award-winning movie producers (Brian Grazer), first-time novelists (Stephanie Clifford of The New York Times), hybrid writer-artists (Lauren Redniss) and more.

Its hard to compete with Malcolm Gladwell, said A.J. Jacobs, the author of four books, including The Year of Living Biblically, who was once such a prolific blurbist, his publisher demanded he stop writing them. He is always going to get the front cover. I get the back cover or, maybe, inside.

Its hardly news that when it comes to selling books, blurbs from even famous people are of dubious value. I discourage writers from doing them, said Mort Janklow, the longtime literary agent whose firm once represented Mr. Gladwell.

Indeed, in the case of Mr. Janklows former client, they can be polarizing. One person on Twitter posted a photo of Mr. Gladwells blurb from Michael Lewiss 2014 best seller, Flash Boys, saying he almost picked up the book after seeing Mr. Gladwells blurb. (He meant this in a good way.) Another wrote: A Malcolm Gladwell blurb on the cover of a book has the opposite of its intended effect on me.

Is it possible that Mr. Gladwell has been spreading the love a bit too thinly?

The author, 52, was good-natured when asked in an interview why his name seems to be on so many book jackets (he could not say how many). Do I really blurb that much? he asked, laughing. He conceded: The more blurbs you give, the lower the value of the blurb. Its the tragedy of the commons.

Thanks to Amazon ranking and self-publishing, the book market is more competitive than ever before. As with blockbuster movie marketing, everyone is looking for a big first week. Celebrity endorsements can seem vital for authors and sellers to help mint hits, a way to make books sell out on a crowded shelf or site.

Its an arms race, Mr. Gladwell said.

Some, though, are laying down their arms. In 2014, Gary Shteyngart, who also contributes to The New Yorker, published a letter in that magazine swearing off blurb writing because, as he put it then: Literature can and will go on without my mass blurbing. Perhaps it may even improve.

Good blurb writing, Mr. Shteyngart said, is akin to performance art. In 2012, his ubiquitous blurbery was collected on a Tumblr account subtitled a catalogue of promiscuous praise, and, the next year, a 15-minute documentary that discussed it was released. The market is so devalued right now, I dont think anyone cares when I do blurb, he said in a recent interview.

Kathryn Court, the president and publisher of Penguin Books, said authors should not be chastised for supporting their peers. Some people like Malcolm Gladwell are very generous, she said. It is a lot to ask these people to read a book of ours. Seth Godin, whose Unleashing the Ideavirus included a foreword by Mr. Gladwell, did acknowledge, I think it means more to the author than reader.

Mr. Shteyngart also suggested that, as in academic circles, few in the clubby literary world want to offend a fellow writer, because they may need a blurb of their own someday. Everyone is friendly, Mr. Shteyngart said. No one really punches people like in Norman Mailers day. We stand around and drink white wine in bluejeans and talk about health insurance. People are afraid to send a bad blurb.

He sees writers clamoring for blurbs to entice reviewers who may not read a book unless it is recommended by a big-name author. (Mr. Gladwells writing has spawned its own adjective, Gladwellian.) When asked if he would buy a book based on a blurb from Mr. Gladwell, Mr. Shteyngart laughed heartily. I would buy it immediately, he said. I am just kidding. I dont read blurbs. I know how the sausage is made.

According to Mr. Gladwell, his sausage is simple: He writes blurbs because people ask him to, and he does not overthink what to say. People will show you a book and you think, Its cool, he said. You want people to read it. I feel like we have to promote ourselves.

For the paperback version of Stumbling on Happiness, a book about imagination and happiness written by his professional acquaintance, the Harvard University psychologist Daniel Gilbert, Mr. Gladwell raved, imploring readers: Trust me. He also wrote a guest review on Amazon.

And he tweets recommendations freely to his 336,000 followers, as he did for the release of Fareed Zakarias new book, In Defense of a Liberal Education in April. Fareed Zakarias new book is brilliant! he wrote, adding a handy link to Amazon.

Many of the people for whom Mr. Gladwell has written blurbs he knows socially or has even dated, like Ms. Redniss. In the 1980s he was a roommate of Jacob Weisberg, editor in chief of the Slate Group, who introduced him to Mr. Zakaria and the author Michael Lewis, of whom Mr. Gladwell once blurbed: Its good to be reminded every now and again what genius looks like. He featured Mr. Grazer in his books and has eaten at Mr. Barbers restaurant, Blue Hill.

The thing about Malcolm is, he is a personality of the time, Mr. Janklow said. He has become a cultural figure, and I think Malcolm enjoys the role. Hes made the decision if he tries to help anyone, he should help everybody.

But Mr. Gladwell came under fire in 2012 for writing a blurb for his friend Jonah Lehrer, another New Yorker writer, who was accused of fabricating quotes attributed to the singer Bob Dylan in his book, Imagine, which explores brain science and creativity. The Chronicle of Higher Education took Mr. Gladwell to task for writing that Mr. Lehrer knows more about science than a lot of scientists.

Thats a ridiculous thing to say, even by blurb standards, and I cant imagine Lehrer concurs, Tom Bartlett wrote. Its the kind of hubris that could get a science writer into real trouble. In the wake of the scandal, Mr. Lehrer resigned from The New Yorker after admitting he had recycled his work from other publications, and Imagine was recalled.

But Mr. Gladwell stands by his praise. Specific mistakes dont invalidate the work of the author or the book, he said, describing the outrage over Imagine as an incidence of moral hysteria.

He is nothing if not loyal. Last July, the authors of Freakonomics released the paperback edition of their latest book, Think Like A Freak. Malcolm Gladwell was on the cover again, this time saying, Utterly captivating.",[]

Mats Zuccarello had a goal and two assists on Tuesday night, and the visiting Rangers defeated the Buffalo Sabres, 4-2, after nearly blowing a three-goal lead.

J. T. Miller sealed the win with a backhander into an empty net with a minute left after he lost a glove on the rush up the right wing. Derrick Brassard and Jesper Fast also scored for the Rangers, who extended their winning streak over the Sabres to nine.

We didnt play our best game, Zuccarello said.

I think were just happy to do what we had to do to win, and Raanta played good, he added, referring to the backup goaltender Antti Raanta, who stopped the final 24 shots he faced in replacing the injured Henrik Lundqvist.

The Rangers built a 3-0 lead on their first 12 shots before losing much of their momentum against a Sabres team that was playing on consecutive nights. BRUINS 1, LIGHTNING 0 Brad Marchand scored 10 seconds into overtime, Jonas Gustavsson made 42 saves, and visiting Boston edged Tampa Bay in a matchup of Atlantic Division leaders.

Patrice Bergeron sent a pass from the right wing through the slot that Marchand redirected past Ben Bishop.

CANADIENS 4, STARS 3 Alex Galchenyuk got his second goal of the game 1 minute 59 seconds into overtime, and host Montreal survived Dallas to end a four-game skid.

Max Pacioretty and Phillip Danault also scored for the Canadiens. Ben Scrivens made 30 saves.

BLUE JACKETS 5, RED WINGS 3 Cam Atkinson scored twice in the third period, Boone Jenner had a goal and an assist, and host Columbus topped Detroit.

David Clarkson and David Savard also scored for the Blue Jackets, while Joonas Korpisalo made 32 saves.

Tomas Tatar and Andreas Athanasiou scored 46 seconds apart late in the third period to pull the Red Wings to 4-3.

PREDATORS 4, JETS 2 Craig Smith scored twice, and Nashville hung on to win at Winnipeg.

Colton Sissons and Ryan Johansen also scored for the Predators. Pekka Rinne turned away 21 shots.

Drew Stafford and Jacob Trouba had goals for the Jets.

HURRICANES 4, SENATORS 3 The rookie Jaccob Slavin scored in the fourth round of a shootout, and Carolina edged Ottawa in Raleigh, N.C.

Jeff Skinner scored twice for the Hurricanes, including one with 0.2 of a second remaining to force overtime, and Jay McClement had a short-handed goal.

Cam Ward made 21 saves for Carolina.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,One Young Artists 21st-Century Baroque,['Kat Herriman'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The work in the Los Angeles-based artist Jesse Mockrins upcoming solo show at Night Gallery, The Progress of Love, looks pointedly familiar  and yet entirely new. Her saturated oil paintings involve a healthy dose of pastiche, borrowing from late-Baroque masters, including Jean-Honore Fragonard and Francois Boucher.

In some works, the references are literal  one of Mockrins works borrows directly from Fragonards The Swing. Others, like a partial portrait called The Forest, seize on aspects of paintings from that period (in this case, the title of a Boucher landscape) without attempting to mimic it. Im always seeing these images out of their original context  Im usually looking at these 17th-century paintings while Im on the Internet, the painter says. Its what allows me to collage together things from the past and the present. It enables them to inhabit the same space.

The new exhibition shares traits with Mockrins last body of work, which focused on gestural hands and shadowy portraits. I was working in this black space for the past couple of years, where the characters were cropped and placed on top of a black background, but now there is a lot more color and texture, she says. I thought of those paintings as negative space; now its more about positive space. Replacing her signature void with a cornucopia of leaves, fabrics and flowers, Mockrin traded one chore for another. You have no idea how labor-intensive those black paintings were. It was maddening to make layer after layer, Mockrin laughs. Turns out painting fabric is also incredibly difficult, but its a different kind of labor. A close look at Mockrins work reveals the tiny strokes that go into rendering each detail  a practice she shares with Boucher and Fragonard.

To make the images her own, the artist swapped the saccharine palette of the old masters for a moodier one, creating a tension between sweetness and bitterness that plays out across her panels. Evoking the precision of painter Ellen Altfest and the femmages of the 70s art icon Miriam Schapiro, Mockrins paintings push symbols of domestic life into the realm of the surreal. I think one of the things that drew me to Rococo is the fluidity of gender, Mockrin says. While most of her subjects have feminine features, in the past theyve been largely male. Sometimes people have a hard time telling, she says. Its that slippage. With her whimsical characters and lush backgrounds, the artist sweeps the viewer into a fantastically ambiguous realm, where time and sexuality fold in on themselves to form something curiously new.",[]

Kent Clizbe, a 55-year-old former C.I.A. officer and intelligence contractor, has cultivated a diverse set of interests in his later years. He loves bird watching and participates in his local Christmas Bird Count, an informal census organized by the Audubon Society. He has a patent on a device, the TimeOff, that prevents unattended-stove fires. But Clizbes true motivating force  a holdover, perhaps, from his decade with the agency  is an unrelenting compulsion to get to the bottom of things. He vets every person he meets, interrogating every fact presented to him. This perpetual need to turn everything inside out is the defining trait of Clizbes personality, and he remains faithful to it, even when it incurs him great personal expense.

Clizbe grew up poor in Halifax County, North Carolina, raised by a single mother. In 1980, after failing out of East Carolina University, he joined the Air Force. Aptitude tests revealed a gift for languages, so Clizbe enrolled in intensive Vietnamese courses and then was shipped to the Philippines, where he spent three years monitoring Vietnamese radio communications. When his tour ended, he went back to school at Southern Illinois University. On campus, he fell in love with a Malaysian girl, who told him that if he wanted to marry her, he would have to convert to Islam. He converted, married her and followed her back to Southeast Asia, where he found work at a refugee camp in the Philippines. Clizbe made frequent trips to her hometown outside Kuala Lumpur, where he immersed himself in the local customs.









He and his wife lived in Asia for a year before finding jobs at the business college at King Saud University in Qassim Province in Saudi Arabia. He taught English as a second language and made the pilgrimage to Mecca. It was 1988, and the war in Afghanistan was dragging on. At the mosque on Fridays, Clizbe would hear calls for young men to travel east and wage jihad against the communists.

After returning to the United States in 1990, Clizbe earned a masters degree in linguistics and studied business and instructional design. While he searched for a job, he sometimes paid the bills by working the phones at a venereal-disease hotline. He was eventually hired by the C.I.A. as an operations officer.

He was sent to an island overseas, where he worked a day job unrelated to his real responsibilities. At night he recruited spies. His experiences in the Philippines, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia all came in handy. You have to understand your target and immerse yourself in his or her culture and the context from which they come, he said. Do they have access to something of interest to you? Are they suitable to do what you want them to do? What are their motivations? What problems do they have that I can solve? Solve their problems, and theyll become your best friend forever. (This fixation on immersion was a big reason Clizbe practiced Islam in the Muslim world; he stopped going to mosques, for the most part, after leaving.) He told me that during his first overseas tour, he probably recruited as many spies as anybody else in his region. I was really, really good at what I did, he said. Never pitched somebody who said no. This process of elicitation is really like the slow hitching up of a womans skirt.

Clizbe quit the C.I.A. in 1999 but returned shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, working as a contractor. In 2008, he started a blog about intelligence and public affairs that mercilessly criticized the Obama administration, including his eventual boss, John Brennan. The political tension cost him his next contract, he said, so he focused on his writing. He had self-published books with titles like Willing Accomplices: How K.G.B. Covert Influence Agents Created Political Correctness and Destroyed America and Obliterating Exceptionalism: A Chronicle of Obamas Politically Correct Progressive Destruction of America. He wrote articles for conservative sites like Newsmax and Breitbart, joining a universe that has expanded over the last decade and a half with people like him: generals, intelligence workers and special-forces veterans who found that, like everyone else, they could now contribute directly to mass media.

In the fall of 2010, Clizbe was summoned from his Northern Virginia home to a restaurant at Baltimore-Washington International Airport for lunch with a Department of Defense contractor named Kerry Patton. The two had grown friendly on an email list affiliated with the International Association for Intelligence Education. The lunch was Pattons idea; he wanted Clizbe to meet a mentor of his, Wayne Simmons. Simmons had served in the C.I.A. for 27 years and appeared regularly as an analyst on Fox News. He was all Kerry could talk about, Clizbe recalls.

Though Simmons had become well known to people in that right-wing media circle, Clizbe didnt know his name. He never encountered Simmons during his days with the C.I.A.  its a massive, compartmentalized organization, after all  and he didnt have cable TV. Still, Simmons and Clizbe should have had plenty to discuss. Their political leanings were similar enough. Simmons claimed to be far right of Attila the Hun. But something about Simmons didnt sit right with Clizbe.

Over lunch, it seemed to Clizbe that Simmons was oblivious to the routine butt-sniffing that C.I.A. veterans routinely engage in: questions about time spent at the Farm and about stints in war zones. Simmons said he had operated separately from Langley; he hinted at brazen operations against drug cartels, opining on the painful isolation of an operatives existence.  You and me, we know what its like,  Clizbe recalls him saying.  Its how we have to live our lives. 

Clizbe added: He was so full of bluster that anybody who hadnt been in the C.I.A. would have had their socks knocked off. But the things he said were so not C.I.A.

Five years later, in October of last year, Simmons  who, as a frequent guest on Fox News discussing intelligence matters, had become a prominent commentator on national security  was arrested for fraud, on charges that (among other things) he used a fictitious background in the C.I.A. to gain real government contract work. Today, the garrulous 62-year-old is under house arrest pending trial. He claims that he was done in by a vindictive Obama administration, which is taking advantage of the fact that his agency past, while real, is almost unfathomably classified. Nobody could see us, he said. Nobody knew who we were. The program I was in was so black it made the black hole seem white.

Fox News may have been surprised by the allegations, as were many close to Simmons, but doubts about his background had percolated for years within Clizbes social network of ex-spooks, and they began in earnest at that fateful lunch in 2010. As Clizbe drove home, his thoughts drifted to a passage from George MacDonald Frasers 1969 novel Flashman, about a wealthy misfit who, because of a series of misunderstandings, earns a reputation as a war hero. It opens on the fraudulent narrator considering a portrait of himself: I can look at the picture above my desk, of the young officer . . . tall, masterful and roughly handsome . . . and say that it is the portrait of a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward  and, oh yes, a toady.

As Wayne Simmons tells it, his career as a talking head began with a chance encounter on a train. In 2001, on a Washington-bound Acela, he got to talking with Mike Collins, a public-relations executive who was a former press secretary for the Republican National Committee. Simmons told him about his experiences in the C.I.A., and Collins asked Simmons if he was interested in going on TV. Simmons said, Why not? He paid Collins a couple hundred dollars for three days of media training. A few weeks later, a producer from Fox called and asked if he would do a quick spot on Geraldo Riveras show. Simmons was nervous, he said, but performed well. (Collins, who has been named as a potential witness for the prosecution, declined to comment. Fox could not confirm how Simmons came to the network.)

Soon after that, Fox bookers started calling, inviting him to appear on more shows: Rita Cosby, Neil Cavuto, Bill OReilly, Hannity and Colmes. Not only was Simmons a good talker, he was also courteous, dependable and willing to make the trek from his home in Annapolis, Md., to the bureau in Washington whenever he was needed. And he was a guest, not a contributor, so he worked free.

By the time of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, Simmons was a regular on the network, talking primarily about terrorism. His tidy gray mustache and smoky-lensed glasses lent him an air of mystery. Everything else about his appearance  the fullbacks neck, razor-sharp jawline and power suits  amplified his message of American supremacy through force. His opinions were cartoonishly belligerent. He defended the enhanced-interrogation techniques employed by the Bush-era C.I.A. In 2005, after Al Jazeera broadcast footage of Ayman al-Zawahri calling for jihad on the West, Simmons suggested one way to contain the terrorists message was to locate Al Jazeera and blow them off the map. He urged lawmakers to consider a moratorium on the construction of mosques in the United States. After The Times exposed the Bush administrations covert terrorist-finance-tracking program in 2006, he suggested the papers sources ought to be imprisoned and maybe even face a firing squad.

In 2005, Simmons was invited to join a Defense Department effort called the Retired Military Analysts program. Started in 2002 during the Bush administrations push for a U.S. invasion of Iraq, the program recruited retired military officers who had high-profile jobs as cable-news experts to be Defense Department message force multipliers. They were given regular briefings from Donald Rumsfeld, then the secretary of defense, as well as access to other high-ranking department officials. There were trips to Iraq and Guantanamo Bay. It was all done in an effort to win favorable but independent-seeming news coverage for the administrations foreign policy.

Cable-news bookers typically do not run extensive background checks. Standards vary from show to show, but according to producers and bookers I spoke with, a cursory look at an experts website is usually sufficient. (In a statement, Fox News said its vetting procedure is as thorough as possible.) But its somewhat more surprising that the Retired Military Analysts program did not include a thorough check, either. While many participants in the program did have top-secret clearances, program events were no clearance necessary: Any time Simmons wanted to visit the Pentagon or hop on a jet to Iraq, he simply submitted his date of birth, Social Security number and a photo ID for a check that verified only that he was an American citizen and wasnt on any watch lists.

Simmons was prolific. He was making up to six appearances a month, rarely straying from the administrations talking points. Even after the Defense Department wound down the program in 2008, Simmons continued to appear on Fox, often pushing a message of wounded honor about the new presidents national-security agenda. Shortly after the underwear bomber attack in Detroit, Simmons called Obama a boy king who emboldened terrorists and third-world despots. In 2009, after Nancy Pelosi claimed the C.I.A. misled her about waterboarding, Simmons called her a pathological liar who had made the agency soft, weakening national security. He recognized, too, the dangers hidden in Americas own bureaucracy. A Lebanese woman was discovered to have faked a marriage certificate to gain U.S. citizenship, got a job with the F.B.I. and accessed sensitive materials relating to her family and Hezbollah. This has exposed the raw nerve, if you will, of a flaw in the background check, Simmons told viewers. Without a background check, without knowing who were hiring and who we are employing to protect our nation, we are in big, big trouble.

Upon returning home from lunch that day in 2010, Clizbe sat at his computer and started looking into Simmonss background. The biography that Clizbe pieced together was breathtaking. Recruited by the C.I.A. after joining the U.S. Navy in 1973, Simmons became part of an outside paramilitary special operations group and spearheaded deep cover intel ops against the worlds most dangerous terrorists, drug traffickers, arms smugglers, counterfeiters, cyberterrorists and industrial and economic espionage artists. His operations helped lead to the seizures of marijuana, cocaine and heroin with a combined value of more than $1 billion. Since leaving the C.I.A., he had become the president of a small airline and the general manager of a mortgage broker. According to Clizbe, Simmons was the id of every aging conservative male.

Clizbes suspicions grew deeper, so he began compiling the obvious inaccuracies. He had never heard of an outside paramilitary special operations group. The Secret Service fights counterfeiters, not the C.I.A. The F.B.I. would fight industrial espionage. None of it made sense. He was taking the place of somebody who could actually contribute to the public dialogue, Clizbe told me. I know people who could do it. I could do it.

One of Clizbes specialties in the C.I.A. and in his post-agency career as an intelligence consultant was deception detection. He had even codified his method, which he calls the holistic contextual credibility assessment system. Clizbe doesnt believe in polygraph machines and other standard lie-detection techniques. They function, he says, from the flawed assumption that people from all cultures have the same physical and psychological reactions when they lie. After all, famous American traitors like Aldrich Ames passed polygraphs while spying for the enemy. True deception detection requires a far deeper cultural immersion. I am what Wayne was pretending to be, he says. He was stepping into my context. Ive lived it, thought about it, pondered it academically and philosophically. Wayne never saw me coming.

Still, theres no number to call at the C.I.A. about that sort of business  no desk dedicated to fact-checking wild claims nor, for obvious reasons, any public access to the agencys roster. The C.I.A. also has a policy against confirming or denying questions about employment. (The agency declined to comment on the Simmons prosecution, except to say that it is working closely with the Justice Department on the case.) There was also the simple difficulty of proving a negative. Clizbe had been an executive recruiter for clients in Silicon Valley for two years after he quit the C.I.A. in 1999, which taught him to approach such epistemological quandaries the other way around. I never vetted a candidate by starting with the hypothesis that they werent qualified for a job, he says. I tried to prove that they were qualified. If the evidence proves that they arent, then Ive falsified the hypothesis.

He set out to see if he could prove that Simmons was a former C.I.A. employee. Running into old C.I.A. colleagues at the Raleigh Spy Conference or at meetings of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers or the C.I.A. Retirees Association, Clizbe folded his inquiries into conversations with dozens of former spooks. Who is this guy? Seen him around? Ever work with him? Know anybody who has? He was especially interested in those who had worked at the Crime and Narcotics Center (C.N.C.), which was the division of the C.I.A. that he figured Simmons claimed to be a part of. But none of the former agents, even from the C.N.C., remembered working with him or even hearing about him.

By the spring of 2011, Clizbe was convinced that there was no way to confirm Simmonss claims, so he reached out to his former boss, M., an irascible older man who had been a high-ranking Senior Intelligence Service officer. (He insisted on being identified only by his middle initial.) M. spent about 40 years with the C.I.A., both on the staff and as a contract worker, ascending to its highest ranks. He knew of Simmons  he consumed Fox News regularly  and had figured Simmons might have been an obscure contractor at the agency. Clizbe pointed out the irregularities in Simmonss biography, and M. became convinced he was a fraud.

M. alerted Paul Vallely, the retired two-star general who founded Stand Up America, an organization that promotes a conservative foreign-policy agenda through analysis on cable-news networks and talk radio. Vallely met Simmons through Fox News and invited him to serve on the Citizens Commission on Benghazi, a collection of military brass, C.I.A. officers and politicians determined to uncover the truth about the September 2012 embassy attack in Libya. M. remained suspicious when Vallely failed to respond after a month. (Vallely declined to comment for this article, citing Simmonss coming trial.)

M. also contacted Gary Berntsen, a decorated former C.I.A. counterterrorism officer and onetime Republican Senate candidate from New York. Berntsen made occasional appearances on Fox News and wasnt surprised by M.s message. When I started doing television, senior agency guys were calling me on the phone and telling me: That guys on television, he goes on the network you are on, hes a fraud. Please tell them,  Berntsen says. While waiting in the greenroom one day before going on Judge Jeanines show, Berntsen was approached by Col. David Hunt, a retired officer who had done special-operations work.

 Can I ask you something?  Berntsen recalls Hunt saying.  This guy Wayne Simmons, is he a fraud?

Of course hes a fraud, Berntsen said he replied. Hes a blithering idiot.

According to Berntsen, Hunt said that he too had been suspicious of Simmons and intended to inform Bill Shine, a senior programming executive at the network. He suspected Fox would heed Hunts warning. (Hunt did not respond to requests for comment.) But then, one morning, Berntsen was at the networks studios to make an appearance on a radio show, and he bumped into Simmons. He asked Simmons what division of the C.I.A. he had served in. If youre an agency officer, you know exactly what to say, Berntsen told me. But Simmonss response was, he said, bloody [expletive] gibberish.

Clizbe knew from his days as a case officer that the most potent deceptions contain a kernel of truth. He developed a theory about Simmons based on this insight. Maybe, he speculated, Simmons had been caught by some government agency on a drug charge and was recruited into working as a street asset. Simmonss recruiters, whoever they may have been, likely blew air up his butt and mentioned the C.I.A. After that, he became a spy in his own mind.

This assessment could be correct. Publicly available information on Simmonss life after 1973, when he left the Navy, reveals a certain sort of aimlessness that doesnt jibe with a career in the C.I.A. He worked as a headwaiter at Pisces, a nightclub in Georgetown, and as a manager for Making Waves, an adult-entertainment hot-tub complex in College Park, Md. He played semipro football for the Baltimore Eagles and, in 1978, was invited to try out with the New Orleans Saints. He played defensive back for them before being cut early in the season. In July 1980 he got into an argument with three men in a nightclub parking lot and shot at them with his 9 millimeter Walther  the sort of handgun James Bond carries. He pleaded guilty to assault and transporting a firearm and received probation.

In 1983, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the F.B.I. received a tip that Simmons was looking to purchase large quantities of Uzis, grenades and surface-to-air missiles. Undercover agents began meeting with Simmons late at night, in an effort to draw him out. Simultaneously, the Prince Georges County Police Department vice squad learned of a bookmaking operation that Simmons ran out of the small house he shared with his wife and two young children. The police monitored his phone activity and, after gathering enough evidence for an arrest warrant, staged a raid. In addition to gambling paraphernalia, the authorities recovered an old handgun stashed in the garage and a rifle in Simmonss bedroom. They also confiscated a safe. Simmons was charged with possession of firearms by a felon.

When Simmons took the stand, an incredible story emerged. The prosecution revealed that Simmons was involved with a man named Tom Tindall, a pilot who had been caught by the United States Customs Service flying drugs into the country for the Patriarca crime family. Because Tindall decided to testify against the Boston-based organized-crime group, he had a contract on his head. Simmons claimed that the Patriarcas wanted him dead, too, simply because of his affiliation with Tindall. That, he said, was the reason for the rifle in his bedroom. As for the artillery he was looking to buy, Simmons claimed that was Tindalls idea. The two were working undercover with Customs, buying weapons so they could infiltrate anti-American forces in South Florida and Central America. Simmons was found guilty, but his sentence was suspended and he was placed on five-year probation.

In a post-trial motion to modify the conditions of Simmonss release, the prosecutor mentioned the safe seized from Simmonss bedroom. When law-enforcement officers opened the safe, they found a ledger that contained documentary evidence of large-scale narcotics activity. Simmons, however, never faced any drug charges. The safe was barely mentioned during his trial. Simmons claims today that the lenient sentence is proof that he was working for the C.I.A. He also claims he perjured himself to cover up for his C.I.A. work. To Clizbe, though, the outcome of the trial supports his theory: Simmons was an informant. Drug charges were never pursued, perhaps, in exchange for some sort of cooperation. (Simmons denies being an informant and dismissed the notion as amateur speculation.)

Clizbes theory seems plausible, but it was still missing some vital details. The typical informant doesnt try his hand, let alone succeed, at conning his way into Pentagon public-relations programs. Clizbe eventually found what he thought was the missing piece: The 2012 obituary for Simmonss wife, Corinne, a longtime military-hospital administrator, laid out the Simmons family tree, and further digging revealed that it was a remarkable lineage. Simmonss father, Wayne Sr., joined the Navy on the day he turned 17 and was stationed at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked. He served in the Pacific during the war and belonged to the Baltimore Masonic Lodge. His mother had been an F.B.I. fingerprint analyst. Simmonss sister, Patricia Bradshaw, had been the deputy under secretary of defense for civilian personnel policy. Before that, she held a number of high-ranking positions in the Defense Department and the Department of the Navy. She was married to a former admiral. (Bradshaw didnt respond to requests for comment.)

Clizbe finally saw it: the black sheep of a distinguished family, disgraced with an arrest that put him in the hands of special agents. Clizbe imagined Simmons reading spy novels and watching movies, researching the history of the C.I.A., internalizing tradecraft. And then one day, he got a lucky break, finding his way onto Fox and into the Retired Military Analysts program. All of a sudden, he was eating lunch with Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon and making day trips to Guantanamo. He was living the life of the decorated patriot he was born to be.

For two years, Clizbe and M. stewed as they watched Simmons ascend to greater fame. He and a co-author had released a novel, The Natanz Directive, about a retired black-ops agent who infiltrates Iran and single-handedly dismantles its nuclear program. (It has a blurb from Donald Rumsfeld: Wayne Simmons doesnt just write it. Hes lived it.) Simmons, who claims the tale is partly autobiographical, used the ensuing publicity push to advocate for a ground invasion of Iran.

In late 2013, Clizbe and M. developed a plan to extract a confession from Simmons. Their method would be a good-cop/bad-cop interrogation, carried out where Simmons would least suspect it: on Facebook. M. left needling comments on Simmonss page, questioning the validity of his claims. In a series of private messages beginning Dec. 1, M. called him a liar. Simmons shot back, accusing M. of being an Obama apologist. M. responded, I agree with you politically (not an Obamatron), but . . . am convinced that your claim to be a former operative is phony.

Simmons noticed that Clizbe and M. were Facebook friends and suspected a connection, so he wrote to Clizbe in an effort to ward off further attacks: My creds are impeccable. . . . Every Federal Agency in the US gov has been up my ass for 12 years. Clizbe responded with a message that seemed friendly yet was still intended to push Simmons closer to an admission: [M.] is about as wired into the C.I.A. as anyone living. If hes criticizing something . . . it might be worth listening to. Youre welcome to reach out to him. He is not shy. So Simmons turned back to M., again leaning on his work with the Pentagon: BTW . . . I was sent by the SECDEF, Rumsfeld, to GITMO 3 times. My clearances were good on each trip. M. had seen a flight manifest from one of those trips, showing Simmons listed as a former C.I.A. worker. M. knew that didnt prove anything; Simmons most likely provided that description himself.

The next morning, Simmons provided M. with a litany of his operations. He helped bring down the Patriarcas in Boston; he helped uncover an Iranian-American drug-smuggling ring; he orchestrated the recovery of a device stolen from a Scandinavian laboratory. Hed been all over the globe: Central America, South America, Geneva, Bimini, Islamorada, Hong Kong, Macau and Kazakhstan. M. reviewed the message, line by line. He may not have been aware of every operation the C.I.A. ran, but he knew what sort of work they did. And like Clizbe, he noticed the strange jurisdictional confusion in Simmonss resume as well as the suspicious diversity of tasks and locations. Despite its swashbuckling reputation, the C.I.A. is a highly bureaucratic organization, rife with procedures, regulations and paperwork. People like M. rise through the ranks because of their ability to work that bureaucracy to their advantage. The operations Simmons claimed to have carried out, if they were real, would have been well known around the higher levels of the directorate, and M. had never heard of any of them. Moreover, if Simmons had done half the things he claimed, the agency never would have agreed to lift his cover. They most likely would have sued him for writing The Natanz Directive or for appearing on Fox News at all.

On the afternoon of Dec. 2, M. sent a note to a group of former senior C.I.A. officers whose careers would have made them familiar with the operations Simmons claimed to have worked. Nobody knew him or his supposed exploits. M. composed a stern warning to Simmons: If you continue to promote yourself as a former agency operative, we will have to expose you publicly as a poser and a fraud. But he also offered him a way out: either to provide his full name and date of birth so that a friend of M.s with access to the C.I.A.s records could run his name, or to provide the name of a living C.I.A. officer who could vouch for him.

And then, just like that, Simmons folded. He wouldnt admit to having fabricated the operations on his resume, but he was willing to entertain the idea that his bosses had been pretending to be C.I.A.  that he had been duped his entire career by some other outfit. I will cede to your wishes, he wrote. You have my word that I will never personally hold myself out as C.I.A. again.

Almost immediately, Clizbe pitched the story of this vetting operation to The Washington Times. The paper sent Simmons an email. Simmons replied, denying the accusations and claiming that he had run an intel op to expose the link that he suspected between Clizbe and M. (This was apparently a reference to their interactions on Facebook.) It was a bold move, but Simmons was a well-known media figure. Nobody knew who Clizbe and M. were. The Washington Times rejected Clizbes story.

Clizbe had sent a draft to Simmons for comment, and as he tried to find another home for his article, Simmons offered a new and curious response. He categorically denied the accusations, which didnt surprise Clizbe. But then he changed his story completely, claiming that for 27 years, he was a sort of officer known as a NOC (Nonofficial Cover). This is the deepest cover the C.I.A. provides. Rather than working out of an embassy, NOCs often maintain a plausible career  as energy consultants, for example  and if they are caught, the C.I.A. may deny their affiliation.

M. thought this explanation was absurd. If Simmons had been a NOC for almost three decades, one of M.s colleagues would have remembered his name. He began to alert Simmonss media colleagues about his and Clizbes suspicion. One of them, a high-ranking military officer who worked as a paid contributor to Fox News, wrote: Ive had reservations for years. In my experience, some of the programs he claims to have been a part of simply never existed. While he may have somehow been on the periphery of something, Ive seen and heard nothing to convince me he was a NOC. M. also notified Shine, the Fox senior programming executive; the Fox legal chief Dianne Brandi; and Neil Cavuto. Nobody wrote back to him. (These emails were obtained by The Times. Fox says Shine, Brandi and Cavuto have no record of receiving the emails.)

After trying and failing to pitch his story elsewhere, Clizbe eventually gave up. He contacted a former senior official at the agency, who took Clizbes report to an assistant deputy director, close to the top of the chain. He had no idea if he would ever hear back.

At 6:30 a.m. on Oct. 15, 2015, the F.B.I. knocked on Simmonss door in Annapolis with an arrest warrant. He was told that for almost two years  since roughly the same time that Clizbes report was handed to the C.I.A.  he had been under investigation for fraud. In the court hearings that followed, the assistant United States attorney Paul Nathanson punctured Simmonss public image with point-by-point allegations: He was never in the C.I.A. He hadnt made a mortgage payment since 2010. His car had been repossessed. Simmons had been telling people that The Natanz Directive would be made into a movie in 2016, but in actuality, Nathanson explained, someone paid $1,250 for the option to make a movie from the book three years earlier, then renewed the option for the same price. Simmonss only other source of income was periodic financial support from his sister, Patricia Bradshaw.

In papers submitted by the prosecution, Simmons is said to have repeatedly tried to use his reputation as a C.I.A. veteran to find lucrative contracting work. In 2008, he managed to pass an interim security clearance and gain entry into the U.S. Armys Human Terrain System program, which brought anthropologists into Afghanistan and Iraq to learn about local culture. Interim clearances are minimally invasive and granted on a temporary basis, pending the completion of a more intense background investigation. According to Simmons, he self-reported his criminal infractions, explaining them away as the collateral damage of a long, complicated career with the C.I.A. He went to training at Fort Leavenworth but was asked to resign before completing the program. Simmons says he resigned over a pay cut. The Army, however, cited unspecified performance problems.

A manager of the Human Terrain System program told me that Simmons had found his way into the program through BAE Systems, a subcontractor that was struggling to meet personnel quotas. Wayne was like a lot of folks taking advantage of the poor screening by the BAE recruiters to draw good pay during training and then cop out, the manager told me. We had a lot of this. He described Simmons as a mile wide and an inch deep.

In 2009, the prosecution argues, Simmons made false statements on security-clearance forms in an effort to secure employment with the defense contractor Triple Canopy. This application led to a full background check by the State Department, which concluded that Simmons never worked for the C.I.A. in any capacity whatsoever. His top-secret clearance was denied. In 2010, he supposedly used another interim clearance to be hired as a senior intelligence adviser on NATOs anti-insurgency team in Kabul. After a time, his clearance was revoked, and he was sent back to the United States.

Simmons generally failed in his attempts to fleece the government, but he succeeded elsewhere. According to the prosecution, Simmons defrauded his former girlfriend, referred to in documents as E. L. (Simmons denies any romantic involvement.) She gave him $125,000 to invest in a real estate venture, and Simmons pocketed the money. (Simmons denies this, too.) Simmonss trial is set to begin in May and, if he is found guilty, he could face decades in federal prison.

The F.B.I. claims that the timing of Clizbes investigation and their own is coincidental, but Clizbe is skeptical. During the course of his inquiry, he talked to dozens of people, and any one of them could have sounded the alarm. Additionally, Clizbe said, he submitted his article to the C.I.A.s Publications Review Board, which would have sent it to offices all around the agency and, potentially, to other federal agencies as well.

After trying to publish his story about Simmons, Clizbe says, he was blacklisted by the conservative media. (When I asked Simmons about this claim, he grinned, shrugged and said, I have powerful friends.) I asked Clizbe if exposing Simmons was worth the trouble it had brought him. He insisted that it was. We cannot allow scum bags to take away honor and truth and change the meanings of those things, he said. Its the fundamental basis of our society and culture.

In the governments extensive rap sheet on Simmons, the picture that emerges is not of a cynical fraudster but of a man living in a fiction of his own creation. The U.S. attorneys office shared with me a particularly troubling police report from January 2007. Two police officers in Annapolis, Md., were called to Church Circle, right in the center of town, to break up a street fight. They arrived to find Syed Mohammed Azizur-Rehman, a 53-year-old taxi driver, lying face down on the street; nearby, they found Simmons screaming, He has a bomb! Simmons claimed that during a ride in Azizur-Rehmans cab, the driver started ranting about his hatred of America and announced that he had a bomb in the trunk. After grabbing his cellphone, which Simmons believed to be the detonator, he forced Azizur-Rehman to stop the car and subdued him. He was a former C.I.A. officer, he told the Annapolis Police, and he advised them to call the White House or Fox News to vouch for him.

A crowd assembled. Bomb dogs were called in. The driver, meanwhile, explained his side of the story. He picked up Simmons at a downtown steakhouse. Simmons hopped in, handed him a $20 bill and told him to just drive; he wouldnt say where he wanted to go. Once they reached Church Circle, with seemingly no explanation, Simmons grabbed the drivers cellphone and ordered him to stop the car. Simmons pulled Azizur-Rehman out of the car and started kicking him.

Needless to say, a bomb-sniffing dog failed to find any explosive devices in the car. At the local precinct, the police called the C.I.A. and spoke to a supervisor, who advised them to take appropriate action  whatever that meant. They called Corinne Simmons, and she told them Wayne was depressed and was supposed to be at a support group for retired government employees the previous day, but it had been canceled. Simmons was taken to the hospital for observation. No charges were ever filed. (Simmons now blames drinking and PTSD for the episode.)

After some coaxing, Simmons agreed to let me visit him during his house arrest awaiting trial. After the October indictment, the Citizens Committee on Benghazi removed Simmons from its roster. Fox News stopped calling the previous spring. Neil Cavuto issued an on-air apology after the arrest. If its true that all our due diligence and vetting on Mr. Simmons missed this, thats big, and thats on me, he said. And only me.

Simmons answered the door in gray wool slacks, a pressed navy blue shirt and blue boat shoes. At 62, he remains physically imposing and still moves with an athletes grace, something he has retained, he said, through regular krav maga, the Israeli self-defense system. The rooms in his ornately decorated home are painted pink, burgundy and teal. He hadnt changed a thing since Corinne died in 2012, he said. He had a Rottweiler named Brutus and two irresistible Maltipoos. His shelves were covered in patriotic bric-a-brac: presidential biographies, flags and awards earned by his son, a civil servant. (His daughter, who is active in local politics, does his shopping.) On a ledge sat a signed note from Rumsfeld, thanking Simmons for some cigars, and next to it, an autographed photo of Ronald Reagan and a glossy of a gleeful handshake Simmons shared with President George W. Bush in 2006.

We sat down at the kitchen table, and he produced a black binder, stuffed with documents. He began to unspool his current version of events: He dropped out of Jacksonville State to join the Navy. His service lasted less than two months before he was given a medical discharge for post-concussion syndrome. The diagnosis was phony, however: a ruse to separate from the Navy and join the C.I.A. But he wasnt recruited to be an officer, he said. He didnt go to the Farm, the C.I.A.s famous training facility near Williamsburg, Va. Instead, he shipped off to Alaska and got a job with Mukluk Freight Lines  perfect cover. He would work four weeks and then take off to Fort Wainwright to learn tradecraft. He flipped to a printout of the Wikipedia entry on MK Ultra, the notorious C.I.A. mind-control program, and told me he was subjected to similar sorts of experiments there.

The reason Clizbe and M. found his resume bizarre, he said, is that he was part of an off-the-books outfit authorized to do whatever was needed, wherever it was needed. Simmons was a saboteur, specialized in infiltrating criminal organizations or terror groups and dismantling them from the inside by inciting violence between rivals. He insinuated that he killed foreign nationals on American soil. His weapons convictions and several D.U.I.s were proof of how far outside the law he operated: Before his arrest in October, hed never spent a day in jail, he says.

He showed me snapshots of buildings that he said were safe houses. Each one was accompanied by a map, their locations marked with a black X. I told him those didnt prove anything about the C.I.A.; they were just photographs of vacation cottages. He shut his binder and held it up in the air for me to ponder. Alex, you dont just wake up one morning and make this from nothing, he said. If it appears I lived this life, its because I did.

He flipped to a binder tab marked Businesses. He showed me articles of incorporation for consulting firms bearing opaque names like WSS International and Phoenix Management. There was Regal Limousine, which had just one car in its fleet. These were agency fronts, he claimed. The C.I.A. spent millions to make sure no one can see me, he said.

He dropped name after name, putting himself in the middle of real events that I later found news clippings about: the massive heroin bust in Washington that took down that Iranian smuggling ring, for instance. But I was never able to independently confirm his involvement in any of the events he mentioned. He vowed to send me corroborating documents but never delivered them. He promised to introduce me to former colleagues and lawyers who would verify his stories, but those offers always fell to the side.

I questioned Simmons on his credentials, and he fell back, as he did with others, on his trips to Gitmo. We rode down on Air Force Two, he said. He produced a photograph taken on the runway. I dont care who you are, you dont get on Air Force Two unless your credentials are legit. (Allison Barber, who ran the Retired Military Analysts program, says the group never flew to Cuba on the vice presidents plane during her tenure, which overlapped with Simmonss.) He pulled out a photo of him standing nose to nose with President Bush. Who did the background checks on me then? Every time we went to White House or the Pentagon, they ran a background check. I knew that his service in the Retired Military Analysts program didnt require anything more than a cursory check to make sure he wasnt on any watch lists and that a visit to the White House required only his name on the guest list and a name check.

Simmons was quick to point out that the F.B.I. banged on his door just a few days before Hillary Clintons congressional testimony about Benghazi. He told me his legal problems were an Obama administration ploy, a craven attempt to punish him for his opinions and to discredit the Citizens Commission on Benghazi. He removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes. I wish I was this smart, he said, chuckling. Nobody can do what the government says I did, fooling the F.B.I., C.I.A., D.O.D. and I.R.S. If Im that good, they should erect a plaque for me. Are you kidding me? Ive fooled the most powerful divisions of most powerful nation of the world?

Simmons said there were documents that hed scattered around the world, files that detailed the unimaginable things he did. They would ultimately set him free, he said. The C.I.A. knows what else I did for them, he said. Its the royal straight flush of spades. His vindication was coming soon, he promised. Any day.",[]

Ah, the adolescent male appetite. Those always hungry growing boys who eat standing up, drain the quart containers of milk or juice, and are fully capable of finishing off as an after-school snack the whole lasagna or pot of stew or cold roast beef that was supposed to serve as dinner for the family. I have come home to this myself: the teenager who greets his parents in the evening with an empty refrigerator, a sink full of dirty dishes, and the hopeful question, Whats for dinner?

In January, when the recently revised Dietary Guidelines for Americans came out, adolescent boys were specifically mentioned in a slightly unexpected context: Some individuals, especially teen boys and adult men, also need to reduce overall intake of protein foods by decreasing intakes of meats, poultry and eggs, and increasing amounts of vegetables or other underconsumed food groups.

Are teenage boys eating too much protein? What do we actually know about the dietary habits of adolescent males, beyond the sitcom jokes?

Dr. Elsie Taveras, the chief of general pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, is an expert on childhood obesity. The forces that are working against good diet quality in adolescent boys, she told me, begin with that famous appetite. Theyre always hungry, and that hunger, and a lack of satiety with small portions, leads to impulsive eating and eating large portions. And the foods they are choosing arent really keeping them full, since foods with high fiber levels are the kinds of foods which do keep people full.

The dietary guidelines include graphs of what people in different age groups eat, drawing on data from the large National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and showing, for each food group and at each age, how those amounts compare with the recommended daily intake. No one will be surprised to hear that when it comes to vegetables, both males and females of all ages eat significantly less than what is recommended.

For protein, the graphs look very different. For males, intake rises steadily from the 9- to 13-year-old category up through 31- to 50-year-olds, so that by the time they reach late adolescence and young adulthood, males report eating significantly more protein than recommended. Females, on the other hand, report eating quantities at the bottom of the daily standards, and 14- to 18-year-old girls say theyre eating less protein than recommended.

Theres so little research focused just on boys, said Alison Field, an obesity and eating disorders expert who is the chairwoman of epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health. We know that at puberty, boys will acquire more muscle mass, and females will end up with more fat mass, she said. When males go through their growth spurt, which is longer than females, their appetite is tremendous.

These hungry fellows have big appetites, and as a group, they dont tend to fill up on salad. So the primary dietary advice for them is probably eat more vegetables, and the hope is that would mean less meat. What this recommendation really says is that teen boys should be eating more of their calories from vegetables but less from meat to better balance their nutrient intake, Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University wrote in an email.

We know as much as we do about the dietary habits of teenage girls because there has been so much concern about obesity and also eating disorders. Many, if not most, adolescent girls are trying to lose weight whether they need to or not. Eating disorders are less common in males, but adolescent boys, on the other hand, are often preoccupied with building muscle, particularly if they are athletes in a sport like football, where size matters. Males may want to bulk up, may want to be big, Dr. Field said.

We really underestimate how important weight and shape are to males, she told me, suggesting that airbrushed images of models and sports figures in the media promise quick results. Young men are just as influenced as young women by these images.

The extra protein in the supplements that many boys buy in hope of bulking up may be useless. The body can only absorb so much protein, said Jerel Calzo, a developmental psychologist who studies eating disorders in adolescent males and is an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. Boys who are eager to build muscle may exceed the recommended amounts, he said. If youre doubling up, youre only getting the extra calories  sugars and fats. Further, he said, the supplements are under-regulated, and the marketing is often deceptive.

In the worst-case scenario, these protein supplements can damage your kidneys, especially if you get dehydrated, so boys who dabble in protein supplements have even more reason to keep drinking fluids. But again, that can lead to problems, since sports drinks, also heavily marketed to young men with athletic ambitions, include additional refined sugars and empty calories. We do a lot to push the fact that children dont need sports drinks, Dr. Taveras said. Water is just fine.

Although some teenage boys are clearly preoccupied with their bodies, others manage to eat their way right through adolescence without ever making very clear connections between any aspects of diet and health.

The unbounded adolescent male appetite, the athletic ambitions and the concomitant desire to add muscle, taken together with the very deliberate drumbeat of marketing, can add up to a poor diet. To me, protein is a nonissue, Professor Nestle said. You cant talk about protein in isolation from everything else people eat.

The most essential message for adolescent boys and young men is a variant of the basic unsurprising message in the overall report: Eat more vegetables, and substitute healthier, less processed foods for the junk. Oh, and while youre at it, guys, be careful of the protein powders. By and large, extra protein is not what you need.

Switzerlands Office of the Attorney General announced on Wednesday that it had enlisted the help of French authorities in its continuing criminal investigation of Sepp Blatter, the former president of FIFA, world soccers ruling body.

This week, the French police searched the headquarters of the French soccer association in Paris at the request of Swiss authorities.

The search was tied to a payment of roughly $2 million that Mr. Blatter made to Michel Platini, the head of European soccers governing body, in 2011 for work done years earlier. That payment, considered suspicious by authorities, is central to Switzerlands current inquiry into Mr. Blatter; the investigation was announced in September and is exploring the possible misappropriation of FIFA funds.

From 1998 to 2002, Mr. Platini was a FIFA employee working from Paris, in offices leased from the French soccer association. On Tuesday, the French police seized documents from those offices, the Swiss authorities said, at which two other full-time FIFA staff members had worked alongside Mr. Platini.

Lawyers for Mr. Blatter, who will turn 80 on Thursday and has long denied all accusations of bribery or corruption, declined to comment Wednesday. Because of Switzerlands decision to publicly name him as a subject of a criminal investigation last fall, Mr. Blatter is afforded real-time access to investigators files on him, meaning he will have insight into the documents seized this week.

The Swiss announcement came a day after American authorities revealed an advancement in their own case against FIFA, which is based in Switzerland. On Tuesday, a new defendant pleaded guilty in federal court in Brooklyn, while another was extradited from Switzerland to the United States.

The Swiss authorities have for the last nine months served a key supporting role in the United States case, arresting defendants, holding them in jail and ruling on requests to extradite them, while also fulfilling requests for bank information and documents. Still, the Swiss authorities have been wary of being outshined by American prosecutors in policing crime within Switzerland.

This week, as Switzerlands own FIFA investigation expanded beyond the countrys borders, the Swiss authorities found themselves requesting the same type of international legal assistance they had for months provided to the United States.

The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland, a statement released on Wednesday said, thanks to the French judicial authorities for their valuable support in this matter.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,Julie Kent to Lead Washington Ballet,"['Michael Cooper', 'Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Reference Timestopics People C Michael_cooper Index Html']","Photo

Julie Kent, a beloved ballerina who danced her final performance with American Ballet Theater last June after spending nearly three decades with the company, will be the next artistic director of the Washington Ballet, the company announced on Monday.

When Ms. Kent, 46, succeeds Septime Webre as artistic director in July, it will be something of a homecoming for her: She grew up in Maryland and began her dance training in the region at the Academy of the Maryland Youth Ballet in Bethesda.

She said in a statement that she looked forward to the opportunity to share my experience to train and nurture dancers so that they can develop to their full potential.

When she takes over in Washington, Ms. Kent, who has danced in more than 100 ballets, and found a wider audience when she appeared in the 1987 film Dancers opposite Mikhail Baryshnikov, will be one of the few women running a major ballet company.

Sylvia de Leon, the chairwoman of the board in Washington, said in a statement that while Julie is an iconic American ballerina, it is her deep understanding of ballet, the individual dancer, the audience and the role of ballet in humanity that makes her an outstanding choice.

Her husband, Victor Barbee, who has been the associate artistic director of American Ballet Theater for 13 years and was a principal dancer there before that, will join the Washington Ballet as associate artistic director.

Last year, after she retired as a dancer, Ms. Kent was named the artistic director of Ballet Theaters summer intensive program. It was not immediately clear who would assume that role.

Kevin McKenzie, the artistic director of Ballet Theater, wished Ms. Kent and Mr. Barbee well. Together, they epitomize ballet artistry at its highest level, he said in a statement.",[]

One by one, they make their confused, anxious, sometimes mysterious departures. Husband and wife, their two daughters and one daughters boyfriend, a grandmother suffering from dementia, rolled off in her wheelchair, until the stage before us is a darkened void.









Its hard to watch the eerie disappearing act that takes place in the final moments of Stephen Karams play The Humans, as a middle-class Pennsylvania family leaves one daughters Manhattan apartment, without having the unsettling feeling that you are watching, in microcosm, whats taking place on a large scale across America. The current presidential election, the most fractious and even frightening in recent memory, has become a referendum of sorts on the shrinking  or is it the disappearance?  of the American middle class.

His terrific play, happily now on Broadway, is one of several Ive seen recently that homes in on the very subjects roiling the political sphere. Financial anxiety and the sense of an uncertain future have unleashed a populist fury on both sides of the political divide. But these plays allow us to look beyond the posturing, punditry and angry speechifying, to really feel the painful, inescapable hardships of daily life as it is lived by increasing numbers of Americans.

One might fancifully imagine that the two members of the younger generation depicted in The Humans  sisters played by Sarah Steele and Cassie Beck  would be feeling the Bern. Ms. Steeles Brigid is working two bartending jobs to pay off piles of student debt. Her older sisters career as a lawyer is in jeopardy because ulcerative colitis has cut into her billing hours, and she suspects shes soon to be cut loose from the firm  meaning, bye-bye, plush health insurance. Bernie Sanderss call for a single-payer system would be awfully hard for such a character to resist.

Their father, played by Reed Birney, in middle age finds himself with no retirement nest egg, an uncertain work future and bills that keep mounting: Dontcha think it should cost less to be alive? he cracks.

He, or a man like him at least, might find himself heeding the siren call of Donald J. Trumps anti-immigrant demagogy, against his better instincts. And Id bet that his more pragmatic, empathetic and deeply devout wife, played by Jayne Houdyshell  who has been working for four decades as an office manager, with few raises  would quietly cast her vote for Hillary Clinton.

This is all, of course, fantasy, but it illustrates the immediacy with which Mr. Karams play addresses the current cultural malaise. And yet The Humans goes beyond closely observed realism, using unsettling imagery to underscore the idea that the forces bearing down upon everyday Americans are not just a matter of a daily struggle to make ends meet. At the mercy of circumstances beyond their control, people on the economic edge may feel as if they are engaged in a terrifying fight for their lives.

In writing her play Sweat, which I saw last summer at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, Lynn Nottage and her director drew on interviews with residents of Reading, Pa., which has been ranked among the poorest cities in the country. (Its a coincidence, or maybe it isnt, that both plays concern people from Pennsylvania.)

But Ms. Nottages play never feels like a statistics-strewn documentary drama. The play fluidly depicts the conflicts and anxieties simmering among working-class people of all backgrounds in a factory town where the factories have been folding, as of course they have across America, leaving hundreds of thousands without jobs  and seething with the anger that Mr. Trump and, on the other side of the fence, Mr. Sanders have tapped into.

The play is set mostly in a bar where factory workers (and, increasingly, former workers) gather nightly. They struggle to make a living while fighting off the seductive escape of alcohol and drug addiction, with some faring better than others; Ms. Nottage obliquely addresses the slow gutting of the once-mighty union movement. And she explores how the collapse of manufacturing, which once provided opportunities for Americans of all races to better their lives, can potentially stoke racial divisions  and even racially motivated violence.

But with her masterly dramaturgy, and her ability to draw characters whose complex humanity brings us into sympathetic intimacy with their plight, Ms. Nottages play, like Mr. Karams, puts a recognizable human face on problems that are often debated in the political sphere merely in the abstract. I hope, and expect, Sweat will make it to New York next season, when the issues it addresses will probably be just as relevant as they are today.

Both The Humans and Sweat are, to different degrees, dramas with generous doses of comedy that stick fairly closely to theatrical naturalism, the standard for most American drama, and perhaps an obvious choice for plays addressing the real-world concerns of average folks.

But other playwrights have managed to paint portraits of middle-class angst in more stylized ways. Taylor Macs Hir, seen last fall at Playwrights Horizons, while not expressly a play about the decline of the middle class, nevertheless tackles the subject in a sidelong manner.

An outlandishly funny comedy about a semi-deranged mother and her two sons (one transgender), it features a near-mute character, the boys father, whose life slid into decline when he lost his plumbing job (to a black woman). It was then that he began to abuse both his wife and his younger son (then daughter); the abuse ended only when he had a stroke and lost most of the power of speech and much of his mobility.

While it is by no means a sociological study, Mr. Macs play nevertheless speaks  in a cackling voice  to the widely reported difficulties the middle-aged face when they fall out of the work force and cannot find a way back in. The humiliation his wife puts her debilitated husband through (dressing him in garish womens clothing and makeup) derives from personal  and real  grievances, but it may also be seen as a symbol of the powerlessness being felt by middle-aged white men, for whom death rates have been increasing after years of decline, to the bafflement of researchers.

Annie Bakers Pulitzer Prize-winning The Flick, first seen in 2014 and revived last year for a healthy commercial run Off Broadway, also reflects on economic stagnation, this time in near-rural America. Ms. Bakers style, here in particular, might almost be called micro-naturalism, in its rigorous attention to the rhythms of real speech and everyday interaction, which are rarely as smooth  or, ahem, as speedy  as they are depicted onstage.

At more than three hours, The Flick followed the daily lives of three young adults working at a run-down Massachusetts movie theater. Ms. Baker is about as far as you can get from being a writer of didactic plays, but in its depiction of workers making minimal wages, with little prospect of greater advancement, the play unquestionably speaks, in its quiet voice, to the sense of alienation from the so-called American dream that many young people feel today, and which has fired up the young true believers who are Mr. Sanderss greatest supporters. (Ms. Baker rose to prominence with a trilogy of plays about at-loose-ends characters of various ages all living in Mr. Sanderss home state, Vermont.)

Its important to remember, of course, that these plays are not hot-off-the-presses dispatches; they have been written and developed over years. The troubles igniting so much furor in middle-class America now go back to at least the Great Recession and in some ways well beyond.

And this latest is not the first batch of plays to depict the hardships of lower- and middle-class lives. Lisa DAmours Detroit, which I first saw in Chicago in 2010, portrays a middle-class couple in an unnamed suburb of an unnamed city (the title was symbolic) who find themselves precipitously close to losing their hold on financial stability when the male half of the couple loses his job as a loan officer.

David Lindsay-Abaires Good People, seen on Broadway a year later, depicts a middle-aged woman from a blue-collar Boston neighborhood whose life is thrown into jeopardy when she is fired from her job at a dollar store and cannot find another. These two fine plays were among the first to reflect the sense of trepidation that has only grown, the sense that the bright promise of an improving future, or even a stable present, has faded for many Americans.

I should note an unhappy irony at work. While its healthy for playwrights to address economic inequality in the country, theater, Im sorry to say, practically qualifies as a luxury item. Tickets for Broadway shows can cost more than $100 apiece, and Off Broadway prices at the major institutions are not substantially cheaper.

People like those whose lives are being portrayed, with insight and compassion, in the plays Ive talked about probably couldnt afford to see them.",[]

Step off the office elevator and youre immediately hit with the smell: a cooking aroma, something warm and inviting (corn chowder? bread?) wafting from a spacious, open kitchen with a wall of Waterworks cabinets.









The lights are set to rainy-Saturday-at-home. Stocked metal bar carts line the back of a plush sofa in a lounge area. One woman conducts a work call inside the book nook, a free-standing four-walled room built within the space, with library shelves and a chocolate brown swivel chair that came not from Staples but Chairish.com, a vintage furniture site.

Indeed, the Chelsea headquarters of Food52, the online cooking community and e-commerce site, look less like an office than a cozy loft apartment. Which is the point.

The work space was designed by Brad Sherman, a Manhattan-based commercial designer who has developed a trademark style that blurs the line between home and office.

Mr. Sherman installs soft lighting, vintage midcentury furniture and fiddle-leaf fig trees. Or, as he did with the downtown office and showroom of Casper, the online mattress seller, he carves out discrete rooms, staging them with artwork and used books from the Strand to create the impression that someone lives there.

Photo

If your workplace is as comfortable and welcoming as your home, the thinking goes, you never have to leave.

A lot of start-ups cant afford the best young talent, Mr. Sherman said. So how do they attract it? With cool spaces.

Mr. Sherman, 30, has created cool homey spaces for several of the citys tech start-ups, including Sakara Life, an organic-meal delivery service; Jack Erwin, a direct-to-consumer mens shoe retailer; and Mobile Commons, a text-messaging platform for nonprofits to connect with donors.

Clients who have hired Mr. Sherman describe him as a budget-stretching magician, able to transform Ikea sawhorses and plywood slabs into chic work stations, or fashion an arty chandelier from exposed mattress springs and string lights.

We needed it to look presentable because we had customers coming in, said Philip Krim, the chief executive of Casper, referring to the apartment work space he hired Mr. Sherman to design. Brad was able to get the job done in a scrappy way that allows us to live on a start-up budget but have an office were very proud of.

Ariel Nelson, a co-founder of Jack Erwin, turned to Mr. Sherman after his friend Mr. Krim hailed the designer. The company had a nothing budget of 20 grand, all in, he said, for a 3,500-square-foot loft in SoHo. Mr. Sherman took control of the build-out, allowing Mr. Nelson to focus on building his company.

I was like, If you have a creative idea and it saves me money, go for it,  Mr. Nelson said. It was mostly all him.

The office-as-home concept has been perfected with Mr. Shermans latest finished project, Food52. Giving a tour of the space one recent afternoon, Mr. Sherman  handsome, floppy-haired, Midwestern friendly  pointed out the chrome and rattan rocker he found at Amsterdam Modern, a vintage store in Los Angeles, and paired with an Ikea coffee table.

Its about the mix, he said. I spent money where I thought it would improve the sophistication.

Merrill Stubbs, a co-founder of Food52, said she wanted a space that evokes hunger but is also soothing, super-functional as an office and also feels like a home. Because the staff members use their office for photo shoots, the test kitchen also had to feel warm and lived-in, in keeping with the brands focus on home cooks.

It was a high bar that Mr. Sherman exceeded. Everyone comments about how things are so pulled together and every inch is thought out, Ms. Stubbs said.

Isnt Ms. Stubbs concerned her employees will feel too much at home?

Were online and available all the time, she said. Giving people a place to relax or feel comfortable at the office is much needed for recharging.

Working with start-ups presents unique challenges, Mr. Sherman said, because often the clients lack both funds and office renovation experience but still have high expectations. And yet Mr. Sherman has delivered under those demands, again and again, becoming, as Ms. Stubbs put it, the go-to office designer for tech start-ups looking to make a statement.

It was a chance conversation with Ms. Stubbs three years ago that began his role as the tech start-up maestro.

At the time, Mr. Sherman was trying to start a design career in New York and working as a glorified receptionist at General Assembly, then a co-working space popular with start-ups, including Food52.

One day, Ms. Stubbs cut her finger and asked Mr. Sherman for an adhesive bandage; the two began talking about how Food52 had just signed the lease on its first office.

He said: Well, you know, I design office spaces in my real life. Id love to talk to you guys about your plans,  Ms. Stubbs said. We had no plans.

They also had no real budget: about $15,000 for 3,500 square feet. Still, that seemed like a fortune to Mr. Sherman, a graduate of Philadelphia University College of Architecture, where he earned a masters in sustainable design.

His previous job was at TerraCycle, a New Jersey-based waste solutions company. He helped design TerraCycles 20,000-square-foot office, for what he called an absolutely insane budget of $1 per square foot.

We used every single thing we could, Mr. Sherman said. The desks I built out of old doors. Some of the bases were built out of old plastic buckets that I just stacked and screwed into the desk.

That resourcefulness has served him well in working for start-ups. He handles not only the design but also oversees the contractors, shops for the furniture and fixtures, custom designs items he cant source (he made bed frames for Casper and recently started a furniture line) and has been known to screw in the electrical outlets on workstations himself.

To cut down on overhead, Mr. Sherman and his design partner, Nina Etnier, along with another employee, work out of his studio apartment in Greenwich Village, or set up shop in the unfinished offices of their clients.

Being the guy who can over-deliver on the cheap isnt the most lucrative path for a designer. But as Mr. Shermans firm is growing and maturing, so are his clients. Hes designing a new, much larger office for Casper, which has already outgrown its downtown space and turned to Mr. Sherman because, as Mr. Krim said, Brad knows our aesthetic and we know well get something really great.

Mr. Sherman persuaded Mr. Krim and his partners to lease a space in a building along Broadway, north of Union Square. The office, currently occupied by a brokerage firm, is run-down and man-cave-ish.

But as Mr. Sherman explained on a recent visit, he sees potential in the expansive northern and southern views, the skylight and the new HVAC system and other cost-saving elements already present.

His eyes lit up, appraising the potential.

First thing I look at is, What can I reuse? Mr. Sherman said, adding what may as well be his sales pitch. We can accomplish a lot more for a lot less.",[]

RUGBY, England  Patrick Derham remembers the moment in October 1973 when, age 14, from a troubled home and planning to join the navy, he saw the course of his life changed, rather miraculously, for the better.









Out of the blue, he was offered a free place at an expensive private school. He took it, went on to Cambridge University and then served as headmaster of two of Britains most famous educational institutions. He was never told how he had been selected for the scholarship, but he has since tried to repay that faith in his potential by bringing more students from disadvantaged backgrounds  including young black teenagers  to some of Britains most elite places of learning.

Few institutions better symbolize social stratification and privilege in Britain than its top independent schools, whose origins date back centuries in some cases. Their former students dominate many spheres of British life, and half the members of the cabinet were privately educated, including Prime Minister David Cameron, who attended the nations most exclusive academy, Eton College.

Critics blame this system for some of Britains social, economic and racial inequalities; argue that such schools impede mobility; and want them to do more for children from disadvantaged backgrounds to justify the tax breaks they receive.

Some schools, prodded by Mr. Derham and others, are doing just that: taking steps to further diversify their student bodies.

More and more of us are concerned by this polarization in society, Mr. Derham said in an office at Westminster School, where he is the headmaster. There is no point producing people who have only met people like themselves.

In 2003, in his previous post as headmaster of Rugby School, Mr. Derham helped set up a program called the Arnold Foundation, which provided free boarding places for teenagers recruited from disadvantaged communities. He forged links with a London club for Afro-Caribbean youngsters, called the Eastside Young Leaders Academy, which was started by a former prison officer, Ray Lewis, who was alarmed at the number of young black men ending up in jail.

Mr. Lewis had been inspired by a TV report about an academy in Baton Rouge, La., set up to improve prospects for young black men and influenced by Americas Prep for Prep, a program aimed at creating opportunities for black, Latino and Asian-American students.

Yet initially Mr. Lewis doubted that exclusive, expensive and traditional schools like Rugby were a place for any self-respecting black guy. It seemed absolutely preposterous, he said. Boarding school? All you ever heard about that was beatings and buggery.

Not only was he eventually convinced, but last year a student from Eastside, Michael Olorunlogbon, 16, became the 100th pupil to attend Rugby thanks to an Arnold Foundation scholarship.

Arriving at a school founded almost 450 years ago, with its quadrangles, cloisters and ivy-clad buildings, was slightly intimidating, Mr. Olorunlogbon conceded. But he now likes life here and thinks he is likely to make higher grades, secure a better university place and forge a brighter future.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The teachers have more time for you  there is a small student-teacher ratio at the school, he said in a large room next to the headmasters office. At home, there are more distractions. I work harder here than I would at home, definitely.

This is not always an easy adjustment, however. David Ejim-McCubbin, 23, said that when he went from a deprived district of London to Rugby School, he struggled to reconcile two astronomically different worlds.

I left one realm, as it were, to peek into one that was  I dont know how many  stratospheres above the one I was born into, said Mr. Ejim-McCubbin, who has since received a degree in law and a masters degree in legal and political theory. He now coordinates Eastsides scholarship program.

The transition was so difficult, he said, that in his first months at Rugby School only the lack of a train ticket home stopped him from quitting. Other students were welcoming, but he recalls being treated like a curiosity, and once being surrounded by a group and asked whether he had ever witnessed a stabbing. (He had not.)

And in a country where accent can still denote social class, his problems included the rather fundamental one of how to speak.

Photo

I wondered: Do I speak the way I normally speak, the slang, the colloquials? Do I do that at Rugby just because its me? Is it me? All these questions came into my mind, Mr. Ejim-McCubbin said. (He decided he could speak differently from the way he would at home, to make himself understood in a new environment, without being untrue to himself.)

The experiment at Rugby has spawned another program, SpringBoard, which places students from disadvantaged backgrounds in other boarding schools, including Eton.

All this has further stirred debate over the social effect of Britains private schools. Seen by supporters as beacons of excellence that drive up standards, they are blamed by critics for allowing well-heeled parents to opt out of state education, removing the incentive for it to improve.

Christine Blower, the general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, most of whose members work in state schools, argued that when exam results are adjusted for social factors, students in state schools succeed as well as their peers in independent schools.

All children and young people should have access to a good local school, irrespective of parental social class and disposable income, she added.

Peter Green, the current headmaster of Rugby School, said the school was now building on its history of charity, and adapting to modern times a long tradition of offering free places. For example, one of its best known historical figures, William Webb Ellis, who is credited with handling, rather than kicking, a ball here in 1823 and thus starting rugby football, was educated on a scholarship.

Nowadays, fees for a boarding pupil are around 33,000 pounds a year, about $46,000. When all free places and scholarships are included, Mr. Green said, 12 percent of students at Rugby pay nothing. He acknowledges that some Arnold Foundation students have had problems but said that, of more than 100, only two had left early.

Though candidates take an academic test to ensure they can cope, the idea is to take not just the very brightest, but also those who will benefit from boarding at the school, often because of their family situation.

We may not be able to help everybody, but at least we can help some people, Mr. Green said, adding that fee-paying students benefit from mixing with those from less privileged backgrounds. Rugby, he said, must not be an extremely wealthy cocoon.

At the Eastside Young Leaders Academy, in Londons Forest Gate district, the founder, Mr. Lewis, explained how he aimed to help black youngsters take control of their lives through activities ranging from meditation to military drills.

A charismatic, if controversial, figure  he resigned as a deputy London mayor in 2008 over allegations of financial irregularities, which he denied  Mr. Lewis conceded that some students were conflicted after attending elite schools, perhaps after visiting the homes of new, rich friends where the driveway makes your local park look like a garden.

We notice everything, from changes of accent to tastes, he said, adding that one girl, now attending a boarding school, does not like going home. Pointedly, her mother had described her child to Mr. Lewis as your white daughter.

Nevertheless, most matriculate successfully, he said, and for students like Mr. Olorunlogbon, the benefit will not necessarily be just academic.

He will improve his confidence, his competence and his capacity, Mr. Lewis said. I think he will start to believe that more is possible, and he will meet other people who are different to him, and therefore have an experience he would never have had if he had stayed around here.",[]

Neil Patrick Harris is collaborating with the producers behind the immersive theater spectacle Queen of the Night on a new, magic-themed nightlife project.

One of those producers, Randy Weiner  whose production credits also include Sleep No More and Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812  said in an interview that the currently untitled project with Mr. Harriss Prediction Productions was in the works, with an opening aimed for the fall. (Mr. Harris will not be performing in the show.)

Mr. Harris has performed magic at a variety of venues, including the Magic Castle in Los Angeles, where he served as president of the board. Mr. Weiner said the collaboration had come about casually. Mr. Harris wanted to work with him on an immersive theater project, he said, and Mr. Weiner reached out when he decided on a magic theme for his next one.

Details are scant but Mr. Weiner did say that the production, which has no opening date, would involve totally transforming 311 West 57th Street  which his company, Variety Worldwide, is to lease when the event space Providence leaves it this year. The site is the former home of the nightclub Le Bar Bat.

Magic is at the core of this venue for the production, Mr. Weiner said, adding that the space would be made to look like a mansion and that there would be dance, variety acts and one-on-one interactions. As with Queen of the Night, there will be a meal, which he said would be an unexpected culinary experience.

Mr. Weiner said he was in the final stages of securing collaborators for set design, choreography and cuisine. Workshops for the production are scheduled to begin this summer.",[]

MIAMI  Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said he had come to regret what became one of the most sensational moments of his campaign: his schoolyard taunting of Donald J. Trump.

Mr. Rubio said the episode  in which he ridiculed the real estate developer as small-handed, orange-faced and wimpy  upset his children and was something he would not do again.

At the end of the day, you know what? Its not something Im entirely proud of, Mr. Rubio said at a town-hall-style event for MSNBC that was taped on Wednesday here at Florida International University.

My kids were embarrassed by it and I, you know, if I had to do it again I wouldnt, Mr. Rubio added.

The question came from a young man in the audience who asked the senator bluntly, How can you sacrifice basic Christian principles with such personal and gratuitous attacks?

Pressed by the host, NBCs Chuck Todd, Mr. Rubio was more reflective than he tends to be in most public appearances, saying that he thought that Mr. Trump had denigrated the tone of the entire presidential race.

I dont want to be that, Mr. Rubio said, referring to someone who mocks and insults. If thats what it takes to become president of the United States, then I dont want to be president.

Mr. Rubio said he was not, however, embarrassed for attacking Mr. Trump on his business record, which the senator has said is riddled with instances of defrauding working-class people.

Not on the other charges, not on the other things, Mr. Rubio said. This time the stakes are not a worthless $36,000 degree at Trump University. The stakes are the greatest nation on earth.",[]
nytimes.com,2012-01-30 00:00:00,Celebrity Guest Solver Alan Zweibel,"['Doug Peterson', 'Deb Amlen']","Todd Heisler/The New York Times

TUESDAYS PUZZLE  One of the nice things about the Celebrity Guest Solver feature, other than giving me the opportunity to work with some truly brilliant minds, is that it gives me a bit of a break. A chance to put my feet up, if you will, and let someone else do the heavy crossword lifting for a change. Its asking a lot, because these are busy people who obligingly take the time out of their busy schedules to solve and write about the puzzle for your entertainment. And because they usually have a book to plug.

Ive found that one of the best times to approach people for a favor of this magnitude is when theyre bone-crushingly exhausted. This was pretty much the case with Alan Zweibel, who had just come off a national book tour with fellow humorist Dave Barry to promote their collaborative novel Lunatics, and since timing is everything, thats precisely when I hit him up. Its very hard to say no to something when youre not even sure what time zone youre in.

Im a fan and admirer of both writers, and I can tell you that not only is the book hilarious, but it will make an awesome movie. Lunatics is the laugh-out-loud story about two men of questionable sanity and widely differing outlooks on life who meet at a childrens soccer game and proceed to trigger a series of incidents that make them, among other things, wanted international terrorists and American presidential candidates.

You might know Mr. Zweibel as one of the original writers of Saturday Night Live, but he is also the 2006 Thurber Prize winner for his novel The Other Shulman and has won countless awards for his work in television, film and theater. The production hes proudest of, he says, is the family hes created with his wife Robin, which includes three children and two grandchildren.

Lets meet Mr. Zweibel and see how he did:

Alan Zweibels Solving Notes

I write. This is what I do. My job is to sit with down with my vocabulary, select words, and decide what order they should be placed in an attempt to keep someones attention and perhaps provide them with a laugh or two along the way. And while not as physically exerting as, say, sitting in a tollbooth and handing motorists their change, in its own way its exhausting work. Thats why, like any other person who taps laptop keys to make ends meet, the most creative thing this writer does on a daily basis is trying to figure out what to do instead of writing. My diversion of choice? Crossword puzzles. Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are best for me as I stand a fighting chance of completing them. Starting Thursday, however, its as if English is no longer my primary language. So what I sometimes do is purposely take five days to complete the Wednesday puzzle so Ill have something to divert my attention until the following Mondays puzzle comes out. At this very moment I am supposed to be working on the outline for the movie version of Lunatics, which is the new novel I co-authored with Dave Barry. Sales have been terrific, the reviews have been mostly enthusiastic, and our producers at Universal are eager to move forward especially because Steve Carell is attached to play one of the lead roles. So what am I doing instead? Trying to figure out one particular word thats been driving me insane since 6:00 this morning. 61 Down. Low-lying region. Its a four-letter answer. Heres what I do know. The first letter is the V from the word AVERAGE. The third letter is the L from ISABEL. The fourth is the E from STRIDE. So the second letter is the elusive one. And because it falls between the V and the L, unless the answer is the Slavic word for low-lying region, I can only assume that the letter Im looking for is a vowel. Six choices. A, E, I, O, U and sometimes Y. Now, the other thing to know is that this letter is also the one I need to complete 63 Across. Tart powdered drink preparation. And heres what have so far: LEMON_REMIX. So, one of those vowels will not only complete both words but the entire puzzle as well  leaving me looking for something else to do instead of working on this outline. Off the top of my head, I cant see it being the sometimes Y as it would give us VYLE and LEMONY REMIX. And while the second word could very well be an ill-conceived brand name, VYLE just looks too weird so I figure that this is not one of those times that sometimes Y gets pressed into service as a vowel. But now, Im stuck. Maybe if I go back to work on the outline Ill be able to readdress this with fresher eyes. O.K., its now 10 minutes later and Im now eliminating the I because I figure that vile already is a word. And though its possible it has two meanings, my gut tells me that the good folks living in that low-lying region would never raise their families in a place whose adjective form offers such a despicable version of whatever its describing. Back to the outline. Back to the puzzle and V_LE, where Im eliminating E from contention because even if VELE didnt look ridiculous, LEMONE REMIX more than makes up for it by looking absurd. Ditto for the U. Back to the outline. Back to V_LE and the two remaining candidates. A and O. Now, Ive seen the word vole before. In fact, Ive seen it as an answer in other crossword puzzles. Its an answer I usually come up with by default while filling in letters of other clues and then seeing that Ive also written the word VOLE, but have never bothered to look up its meaning. Could a vole be a low-lying region? On the other hand, I dont even know if vale is a word. I know that veil is. I also know that vail is. Is it possible that there are three (here comes a word I havent used since 4th grade) homonyms? Yet, vale is a mere one L and a Y short of valley, which is certainly a low-lying region. Could be. Could be. Once again, a quick glance at the horizontal word it intersects also offers no help as LEMONA REMIX is just as unfathomable as LEMONO REMIX. So, here I sit. Waiting for just one of the newscasters on MSNBC to use the word vale or vole in a sentence so Ill no longer be stuck in neutral and can continue with my Tuesday. Until then, if any of you would like to finish this movie outline I should be working on, I would really appreciate it.

I say the man deserves a huge round of applause. And a good nights sleep. Thank you, Mr. Zweibel.

nytimes.com,2016-02-25 00:00:00,Finding Oscar Moments From the Red Carpet to Backstage,"['James Estrin', 'Http Jamesestrin']","Monica Almeida, a New York Times staff photographer, has been photographing the Academy Awards since 1999 and is scheduled to cover her 17th Oscars on Sunday. Her conversation with James Estrin about covering the ceremony has been edited.

Q.

Tell me about your first Oscars.

A.

It was at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in 1999. I shot the red carpet, and that was it. I shot film and it wasnt a tight deadline. At that time, The Times would run the red carpet story the Tuesday following the awards.

Q.

What is the difference between 1999 and last year?

A.

The difference is the technology and new media. The fan base has always been there, but its even larger now because of the technology that lets people experience this on their phones. Theres an insatiable appetite for films and movie stars.

Q.

Now the Oscars photos are essentially broadcast live. You take a photo, and it ends up on the New York Times home page minutes later.

A.

Its gone from dropping film overnight and picking it up the next morning to transmit, to running memory cards to an on-site editor to beat the closing time for the next days paper. When the first wireless transmitters came out, we started using them. We work under an extremely tight deadline on East Coast time.

Josh Haner made all the difference when he devised an ingenious system where every single frame we shoot is transmitted immediately to the editors in New York. They are actually seeing the pictures in real time. They caption them with the names of the stars and the designer and post them on the web.

Photo

Q.

You work on a lot of serious, in-depth stories. Yet these award shows are among the most popular slideshows we do.

A.

Yes. The Oscar slide shows get the most views of any shows all year, which is quite amazing. Last year, it got over three million views over all. But do you want to hear something incomprehensible to me? The red carpet slide shows for last months Golden Globes got 13 million page views. And thats pretty much somebody posing in an evening gown. But we were faster. We were beating the wires. They were still dealing with on-site editors.

Q.

What is involved in shooting the red carpet?

A.

We have more access now so its gotten much more interesting and challenging. It used to be all about logistics  setting up days in advance to make sure all that technology works.

I have shot every position, from the red carpet to the photo room, where there are bleachers full of hundreds of photographers screaming at the winners when they come to pose for pictures; to a position inside of the theater, which is essentially what is seen on television.

Once I got the backstage position in 2014  and along with that the ability to move around on the red carpet  I could roam, take pictures, observe and work the light. Youre not in one position waiting for something to happen in front of you. You can actually start to take real pictures. The first year, I felt like a kid in a candy store.

Q.

And how did this happen?

A.

It took many years of asking. Only a handful of photographers are granted that access, and the biggest news and entertainment organizations are represented. The New York Times is one of them, and our reach has grown tremendously, especially the last few years, through our website and social media.

Photo

Q.

Whats it like to be in the bleachers?

A.

You get into your position in the photo room and everybodys dressed in formal attire. You wait for the winners to come in with their awards and when they do the whole room just goes crazy. Theres a stage thats set up and they pose with their statues.

You just try to capture whatever moment you can with somebody standing in front of you posing.

Q.

And the other photographers screaming in your ears.

A.

Yes, but sometimes that might work to your advantage if youre sitting next to somebody who gets the winners attention and they kind of look your way. Im not inclined to scream at people. Its just pandemonium.

Then the celebrity walks away and everything quiets down. The next one comes and the room erupts again. It can be entertaining, but also sort of a sensory overload at times.

Im at my best when Im like the only photographer around. And so this is quite the opposite. The red carpet positions are pretty much the same. Essentially youre stuck in a tiny position waiting for somebody to walk by and pose and you try to make visual sense. You want to make a clean image, but you want to make an interesting one. Sometimes youre a little limited and they breeze past you.

Photo

Q.

Are you taking note of the clothes or are you just trying to make a sharp head-to-toe image?

A.

A little bit of both. There are some dresses that do really stand out. Now, being able to roam on the carpet, you can be a lot more discerning. You can follow a person or gown that looks really great. When youre in position you really have to get it while theyre there. Its like shooting theater or sports. It takes a lot of technical prowess  you really have to be on top of it. You have to capture that moment. Once theyre gone, theyre gone.

Q.

Half of Americas watching whats happening onstage. Whats it like backstage?

A.

Its really quite impressive and a little intimidating at first. There is so much activity going on in a crowded, confined space. Im fairly new to it and there are great photographers like Al Seib of The L.A. Times who have been shooting backstage for a long time. I learned a lot from them.

I use flash sparingly and shoot with fast primes because if youre shooting into a black hole it doesnt always look good and it creates a big disturbance. Ill raise my ISO as high as 6400, and work with the light thats there.

There are all the stagehands and different sets coming in and moving out at a very fast pace. And you have to stay out of the way of the performers, musicians, presenters and stage managers. You dont want to interfere with their flow but you still want to get your pictures. So its kind of an intricate dance, knowing when to step in  and knowing when to step out.

Q.

What have been your most memorable Oscar moments?

A.

Backstage, when Lupita Nyongo won, she had a big smile on her face and then she came out and she was just so quiet (Slide 10). She just stood there like she was just trying to take it all in, but it was just such a quiet moment. I mean, theres so much excitement and activity going on all the time, and I was just there, shooting, and it was dark.

Q.

As photographers we see so many famous people, presidents and stars, that we have been somewhat inoculated against being impressed. And then every once in a while theres someone youre impressed by.

A.

The most obvious pictures are of the famous people onstage. But I have to remind myself to resist the urge to blast away when I see a familiar face and to look for something that is interesting in that moment, even if its an expression or a gesture.

In some ways its like shooting politics. I went to Nevada for the caucuses, stayed for a week and flew back on Wednesday to go straight from the airport to the Oscars venue for the first walk-through. So I went from one American ritual to another.

Photo

Q.

How are they similar and how are they different?

A.

Well, there are the obvious differences: One group of people is dressed much more elegantly than the other.

The similarities are that these are rituals the American public feels that it has a vested interest in. And that dominate our television screens and social media. People can get very passionate about entertainment and politics.

Q.

Theyre both theater.

A.

The challenging part of both is finding the real human moments in between the staged moments  finding something that looks different from what everybody else is shooting. I mean not only the angles, but also the little off-moments. Like the workers who are behind the scenes carrying the big Oscar statues around.

Q.

Did you watch the Oscars when you were growing up?

A.

Absolutely.

I love movies. The town I grew up in  a small suburb east of L.A.  had a drive-in that played all the first run movies. I saw all the movies of the 70s there with my parents: The Godfather, The Exorcist, Jaws, even Carnal Knowledge. We went to the movies every single week. That was a big part of my life growing up. I always watched the Academy Awards. The Oscars were a special occasion when I could stay up late and watch the show with my parents. I never dreamt that I would get so close to the actual awards ceremony.

Q.

So I wonder whether the 8-year-old Monica, what she would have thought about the fact that you are now backstage.

A.

Actually the 40-something Monica would be pretty impressed, after all the years of shooting from all the other positions.

I remember watching in the living room with the family. I remember the streaker one year, and when Marlon Brando, sent the Native American woman (Sacheen) Littlefeather to decline his award. I remember Jane Fonda. Its a reflection of society and the times.

Thats whats going on this year, too. I remember the palpable elation when Denzel Washington and Halle Berry won the Best Actor and Best Actress awards the same year, in 2002.

So its interesting to see the controversy going on now and how different people are responding to it. As gilded and removed as it is from reality, the Oscars cant avoid being a reflection of our society as well.

nytimes.com,2014-03-15 00:00:00,Celebrity Guest Solver Suzanne Whang: It's Better This Way,"['Deb Amlen', 'Jeremy Newton']","SUNDAYS PUZZLE  Well, I dont have to say very much today, because Suzanne Whang, stand-up comedian, actress and host of HGTVs House Hunters for 10 years, is going to tell you about her experience solving todays crossword puzzle.

More importantly, you know how I always encourage people to talk about what the puzzle brings out for them? Youre going to read a surprising and very touching twist at the end of Ms. Whangs write-up, and I promise you that neither of us thought of this when I scheduled her for todays post. Thats all Im going to say. Im just glad things are working out for her, because we need more bright lights like her in the world.

When my friend Elayne Boosler told me that she was a celebrity guest crossword solver for The New York Times, I plotzed (Koreans are the Jews of Asia.) I blurted out, You WERE? What exactly does that MEAN? I want to do that!!

Ive been in love with crossword puzzles for as long as I can remember. And lately, heres how it works. Every time I get on an airplane from L.A. to New York City, as soon as I get through security, I go straight to the nearest newsstand and I buy USA Today, The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times and a bottle of water. I head to my gate and then proceed to do what would appear to be an odd ritual to anyone who cares about whats going on in the world.

First, I find the section of each newspaper that has the crossword puzzle. I remove those sections, and I give away the rest. Then I open each section to the page with the crossword puzzle. First, I carefully fold backward at the main vertical seam, then backward at the main horizontal seam, and then I create a new vertical fold so that now all thats visible is the puzzle itself. Then I put the puzzles in order of increasing difficulty: USA Today, then The Los Angeles Times, then The New York Times. If its a Monday, I can sometimes get all three puzzles finished before the plane takes off. If its a Saturday, I will most likely not finish the New York Times puzzle by the time I land in New York, and Im furious that its so freakin difficult.

I use pen. It has to be a Pilot Precise pen, in black, blue or purple. Its the only pen for me. It gushes with ink. It glides. It makes writing a pleasure. The only problem is that these pens sometimes explode in the airplane, leaking ink everywhere. But I digress.

The only exception to my folding ritual is when its a Sunday, which means that the holy grail of puzzles is in The New York Times Sunday Magazine. Ahhhh. Itll be close to the last page. And its on smooth magazine paper. And there will be some sort of theme for me to figure out, so its a puzzle within a puzzle. And its bigger than the other puzzles (21 x 21 instead of 15 x 15). And I love it so. And I dont want your help until Ive done everything in my power to solve it on my own. Once, on an airplane, the person sitting next to me just decided to tell me the answer to 7 down. Unsolicited help. Horrifying. I

felt so violated, I needed a Silkwood scrub-down.

I emailed Deb Amlen, introducing myself, hoping I was enough of a celebrity to be considered for this highest of all honors, pitching myself as if it were more important than anything else I had done in my 25-year show biz career. When I got her email saying that she knew who I was and yes I could be a celebrity guest solver, I squealed with glee. When she gave me a choice of what day of the week Id like to solve, well, that was easy. Sunday!

Most of my friends dont do crossword puzzles, and they dont understand my obsession with them. They also dont understand why I dont want crossword puzzle books, and I dont want to do crossword puzzles online. This is a visceral experience that requires pen and paper, and it has to be in a newspaper, not in a book. Its more special when youre doing the puzzle in todays paper. And the puzzles in The New York Times, thanks to Will Shortz, are the most elegant. There is a sweet spot between a clue being too easy and being impossible to figure out, and Mr. Shortz manages to make sure to create that perfect balance. Well, with the exception of Saturdays. Grrr.

One of my favorite documentaries is Wordplay. Much like a support group meeting, it was wonderful to not feel like such a weirdo for loving crossword puzzles this much. Jon Stewart loves crosswords, too? Yay!

When I printed out the Sunday puzzle Id be solving, the first thing that occurred to me was, Im seeing this puzzle before the rest of the world! Wow! The second thing that occurred to me was, My father is going to LOVE reading this piece. I got my father into crossword puzzles many years ago. But I got my love of the English language from him.

O.K., lets get to this puzzle. After wondering about the significance of the title, I notice the four circles in the squares of 1 Across, and the four circles in the squares of 119 Across. What is that? A word within a word? Hmm.

I usually begin puzzles by looking through the clues for anything with a fill-in-the-blank. Im not sure why I do this, but I do. Perhaps in my experience, Im often able to solve those clues easily. 62 Across, ______ good cheer! I write in BE OF.

I write in all capital letters. Not sure why, its just what Ive always done. I wonder why it doesnt say (two words) in the clue. There was a time when the clues would tell us if the answer was more than one word. Im mildly annoyed.

117 Across, The ______ Project (Fox comedy). MINDY! 2 Down, ______ de la Societe. I think its ILES; thats one of those crossword puzzle answers that I only know from doing crossword puzzles. Like knowing that a jewelry case is an ETUI. 15 Down, Whack-_____ Well, its gotta be A-MOLE. 66 Down, _____ and Thummim (sacred Judaic objects) Darn you, Jeremy Newton and Will Shortz. Grrrrr. I rarely know world history or ancient terms for anything. Or the Latin words for anything.

Now, whats the theme of this puzzle? 23 Across, *He bested Leonidas at Thermopylae. Oh, come ON. Nobody knows that. And why is there an asterisk before the clue?

Here are my favorite clues. 1 Downs Something dirty kept in a cell? It took me a while, but I finally realized it was SEXT. Fantastic. 57 Down, Loud beast heard in the theaters. Huh? Godzilla? King Kong? Those dont fit. Then I got the across answers that showed me the first two letters of the answer were MG. Theres no word that starts with MG. If its a Scottish word, it would be MCG. Then I realize. Its the MGM LION.

Woo hoo! Im so pleased with myself now. 7 Across, Touching words? Eulogy doesnt fit. And theres a question mark, so theres something punny going on.

Oh! BRAILLE! Love it. 73 Down: Theyre 18 to 21. What could that possibly mean? I cant get past these numbers referring to a persons age. Then I finally realize its referring to the letters of the alphabet. RSTU. Im in heaven.

I get that 31 Across is FOURXFOUR, and that 49 Across is THE WINTERX GAMES, and then I see the clue for 16 Down. Its the key to this puzzle! In both of these starred clues, the answers contain the letters RX, which means prescription. And now Im on my way. Figuring out the theme to a Sunday puzzle is what I would call a wordgasm.

As soon as I figure out the theme, I have to leave the house to go to a meeting. Im in my car, and I notice this license plate right in front of me. PARIS RX. I get chills. I recently married a man whom Ive been friends with and secretly in love with for 20 years. Turns out he was secretly in love with me, too, and he chose to tell me. We want to go on a honeymoon to Paris, when we can afford it. And then RX, the theme of this puzzle is right after that? Paris prescription, indeed.

I get that 1 Across is SICK OF, with SICK being inside the four circles, so I look at the four circles at the bottom right and wonder if those would contain the letters WELL. The clue is Thrive, so I write in DOWELL. Now the title makes sense. ITS BETTER THIS WAY. We begin with SICK and end with WELL.

This theme is poignant for me. In the last eight years, I had breast cancer three times, because like most Asians, I am an overachiever. Yay! The third time it metastasized to Stage 4, and I was given six months to live. But I reversed the disease, reclaimed my health, and am now cancer-free. I used Western medicine, Eastern medicine, holistic, alternative, illegal and revolutionary treatments. I came out of the cancer closet and started asking for (and receiving) help and love. My house became Grand Central Love Station. I felt like Jimmy Stewart at the end of Its a Wonderful Life. I changed my nutrition and started meditating. And now I laugh, I bask in the present moment, and I overflow with gratitude. Every day feels like a bonus round. I wake up so grateful to be alive. Im not just a survivor, Im a thriver. And that today I get to be the celebrity guest solver for the New York Times Sunday puzzle is yet another miracle. The only thing that could top this would be for my name to be the answer to a New York Times crossword puzzle clue.

In a random house in America: Hey, sweetie, whats a 12-letter-word for a crazy Asian?",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"After Living Brazils Dream, Family Confronts Microcephaly and Economic Crisis",['Simon Romero'],"IPOJUCA, Brazil  They were young and relishing Brazils version of the American dream: buying a car, joining a church, starting a family.









With millions of others, they had climbed into the countrys expanding middle class. They had even moved into California, a neighborhood of strivers who had left the big, impoverished city nearby.

It was that magical moment when everything seemed possible, said Germana Soares, 24.

Then, in the sixth month of Ms. Soaress pregnancy, the couple discovered how quickly their fortunes, like those of their nation, could change. A routine exam showed that their son weighed much less than he should. Doctors worried that he, like hundreds of other Brazilian babies born in recent months, had microcephaly, an incurable condition in which infants have abnormally small heads.

The doctors peppered her with questions about the Zika virus, which she had contracted early in her pregnancy. Her husband, Glecion Amorim, 27, quickly spiraled into worry. Ms. Soares put on a brave face and prayed, trying to stay positive.

Then another shock: Mr. Amorim, a welder riding Brazils push into the top ranks of global oil producers, was fired with hundreds of others. The enormous shipyard where he built oil vessels was teetering along with Brazils scandal-plagued oil industry.

In the span of a few weeks, the entire arc of their lives had changed. All the crosscurrents punishing Brazil  corruption, the countrys worst economic downturn in decades, the fall of millions of middle-class people into poverty, the Zika epidemic and the surge of microcephaly cases stalking the northeast  were suddenly lashing at the door of their cookie-cutter two-bedroom home with a Chevy compact in the driveway.

I thought Hawaii would be wonderful to see, Ms. Soares said, rattling off a list of dreams the couple had sketched out, until recently. All those big plans are in the past. My priority has to be caring for my special boy.

Their struggle offers a small glimpse into the thousands of Brazilian families now faced with the prospect of raising a disabled child in poverty in the wake of the Zika epidemic.

Researchers still cannot say with certainty whether the virus causes microcephaly in infants, but at least 641 Brazilian babies have been born with the condition since October  a sharp increase detected by doctors in recent months  and the authorities are investigating 4,222 other cases, largely here in the countrys impoverished northeast.

Newfound Security

Ms. Soares and Mr. Amorim thought they had finally escaped the hardships of life in nearby Recife when they moved into California around the start of the decade. Those were the boom years, when tens of thousands of workers swarmed the Port of Suape, a sprawling industrial site built to help propel Brazil into the elite ranks of the worlds oil-producing nations.

Huge deep-sea oil discoveries and the opening of a new agricultural frontier on the edge of the Amazon rain forest had catapulted Brazil onto the global stage, positioning it to satisfy Chinas demand for commodities. Brazilian officials built concrete canals in drought-stricken backlands, railroads through the hinterlands and lavish stadiums for the World Cup soccer tournament.

Demand for workers was so intense that Mr. Amorims employers offered him a two-bedroom house, one of nearly 800 designed almost identically in this company town.

At one point, there were a thousand buses a day here transporting workers, said Aldo Amaral, 44, the president of the union representing laborers at the port complex. It was a boom that was supposed to last decades.

Ms. Soares and Mr. Amorim embraced it fully. When Brazils currency surged, their combined income reached the equivalent of almost $40,000 a year. They installed a large flat-screen television in their living room, joined an evangelical Christian congregation, hired a photographer for their wedding, traveled by motorcycle to idyllic beaches and even flew on vacation to Fernando de Noronha, a Brazilian archipelago in the Atlantic that few people in the world ever get to see.

We even had health insurance that gave us access to private hospitals, Ms. Soares said, lamenting her current reliance on Brazils public health system, often characterized by horror stories about neglect by doctors and shortages of beds that force patients to sleep in the corridors. It was the perfect time for us to have a baby.

A Sudden Blow

Ebullient when Ms. Soares became pregnant, the couple hosted a cha de revelacao, a party to reveal the babys sex, and announced to friends and relatives that they were expecting a son. They tried to remain hopeful even after doctors raised the possibility during Ms. Soaress pregnancy that their son might have microcephaly. They thought about opening a store selling baby clothes with the modest severance package Mr. Amorim had received after losing his job at the shipyard.

Photo

Then, on Nov. 27, Guilherme was born. At first, doctors said the baby seemed fine. The news elicited cries of joy among relatives in the waiting room, and a celebration of hugs and impromptu dancing that resembled a Carnival street party, Ms. Soares said.

But a nurse returned with an update. Something appeared to be wrong when they measured Guilhermes head. The circumference was 32 centimeters, the threshold for microcephaly classification at that time. A hush set over the hospital room as family members carefully tapped the word microcephaly into the search engines of their smartphones.

I heard the number 32, and I began to cry, Mr. Amorim said.

Doctors kept Ms. Soares and Guilherme hospitalized for a week as they carried out tests. Scans confirmed that Guilherme had brain damage associated with microcephaly.

The blow led the couple to rethink everything. Ms. Soares had been so buoyant after learning she was pregnant that she left her job as a real estate agent, planning to dedicate herself instead to raising their child on her husbands salary. But after he lost his job, the two found themselves in the whirlwind of Brazils economic crisis. More than six million Brazilians have slipped from the middle class into poverty since 2014, according to economists at Bradesco, one of Brazils largest banks.

Instead of opening a clothing store, as they had envisioned, Mr. Amorim invested in something more affordable: a dune buggy. Each day, he drives to Porto de Galinhas, a nearby area of resorts where he tries to lure vacationers to take beach tours. In a good month, he makes about $625. Altogether, he said, the family will be lucky if their annual income reaches $7,000.

I have to keep a smile on my face and be friendly despite all the thoughts swirling in my mind, Mr. Amorim said. Im the only one now earning money, and its my responsibility to put food on our table every day.

Ms. Soares said she was slowly realizing that she might never be able to hold a regular job again, given the time needed to care for many children with microcephaly, who often develop problems like speech impediments, hearing loss and learning delays. Guilherme, she said, has already started having muscle spasms, which doctors say are a predictor of convulsions later in life.

He cries so much and needs so much love that I cant just leave him with someone, she said.

I used to think of myself as an independent woman, she added, pausing to look out the window. But that phase in my life is finished. I cant go back to work.

A Daily Grind

Ms. Soares leaves home a couple of times each week for appointments with doctors in Recife, awaking with Guilherme at 5 a.m. to board a van provided by municipal officials to transport patients. Driving their car is out of the question, since each trip to Recife and back consumes about $25 in gasoline, an expense far beyond their reach.

Cruelly, their move into California, which once seemed to trumpet their ambitions for independence, now feels isolating. While Mr. Amorim scours the beaches for clients, a family member from Recife occasionally visits Ms. Soares and Guilherme. Still, relatives have their own jobs and families, so she spends many of her days alone with her son. On a recent Saturday afternoon, their flat-screen TV was tuned in to a skateboarding event in Rio de Janeiro featuring cheerful competitors from around Brazil.

I dont know if my son will ever be able to do anything like that, she said.

Ms. Soares tries to maintain a semblance of normalcy. Embroidered elephants, hippos and lions adorn the walls of her sons room under the words Guilhermes Safari. A mosquito net envelops his crib, reflecting the couples newfound awareness of viruses like Zika, dengue and chikungunya.

With so many other mothers who have recently given birth to babies with microcephaly, Ms. Soares keeps informed about the condition on WhatsApp, the Internet messaging service that is a sensation around Brazil. They trade updates about Zikas spread, information about microcephaly, reports that the authorities may provide subsidies of about $220 a month to poor families with microcephalic babies, and even the occasional joke to lighten up the mood.

One of the mothers in Salvador, 420 miles south of Recife, has begun composing poems about microcephaly that she distributes among the WhatsApp group. One of her writings, Microcephaly Is Not the End, resonated so much with Ms. Soares that she recites it when the mood in her house starts to darken:

Do you know what prejudice is?

Its something that wont affect us

Because we are here

To fight for our angels

Trudging Forward

Mr. Amorim says he is too busy trying to make ends meet to dwell on their misfortune. When he gets home from work, he surfs the web for welding jobs, wondering whether it makes sense to apply for openings in distant Mozambique, a Portuguese-speaking country in southern Africa.

Despite the findings of dozens of medical tests, he said he still held out hope that Guilherme does not have microcephaly, pointing out that his head circumference is at the upper limit of the range for the condition.

Its not that I dont accept him, he said. But in my mind, he is normal.

While adapting to the challenges and costs of raising Guilherme, the couple are also trying to stave off eviction. The shipyard is trying to repossess their house on the grounds that Mr. Amorim did not work long enough to take full ownership of the property. The couple have joined dozens of other families in a lawsuit, claiming that Brazils real estate laws allow them to stay in their homes.

Built in less than a decade, their subdivision and surrounding areas of Ipojuca already exhibit the strains of age.

Some in the California subdivision have put up towering walls around their homes to protect against break-ins. Motorists navigate through potholes on streets buckling under the equatorial sun. Graffiti tags on some homes speak to the fraying of the neighborhoods aspirations.

From their porch, Ms. Soares and Mr. Amorim can glimpse the flickering of the flare stack at the oil refinery in the Port of Suape that cost nearly $20 billion to build, about eight times original estimates. Like so many other ambitious projects begun in Brazil during the boom, it was never completed.

RE: N.Y.P.D.









Saki Knafo detailed the struggle of Edwin Raymond, an N.Y.P.D. officer who thought he could change the department from the inside but instead became the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit brought by 12 minority officers contending that racially based arrest quotas have persisted throughout the department.

What a well-written and riveting article about Edwin Raymond. Thank you for telling his story and shedding light on what he is trying to do. I found myself enthralled, impressed and furious all at the same time. Raymond is brave and driven; we need more men and women like him serving our city. Its a shame the N.Y.P.D. is caught in its own backward ways and is not more willing to champion change, especially as we continue to see the stressed and violent relationship between the police and citizens across this country. I hope Edwin Raymond will prevail and that his story inspires others to speak the truth and champion their cause in the hope of making New York City, and this country, a better place. Hannah Grace Miles, New York

As racial relations continue to be at the forefront of discussion over police interaction with members of the community, it is imperative to acknowledge accountability on both ends. The police departments approach to building trust among black and Hispanic New Yorkers by recruiting more minority police officers is offensive and does not address the underlying issues.

Minority members of the community are both consciously and subconsciously distrustful of policemen because of the undeniable history of prejudice practiced toward them. The recruitment of minority policemen into poor, minority neighborhoods only represents a lack of awareness and a refusal to acknowledge the unfair treatment of minorities within the criminal-justice system. Jasmine N. Jones, New York

The Edwin Raymond article made my blood boil after reading about the unjust and sclerotic bureaucracy thrown against a black police officer of exemplary integrity and dedication to his oath as a guardian of the public. If a cop like Raymond is barred from serving the public effectively, no system from the departments executive suites will make any difference in relations with the community and its residents views toward cops.

Yes, Officer Raymond, you are correct: The system needs to change, and what you are doing is not only right, it is in the interest of millions of law-abiding New Yorkers. History makes clear that change hardly ever comes easily, but courageous people give us hope and engineer change.

I come from a long line of New York cops, beginning with my grandfather and continuing with my father and my uncle. I dont know about my grandfather, who died in 1922, but my father and uncle were blatant bigots. (My father argued with me 48 years ago about this countrys need for George Wallace as president, but Im glad to say his views moderated significantly before he died.) Racism was pungent then; it still stinks. Richard J. Olive, San Rafael, Calif.

Saki Knafos profile of officer Edwin Raymonds desperate push to bring some reform to the N.Y.P.D. was yet another harsh reminder of how entrenched racist oppression is in America. Sadly, the racism even infected the article. Casually referring to Chancellor Williamss The Destruction of Black Civilization as a work of Afrocentric history diminishes by pigeonholing. If someone were reading J. M. Robertss celebrated History of the World, would The Times have tossed off a reference to it as a work of Eurocentric history? I strongly doubt it.

The destruction of black civilization, principally at the hands of Europeans, is history. It is thus both morally and factually correct to cite it as world history. Neil Hartbarger, Silver Spring, Md.

RE: ON MONEY

Adam Davidson considered the effect of technological advances on the improvement of an average persons material condition, citing the economist Robert Gordons claim that there have been just a handful of truly transformative innovations in the past 200 years.

While I agree with Adam Davidsons skepticism regarding the pessimistic conclusions in Robert Gordons book, I was amazed by his comment that no presidential candidate in 2016 is offering an expansive, optimistic vision of the future. As a political junkie who has been looking for a candidate in this cycle who reflects my hope for economic progress, I have been strongly attracted to Marco Rubio largely because of his frequent espousal of just such a possible future. While I have not yet decided to support him, he articulates some of the same points that Davidson made, so I can only conclude that Davidson was unfamiliar with his economic arguments or rejected him because of other aspects of his political philosophy.

Situated on a narrow barrier island, Shishmaref was founded over 400 years ago as a seasonal fishing settlement. Cold weather and natural ice barriers used to protect the shore, but now the municipal village, home to some 600 residents, faces the immediate threat of inundation.

A recent study noted that Alaskas glaciers have lost some 75 gigatons of ice every year from 1994 to 2013. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, Alaska has been heating up twice as fast as the national average over the last 50 years, and the rising temperatures melt sea ice and thaw permafrost along the coast.

Frozen ice used to form natural barriers that protected Shishmarefs shores from powerful storm surges in autumn. But rising tides now threaten the remainder of an eroded coastline.

We hear about climate change and we hear about foreign countries like Moldova or some such island that is sinking and its all very remote and nebulous, Mr. Taradji said. The Alaska folks are here in the United States. They are folks on our team that are immediately threatened. Its not something that is going to happen in several generations, it is something that is happening to them right now as we speak.

Photo

Residents of Sishmaref were so alarmed by the tides that in 2002 they voted overwhelmingly in favor of relocation. Yet few have budged. Mr. Taradji went there to photograph how the villages residents are coping with climate change, staying at the local high school because he said it was the only building with running water.

After talking to the residents, whom he described as divided between elders and a new generation, he didnt find much urgency about the need to move.

I felt a sense of what can we do about it?  he said. A sort of resignation and wait-and-see attitude and hoping for the best from the older people I spoke with. There are not many options. Moving costs money, and the situation is a Catch-22 sort of thing.

Photo

Mr. Taradjis project is centered on people. Each day he would wake up, have breakfast with the schoolchildren, then walk around the village and ask people if he could photograph them.

I had seen many photos of the falling house and the erosion and videos about the erosion, he said. I wanted to show what it is all about. Erosion without people being affected is irrelevant. I wanted to show the people who are actually impacted by climate change.

He photographed 26-year-old Andrew Ningealook, a lifelong resident of Shishmaref, breaking the ice to dip his fishing net underneath (Slide 1). He photographed the mayor, Howard Weyiouanna, at home as he was getting ready to attend a City Council meeting. He photographed residents playing bingo, which he says is a favorite  if expensive  pastime, in which players can win as much as $1,000.

Funds are still needed for relocation. Although the Army Corps of Engineers has taken steps to set up a rock revetment, it is only a temporary solution, and the government has not decided on the villages new location.

Additionally, moving could cost hundreds of millions of dollars, an obstacle for other threatened villages in Alaska, too.

Mr. Taradji said part of the resistance to moving is that Shishmarefs residents have ancestral and cultural ties to the land.

They have their own culture and art and ways to work the food, he said. Its understood, for example, the way they work the seal oil is the best. So all this is threatened by the fact that their home will disappear in a near future.

Kurt Sutter swung the ax on his own series, opting to end The Bastard Executioner after its debut season, which concluded on Tuesday.

The show runner announced the end of the FX show, a swords-sandals-and-revenge drama set in 14th-century Wales, in an ad that appeared in outlets including Variety and The Hollywood Reporter. It read, in part: The audience has spoken and unfortunately the word is meh. So with due respect, we bring our mythology to an epic and fiery close.

The show was Mr. Sutters followup to Sons of Anarchy, his popular motorcycle gang drama that ran on FX for seven seasons.

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Mr. Sutter acknowledged the complexity and expense of shooting a period drama in Wales, with elaborate sets and horses.

But the bottom line was the bottom line: The show ended because it did not draw enough ratings. It debuted in September to around four million viewers but lost roughly half of its audience within six weeks.

I dont want to write something that nobodys [expletive] watching, he said.

The decision to end the show was made in consultation with John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX Networks, but the timing and delivery of the cancellation announcement was Mr. Sutters call. The advertisement, which thanks the cast and crew members, was about letting folks know what a great experience I had, and how proud I was of them, Mr. Sutter told The Hollywood Reporter. He notified them in advance, he said.

Executioner starred the Australian theater actor Lee Jones as a former soldier and farmer impersonating a punisher, for a variety of reasons. There was also a mystical plot involving rival religious sects. I think the mythology was a little too dense for some people, Mr. Sutter said in the interview. Theres a glut of period pieces on right now, and Im sure timing has something to do it.

Mr. Sutter is developing a Sons of Anarchy spinoff about the Mayans, a rival gang in the show, among other projects.

Mr. Sutter also let fans know the show was ending via an Instagram post that read, in part: The final episode of The Bastard Executioner. Truths revealed. Love professed. Limbs severed. Bloody good end.",[]

I say, The doctors told me there is nothing they can do, it is inoperable and incurable,  says Wanda N., who is 50 and in hospice care at home in New York with metastasized colon cancer. When I tell people, I use the same words the doctors used to tell me. You might not have time or energy to formulate the exact right phrasing  but you are not obliged to be the town crier, spreading the news of a terminal diagnosis. Dont feel the need to announce your situation over and over again, says Wanda, who has told only a handful of people, including her father, a cousin and a few women from her Army veterans group. Some she told in person, others by phone or text.

Though everyone eventually dies, few know how to talk about the end of life. People dont know what to say, Wanda says. Theyre afraid. Be prepared for strange and stilted reactions. Some want to believe in a fix and will give you unsolicited health tips. (Dont eat sugar. Avoid gluten.) You can ignore their suggestions but acknowledge the heart underlying them. People may offer to pray for you. Prayers are good, but maybe what I need is someone to listen, Wanda says. For that type of engaged listening, you may need to seek out a professional, like a trained social worker or a psychiatrist. Sometimes people who know about your condition  those you tell will tell others  will pretend your situation does not exist. Or weirder still, they will temporarily forget. To all appearances, Wanda looks healthy, and occasionally the reality of her health slips peoples minds.

Know that these might be profoundly lonely, vulnerable months, when you need to conserve your energy. But in order for people to be there and provide help, you need to tell them. Dont expect others to step up, but give them a chance to. Wanda fondly recalls when a friend, unasked, bought her groceries and another friend delivered them to her apartment. Sometimes what you need, she says, is very small: someone to walk with you for five minutes outside the hospital in the sun.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,How Trump Could Be Blocked at a Contested Republican Convention,"['Larry Buchanan', 'Alicia Parlapiano']","Mr. Trump could lose support as delegates become free to vote as they please.

Most states bind their delegates to candidates based on primary results. But most delegates are released if no candidate wins a majority in an initial vote at the convention, so those who were bound to Mr. Trump could shift their support. This scenario is less likely if Mr. Trump is close to 1,237 delegates, or if he continues to face a split opposition.

First vote At least 5 percent of delegates are not bound to candidates and can vote as they please from the outset. Needed to win 95% bound to a candidate 5% unbound Did one candidate get a majority of delegates? Yes. Thats it. Hes the nominee. No. Move on to a second vote with some new rules. Second vote After the first round of voting, more than half of all delegates, from more than 30 states, become free. 43% bound to a candidate 57% unbound Did one candidate get a majority of delegates? Yes. Thats it. Hes the nominee. No. Move on to a third vote with some new rules. Third vote Many states with a large number of delegates (like California, with 172) release them before the third vote. 19% bound to a candidate 81% unbound Did one candidate get a majority of delegates? Yes. Thats it. Hes the nominee. No. Move on to a fourth vote with some new rules. This could go on for a while, but its very unlikely. It would be difficult to get through more votes without one candidate receiving a majority, because many states release their delegates early if candidates withdraw from the race or do not meet a certain vote threshold on the floor, preventing those with low support from remaining in contention.

An eight-state rule could come into play.

Currently, in addition to securing a majority of delegates, a candidate is required to win more than 50 percent of delegates in at least eight states to secure the nomination. Mr. Trump has already done so in five.

However, this rule, or any other, could be changed before the voting begins, putting candidates who do not win a majority in eight states into contention.

The people who are selected as delegates in the first place will be key.

Because delegates are free to vote for their candidate of choice once they are unbound, Mr. Trump and some of the other candidates have already begun organizing their supporters to get as many allied delegates as possible selected.",[]

Common-Sense Policing









Re Making policing safer for everyone (Opinion, March 3): It was heartening to read Chuck Wexlers and Scott Thomsons ideas about common-sense reforms to protect police officers and the civilians they encounter. Their reference to de-escalation tactics employed by the police in Britain demonstrates a welcome desire to bring those techniques to American communities for the benefit of all.

But their arguments, which focused largely on knife-wielding criminals, failed to draw the critical conclusion from the British example: The police in Britain can take the time to patiently de-escalate tense situations because they almost never encounter a gun-wielding civilian. If civilians didnt have access to such lethal weapons, the police would have the time and space to do their job properly, with far less fear for their own lives. Common-sense gun-control measures were passed in Britain in the 1980s and 1990s. Its time for the United States to follow suit.

Saving the Planet

Re Planet on the ballot (Paul Krugman, March 1): I enjoyed the column but could not help but find a fly in the ointment. There is a notional inaccuracy in maintaining that the fate of the planet is at stake. The Earth has survived the impact of large asteroids, years of total darkness and several ice ages. It will surely survive man-made global warming, as it has survived catastrophes of even greater magnitude. It has existed for billions of years, and it could surely last for another few billion, even if mankind manages to make it uninhabitable for humans or other life forms. What is at stake right now is not the fate of the planet but the fate of humanity.

Science and Sexual Harassment

Re Why women quit science (Review, March 5): As a scientist and the father of two daughters who hopes that all women interested in STEM will be able to pursue a scientific career, I read the article with great interest. But to my disappointment, its conclusion is flawed.

The central thesis is that science and academia are rife with sexual harassment and that women are quitting their positions mainly to stop being harassed. However, it is well known that sexual harassment exists everywhere, not just in STEM. If the author were correct, women would also be quitting their positions in commerce, law, the arts, sports, manufacturing, teaching, medicine, etc. But thats not the case. The proportion of women in professional occupations has been increasing for decades.

The only way to defend the authors argument would be to demonstrate that in science, in particular, there is either a higher incidence of sexual harassment, or that women scientists are more vulnerable to predatory males than in other professions. I doubt very much that that is so. All people  women as well as men  are equally dependent on the bosss good will, whatever their profession.

Merkels Next Job?

Re Why Angela Merkel could lead the U.N. (Opinion, Feb. 17): The United Nations is passing through an existential crisis, its wings clipped by its largest donors, like the United States and Russia. Unless the organization is freed from its shackles, it will be difficult for any secretary general to function independently.

Its true that Angela Merkel would be an ideal candidate to head the United Nations, considering her contributions to the European Union and her stupendous efforts to address the refugee crisis in the face of strong opposition in Germany. However, her successes are mainly due to the tremendous good will she enjoyed in that country. The question is whether the United Nations will provide a platform for her to make independent decisions, without being unduly influenced by the members of the Security Council, who have maintained a virtual grip on the organization.

THURSDAY PUZZLE  Heres what can happen when your mother eagerly signs you up for music lessons when youre a child and you dont pay attention: You grow up to be a crossword puzzle blogger, responsible for explaining the puzzle to a large number of people, and then you wind up solving  or rather, not solving  a crossword that incorporates music notation theory as part of the theme. Its like one of those stress dreams we all have, but this is for real.

Somewhere in Florida, my mother is laughing her behind off.

This is as good a time as any to admit to you that I had to look at the answers to crack the theme. That is not as bad as it sounds; who amongst us has not revealed an answer here or there? No one, thats who, and that is a good lesson for all you beginning solvers out there. Dont feel that you cant take a peek if you think youll learn something from it. That knowledge is stored away for the next time you will see it in a puzzle. Streaks be damned. [Cleans off the remains of the tomatoes thrown at me.]

Sidenote: I originally thought this puzzle was going to be a commentary about footballs DEFLATEGATE and that the black squares in the lower center of the grid represented goalposts. You see how misdirected you can get on a Thursday?

Anyway, if, unlike me, you did not fall asleep in music theory class, you will recognize that there are supposed to be two musical notes in three of the squares of Andrew Zhous mirror symmetry puzzle. Each note is used once: one note for the Across entry and one note for the Down entry. For example, at 16 Across and 6 Down, we have the respective entries MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY and THE SHARPER IMAGE. Where the two entries cross, we have the two rebus elements: F NATURAL going across and E SHARP going down.

And because you havent had enough agita for the day, all of the notes are different. If you are solving this on the web or in our app, please note that the accepted entries are supposed to be either the entire entry (either Across or Down) or the first letter. So, for 16 Across and 6 Down, the accepted answers should be F NATURAL, F, E SHARP or E.

As a public service, I would like to present you with the six theme entries:

16A/6D: MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY / THE SHARPER IMAGE

65A/53D: LOOKING SHARP / GET A FLAT

66A/55D: DEFLATEGATE / CARD SHARP

In addition, Mr. Zhou has thrown in some long Downs that highlight the theme, MUSICAL NOTE and TWO TONE CARS (sort of). For my money, One added to the staff? also wins Clue of the Day.

Constructors Notes:

A couple of months back, Evan Birnholz espoused his theory that music and crossing words have much to do with one another. Ive always thought that a good crossword works like a piece of Bachian counterpoint, in which both the vertical (harmony) and the horizontal (melody) are required to maintain absolute integrity. In that spirit, todays puzzle puns in the form of ENHARMONIC spellings, wherein the same sounded pitch (in equal temperament) is notated in two different ways. I hope it offers a significant contribution to the canon of musical puns, which includes beloved classics like, If you dont C-sharp, youll B-flat. Heres to a music-filled Thursday!

And that is why I failed to solve todays crossword puzzle, Officer. Please dont tell my mother.

We just have to move on to the Friday puzzle with this song:

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Biden Condemns Palestinian Violence in Implicit Rebuke to Abbas,['Isabel Kershner'],"JERUSALEM  Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.s two-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories was expected to be one of public pleasantries and private talks on regional energy and a new military aid package for Israel. Instead, he stepped into a bloody maelstrom.









In an unusually stinging critique on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said the United States not only deplored the recent wave of Palestinian attacks, including the fatal stabbing attack that killed an American graduate student soon after Mr. Biden landed, but America also condemns the failure to condemn these acts. It appeared to be a veiled reference to the silence of President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, whom Mr. Biden was scheduled to meet hours later.

Mr. Biden made the pointed statement as he stood beside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, one day after a Palestinian man fatally stabbed Taylor Force, 28, an American combat veteran and a first-year M.B.A. student at Vanderbilt University, and wounded several other tourists and Israelis.

Let me say in no uncertain terms: The United States of America condemns these acts and condemns the failure to condemn these acts, Mr. Biden said, adding: This cannot be viewed by civilized leaders as an appropriate way in which to behave.

Mr. Netanyahu said that unfortunately President Abbas has not only refused to condemn these terrorist attacks, his Fatah party actually praised the murderer of this American citizen as a Palestinian martyr and a hero.

Palestinian leaders blame growing popular anger over Israeli policies and the lack of any formal peace process for the violence.

What is happening today is a Palestinian reaction to Israels occupation and the lack of any political horizon, Hanna Amira, a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, told Voice of Palestine radio before Mr. Bidens meeting with Mr. Abbas in the West Bank city of Ramallah.

Mr. Bidens visit came against the backdrop of simmering tensions between the government of Mr. Netanyahu and the White House: Mr. Netanyahu canceled a meeting with President Obama and there are unresolved differences over a new Memorandum of Understanding for military aid for Israel, potentially worth more than $40 billion over 10 years.

The package is viewed as a way to compensate Israel after the United States pressed for the nuclear deal with Iran over Israeli objections. But there are gaps between Washington and Jerusalem over the amount of aid and other issues, and Mr. Netanyahu recently suggested that he might prefer to wait for the next president. Mr. Biden urged the Israelis to sign the memorandum while Mr. Obama was still in office, the Israeli news media reported, citing unidentified Israeli officials.

Israeli experts say that both sides now have an interest in wrapping up the deal as soon as possible, citing American budgetary constraints that are unlikely to change and the volatile situation in the Middle East.

A new administration will take many months until people get settled into their offices, said Zalman Shoval, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, and there is always an element of continuity anyway.

Mr. Biden said that the Obama administration had done more to help bolster Israels security than any other administration in history, and that it was committed to ensuring that Israel can maintain its qualitative edge militarily and will have the resources to do so.

The spike in deadly attacks in recent months, including multiple stabbings Tuesday night along a seaside promenade in Jaffa, where the American graduate student was killed, highlighted the tense environment that exists in the absence any political negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Israelis fear that the lack of diplomacy could push Mr. Obama to lay down the outlines of an agreement for the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel in the final leg of his term without talks.

The status quo has to break somewhere along the line, in terms of a two-state solution, Mr. Biden said in Jerusalem, cautioning that security measures alone would not stop the violence.

Even though it may be hard to see the path ahead, we continue to encourage all sides to take steps to move back toward the path of peace, he added.

Mr. Netanyahu made it clear that he did not think this was the time to advance Palestinian statehood, citing the persistent incitement in Palestinian society that glorifies murderers of innocent people and calls for a Palestinian state not to live in peace with Israel, but to replace Israel.

Palestinian shootings and knife attacks continued on Wednesday. Two Palestinian men in a car fired shots in a Jerusalem suburb, according to the police, then drove to a bustling thoroughfare outside the Old City, where Israeli police officers fatally shot them. A resident of East Jerusalem was also badly wounded. Soon after, a teenage Palestinian assailant tried to stab Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint in the occupied West Bank and was killed at the scene.",[]

Thousands more from around the world tuned in to livestreams and watched as the distant daytime skies darkened.

Those who viewed the event from places like Indonesia or Micronesia saw the moon completely engulf the sun  a moment known as totality  and caught a rare glimpse of the stars roaring corona. They also saw what looked like a diamond ring when light from the sun flickered from behind the moon in the seconds before and after totality.

When the moons shadow swept across the Pacific Ocean, it also created partial eclipses visible from India, Cambodia, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Myanmar and other South and Southeast Asian countries. Here are some images from the spectacle:

Photo

About a week before he used the national political stage to ask viewers to think about Donald Trumps finger size, Marco Rubio told the audience during another recent Republican presidential debate to Google Donald Trump and Polish workers. They did.

The worry is no longer about who controls content. It is about who controls the flow of that content.

Rubio wanted voters to see news stories about Trump illegally hiring undocumented Polish workers more than 35 years ago to demolish a building to make way for Trump Tower. Searches for those terms, and the fraudulent Trump University, shot way up. It was like a public version of the now ubiquitous phenomenon of everyone whipping out smartphones to verify a disputed fact at a party or meeting. Not that it did much good in this case; as numerous commentators have noted, Trump and many of his supporters dont seem particularly worried about minor annoyances like facts. (For the record, PolitiFact, which checks the veracity of politicians statements, judged Rubios charge to be half true.)

Nonetheless, Rubios Google gambit and Trumps (non)reaction to it, reveals an interesting, and troubling, new change in attitude about a philosophical foundation of democracy: the ideal of an informed citizenry.

Political thinkers have long claimed with Jefferson that, An educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free people. The idea is obvious: If citizens are going to make even indirect decisions about policy, we need to know the facts about the problem the policy is meant to rectify, and to be able to gain some understanding about how effective that policy would be. In the larger sense, if we are going to decide who runs the country  and we are, if you think the electoral college allows for that  we need to know the facts about the candidates records.



This is one reason philosophers have always been worried about the ebb and flow of information, and who controls it. Plato argued in The Republic that the fact that democracies couldnt control that flow and point it toward truth was one reason they often dissolved into tyranny. In a different vein, Noam Chomsky argued in the 1980s that consent was being manufactured by Big Media  large consolidated content-delivery companies (like this newspaper) that could cause opinions to sway one way or the other at their whim. Knowledge is power; capture it and you capture power in a democracy.

Now in print The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments An anthology of essays from The Timess philosophy series, published by Liveright.

The political importance of information  and the fear that it can be manipulated  has not changed. What has changed is how we are informed about politics or anything else, or how we arent. The Big Media that worried Chomsky 30 years ago is largely a thing of the past; many of the largest newspapers are gone, and others are shadows of their former selves. In the halcyon early days of the Internet, when we began excitedly exploring the information Garden of Eden, still free of the shadow of social media, it was easy to think that knowledge itself had become democratic, and that Platos worry had at last been shown to be bankrupt. But the worry hasnt gone away  it has just changed form.

The worry is no longer about who controls content. It is about who controls the flow of that content. It is no coincidence that we are now seeing Big Data companies like Facebook sponsor presidential debates. Nor is it a coincidence that people are increasingly following the election on social media, using it both as the source of their information and as the way to get their view out. Consent is still being manufactured, but the manufacturing is being done willingly by us, usually intended for consumption by other people with whom we already agree, facts or no facts.

It really isnt a surprise that Rubio would ask us to Google for certain facts; thats how you and I know almost everything we know nowadays  it is a way of knowing that is so embedded into the very fabric of our lives that we dont even notice it. What else could Rubio ask us to do to fact-check Trump? We used to say that seeing is believing; now Googling is believing.

Of course, in many ways following that norm  Google it!  can help us realize the Jefferson ideal of an informed citizen I sketched above. That ideal, recall, emerges out of the simple fact that reasonable action requires knowledge, and reasonable political action requires political knowledge. And Google places more politically important information at our fingertips than ever before. So if the ideal of being informed means having more information available for uptake, there is a case for saying that we are now closer than ever to realizing that ideal. That is behind the thought, commonly voiced in the early part of this century, that the Internet has democratized knowledge.

The Internet is both the worlds best fact-checker and the worlds best bias confirmer  often at the same time.

The problem of course is that having more information available, even more accurate information, isnt what is required by the ideal. What is required is that people actually know and understand that information, and there are reasons to think we are no closer to an informed citizenry understood in that way than we ever have been. Indeed, we might be further away.

One reason for thinking so is that searching the Internet can get you to information that would back up almost any claim of fact, no matter how unfounded. It is both the worlds best fact-checker and the worlds best bias confirmer  often at the same time. Group polarization on the Internet is a fact of digital life. Liberals friend liberals and share liberal-leaning media stories and opinions with them; conservatives friend conservatives, and do the same.

And the flow of digital information is just as prone to manipulation as its content  even when that flow is directed at an audience larger than our own immediate circle. Take an example: Search for what really happened to the dinosaurs and one of the top results is likely to be from a site called answersingenesis.org  not, I suggest, a good source of information on the T-Rex. But it illustrates how canny use of search engine metrics can be used to push an agenda. No wonder Trump and his followers on Twitter immediately shrugged off Rubios inconvenient truths; there is nothing to fear from information when counterinformation is just as plentiful.

Thats why the real worry here isnt about the regrettable if obvious fact that citizens are less informed than our ideals demand. Nor is it simply the amusing specter of candidates shouting competing Googling instructions at the audience like so many carnival barkers. The real worry concerns our faith in the ideal of an informed citizenry itself. That worry, as I see it, has two faces.

Related More From The Stone Read previous contributions to this series.

First, as Jason Stanley and others have emphasized recently, appeals to ideals can be used to undermine those very ideals. People on both the left and the right tell one another that the information is right there; people just arent paying attention to the facts (Google it!). The very availability of information can make us think that the ideal of the informed citizen is more realized than it is  and that, in turn, can actually undermine the ideal, making us less informed, simply because we think we know all we need to know already.

Second, the danger is that increasing recognition of the fact that Googling can get you wherever you want to go can make us deeply cynical about the ideal of an informed citizenry  for the simple reason that what counts as an informed citizen is a matter of dispute. We no longer disagree just over values. Nor do we disagree just over the facts. We disagree over whose source  whose fountain of facts  is the right one.

And once disagreement reaches that far down, the daylight of reason seems very far away indeed.

nytimes.com,2011-06-26 00:00:00,Monday: Celebrity Guest Solver Joel Stein,"['Joseph Samulak', 'Deb Amlen']","Administrivial Disappearing Comments Update: My apologies for the disappearing comments. Ive found them, and wouldnt you know, theyre always in the last place you look. A new system had been put in place and it was sending some of the comments on walkabout. After an epic battle, in which I wielded both power tools and my magic bullet-proof bracelets, that system has been shut down, so we should be back to normal. Thank you for your patience.

MONDAYS PUZZLE  When I started the regular Celebrity Guest Solver feature here at Wordplay, my intent was twofold: I simply wanted to bring something special to the blog, but I also wanted to show people who are afraid to tackle The New York Times crossword that even people of note can have trouble with it, yet with enough support, encouragement and a certain amount of threatened public humiliation, they, too, could work the puzzle. And without fail, they have all come through brilliantly for me. No one will ever accuse these people of not having a rocking sense of self-preservation.

That is also mostly the case with todays Celebrity Guest Solver, TIME magazine contributor Joel Stein. When I first approached him, Mr. Stein seemed a bit nervous about being able to do the puzzle, as he isnt a regular solver. I do find it interesting, though, that he jumped on the chance to be a guest blogger, and I dont even think its because the man is habitually desperate for attention and owes me money. No, I would like to cling to the belief that he, like much of humanity, appreciates the challenge of climbing new mountains and that pushing the limits of what we can do is what separates us from the other species. Plus, its an easy way to pay off a debt.

Even so, Mr. Stein is one funny attention-mongerer. Not only did he supposedly survive being fired twice in one day by Martha Stewart at the beginning of his career (or so people used to say; now he claims they made that up and that the woman is far too busy canning jelly to fire someone more than once), but he has also graced VH1s I Love Whatever Decade You Tell Me I Love. In the midst of all this, he still finds time to write some pretty hilarious stuff and he would also like me to mention that he once taught a humor-writing class at Princeton. Yes, the University.

Todays puzzle is a debut by Joseph Samulak, and hopefully you wont be dizzied by it: the circled letters not only mix it up, but they also appear to go around like the wheel on a cassette tape, dont they? In fact, thats exactly what Mr. Samulak has intended, and he reveals that at 37 Across with the entry MIX TAPE. Not only that, but the four entries that contain the circled letters are all new entries. Well done, Mr. Samulak.

You can read more about Mr. Stein at his Web site, but before we run out of space, I will turn it over to him:

Joel Steins Solving Notes

I did not expect this rush of power. When I agreed to attempt to solve this puzzle, I had no idea I would be getting it early. Embargoed. Not for publication. I had something all the New York Times puzzle-solvers wanted: A puzzle days before it came out.

I get to see screenings of movies weeks early and get sent books months before their publication date. But this was better. This was something I could use to taunt my friends who do the N.Y.T. crossword puzzle.

My friends who do the N.Y.T. crossword puzzle are horrible people. (No theyre not; hes just bitter because he didnt finish the puzzle.  D.A.) They are people who like to think and be challenged and spend their free time improving themselves instead of watching TV, searching for porn and checking how many friends they have on Facebook. They are superior people. And now they would suffer.

My friend Matt Selman once met a postdoc English student who, when Matt told him he writes for The Simpsons, instantly said he didnt watch TV. When Matt asked what he worked on, and the guy said he just wrote a book about Thomas Pynchon, Matt got to say, I talked to him on the phone today, since hed just recorded Pynchon for the show. (Full story here: http://techland.time.com/2009/09/08/true-tales-of-conversational-vengeance/).

Thats how I felt e-mailing the embargoed crossword puzzle to all of my horrible friends. I was saying, I write a juvenile sophomoric column, largely about my penis, and, for this, I got the N.Y.T. crossword puzzle before you.

Heres what I didnt figure:

People who do the N.Y.T. crossword puzzle are not status-desperate like me. They get their satisfaction from being intellectually superior. So instead of being impressed, my high school friend Art Chung smugly e-mailed me less than ten minutes after I sent it to him and said, Done. 7 Across is something we used to do in high school. My smug friend John Sellers simply said, Mondays are too easy. My mother-in-law, Hope Barry, smugly said, Do you need help???? You know Im there for you. Worse yet, Dan Okrent  who is in that smug movie about crossword puzzles that I refuse to see  sent me back a smug form e-mail saying he wasnt checking his inbox because he was at some smart people place like Marthas Vineyard or Davos or the Constitutional Convention.

I have not finished the puzzle. I dont know who Robin Hoods compadre is, who the tiger in The Jungle Book is or the five-letter word that means Brilliance that probably starts with an EC and ends with AT. And Im not asking any of those people who e-mailed me. Thats what they want. And Im well aware that all the stuff I dont know is from books meant for children. I get it. I dont need Jeff Foxworthy to point it out.

It took me 30 minutes to not finish this puzzle. All I learned is that oxen wear YOKEs and that people in New York put sour cream on their TACOS, which is disgusting.

I dont know why some NFL linemen are RGS or what that means. I dont know why the letters T A P and E are in circles. Im guessing the puzzle-writer is trapped somewhere and is trying to send me a secret message about his location. Which I dont care about. Hes probably smugger than Okrent.

O.K., theyve all come through brilliantly for me except for Joel Stein. Thanks for playing anyway, dude. And you still owe me.

nytimes.com,2015-04-05 00:00:00,"The Sympathizer, by Viet Thanh Nguyen",['Philip Caputo'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The more powerful a country is, the more disposed its people will be to see it as the lead actor in the sometimes farcical, often tragic pageant of history. So it is that we, citizens of a superpower, have viewed the Vietnam War as a solely American drama in which the febrile land of tigers and elephants was mere backdrop and the Vietnamese mere extras.









That outlook is reflected in the literature  and Vietnam was a very literary war, producing an immense library of fiction and nonfiction. Among all those volumes, youll find only a handful (Robert Olen Butlers A Good Scent From a Strange Mountain comes to mind) with Vietnamese characters speaking in their own voices.

Hollywood has been still more Americentric. In films like Apocalypse Now and Platoon, the Vietnamese (often other Asians portraying Vietnamese) are never more than walk-ons whose principal roles seem to be to die or wail in the ashes of incinerated villages.

Which brings me to Viet Thanh Nguyens remarkable debut novel, The Sympathizer. Nguyen, born in Vietnam but raised in the United States, brings a distinct perspective to the war and its aftermath. His book fills a void in the literature, giving voice to the previously voiceless while it compels the rest of us to look at the events of 40 years ago in a new light.

But this tragicomic novel reaches beyond its historical context to illuminate more universal themes: the eternal misconceptions and misunderstandings between East and West, and the moral dilemma faced by people forced to choose not between right and wrong, but right and right. The nameless protagonist-narrator, a memorable character despite his anonymity, is an Americanized Vietnamese with a divided heart and mind. Nguyens skill in portraying this sort of ambivalent personality compares favorably with masters like Conrad, Greene and le Carre.

Duality is literally in the protagonists blood, for he is a half-caste, the illegitimate son of a teenage Vietnamese mother (whom he loves) and a French Catholic priest (whom he hates). Widening the split in his nature, he was educated in the United States, where he learned to speak English without an accent and developed another love-hate relationship, this one with the country that he feels has coined too many super terms (supermarkets, superhighways, the Super Bowl, and so on) from the federal bank of its narcissism.

The narrators acrobatic ability to balance between two worlds is his strength and weakness, as he makes clear in his opening lines:

I am a spy, a sleeper, a spook, a man of two faces. Perhaps not surprisingly, I am also a man of two minds, . . . able to see any issue from both sides. Sometimes I flatter myself that this is a talent, he continues, but I wonder if what I have should even be called talent. After all, a talent is something you use, not something that uses you. The talent you cannot not use, the talent that possesses you  that is a hazard.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

And a hazard it proves to be.

The protagonists narrative, which takes the form of a confession written to a mystery man known as the commandant, begins in the final days of the war, as Communist forces close in on Saigon. The narrator is aide-de-camp to the general (one of several characters who, like the narrator, is never identified by name), the chief of South Vietnams National Police and, with it, of Special Branch, the secret police.

But the narrator is also a mole, a Communist undercover agent assigned to keep tabs on the general and Special Branchs activities. His closest friend is Bon, an assassin with the C.I.A.s Phoenix program, a genuine patriot who volunteered to fight after Communists murdered his father for the crime of being a village chief. The narrators North Vietnamese handler, Man, is also an old chum. Indeed, the narrator, Bon and Man were high school classmates, who in their youth melodramatically swore allegiance to one another by becoming blood brothers. This complex relationship, with the narrator in the tenuous middle, riven by conflicting loyalties, is a recipe for tragic betrayals, and those come, one after the other.

Working through a C.I.A. spook named Claude, the narrator dispenses liberal bribes to engineer an air evacuation to the United States for the general, the generals wife and their huge extended family. Bon is also to be lifted out with his wife and child. The narrator wants to stay and take his place in a reunified Vietnam, but Man, convinced that the general and his cohort will plot a counterrevolution from abroad, gives him a new mission that is an extension of his old one: Your general isnt the only one planning to keep on fighting, he explains. The wars been going on too long for them to simply stop. We need someone to keep an eye on them.

Nguyen presents a gripping picture of the fall of Saigon, its confusion, chaos and terror, as the narrator flees with the others under a storm of shellfire from his Viet Cong and North Vietnamese comrades. Bons wife and child are killed before their plane takes off, giving him two more deaths to avenge.

This rich narrative stew is assembled in the novels first 50 pages, then set on a low simmer. From that brief, intense beginning we proceed to a picaresque account of the narrators experiences as a refugee-cum-spy in Los Angeles. He lands a clerical job with his former professor, has an affair with an older Japanese-American woman and sends messages to Man (written in invisible ink) via an intermediary in Paris. Here the novel becomes both thriller and social satire. If you like your humor written in charcoal, this is the funniest part of the book, though its occasionally spoiled by zingers that belong on The Daily Show more than they do in a serious novel.

The narrators espionage activities lead him to make a foray into the movie business. He is hired by a director, the auteur (who bears a resemblance to Francis Ford Coppola), to round up Vietnamese in a Philippine refugee camp to work as extras in his film (which bears a resemblance to Apocalypse Now). Nguyen adroitly handles the shifting tones of these episodes, now hilarious, now sad, as the narrator tries to do what Nguyen has done: de-Americanize the portrayal of the war. But, unlike Nguyen, he fails.

Thereafter, the books mood darkens. The narrator falls into a web of deceit and treachery spun by his dual role and the schisms in his soul. Mans suspicions prove accurate: The general and some other die-hards, guilt-ridden for not fighting to the death, bored with their mediocre lives in the States (the general has become owner of a liquor store), plot a counterrevolutionary invasion with the help of a right-wing congressman.

The narrator assists in the planning, while sending reports to Man. However, to avoid having his cover blown, he is compelled to take part in two assassinations. One victim is an ex-Special Branch officer, the crapulent major, the other is a Vietnamese journalist at a California newspaper. The descriptions of the murders are tense, psychologically complex, riveting. The narrators conscience becomes as torn as the rest of him. Remorse over the crapulent majors death was ringing me up a few times a day, tenacious as a debt collector, he thinks.

(A parenthetical quibble. Good as it is, The Sympathizer is sometimes marred by overwriting. Lines like this  The waiters arrived at that moment with the solemnity of Egyptian servants ready to be buried alive with their pharaoh, platters with the main courses propped on their shoulders  appear a bit too often.)

The general eventually assembles a ragtag army of former South Vietnamese soldiers, armed and funded by the Americans. Man, kept abreast of the scheme, orders the narrator to remain in the States even as this army heads back to Asia, but he is once again rent by divided loyalties. He feels he must go to save Bon, his blood brother, from dying in what hes sure will be a suicide mission. He finds himself caught in his familiar dilemma, with no idea how I would manage to betray Bon and save him at the same time.

The blood of friendship is thicker than the water of ideology. The narrator joins the generals army. What happens to it is predictable; what happens to the narrator and Bon is anything but. I dont want to give anything away, except to say that in its final chapters, The Sympathizer becomes an absurdist tour de force that might have been written by a Kafka or Genet.

As that narrative unfolds, the protagonist makes several startling discoveries, among which is the identity of the commandants own boss, the commissar. Under interrogation, the narrator goes temporarily insane; but in his madness he achieves a new mental clarity. He sees that the revolution for which hes sacrificed so much has betrayed him and everyone who fought for it  as revolutions are prone to do.

Even the people who call the shots must admit that the fruits of victory are rotten, and the narrator in turn must recognize this joke, about how a revolution fought for independence and freedom could make those things worth less than nothing.

But that revelation produces an insight that saves him from complete despair: Despite it all  yes, despite everything, in the face of nothing, he writes at the end of the confession that is this book, we still consider ourselves revolutionary. We remain that most hopeful of creatures, a revolutionary in search of a revolution, although we will not dispute being called a dreamer doped by an illusion. . . . We cannot be alone! Thousands more must be staring into darkness like us, gripped by scandalous thoughts, extravagant hopes and forbidden plots. We lie in wait for the right moment and the just cause, which, at this moment, is simply wanting to live.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,A Brief Visit With My Inner Diesel,['Jon Caramanica'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In the back of the new Diesel flagship on Madison Avenue, near the jeans bar, which breaks down the companys offerings into various cuts (Slim? Sure. Tapered? Fine. Carrot? Ummmmmm.), there is a small museumlike display paying homage to the brands long-running wrestling match with denim.









Here are clothes from the 1980s and 1990s, ones in which the fabric is manipulated, distressed, cut up, accessorized, pushed to its emotional breaking point (if denim had a heart). You look down from these pieces, encased in glass on the wall, to the Diesel jeans of today and find that the war on denim is very much alive.

In fairness, we are in an era of distressed jeans, when the average pair has sacrificed 20 to 40 percent of its front material, leaving a topographic map of cutouts and frayed edges. In the space of the last decade, we have gone from utilitarian denim to premium denim to art denim.

Or at Diesel, all of these things at once, together, and manque.

In the 1990s, Diesels Lexington Avenue location was an amusement park of European slickness, moto kitsch and soft fashion aspiration. The brand offered a starter kit for those ready to graduate from streetwear or, you know, regular clothes, but not ready to submit to adulthood. Babys first tight-cut shirt almost certainly came from Diesel. Same for babys first treated denim.

Photo

Back then, Diesel made clothing for wayward foreign exchange students spending their parents money on bottle service and foam parties. Now, though, Nicola Formichetti is in charge. He has been the brands artistic director since 2013. By all accounts, he has a sense of humor, of color, of freedom.

And yet Diesel remains irreparably Diesel. I made my way there one recent afternoon, a field trip into the heart of gaucheness. If there was ever a right day to wear my black En Noir x Gap hooded jacket made of waxed denim and leather, this was it.

What I found was a Madison Avenue store with West Eighth Street soul. The brand remains committed to its middle station, with selections that feel like shrugged-off takes on whats happening farther up Madison: a Chelsea boot with a vertical zipper right through the elastic pulls ($290); a not-wholly-unappealing ivory patchwork sweater described on the label as being made with Italian Yarn ($198); a perforated black leather jacket with a loud sweatshirt-ish lining ($698); some sort of studded dog tag ($105).

The eyebrow arching extended even to the Diesel Black Gold collection, the companys premium line, which included a 13-pound heavily studded motorcycle jacket ($6,750) suitable for, perhaps, Flo Rida or John Cena or some other musclebound entertainer who needs to telegraph the most fashionable menace possible.

Back at the jeans bar, things were much the same. Our grandchildren will taunt us as the generation that allowed our jeans and our sweatpants to become one: Was everyone that lazy, Grandpa?

No, we werent. I tried on a couple of pairs to remind myself of my belief system, like a Bernie bro watching a few minutes of Fox News. The beige pair  $278!  made my unstubby legs look stubby indeed. The gray pair had biker-pants accents and hospital-scrubs fit.

But things got more complicated with the more familiar denim (the companys coin-pocket label is so familiar, it even adorns iPhone and iPad cases). It turns out the carrot pair fit beautifully; a pair in a dark, chalky gray ($198) was eminently appropriate.

And then I tried on one of the more molested pairs, with abrasions all over and black denim patches sewn into blue denim gaps. I looked ... good? The same went for a gray leather jacket in a finish that recalled acid-washed denim ($998) that I selected off the rack for its humor value and found myself unexpectedly attracted to.

Photo

All of us, we know there is a slightly tacky version of ourselves lurking within, an identity that a few wise turns in life have prevented us from having to own. Call it your inner Diesel: not a place I could live, but I didnt mind visiting.

Besides, sometimes that inner voice delivers surprise.

Years and years of experience fiddling with denim means youre likely to stumble upon new tricks before anyone else. There, in the front of the store, as part of the Diesel Black Gold collection, was such an item: a pair of preposterously long jeans, designed to scrunch and gather not just around the ankle, but up the full length of the leg ($450).

One of the mannequins wore a black pair. The legs looked like stacks of thin cookies. I felt compelled to try on a pair.

They were difficult to maneuver, both a logistical nightmare and almost an avant-garde disruption. They made Vetements sail-size clothes look eminently reasonable. They were so skeptical about form that they verged on Kawakubo territory.

They suggested expertise, and whimsy, and confidence  the product of a crafty veteran who has tried everything else, and then tears up the old playbook and tries to write a new one.",[]
nytimes.com,2015-04-10 00:00:00,"Lena Hall Rocks Out at, Yes, the Reserved Cafe Carlyle",['Stephen Holden'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Early in her Cafe Carlyle show on Wednesday evening, Lena Hall produced a tambourine and remarked that she might be the first performer to shake such an instrument in this staid cabaret, which until recently had avoided booking rock performers. But appearances there by Debbie Harry and Buster Poindexter, who have done good business, have signaled that the walls are crumbling.

Ms. Hall, who won a Tony in 2014 for her portrayal of Yitzhak in the Broadway revival of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, is an all-out rocker in the Robert Plant vocal tradition with strong echoes of Hearts Ann Wilson. Paradoxically she exhibited the discipline of a Broadway performer who doesnt miss a note. Despite the feral cries that came out of her, at no point in her show did you feel that she was pushing the boundaries and surrendering control. The personality behind the wild woman pose was polite but warm.

Therein lies the contradiction of rocking out in New Yorks most elegant supper club. As uninhibited as a performer pretends to be, the gracious environment in which well-dressed patrons play kissy-kissy serves as a behavioral brake. Her excellent band, led by Watt White on guitar and featuring John Deley on keyboards, Lee Nadel on bass and Brian Fishler on drums, played music that was impeccably arranged but scaled down.

Eardrums would not be shattered. There was not the remotest possibility of clothes being shed and tables overturned.

The far-reaching program concentrated on songs associated with the likes of Jack White, Led Zeppelin, Tori Amos, Talking Heads, Queen, Nirvana, Elton John, David Bowie, Paul McCartney, Hozier and Erykah Badu. For the quietest selection, the Blind Faith ballad Cant Find My Way Home, Ms. Hall peeled off the rough vocal edges to adopt a sweeter sound, but the plaintive wail of Steve Winwoods original vocal was absent. For all her attitude, Ms. Hall conveyed little strong emotion beyond a desire to demonstrate an impressive vocal expertise.",[]

When I moved to Brooklyn in 1999, Id never heard of Greenpoint  a working-class Polish community out past Williamsburg with questionable subway access  before the apartment broker sold me on it. My landlords lived upstairs, among clear vinyl tablecloths and a shrine to Pope John Paul II. I ate bigos, a savory, tart stew cooked so long that its many meats fell to nearly spreadable shreds, and incredibly cheap pirogi in fluorescent restaurants, where I would laugh in amazement at how much pork and potatoes five bucks could get you. I walked around my new neighborhood, looking into shops filled with sacks and sacks of rye bread and hundreds of sausages dangling in the windows, wondering how long it would take me to learn all their names.









I wanted to be a part of the community, to integrate, but I never became anything more than an interloper. The cold looks I sometimes got on the street confused and bothered me, until I realized that I wasnt just a new neighbor, that by paying more in rent than the families around me, Id made living in Greenpoint just that much more expensive for them. I realized those fluorescent dining rooms were populated mostly by single men, men whod left their families back in Poland while they tried to make some money in America. I realized that, when I was amused by those massive plates of food, Id never really thought about how hungry Id be if I spent the day building furniture, or moving it, as many of them did. By the time I moved away a couple of years later, I hadnt learned the names of any of the sausages.

So I was glad, a few weeks ago, when Monika Woods showed me how sweet her life in the old neighborhood had been. Woods also landed in Greenpoint when she first arrived in New York City, about half a dozen years after I left. With her stylish, oversize glasses, she might also be taken for an outsider. But she moved to the neighborhood because she was born in Poland and missed hearing strangers talk to one another in Polish; because the first restaurant she went to used the same plates her grandmother kept in Poland.

Woods agreed to show me how to make her moms bigos, and we ambled to her favorite meat market. Walking the main drag of Manhattan Avenue, she pointed out the places that always transported her back to Poland: an entire shop devoted to her favorite brands of Polish candy; a storefront completely obscured by its selection of Polish bottled waters; a store that carried Polish beers that are hard to find even in Warsaw. She pointed to a liquor store that once featured live bunnies and chicks in an adorable Easter window display. Shed come back a few weeks later and asked what happened to them. To eat, she remembers the owner saying, with Old World matter-of-factness.

But her Greenpoint is changing, in the way I think my old neighbors feared. The candy shop now sits empty, for rent. The restaurant that had her grandmothers plates closed; next door is a new location of an Anthony Bourdain-approved Chinese noodle shop. When we walked by a hip new restaurant, the kind whose dishes feature swooshes of purees and swipes of sauce, we noticed an odd postscript on the menu: Owned and operated by residents of Greenpoint.

The story of gentrifying communities is always about the dynamic between the new and the old, the outsiders and the insiders, but that friction is palpable when you feel as if you need to stake your claim to the neighborhood on your restaurants menu. Its funny, Monika said. I moved away a few years ago, but now, when I come back with my baby and go to a cool coffee shop, the people look at me like: Great. Here come the stroller people. There goes the neighborhood. 

Inside the Polam International Meat Market, though, you could easily be convinced that nothing had changed on these blocks for decades, and that nothing should. There were curtains of smoked sausages, tray upon tray of unidentified cured, smoked, roasted, poached, emulsified, rolled, cased, cubed, caul-fatted meats. Its a museum of meats, and just 20 minutes inside the store will leave your clothes smelling of salt and smoke for hours. That old pang of wanting to know what all this stuff was hit me, and when the kindly counterwoman offered to slice some chicken-and-parsley sausage for me, I thought it might not be too late to start finding out.

We bought ribs and wonderfully smoky kielbasa, and, back in my kitchen, Woods showed me her mothers method for a bigos that marries butter-soft cabbage with the tense pop of sausage in its skin. Hours later, I supped on silky broth rich with fat and gelatin, kept lively by tart sauerkraut and the sweet, almost floral taste of caraway. What should have served eight was just enough for my brother and me. Woods didnt have any, though  it turns out that she doesnt eat meat. But she wanted to show me what a proper bigos is like, from the inside.

You go to Indiana, its hard to imagine you wont run across a basketball court. Theyre like Starbucks there, only it may be easier to get a seat at Starbucks.

Indiana is known as a place where basketball is sort of like the sport, said Michael E. Keating, a photographer. Its kind of like the religion. If basketballs a religion, then the gymnasiums  theyre the places where people worship. Theyre the churches, the temples.

For the past several years, Mr. Keating and his colleague Chris Smith have crisscrossed the state, traveling more than 10,000 miles and photographing more than 100 school gymnasiums. There is no lack of choices. People in Indiana, as anyone who saw the 1986 movie Hoosiers knows, view basketball the way Southerners view football. Texas can keep its Friday night lights. Nine of the countrys 10 biggest high school gyms, the photographers say, are in Indiana.

They both say the appeal is not really the basketball. Were there for everything that surrounds the game, Mr. Keating said.

Mr. Smith said, We like to have people in the gyms. But for the photographers, its fine if it is just a practice or even a graduation. When there was some kind of activity, he said, the gyms kind of came to life.

Photo

The project began when Mr. Smith ran across a hand-tinted photograph of his father in an old team photograph and wanted to learn more. A longtime commercial photographer who also teaches photography to college students, he reached out to Mr. Keating, who had retired from The Cincinnati Enquirer after decades as a general assignment photographer. Both men are 63.

Their backgrounds are reflected in their approach to their work. Mr. Keating, Mr. Smith said, is drawn to emotion, while he tends to try to capture something a little less fleeting. Each has learned from the other.

I envy how he sees, Mr. Keating said. Because my whole training, my whole emphasis for so long was on a moment.

Getting good shots can be challenging, in part because the light in gyms is not always cooperative, Mr. Smith said. And lets face it: Not every church is Chartres, and not every gym is inspiring.

Some gyms, Mr. Keating said, choosing his words with a diplomats care, just are not interesting.

But for these two photographers, a dull gym is the exception.

Donald Trump seemingly had a tough week. He faced an onslaught of attacks from his competitors, Mitt Romney and outside groups. He suffered an upset loss in Maine and nearly lost Louisiana and Kentucky, two states where he was expected to fare well. Polls showed him slipping nationally.









But the results on Tuesday suggest that Mr. Trump remains in a strong position, at least as long as the field remains divided. He carried Michigan and Mississippi by healthy margins and later won in Hawaii.

His opposition did not become as strong as he might have feared after Ted Cruzs performance on Saturday, either.

The results look a lot more like the race we had on Super Tuesday: a double-digit advantage for Mr. Trump, who holds an edge in a three-way race, rather than the close race suggested by new national polls.

Trump Holds

After a barrage of attacks, tight races last weekend and weak national polls on Tuesday, Mr. Trump faced a question: Was he fading?

His strong finish Tuesday night was a clear answer: No.

Photo

In Michigan he currently holds 37 percent of the vote, neatly in line with the 36 percent of the vote we estimated he would receive based on the results on Super Tuesday.

Mr. Trump has 47 percent of the vote in Mississippi, well above the 42 percent we had estimated. (One caveat: Theres reason to think 42 percent was a low estimate. Other models based on Super Tuesday results suggested Mr. Trump should have received around 45 percent of the vote.)

We had him at 26 percent in Idaho, and he wound up with 28 percent. He won the Hawaii caucus with 46 percent of the vote with 60 percent of the precincts reporting.

These figures are consistent with Mr. Trump holding around 38 percent of the vote nationwide, with a comfortable lead over Mr. Cruz. It looks nothing like the much-discussed NBC/WSJ poll Tuesday, which showed Mr. Trump leading by just three points with 30 percent of the vote.

Kasich and Cruz Gain, at Rubios Expense

Marco Rubio cleared 18 percent of the vote in every primary state on Super Tuesday.

He hasnt reached that number since.

With virtually no one noticing, his support seemed to collapse ahead of the contests on Saturday, and Tuesdays races confirmed it.

Mr. Rubio won just 5 percent of the vote in Mississippi and 9 percent in Michigan  his two worst showings in a primary this cycle. Its even worse than his result in New Hampshire, right after a terrible debate performance and in a much larger field.

Both John Kasich and Mr. Cruz benefited  but who benefited most depended on the location. They appear to be divvying up the Rubio vote by ideology and region, with Mr. Cruz consolidating conservative voters in the South and Mr. Kasich gaining among more moderate voters in the North.

The result was that Mr. Cruz fared quite a bit better in Mississippi  along with Louisiana on Saturday  than he did in neighboring Alabama on Super Tuesday. He also won the Idaho primary later Tuesday night.

But Mr. Cruz did not make nearly as many gains in Michigan. There it was Mr. Kasich who benefited most from Mr. Rubios voters, who are presumably more moderate than they are in the South. Mr. Kasich wound up in a tough fight for second place.

It sets Mr. Kasich up to fare well in his home state of Ohio next week, where polls show a tight race.

The Challenge for Anyone but Trump

The results since Super Tuesday suggest that Mr. Trump holds around 38 percent of the vote nationally, a number that could allow him to amass a majority of delegates in a three-way race.

But they also suggest that he really does have a ceiling: His support hasnt increased, even as other candidates have left the race or faltered. The polls say the same thing.

The collapse of Mr. Rubio makes it even harder to imagine that hell manage to squeak out a win in his home state, Florida, where polls have consistently shown Mr. Trump with a lead.

Mr. Kasich might win Ohio, but even if he does, Mr. Trump could amass a majority of delegates without it. Mr. Trump could conceivably benefit if Mr. Kasich stayed in the race, by preventing Mr. Cruz from consolidating the anyone but Trump vote.

Even if Mr. Kasich loses Ohio, he might still stay in the race. His strength in blue states suggests he could be a more formidable challenger to Mr. Trump in many of the states that remain than Mr. Cruz, who has struggled to compete outside the South and conservative caucuses. It also seems unlikely that Mr. Kasich would leave the race if Mr. Rubio did, since there would be a large opening among well-educated, relatively moderate Republican voters.

But even the exit of Mr. Rubio would not necessarily be enough for Mr. Kasich to overtake Mr. Trump in the relatively blue states that remain. For instance, Mr. Kasich and Mr. Rubio did not combine to win as many votes as Mr. Trump did in Michigan.

The results, in other words, point toward a three-way race in which Mr. Trump might still have a narrow edge.",[]

Terence Blanchards jazz-inflected opera, Champion, based on the true story of a boxer who threw a fatal punch after being taunted about his sexuality by a rival, and Jake Heggies Dead Man Walking, based on Sister Helen Prejeans memoir about working on death row, will be staged next season at Washington National Opera, the company announced Tuesday.

Its season will begin Sept. 22 with James Gaffigan, the chief conductor of the Lucerne Symphony Orchestra, making his company debut leading a production of Mozarts The Marriage of Figaro. The bel canto tenor Lawrence Brownlee will star in Donizettis The Daughter of the Regiment, Ermonela Jaho and Hei-Kyung Hong will alternate in the title role of Puccinis Madame Butterfly and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the Supreme Court will join the companys artistic director, Francesca Zambello, for an evening exploring justice at the opera.

The Kennedy Centers season will also feature the Mariinsky Ballet dancing Alexei Ratmanskys The Little Humpbacked Horse, San Francisco Ballet performing Christopher Wheeldons Cinderella, visits by New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theater and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and two evenings programmed by Justin Peck and Misty Copeland.

In Noah Baumbachs recent movie, While Were Young, Josh and Cornelia, aging Generation X Brooklynites (played by Ben Stiller and Naomi Watts) who are desperately trying to reclaim their youth, are struck by what passes for home decor in the Bushwick loft of their new, painfully on-trend young friends Jamie and Darby (Adam Driver and Amanda Seyfried).









Along with the familiar hipster household cliches (the electric typewriter, the wall of vinyl records), the young couple proudly displays a Reagan-era library of movies on VHS tapes, along with a shelf of music cassettes.

Its like their apartment is full of everything we once threw out, Cornelia says with an air of wonder.

The tech detritus of the 1980s and 90s is finding a second life as a new generation of artists, designers and geek-nostalgists is repurposing the early-digital-era flotsam of its youth as art, home decor and jewelry, along with plenty of irony-laced kitsch.

Think of it as the next evolution of retro-chic style. Self-conscious analog style may have owned the last decade, at least among tastemakers in shuttle-loomed denim with their vintage phonograph players, typewriters and mechanical watches.

Photo

But as the children weaned on Nintendo and Napster mature to the point that they suffer occasional fits of cultural nostalgia, the disposable plastic junk of their youth may finally be ready to have its due.

Were just to the point where we can look back at the VHS tape and realize how cool it was, said Erika Iris Simmons, a 31-year-old Chicago artist who works under the name Iri5, fashioning portraits of luminaries like Jimi Hendrix and Marilyn Monroe not with a brush, but with swirls of tape from old audio and VHS cassettes.

To Ms. Simmons, cassette tape recalls a more physical, tactile association that children of the 80s and 90s once had with their gadgets; she remembers knowing how to blow into her Nintendo game cartridge just so, to get it working when it would not load. We all have that shared experience of interacting with the technology that you dont get to know with MP3s, she said.

In a similar vein, Chris McCullough, 40, a Los Angeles architectural designer who creates art for his spaces, renders portraits of cultural icons like James Brown using audiocassettes like mosaic tiles. Not only are discarded cassettes inexpensive and abundant, he said, but they resonate with audiences his age.

Cassettes represented the first popular portable music medium you could share and personalize yourself, Mr. McCullough said, before services like Spotify made music ever disposable.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

(While cassette tapes are technically analog, they reached their cultural zenith in the early digital era of the 80s, just as PCs were entering the mainstream.)

Old Nintendo peripherals themselves can also function as art, or at least eye-catching home decor. Jeff Farber of Oshkosh, Wis., sells pop-art-style desk and floor lamps fashioned from vintage PlayStations and Nintendo 64s and the like on his Etsy shop Woody6Switch, which are intended to celebrate an era when gadgets, even cheap plastic ones, had a certain staying power.

When I was a kid, technology advanced much more slowly than it does today, Mr. Farber, 36, said. Like a beloved pet, you took care of it and it gave you joy and entertainment for many, many years.

By contrast, he added, todays technology advances and upgrades are so fast that a device you buy today can become virtually obsolete in a matter of months, so there is no real time to fall in love with it the way you could in those golden years of video game infancy.

There is certainly no shortage of the stuff. As the life cycle of the average electronic gadget shrinks to a virtual eye blink, the mountains of electronic trash continue to rise, expected to surpass 70 million metric tons this year, from about 19 million in 1990, according to a 2014 report by Step, a United Nations-affiliated sustainability initiative. Except in unusual cases  like the story last month about a Bay Area woman dumping a rare Apple I computer from the 1970s worth $200,000, apparently by accident, at a recycling facility in Milpitas, Calif.  few look at that trash heap and see treasure.

But that has started to change. While some regard the so-called upcycling of old gadgets into picture frames or planters as an ecological gesture, others see it as a celebration of shared technological heritage.

Jake Harms, 31, who lives in Hildreth, Neb., started a business recycling old iMacs into aquariums and desk lamps in 2007 after a boss directed him to toss an outmoded iMac G3.

The candy-colored, egg-shaped desktop computer, introduced in 1998 as one of Steve Jobss first iconic pieces during Apples late-90s comeback, seemed too lovely to toss, Mr. Harms reasoned. So after some online research, he decided to turn it into a computer fish tank (a longstanding hobby for some techies), and has since sold more than 1,000, he said.

To Mr. Harms, the iMac is functional art, like a classic car. And just as a 1960s Ford Mustang may not make an ideal daily drive but is great for a weekend cruises, an old computer may not run current software, but make some modifications and it makes a pretty sweet aquarium or lamp, he said.

Apple products created early in the reign of Jonathan Ive, the companys design guru since 1996, are a natural for reuse as household objects since many were hailed as classics from the outset. For example, Lonnie Mimms, a Georgia real estate executive who owns a collection of vintage computers he values at more than $1 million, recently staged an Apple Pop Up Museum in a former CompUSA store near Atlanta.

Other die-hards have fashioned discarded eMacs into pet beds, G4 towers into mailboxes, G5 towers into outdoor benches and G4 Cube computers into tissue boxes.

The customer base for these upcycled products tends to be narrow and self-selective.

Theyre geeks, theyre nerds, said Rob Connolly, a retired Floridian who, with his partner, Rita Balcom, makes intricate wall clocks and desk clocks out of old hard drives and motherboards. A few years ago, for example, their company, Tecoart, which sells on Etsy and Amazon, filled an order for 2,400 such pieces from Google, which passed them out as employee incentive awards, he said.

Not surprisingly, these techie hobbyists share their passion in online communities. One of the more popular forums is a D.I.Y. tech blog run by Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories, a family company in Sunnyvale, Calif., that produces open-source hardware. The site features tutorials on making earrings out of linear regulator chips, wine charms from capacitors and a wooden footstool in the shape of a classic 555 integrated circuit chip from the 70s.

Most of us are deep in the maker communities, said Lenore Edman, a founder, so these items are symbols of both our history and our knowledge.

Repurposed tech peripherals are also finding a higher-brow, arty audience.

Retro ironists who wish to express their tech nostalgia may consider the Pixelkabinett 42, a sleek handmade reinterpretation of the classic 80s arcade game cabinet by the Swedish artist Love Hulten. The limited-edition console contains a vintage computer board and costs about $4,200.

I want to push gaming into a new context, making the arcade cabinet an artistic equivalent to the painting on your wall, Mr. Hulten, 31, said.

Video games from the Fast Times at Ridgemont High era can also be found at major museums. Starting July 10, the Brooklyn Museum will present Deluxx Fluxx Arcade, an electric Kool-Aid urban-art reinterpretation of a Missile Command-period video arcade by Faile, a Brooklyn-based art duo formed by Patrick McNeil and Patrick Miller, and Bast, another New York artist.

This latest iteration of the installation, which has also been shown in London and Miami, is part of a larger Faile show at the museum, and comprises 14 vintage game cabinets painted in collaged imagery and Day-Glo patterns, and reprogrammed with smirky, interactive games that satirize gentrification, pollution and parking in Brooklyn.

In the past, the artists have described the piece, which was shown at Art Basel Miami Beach in 2013, as a reflection of the art worlds fixation on ideas of relational aesthetics and democratization.

But there is an undeniable element of Gen X nostalgia at work, too.

It celebrates and builds on the loss of these somewhat sacred spaces we found growing up going to arcades at the mall, Mr. Miller, 39, said. You could be a hero or a villain in these spaces and be transformed in the games before walking back out into the normal, and sometimes boring teenage, world.",[]

Though you can still see the recesses in the walls where the hinges of the portals once hung, the Venice ghetto has not been a prison since Napoleon seized the city and tore down the gates in 1797. Today, no barrier or signpost marks where Venice ends and its ghetto begins. Cross a canal on an arched bridge, duck through a sottoportego (an alley tunneling through a building), disappear down a vent in the urban fabric  you come and go just like everywhere else in the maze of this island city.









But linger long enough in the Campo di Ghetto Nuovo, the generous, frayed, tree-flecked plaza that anchors this corner of Cannaregio (the quiet northwest quadrant of the city) and youll feel the wall of the past closing in. Half a millennium of history does not transpire without stamping the soul of a place.

Established by decree of Doge Leonardo Loredan on March 29, 1516, the Venice ghetto was one of the first places where people were forcibly segregated and surveilled because of religious difference. The term itself originated here; the area had been used as a foundry (geto in Venice dialect) and over time the neighborhoods polyglot residents corrupted the word to ghetto.

I traveled to La Serenissima in December to see how the city was gearing up for the anniversary of the establishment of the ghetto. A major exhibition called Venice, the Jews and Europe: 1516 to 2016 (on view from June 19 to Nov. 13) was being planned for the Ducal Palace, and during the last week of July, Shakespeares Merchant of Venice will be staged (in English) for the first time in the confines where its most hallucinatory scenes take place. Venice being Venice, there will also be glittering parties, celebrity-filled fund-raisers and fancy dress galas, starting with the invitation-only performance of Mahlers First Symphony at La Fenice opera house on March 29.

But in the course of my visit, what I became most curious about was the mood of the current Jewish community of 450 people. Venice is such an impossibly beautiful fantasy, it seems astonishing that ordinary people, Jews among them, actually live there. How, I wondered, did deep-rooted Jewish families feel about their past  and future  in this ancient, vulnerable city?

My first answer came inside the humble, rectangular sanctuary of the circa-1532 Scuola Canton, one of five synagogues still standing in the ghetto. The synagogues are open to the public only as part of guided tours offered by the Jewish Museum of Venice, and that morning just three of us (two other Americans and I) had signed up for the 10:30 tour in English. We were standing with our guide, Silvia Crepaldi, admiring the golden spiraling tree-trunk columns that support the arch over the bimah (podium), when the subject of rising sea levels came up.

The city will be empty before it sinks, Ms. Crepaldi said ruefully. Venice is shrinking before our eyes.

The urban exodus of both Jews and gentiles has been going on for some time, though the pace has accelerated in recent years.

When the ghetto was at its height in the 17th century, 5,000 Jews from Italy, Germany, France, Spain and the Ottoman Empire carved out tiny, distinct fiefs, each maintaining its own synagogue, all of them crammed into an acre and a quarter of alleys and courtyards. Confinement was a burden, but it also provided an opportunity for cultural exchange unparalleled in the diaspora. As Jan Morris, a Venice devotee and one-time resident, writes in The World of Venice, the city was a treasure-box full of ivory, spices, scents, apes, ebony, indigo, slaves, great galleons, Jews, mosaics, shining domes, rubies, and all the gorgeous commodities of Arabia, China and the Indies.

Photo

Jewish merchants and bankers were vital to the flow of these commodities, but as Venice declined, the Jewish presence dwindled. By the outbreak of the Second World War, Jewish Venice had shrunk to 1,200 residents. Today, with the citys total population hovering around 58,000 (down from 150,000 before the war), there are about 450 Venetian Jews left, only a handful of them residing in the ghetto.

So now the ghetto is just a shell? I wondered aloud as Ms. Crepaldi led us across the campo, over a bridge, down a street of intriguing-looking shops, and into a tighter, grimmer square (the Campiello delle Scuole or little square of the synagogues), flanked by the two Sephardic scuole.

The answer to my question was revealed inside one of these: the sumptuous Scuola Grande Spagnola (Great Spanish Synagogue), possibly the work of Baldassare Longhena, the renowned 17th-century architect of Santa Maria della Salute. After we had gazed our fill at the elliptical coffered ceiling and the black-columned pediment that frames the ark of the covenant; after we had craned our necks to glimpse the cherry wood balustrade and diamond-hatched panels that screen the upstairs womens gallery; after our eyes had bathed in the silver gleam of candelabra and the soft glow of crimson-curtained bottle-glass window panes, Ms. Crepaldi pointed to the brass plaques affixed to the pews. These are the names of families who pay to rent their own bench sections, she told us. These families still pray here. This synagogue is used in summer, and in winter they switch to the Scuola Levantina because its heated. The Venetian Jewish community may be small, but its still strong.

Calimani and Sullam  two of the surnames inscribed on those plaques  appeared in tiny letters by the buzzer I pressed at 10 oclock the next morning. Riccardo Calimani, the esteemed historian of Italian Jewry and the author of a book about the Venetian ghetto, had given me very precise directions to his home off the Strada Nuova (a rare rectilinear thoroughfare stocked with shops catering more to residents than tourists).

What Mr. Calimani had neglected to say in his email is that he lives in a palace: a light-bedazzled, soaring-ceilinged, art- and book-lined Renaissance suite overlooking the Grand Canal. As he ushered me into his princely study, the ample, urbane Mr. Calimani struck me as a kind of latter-day Jewish doge.

My fathers family arrived in Venice from the north of Italy in 1508, he said, slowing his Italian down to a tempo I could follow. My ancestor Simone Calimani was the author of a trattato morale [moral treatise], printed in the 18th century when Jewish publishing was flourishing here. My grandfather was the cantor in the Scuola Levantina, even though our roots are not Levantine but Italian and German. The Venetian history of the Calimani family, I realized, coincides almost exactly with the history of the ghetto.

The palace belongs to his wifes family, the Sullams, Spanish Jews who took refuge in Venice after the expulsion from the Iberian Peninsula at the end of the 15th century. I knew, from reading Mr. Calimanis The Ghetto of Venice (1988), that Italian and German Jews, the first and poorest to settle in Venice, had been consigned to selling rags and running pawnshops, while the great merchants of Venice were later arrivals from Spain and the Levant.

With tantalizing fragrances wafting out of the hidden kitchen and the velvety light of winter burnishing thousands of leather spines, I could practically taste the history that had made this room possible. The palace may be extraordinary, but the convergence of cosmopolitan currents in the Calimani/Sullam household is quintessentially Venetian.

Photo

Their families abandonment of the ghetto is also typical. As soon as the ghetto was abolished in 1797, Jews with means fled the high-rise tenements  the tallest buildings with the lowest-ceilinged apartments in Venice  for more elegant, and spacious, parts of the city. But the ghetto remained the anchor of Venetian Jewry. Since travel by gondola was deemed permissible on the Sabbath, the observant had no trouble floating back each week to pray at the scuola of their choice.

Today, the Jews of Venice, though still a proud (if dispersed) community, are invisible. (The black-garbed Hasids you see in the campo are not Venetian but followers of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement who have resettled here from other parts of Europe and the United States.) Mr. Calimani, like every local Jew I spoke to, said he moves unremarked in and out of Jewish circles. The Venice ghetto, he told me, was always more open to the city than the Roman ghetto, which was beset by the conversion mania of the church.

The dispersal of the community had the unexpected benefit of sending me into unfamiliar neighborhoods in pursuit of interviews. I had been in Venice twice before, but far from growing accustomed to its gorgeous strangeness, I found it endlessly fascinating just to thread the maze, and inevitably get lost in it, on my way to appointments.

The Airbnb my wife, daughter and I rented just off Campo SS. Giovanni e Paolo  the heart of Castello, a still quasi-authentic quarter of working families, schools, neighborhood bars and the municipal hospital  is perhaps half a mile as the crow flies from the flat of Donatella Calabi, a professor of urban history who curated the exhibition Venice, the Jews and Europe: 1516 to 2016. But even though Ms. Calabi had emailed me a map with arrows pointing the way, it still required several forays across the nearby Campo Santa Maria Formosa before I hit on just the right calle (street in the Venetian dialect).

No matter; it just gave me more angles from which to admire this perfect urban plaza with an austere whitewashed church rising in the center and a perimeter of magnificently crumbling palaces now occupied by restaurants, hotels, banks and the delightful 16th-century house-museum of the Fondazione Querini Stampalia.

As we sat by the windows of her top-floor apartment watching the dome of San Marco go gray against the December dusk, Ms. Calabi spoke with animation of the coming exhibition at the Ducal Palace. The ghetto provided an incredible occasion for cultural exchange she said, and the exhibit will focus on that exchange within the ghetto itself, between the ghetto and the city, and with the rest of Europe. Artworks including Carpaccios Predica di Santo Stefano (St. Stephens sermon) on loan from the Louvre, virtual reconstructions of the ghetto in various periods, and sacred books will conjure up the rich complexity of this exchange.

Ms. Calabi became more somber when the conversation turned to the present. Renaissance scholar Francesco Sansovino wrote that for the Jews, Venice was quasi una vera terra di promissione  practically a true promised land, she said. But today Jewish Venice is a small community within a small city. The 500th anniversary is an occasion not to celebrate  you dont have a festival for a ghetto  but to commemorate. An unbroken stretch of 500 years of history will not happen again soon.

I heard similar sentiments voiced later in the week at a packed meeting of an informal discussion group that gathers at intervals to consider issues pertinent to Venetian Jewry. The members had assembled that night in a pretty little house on a canal in Cannaregio near the Gesuiti Church, a Baroque pile that presides over a quarter once inhabited by artisans and artists (Titian and Tintoretto among them). My Italian, though not quite up to the rapid flow of ideas, was good enough to register the passion and erudition that these 30 or so men and women brought to a discussion of their deeply rooted community.

Amos Luzzatto, an esteemed Venetian-Jewish intellectual and the past president of the Jewish Community of Venice, was present, and we chatted for a few minutes about the small Jewish cemetery on the Lido, the beit midrash (study room) named for his family that is still in use in the ghetto, and the book by his renowned ancestor Rabbi Simchah Luzzatto that I had spotted in the Jewish Museum.

I didnt have a chance to ask Mr. Luzzatto how he felt about the state of the ghetto today, but as I picked my way back to SS. Giovanni e Paolo through deserted echoing alleys and over black filaments of water, I thought of a comment he had made in a recent interview posted on YouTube: The ghetto today belongs to the city of Venice  it does not belong to the Jews. The ghetto has become part of the panorama of Venice.

The panorama was its most ravishing the day I met Venices head rabbi, Scialom Bahbout, for lunch in the campo. Maybe it was the dazzle of another clear December day or the adrenaline of the holidays (Hanukkah was ending, Christmas still a week away), but the campo, which had struck me as rather forlorn on prior trips, now looked like a stage set waiting for a play. (In fact, this summers production of The Merchant of Venice will be staged right here, notes Shaul Bassi, a professor at the University of Venice who is spearheading the production.)

Mothers pushed strollers in and out of shadows cast by the teetering ghetto skyscrapers. Booted and scarfed Venetians clicked their heels across a bridge and disappeared into the inviting trattorias that line the fondamenta (bank) of the Rio della Misericordia canal. A small knot of tourists hovered by the entrance to the Jewish Museum, a charming warren of rooms stuffed with precious objects and books (and slated for a major makeover later this year under the aegis of Venetian Heritage, an international organization dedicated to preserving the citys cultural riches). I had just enough time before lunch to duck down an alley and browse the elegant Judaica pieces in glass and gold at Arte Ebraica Shalom.

The one jarring note was the makeshift police booth at the far end of the campo. Though there have been no attacks here, the booth is staffed around the clock by Italian police, rarely seen elsewhere in Venice, and the Jewish community has brought in its own private Israeli security guard. The juxtaposition of the armed police and the two Holocaust memorials (a series of bronze reliefs on either side of the Jewish old-age home that encloses one side of the campo) is apt. During the Nazi occupation, some 250 Venetian Jews, including its beloved chief rabbi Adolfo Ottolenghi, were seized from the ghetto and elsewhere in the city and sent to Auschwitz and a Trieste concentration camp. Eight returned.

The conversation touched only briefly on the Holocaust in the course of my leisurely lunch with the rabbi at Ghimel Garden, the popular kosher restaurant that opened recently beside the old-age home. Davide Federici, a local journalist, and the Venetian sculptor Giorgio Bortoli were present, and Rabbi Bahbout, who is highly regarded after two years in the community, seemed entirely in his element as the talk rambled around art, politics, history, cinema and food.

Did you know sarde in saor  sweet and sour sardines, a ubiquitous winter appetizer in Venice  is typically Jewish? the rabbi asked as the first round of plates appeared beside our glasses of prosecco. I was aware of the influence of ancient Jewish recipes on Roman cuisine, but it never occurred to me there was anything Jewish about the food of Venice, where shellfish (not kosher) figures in so many dishes. Id also never seen an Orthodox rabbi sipping prosecco.

By the time the pasta arrived, the conversation had moved on to the rabbis dream project: a Jewish university in Venice. The challenge today is to sustain the vivacity of our culture and carry it into the future. What better way than with an international Jewish university? In Venice today, conservation tends to dominate other concerns  but what we really need is to construct the next 500 years.

The rabbis American-born wife, Lenore Rosenberg Bahbout, joined us for pinza, a thrifty confection of stale bread and spice. We were chuckling about all the celebrities (Barbra Streisand, Donna Karan, Diane von Furstenberg, Barry Diller) whom Toto Bergamo Rossi, the charming director of Venetian Heritage, had tapped to fund the ghetto restoration project. Its wonderful, said Mrs. Bahbout. But it would be even more wonderful if this money could be used to restore the soul of the ghetto.

I contemplated the soul that Saturday morning, my last in Venice, at the Shabbat service in the Scuola Levantina. The high, dim sanctuary was about a quarter full, perhaps 40 men scattered around the benches that ran the length of the room between the massively carved bimah and the red-curtained ark of the covenant, with 15 or so women peering down at us from the upstairs gallery.

Photo

Id been in Venice less than a week, but already I recognized faces  Paolo Gnignati, the current president of the Jewish community; Elly, the strapping Israeli security guard who had warned no cellphones  theyre Orthodox! before letting me enter the synagogue; and of course Rabbi Bahbout, distinguished and elegant in his fedora as he chanted the Sephardic liturgy.

Every Venetian I spoke to, Jew and gentile alike, had expressed deep pessimism about the citys future. But as I sat in this sacred space in the hushed, carless city, listening to the Hebrew prayers and Italian murmur, I felt reassured, not discouraged, by the evidence of time. Since the ghetto was first established, doges, merchant princes, Shylock, Napoleon, the Austrians, the Nazis have come and gone (and in Shylocks case, will soon return). Through that half-millennium of history, Jews have gathered on Sabbath mornings like this one at the serene cusp of winter to pray and gossip in the Venice ghetto.

IF YOU GO

The website of the Jewish Community of Venice, veniceghetto500.org/?lang=en, has the latest information about events planned for the anniversary year. The Venetian Heritage Council, vh-council.org, is in charge of the coming restoration of the Jewish Museum and the ghetto synagogues.

Venice, the Jews and Europe: 1516 to 2016 will be on view at the Ducal Palace (veniceghetto500.org/la-mostra/?lang=en, Piazza San Marco) from June 19 to Nov. 13. Tickets are 19 euros (about $20) and can be purchased online.

The Merchant of Venice will be performed outdoors in the Campo di Ghetto Nuovo on July 26, 27, 28, 29, and 31, with a rain date on Aug. 1. The production, in English, is being staged through a partnership between Compagnia de Colombari theater company (colombari.org/#!home/c1pbl) and CaFoscari University of Venice. For tickets and further information, see themerchantinvenice.org.

The Jewish Museum of Venice is open from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Oct. 1 to May 31 and until 7 p.m. from June 1 to Sept. 30. Hourly guided tours of the synagogues (in Italian and English) start at 10:30 ( museum admission is 4; museum and synagogue tour is 10). The museum also offers tours of the Jewish cemetery on the Lido, with advance booking. Closed Saturdays and Jewish holidays. For more information, museoebraico.it/english/museo.html.

The Kosher in Venice website, kosherinvenice.com, lists kosher restaurants, hotels and food shops in the ghetto, including Ristorante Ghimel Garden, the recently opened Giardino dei Melograni guesthouse, and Panificio Volpe Giovanni, a bakery and grocery.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Hopping Freight Trains With the Dirty Kids,['Rena Silverman'],"If you combine the tinge of loneliness in Jimmie Rodgerss Waiting for a Train with the outcast mentality of Bob Dylans I Am a Lonesome Hobo, you might understand the millennial hippiedom of a group called Dirty Kids. Theyre not a band, but a self-proclaimed set of countercultural vagabonds: a new wave of nomadic, homeless youth traveling state to state hitchhiking, sleeping in cars and hopping on freight trains.

Last autumn, Emily Kask, a photojournalism student at Western Kentucky University, took a semester off to document  and become  part of the Dirty Kids family.

I had to panhandle, I had to eat out of Dumpsters, said Ms. Kask, 21. Everything that they had to do to survive, I had to do the same thing, too. They didnt cut me any excuses because I was a college kid or a journalist.

Her project started with a search for subjects on Hippie Hill in Christiana, Tenn., where the homeless can find temporary housing, comradeship and free expression. Contacts there led Ms. Kask to Southern Illinois, where she attended a rainbow gathering, a traveling convention that aims to inspire peace, love and community among multigenerational hippie types. It was there that she met Bambi, then 20, who had left her suburban home in North Carolina for the open road.

We were both kind of the same age, young women, Ms. Kask said. So I kind of felt at ease with her.

Photo

Bambi, who preferred to be identified by only her street name, had just parted ways with another group and was getting ready to learn how to hop freight trains with her friend Travis Sauter. Ms. Kask asked if she could come along. They agreed, and Ms. Kask drove them to Kentucky.

On arrival, Mr. Sauter, 41, was arrested over a prior panhandling incident, but Bambi and Ms. Kask continued with a new friend, Matt Johnson, or Smerph, who grew up in a family of train riders. He taught them the moves. Later the group met up with others, including Deverayn Armstrong, 26, who had been in and out of foster homes before taking to riding the rails.

Ms. Kask hopped on her first freight train  a gondola car full of scrap metal  near Bowling Green, Ky. She and the others got off in Nashville, about 65 miles away.

That is an exhilarating feeling, jumping on a train, Ms. Kask said.

Shooting it was a different story. She tried to use her Nikon D4 or smaller Fuji, but in the end many of her train photos were shot with her iPhone for safety.

Photo

There are two ways to get on a train, she said. You can either get on a side off or hop on the fly. When youre siding off, the trains going to stop for a little bit. That is the easiest way to get on. When youre hopping on the fly, you are going to wait for the train to slow down to a speed where you can get on. Thats different for everybody. I wouldnt be able to do it more than a couple miles per hour, but there are some kids who can do it up to 10.

Train hopping is hardly new to American society. Even before the Great Depression (think John Steinbecks Of Mice and Men), there was the post-Civil War railroad scene when war veterans, westbound drifters or migrant workers headed across the country via freight train.

I think it is absolutely this wild revolution, Ms. Kask said of the Dirty Kids. I think its this blend of these Great Depression train riders and the hippies of the 60s and 70s, and, I think its come to blend together with the millennials.

Mark Mattson, a neuroscientist at the National Institute on Aging in Maryland, has not had breakfast in 35 years. Most days he practices a form of fasting  skipping lunch, taking a midafternoon run, and then eating all of his daily calories (about 2,000) in a six-hour window starting in the afternoon.

Once you get used to it, its not a big deal, said Dr. Mattson, chief of the institutes laboratory of neurosciences. Im not hungry at all in the morning, and this is other peoples experience as well. Its just a matter of getting adapted to it.

In a culture in which its customary to eat three large meals a day while snacking from morning to midnight, the idea of regularly skipping meals may sound extreme. But in recent years intermittent fasting has been gaining popular attention and scientific endorsement.

It has been promoted in best-selling books and endorsed by celebrities like the actors Hugh Jackman and Benedict Cumberbatch. The late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel claims that for the past two years he has followed an intermittent fasting program known as the 5:2 diet, which entails normal eating for five days and fasting for two  a practice Mr. Kimmel credits for his significant weight loss.

Photo

Fasting to improve health dates back thousands of years, with Hippocrates and Plato among its earliest proponents. Dr. Mattson argues that humans are well suited for it: For much of human history, sporadic access to food was likely the norm, especially for hunter-gatherers. As a result, weve evolved with livers and muscles that store quickly accessible carbohydrates in the form of glycogen, and our fat tissue holds long-lasting energy reserves that can sustain the body for weeks when food is not available.

From an evolutionary perspective, its pretty clear that our ancestors did not eat three meals a day plus snacks, Dr. Mattson said.

Across the world, millions of people fast periodically for religious and spiritual reasons. But some are now looking at the practice as a source of health and longevity.

Valter Longo, the director of the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California, initially studied fasting in mice that showed that two to five days of fasting each month reduced biomarkers for diabetes, cancer and heart disease. The research has since been expanded to people, and scientists saw a similar reduction in disease risk factors.

Dr. Longo said the health benefits of fasting might result from the fact that fasting lowers insulin and another hormone called insulinlike growth factor, or IGF-1, which is linked to cancer and diabetes. Lowering these hormones may slow cell growth and development, which in turn helps slow the aging process and reduces risk factors for disease.

When you have low insulin and low IGF-1, the body goes into a state of maintenance, a state of standby, Dr. Longo said. There is not a lot of push for cells to grow, and in general the cells enter a protected mode.

Critics say that health benefits or not, various forms of intermittent fasting are too impractical for most people.

The 5:2 diet, for example, advocates eating without restrictions for five days and then consuming just 500 calories  roughly the equivalent of a light meal  on each of the other two days of the week. Another regimen, called alternate-day fasting, involves eating no more than 500 calories every other day.

A third regimen, which Dr. Mattson follows, is known as time-restricted feeding. The idea is to consume all of the days calories in a narrow window, typically six to eight hours, and fasting for the remaining 16 to 18 hours in a day. Studies of time-restricted feeding practices in both animals and humans have suggested that the practice may lower cancer risk and help people maintain their weight.

The scientific community remains divided about the value of intermittent fasting. Critics say that the science is not yet strong enough to justify widespread recommendations for fasting as a way to lose weight or boost health, and that most of the evidence supporting it comes from animal research. Advocates say the body of research on intermittent fasting is growing rapidly and indicates that the health benefits are striking.

The 5:2 diet, in particular, is backed by promising studies that show that it lowers weight and improves blood sugar, inflammation and other aspects of metabolic health, said Joy Dubost, a registered dietitian and a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the countrys largest organization of dietitians. She noted that fasting isnt appropriate for pregnant women, people with diabetes and people on medications.

Most people who do this understand that its not about binge eating, Dr. Dubost said. But they like that it gives them the freedom not to worry about calories, carbs and other restrictions on days when theyre not fasting.

Krista Varady, an associate professor of nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago, has studied the effects of alternate-day fasting on hundreds of obese adults. In trials lasting eight to 10 weeks, she has found that people lose on average about 13 pounds and experience marked reductions in LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, triglycerides and insulin, the fat-storage hormone.

Dr. Varady found in her research that intermittent fasting was easiest when people ate a moderately high-fat diet and were allowed to consume up to 500 calories on their fasting days. In her studies, 10 percent to 20 percent of people usually find the diet too difficult and quickly stop. Those who stick with it typically adjust after a rocky first few weeks.

Weve run close to 700 people through various trials, Dr. Varady said. We thought people would overeat on their feast days to compensate. But people for some reason, regardless of their body weight, can only eat about 10 or 15 percent more than usual. They dont really overeat, and I think thats why this works.

In 2011, Dr. Mattson and his colleagues reported a study of the 5:2 program that followed 107 overweight and obese women. Half of the subjects were assigned to eat no more than 500 calories each on two consecutive days each week. A control group was assigned to follow a low-calorie diet.

After six months, both groups had lost weight. But the intermittent fasting group lost slightly more  about 14 pounds on average  and had greater reductions in belly fat. They also retained more muscle and had greater improvements in blood sugar regulation.

Dr. Mattsons interest in intermittent fasting grew out of work on animals that showed that alternate-day fasting protected mice from strokes, Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease, and consistently extended their life spans by 30 percent. Dr. Mattson and his colleagues found that alternate-day fasting increased the production of proteins that protect brain cells, enhancing their ability to repair damaged DNA. Fasting, he said, acts as a mild stress that makes cells throughout the body stronger, shoring up their ability to adapt to later insults.

In this way, intermittent fasting is like exercise, which causes immediate stress and inflammation, but protects against chronic disease in the long run. Eating fruits and vegetables may have a similar effect. While very large doses of antioxidants can cause cancer in humans, moderate amounts of exposure can make cells more resilient, Dr. Mattson said.

There is overlap between the way cells respond to exercise, to fasting, and even to exposure to some of the chemicals in fruits and vegetables, he added.

Dr. Mattson is now starting a rigorous clinical trial of people 55 to 70 years old who are prediabetic and at high risk for developing Alzheimers disease. He plans to study whether intermittent fasting may slow cognitive decline.

Dr. David Ludwig, a professor of nutrition at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, said one benefit of fasting is that it forces the body to shift from using glucose for fuel to using fat. During this process, the fat is converted to compounds known as ketones, a clean energy source that burns more efficiently than glucose, like high-octane gasoline, Dr. Ludwig said.

The same process, known as ketosis, occurs when people go on extremely low-carb, high-fat diets. Dr. Ludwig said ketones seem to have unique effects on the brain. High-fat diets, for example, have been used for years to treat people who suffer from epileptic seizures.

There are extensive reports of children who had debilitating seizures who were cured on ketogenic diets, Dr. Ludwig said. If it benefits the brain to prevent seizures, then maybe it benefits the brain in other ways.

Dr. Ludwig noted that the long-term effectiveness of fasting had not been well studied. He cautioned that for many people, fasting is simply too difficult and may slow metabolism. A potentially more practical approach is to limit sugar and other processed carbohydrates, replacing them with natural fats, protein and unrefined carbohydrates, he said.

It takes a very disciplined person to skip a couple meals every day, he added.

But Dr. Mattson, who has been skipping meals for decades, said the adjustment to skipping breakfast and lunch was a lot like the change that occurs when a couch potato starts exercising.

If youve been sedentary for years and then you go out and try to run five miles, youre not going to feel very good until you get in shape, he said.  Its not going to be a smooth transition right away. It takes two weeks to a month to adapt.

Phys Ed Gretchen Reynolds on the science of fitness.

Some forms of exercise may be much more effective than others at bulking up the brain, according to a remarkable new study in rats. For the first time, scientists compared head-to-head the neurological impacts of different types of exercise: running, weight training and high-intensity interval training. The surprising results suggest that going hard may not be the best option for long-term brain health.

As I have often written, exercise changes the structure and function of the brain. Studies in animals and people have shown that physical activity generally increases brain volume and can reduce the number and size of age-related holes in the brains white and gray matter.

Exercise also, and perhaps most resonantly, augments adult neurogenesis, which is the creation of new brain cells in an already mature brain. In studies with animals, exercise, in the form of running wheels or treadmills, has been found to double or even triple the number of new neurons that appear afterward in the animals hippocampus, a key area of the brain for learning and memory, compared to the brains of animals that remain sedentary. Scientists believe that exercise has similar impacts on the human hippocampus.

These past studies of exercise and neurogenesis understandably have focused on distance running. Lab rodents know how to run. But whether other forms of exercise likewise prompt increases in neurogenesis has been unknown and is an issue of increasing interest, given the growing popularity of workouts such as weight training and high-intensity intervals.

So for the new study, which was published this month in the Journal of Physiology, researchers at the University of Jyvaskyla in Finland and other institutions gathered a large group of adult male rats. The researchers injected the rats with a substance that marks new brain cells and then set groups of them to an array of different workouts, with one group remaining sedentary to serve as controls.

Some of the animals were given running wheels in their cages, allowing them to run at will. Most jogged moderately every day for several miles, although individual mileage varied.

Others began resistance training, which for rats involves climbing a wall with tiny weights attached to their tails.

Still others took up the rodent equivalent of high-intensity interval training. For this regimen, the animals were placed on little treadmills and required to sprint at a very rapid and strenuous pace for three minutes, followed by two minutes of slow skittering, with the entire sequence repeated twice more, for a total of 15 minutes of running.

These routines continued for seven weeks, after which the researchers microscopically examined brain tissue from the hippocampus of each animal.

They found very different levels of neurogenesis, depending on how each animal had exercised.

Those rats that had jogged on wheels showed robust levels of neurogenesis. Their hippocampal tissue teemed with new neurons, far more than in the brains of the sedentary animals. The greater the distance that a runner had covered during the experiment, the more new cells its brain now contained.

There were far fewer new neurons in the brains of the animals that had completed high-intensity interval training. They showed somewhat higher amounts than in the sedentary animals but far less than in the distance runners.

And the weight-training rats, although they were much stronger at the end of the experiment than they had been at the start, showed no discernible augmentation of neurogenesis. Their hippocampal tissue looked just like that of the animals that had not exercised at all.

Obviously, rats are not people. But the implications of these findings are provocative. They suggest, said Miriam Nokia, a research fellow at the University of Jyvaskyla who led the study, that sustained aerobic exercise might be most beneficial for brain health also in humans.

Just why distance running was so much more potent at promoting neurogenesis than the other workouts is not clear, although Dr. Nokia and her colleagues speculate that distance running stimulates the release of a particular substance in the brain known as brain-derived neurotrophic factor that is known to regulate neurogenesis. The more miles an animal runs, the more B.D.N.F. it produces.

Weight training, on the other hand, while extremely beneficial for muscular health, has previously been shown to have little effect on the bodys levels of B.D.N.F., Dr. Nokia said, which could explain why it did not contribute to increased neurogenesis in this study.

As for high-intensity interval training, its potential brain benefits may be undercut by its very intensity, Dr. Nokia said. It is, by intent, much more physiologically draining and stressful than moderate running, and stress tends to decrease adult hippocampal neurogenesis, she said.

These results do not mean, however, that only running and similar moderate endurance workouts strengthen the brain, Dr. Nokia said. Those activities do seem to prompt the most neurogenesis in the hippocampus. But weight training and high-intensity intervals probably lead to different types of changes elsewhere in the brain. They might, for instance, encourage the creation of additional blood vessels or new connections between brain cells or between different parts of the brain.

So if you currently weight train or exclusively work out with intense intervals, continue. But perhaps also thread in an occasional run or bike ride for the sake of your hippocampal health.

nytimes.com,2015-12-17 00:00:00,Lanvin and Alber Elbaz: The Story of a Breakup,['Vanessa Friedman'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Even in a world inured to designer change, no one expected this.









Not the editors and retailers and friends who sat front row at the Lanvin womens wear show in Paris last October applauding the crisp tuxedo day looks, the shimmering jewel-toned cocktail frocks. Not Fashion Group International, a prominent industry organization that bestowed upon Alber Elbaz, the Lanvin artistic director, their Superstar Award three weeks later. Not Meryl Streep, who handed him his award while wearing Lanvin, noting, if what youve made me feel over the years is multiplied by all the other women whose lives youve enhanced, I think you should get this every year. And most all, not Lanvins own employees, many of whom cried when they got the news.

No one expected on a Wednesday morning in late October that Mr. Elbaz would be sitting at his home in Paris reading a letter from Lanvin telling him not to come into the office, because he had been fired.

And no one expected that not long after, the storied brand of Lanvin, the oldest French fashion house in continuous existence, would be in court, engaged in a very public airing of its dirty laundry.

I have never heard of anything like it, said Julie Gilhart, an independent consultant and former fashion director of Barneys.

The company is breaking up into two camps: the management on one side, the works council, the studio and the ateliers on the other, said a recently dismissed manager who would speak only on condition of anonymity because of pending legal action against Lanvin.

An erstwhile happy fashion marriage between a designer and a proprietor has turned into a very ugly divorce. And, like many divorces, it is now being played out in court  in this case, the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris, where on Wednesday, Judge Penelope Postel-Vinay ruled on an emergency procedure brought by management.

Lanvin executives had accused the Comite dEntreprise, a works council that functions as an intermediary between employees and executives, of abusing the internal communications network, fomenting unrest since Mr. Elbazs departure, and groundlessly alerting the board of directors to concerns about the company situation, especially its financial situation, and requesting an independent audit, and asked that such actions be halted. The judge found that the works council had behaved within its rights on the first two points and that the court did not have jurisdiction to suspend the right to alert. She further fined the company 3,000 euros, or about $3,285, and instructed them to pay all legal fees for the works council, though she did not grant the 20,000 in damages it had requested. Both sides (confusingly but not surprisingly) claimed a measure of victory.

Mr. Albaz and Lanvin executives all declined to be interviewed. But the public nature of the case means that, while this year alone has seen a plethora of designer moves  including Alessandro Michele replacing the fired Frida Giannini at Gucci and Peter Dundass jump from Pucci to Cavalli  the situation at Lanvin has lifted the mink-trimmed silk charmeuse skirt of fashion, exposing the costs of such changes for everyone involved: protagonists, employees and even consumers.

Everyone should pay attention, said Ralph Toledano, the chief executive of Puig fashion division and, as the former chief executive of Guy Laroche, the man who took Mr. Elbaz to Paris from New York in 1996, to be creative director of Laroche. It is a story of exactly what should not be done.

It is a story, mostly, about relationships  between individuals, between corporate and creative  and about the gap that can exist between public perception and private reality.

There is a truism in the fashion world that the most successful companies are built on a designer-chief executive pairing: Pierre Berge and Yves Saint Laurent, Valentino and Giancarlo Giammetti. This evolved, as fashion industrialized and globalized, into a team of creative director and chief executive officer(think Tom Ford and Domenico de Sole), watched over by the benevolent (or not so benevolent) eye of a majority shareholder, and became the model for the revival of fashion brands like Celine and Louis Vuitton. That was how Lanvins once-upon-a-time began.

The fairy godmother was Shaw-Lan Wang, a Taiwan-based Chinese-born former media mogul, who was part of a consortium that bought the then-largely wholesale men's wear and fragrance business of Jeanne Lanvin S.A. from LOreal in 2001, quickly taking control. That was when Mr. Elbaz, the former creative director of Yves Saint Laurent  fired from his post after three seasons when Gucci Group bought the company  asked for a meeting. It is time to awake the sleeping beauty, Madame Wang told Mr. Elbaz, according to a 2009 profile in The New Yorker. She cast him as her prince.

We were really starting from scratch, said Natasa Cagalj, currently creative director of Ports 1961, who worked closely with Mr. Elbaz at Lanvin from 2001 to 2005. We could hardly get any models for the first show. We joked we would have to get people off the streets of Paris.

By the second season, however, everything had changed. Mr. Elbaz began to establish the signatures that became trademarks of the house (as well as inspiring multiple copycats), from exposed zippers in the back to grosgrain ribbon trim and a love of what Virginia Smith, the Vogue market director, fashion and accessories, called a sense of imperfect beauty; the appreciation of the humanity found in a frayed edge. The press flocked in. Its one of the few shows I remember people practically dancing in their seats and clapping their hands, Ms. Smith said.

Paul Deneve, the president of Nina Ricci, joined as managing director in 2006 (previously Madame Wangs son had held that position), and they began to build the business. People would fight to get the brand in their stores, said Cecile Andrau, the sales director at the time, who eventually became executive vice president for Lanvin Inc.

Retailers bought it not only for their stores, they bought it for themselves: Marigay McKee, the former chief merchant of Harrods, says she has at least 10 black dresses in her closet; Ikram Goldman, the owner of the eponymous Chicago boutique, who bought the brand from Mr. Elbazs first season, said she also made purchases for my archives.

It was mesmerizing how fast that brand grew, Ms. Gilhart said. Barneys, she added, did our first million-dollar trunk show with Lanvin. They became an anchor brand on the second floor. The other anchor was Azzedine Alaia.

But that doesnt mean it was easy. Alber was a total workaholic, Ms. Cagalj said. The first to come, the last to leave. He cant stand mediocrity, and he was always challenging you. He called it Ping-Pong: the constant back and forth with the studio.

Bruno Frisoni, creative director of Roger Vivier, who worked with Mr. Elbaz during two seasons at Yves Saint Laurent (and worked at Lanvin in the 1980s, before Mr. Elbaz), had similar memories. He is exhausting to work with, he said. He never agrees to anything until the last minute, because of his level of perfectionism and passion. He gives you notes and notes and notes, not drawings or silhouettes, and can talk for hours about images and ideas.

Yet at the same time, the intensity was balanced by a humanity, Mr. Frisoni said. Mr. Elbaz was famous for sending flowers on birthdays, on births of babies, after funerals. He treasured the atelier, and they knew it, said Ms. Cagalj. Indeed, they stayed with him: In his speech at the FGI awards dinner, Mr. Elbaz referenced a seamstress who had recently retired at 61  after joining Lanvin at 17.

Love is a word that comes up a lot in relationship to Mr. Elbaz. Though fashion is famously fond of a comeuppance and a sotto voce aside, it is almost impossible to find someone with a negative experience with Mr. Elbaz. Mr. Toledano said he resigned a few months after Mr. Elbaz left Guy Laroche for Y.S.L. because: When you are in love with someone and he or she drops you, you cant fall immediately in love again. You need time.

Ms. Cagalj says he taught me design was an emotional process. Mr. Frisoni, describing a Lanvin show he attended, said: You could see he loved people, loved women, loved fashion. How could you not love Alber?

But love did not characterize every relationship at Lanvin. Fissures had begun to appear in the relationship of Mr. Deneve and Madam Wang. In 2007, reportedly without telling Mr. Deneve of her plans, she sold the perfume business to Interparfums. In January 2009, Mr. Deneve left  after diverging opinions.

It was the beginning of a pattern that would repeat itself: Disagreement would not be tolerated. Those who did, left. Or were asked to leave.

Mr. Deneves replacement, Thierry Andretta, former chief executive of Moschino, focused on changing the wholesale and retail balance of the brand and opening stores, doubling the revenues in four years from approximately 120 million to about 240 million, before leaving in 2013 for personal reasons widely attributed to disagreements over strategy.

And though for years they seemed to have a warm relationship, developing a famous routine in which at the end of every show, after bowing to the crowd, Mr. Elbaz would bow to Madame Wang personally, and she would give him a kiss and a bouquet of flowers, now he, too, is gone because of a disagreement over strategy.

The word that comes up most often when associates are asked to describe Madame Wang is autocratic. Fashion houses are not democracies, of course, and Madame Wang is Lanvins majority shareholder; she owns the last word. Still, it is striking that, over the years, the strategic disagreements all seemed to turn broadly on the same point: an alleged reluctance on the part of Madame Wang to invest in the business, whether by putting cash back into the company after selling off assets or opening it up to investment from the outside.

Though she accepted a silent minority shareholder in Arpege, the company that owns Lanvin, in the form of German investor Ralph Bartel in 2009 (he now owns 25 percent and has a seat on the Lanvin board), and gave Mr. Elbaz some shares in her own Luxembourg-based holding company, Bluewater Investment (reportedly the indirect owner of Arpege, though the company declined to comment on the relationship), she maintained a tight hold on Lanvin. Everyone tried to buy it, Mr. Andretta said. She simply refused. In her way, she is very passionate about the company.

Charles-Henry Paradis, a member of the communications team and the representative of the employees on the Comite dEntreprise and to the board, said: She is a very proud woman. She would see selling as an admission of failure.

But in order to grow, Ms. Gilhart said, You have to feed the machine. Valentino and Brunello Cucinelli, two companies Mr. Andretta characterized as of comparable size during his tenure, have continued their upward trajectory in part by bolstering their balance sheets, thanks to both the acquisition by the Qatari royal family and a public offering.

Mr. Andrettas successor was Michele Huiban, the former finance chief, who had been hired under Mr. Deneve and promoted by Madame Wang to deputy director general under Mr. Andretta. Unlike her predecessors, Ms. Huiban had almost no profile in the fashion community, but was seen as an extension of Madame Wang, a former executive said. Her appointment coincided with a difficult financial period for the brand. Revenue and net profit fell in 2013 and 2014, and according to an internal announcement, there was a loss of 2.5 million in net profits projected for 2015  the first since 2007.

Lawyers for Lanvin disputed claims that this was an issue in court, saying that the company is on a solid financial footing, and pointing to the fact Madame Wang is trying to buy back the Lanvin name and distribution rights in Japan as proof.

In an internal memo shown to The New York Times, the financial difficulties were attributed to the general geopolitical situation, lack of creative energy and the absence of a meaningful accessory business.

Though Lanvin had notable success with items like the ribbon-trimmed sneaker (worn by Michelle Obama, among many others) and the ballet flat (worn by Angelina Jolie), as well as tulle-covered pearls and other costume jewelry, Lanvin remained a heavily ready-to-wear business. Mr. Paradis said that today the balance is 60 percent ready-to-wear, 40 percent accessories. Lanvin does not officially release such numbers, though another insider said the division could be as extreme as 80/20.

It is true that I cant recall a specific bag that broke through, Ms. Smith acknowledged, though I remember there were many good ones.

Photo

In a letter written to both the management and employees, Mr. Elbaz said that it was lack of an articulated strategy and investment that was responsible for the stagnation, a view supported by many employees, Mr. Paradis said. And both Mr. Andretta and Ms. Gilhart say that every time they asked Mr. Elbaz to design an item for commercial needs  more jackets, say, or long dresses  once they had explained why the market needed the product, he was happy to comply.

Whichever side is right, it is not unusual in situations like this  falling sales, corporate change  for the designer or the chief executive to take the fall. In June, for example, after the fourth consecutive quarter of falling sales, J. Crew fired its head of women's wear, Tom Mora. Last year, after an extended sales decline, the chief executive and creative director of Gucci were both fired. But, in part because of Mr. Elbazs talent and charisma, the industry as a whole was so invested in Lanvins happy ending, no one imagined it would happen to him.

Maybe he didnt, either, as he began to voice his belief that the brand needed to accept further outside investment and articulate a concrete management strategy; Lanvin executives allege that he tried to sell his shares in Bluewater without telling Madame Wang, and then pressured her to sell her own holdings. Lanvin became, according to numerous employees, a tense building in which to work. Last year, 65 people  almost 20 percent of the work force  left. (The companys lawyers characterized this as normal industry attrition.) Earlier this year, Hania Destelle, communications director for 21 years, who was known as being very close to Mr. Elbaz, was fired.

At the last show, Madame Wang and Mr. Elbaz did not exchange their customary kiss, despite the fact that many retailers thought it was the best show the designer had produced in seasons. Indeed, Selfridges began buying the brand again after dropping it in 2013, according to Judd Crane, the stores director of women's wear and accessories.

In October, the employees discovered that Mr. Elbaz had been fired when he called his assistant to ask her to pack up his office because he was not allowed back in the building. (His partner of over two decades, Alex Koo, is still director of merchandising; he also was not available for an interview.) At a large meeting later the same day, Ms. Huiban officially informed them of the decision to end Mr. Elbazs contract, while many present chanted his name. Things escalated from there.

The Comite dEntreprise said they did not get satisfactory answers to the questions of why Mr. Elbaz had been fired and what the strategy was for the companys future (and their emails to Madame Wang asking her to return to Paris to address the company in person were not answered), so they took their cause public, speaking on a French radio station about their concerns. Management said the employees were refusing meetings; the employees said the same thing. The works council posted a letter from Mr. Elbaz defending himself on a message board, to the displeasure of management, who viewed the council as partisans of Mr. Elbaz. The works council then asked for an independent audit. The next stop was the Tribunal.

The question is: What happens now? Ironically (or perhaps purposefully), celebrities have been wearing the brand on the red carpet at an almost unprecedented rate, with Cate Blanchett, Michelle Dockery, Ms. Streep and Adele all modeling Lanvin in public in the weeks since Mr. Elbazs ouster.

In an internal email seen by The New York Times, Lanvin management said it would not pursue the court case any further, and hoped to engage in more constructive dialogue with the employees. It is unclear what direct financial impact Mr. Elbazs ouster will have on the company, as the works council believes the company could owe him from 20 million to 40 million in severance, according to a statement from their lawyer in court, a figure denied by the Lanvin lawyers (Mr. Elbaz was not a full-time employee of Lanvin, but rather contracted to them as a creative consultant via his own company, AEK Designs, and his current contract was due to end next year). In terms of perception, the company lost half its value when Alber left, said Ralph Toledano.

Before he was fired Mr. Elbaz, had hired Chemena Kamali from Chloe as womens design director; she arrived three days before he was ousted, and is currently in charge of creating the pre-collection with the studio team, to be shown in January. Lucio Finale has been brought in to focus on accessories. (Lucas Ossendrijver will continue to design the mens wear collection.) Head hunters report feelers have been put out by employees on the corporate side looking for other job prospects. Last week, a long-term member of the studio, was suspended for being uncooperative and allegedly undermining the new studio director, charges he denied.

Whats clear is whatever the brand is after Alber, it has to be something different, said Mr. Andretta. Names that have surfaced as possibilities for the artistic director position include the buzzy British designer Simone Rocha and the Chinese designer Huishan Zhang.

As for Mr. Elbaz, though rumors flew when he left that he would go to Dior (which had lost its designer, Raf Simons, only a week before Mr. Elbaz was fired), that speculation has died down. Though he recently joined Instagram and has posted pictures of himself with Bono, who dedicated the song Beautiful Day to him during a November concert in Paris, Mr. Elbaz has kept a low profile, and is said to be pondering his options. After being fired from Saint Laurent, he spent a year in the wilderness, questioning his commitment to fashion, but this time he is said to be planning to return. He does not have a noncompete with Lanvin.

Maybe hed want his own house, said Kim Hastreiter, co-founder and editor of Paper, who has known Mr. Elbaz since before he moved to Paris (and who played percussion along with the band Pink Martini at his Lanvin 10th anniversary party, where he serenaded guests with Que Sera, Sera). He remains a Lanvin board member. Though there was a directors meeting scheduled for this week, it has been postponed until after the holidays because Mr. Bartel could not attend.

Retailers are taking a wait-and-see approach. I am scheduled to schedule an appointment to see the pre-collection, said Ms. Goldman. But I dont need more brands. I need continuity, loyalty, consistency  not labels. I cant keep bringing strangers into the beds of my consumers and expecting them to fall in love over and over again. Its unreasonable.",[]

Bob Dylan is on the move yet again, with a new album and tour.

After returning from a series of concerts in Japan in April, Mr. Dylan, 74, will embark on a 27-date American tour in June and July, in support of a coming album, Fallen Angels, according to a brief announcement on Mr. Dylans website on Monday.

The tour, featuring Mavis Staples as the opening act, will start with two shows at the Chateau Ste. Michelle Winery in Woodinville, Wash., on June 4 and 5, and continue through July 17, with a performance at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford, N.H. The tour will include a stop on July 8 at the Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, where Mr. Dylan last played on Aug. 28, 1965. Tickets for the shows will go on sale at various times, with the first of them selling on Friday.

Mr. Dylans website gives little information about Fallen Angels, even a release date. The album is his first since Shadows in the Night, a year ago, with covers of traditional pop standards associated with Frank Sinatra, including Im a Fool to Want You  one of the very few songs in which Sinatra has a writing credit. One perk: for most shows, customers buying a pair of tickets will get a redemption code for the CD, the announcement said.

Some sleuthing fans, looking at recent statements from Dylan collaborators like the producer Daniel Lanois, have surmised that Fallen Angels will be another standards record. The title, for one thing, may be a reference to the 1945 film noir Fallen Angel by Otto Preminger, who also directed Sinatra in The Man With the Golden Arm. (Whats a new Dylan announcement without some mystery?)

Last week, it was revealed that Mr. Dylans vast personal archives of lyrics, correspondence, audio tapes and films were being acquired by a group of institutions in Tulsa, Okla., and would become available for scholarly study after about two years of cataloging and digitization.",[]

PARIS  The French Culture Ministry announced on Wednesday that Guy Cogeval, the president of the Musee dOrsay in Paris since 2008, would be reappointed to his post  but for only one year rather than the expected three.

In a statement, the ministry praised Mr. Cogeval, who is also the head of the Musee de lOrangerie across the Seine, noting that he had helped to develop and renovate the Musee dOrsay and that recent exhibits there, like one on the artistic depiction of prostitution, had been met with repeated critical and public success.

But Mr. Cogevals governance came into question last month when half a dozen curators at the Musee dOrsay anonymously contacted the newspaper Le Monde to oppose his reappointment, arguing that he was neither physically, nor psychologically, nor scientifically able to run a museum of this stature.

Mr. Cogeval, 60, suffered a stroke in 2014. The anonymous curators said his health problems had left him unfit to manage the museum, calling his decision-making irrational and his programming extremely fluctuating.

Several high-profile curators have recently left the institutions under Mr. Cogeval, including Sylvie Patry, who left the Musee dOrsay last November to become chief curator and deputy director for collections and exhibitions at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia.

In an open letter addressed to Le Monde, Mr. Cogeval dismissed the anonymous criticism as rumors fostered by rivals vying for his job and denied the stroke had left him impaired.

Although the statement did not specify why Mr. Cogevals term would only last for only one year, the ministry said he would step down in March 2017 to head a center dedicated to the study of a movement of painters known as Les Nabis, which he specializes in.",[]

Angela Dimayuga, the executive chef at Mission Chinese Food in Manhattan, spooned salmon roe and rare beef into what she called baller lettuce cups.

Bill Telepan sweated through his T-shirt, fending off Wylie Dufresne, who snatched a few cubes of potato Mr. Telepan was frying in olive oil to go with slices of dry-aged rib-eye.

By virtue of his appetite, his fame and the kind of mind that can keep track of an 80,000-record vinyl collection, Mr. Thompson in the last few years has crept into the white-hot center of a food world that is itself moving toward the center of pop culture.

He doesnt cook much himself, although he grew up with a grandmother devoted to Sunday supper. Rather, he aspires to become to food what Gertrude Stein was to art, a culinary catalyst whose parties mix the creative and the powerful against the backdrop of cooking. In these discussions and a book to be released next month, Mr. Thompson continues to mine a favorite topic: the mechanics of creativity.

The job is not all indulgence. His favorite dish at the salon was a South African malva pudding with blood orange sherbet put together by Jessica Koslow of Sqirl in Los Angeles. But it was the first time I had sugar in, like, five weeks, Mr. Thompson said.

He had been on a cleanse, which involved a lot of cabbage soup, in an effort to get his frame under 330 pounds. Based on my physical look, he said, you can tell that food and me have been friends for a long time.

The chefs at the salon said that musicians tend to have terrific appetites, and that the bridge Mr. Thompson is building between food and music makes sense. There is no difference between the music you listen to and the food you eat, Mr. Samuelsson said. The emotions are the same. They are both a narrative.

Mr. Thompson has been a presenter at James Beard awards ceremonies and has been a Top Chef judge. Hes the guy Chris Rock calls to find out where to eat. His culinary exploits are sent out to his 3.6 million Twitter followers and the 25,000 people who have discovered his Questlovesfood Instagram account. When he spreads his wings over food-related charity events, he can help raise hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Anthony Bourdain calls him a fully made member of the chef mafia, but Mr. Thompson thinks thats overblown. He doesnt want to be another celebrity trying to extend his brand into food. Im very leery of my entry into the fraternity or sorority of these people, Mr. Thompson said.

In 2013, he opened a little food stand in Chelsea Market with the restaurateur Stephen Starr, who like Mr. Thompson is from Philadelphia. Mr. Thompson is a drummer, so they served fried chicken drumsticks. It was the food version of a rap battle between him and the chef David Chang. The bigger point, though, was to prove he was serious.

I dont want to be perceived as someone who just bought my way into this world or used my currency as a means to get in, Mr. Thompson said in an interview. Like, I had to throw them proof.

After seven months, the stand was losing money and closed. After the restaurant went down, it was sort of like, What should our next move be? he said. So the food salons started.

The idea came from something he used to do with the Roots, the neo-soul hip-hop band he founded in 1987 with Tariq Trotter, the musician known as Black Thought. They made their record company add a food budget to pay Philadelphia chefs to prepare meals for social gatherings of musicians.

We would eat and the musicians would set up and wed start writing music, Mr. Thompson said. Thats how the bands breakthrough album, Things Fall Apart, was born in 1999.

His food obsession became more serious in 2009, when the Roots became the house band for Late Night With Jimmy Fallon. (Mr. Thompson and the band have stayed on with Mr. Fallon since he took over The Tonight Show in 2014.)

I was counting the pros and the cons of having the Late Night job, and one of the big pros was just the amount of chefs who were at our disposal, Mr. Thompson said. It was like, Oh man, I am eating a sandwich Martha Stewart just brought in.

The job has also made it harder to fight his weight. For his birthday in January, cakes poured in from all over. Tastykake even made a delivery. They are my kryptonite, he said. The scariest thing about being here at 30 Rock is that if I mention something, a lifetime supply of it will show up.

The seminal moment in his food education came after he watched the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi and then traveled to the basement of an office tower in Tokyo to eat at the hands of the films sushi master, Jiro Ono.

Once I saw his commitment, I realized that I needed to work harder myself, he said. The visit led to a book, Something to Food About: Exploring Creativity With Innovative Chefs, which Clarkson Potter will publish in April. Written with Ben Greenman, co-writer of the Questlove memoir Mo Meta Blues, its based on lengthy interviews with 10 chefs.

Is this drive for perfection necessary for creative people, Mr. Thompson asks in the new books introduction, or is it just something that happens to creative people whether its necessary or not?

One may legitimately ask if the world needs another book examining the creative mind of the chef, but in the hands of Mr. Thompson, its a fresh ride.

He discusses race and poverty with Donald Link in New Orleans and the compromises that come with cooking in Americas culture of instant gratification with Dominique Crenn in San Francisco. He visits Nathan Myhrvold, an author of Modernist Cuisine, in Seattle, and asks Michael Solomonov, Philadelphias impresario of Israeli food, what it was like to work at his dads Subway restaurant in Israel.

The poet Elizabeth Alexander, who seemed surprised and delighted to be at the food salon last month, said she was looking forward to reading the book. She perhaps understood more than others at the party the deep link between cooking and other creative pursuits.

Her recent memoir, The Light of the World, uses food memories and recipes to explore her grief over the sudden loss of her husband, a chef and painter.

Chefs, she said in between bites of a baller lettuce cup, are just like any other artists: They are obsessive weirdos in the same way.",[]

You go to Indiana, its hard to imagine you wont run across a basketball court. Theyre like Starbucks there, only it may be easier to get a seat at Starbucks.

Indiana is known as a place where basketball is sort of like the sport, said Michael E. Keating, a photographer. Its kind of like the religion. If basketballs a religion, then the gymnasiums  theyre the places where people worship. Theyre the churches, the temples.

For the past several years, Mr. Keating and his colleague Chris Smith have crisscrossed the state, traveling more than 10,000 miles and photographing more than 100 school gymnasiums. There is no lack of choices. People in Indiana, as anyone who saw the 1986 movie Hoosiers knows, view basketball the way Southerners view football. Texas can keep its Friday night lights. Nine of the countrys 10 biggest high school gyms, the photographers say, are in Indiana.

They both say the appeal is not really the basketball. Were there for everything that surrounds the game, Mr. Keating said.

Mr. Smith said, We like to have people in the gyms. But for the photographers, its fine if it is just a practice or even a graduation. When there was some kind of activity, he said, the gyms kind of came to life.

Photo

The project began when Mr. Smith ran across a hand-tinted photograph of his father in an old team photograph and wanted to learn more. A longtime commercial photographer who also teaches photography to college students, he reached out to Mr. Keating, who had retired from The Cincinnati Enquirer after decades as a general assignment photographer. Both men are 63.

Their backgrounds are reflected in their approach to their work. Mr. Keating, Mr. Smith said, is drawn to emotion, while he tends to try to capture something a little less fleeting. Each has learned from the other.

I envy how he sees, Mr. Keating said. Because my whole training, my whole emphasis for so long was on a moment.

Getting good shots can be challenging, in part because the light in gyms is not always cooperative, Mr. Smith said. And lets face it: Not every church is Chartres, and not every gym is inspiring.

Some gyms, Mr. Keating said, choosing his words with a diplomats care, just are not interesting.

But for these two photographers, a dull gym is the exception.

THURSDAY PUZZLE  Heres what can happen when your mother eagerly signs you up for music lessons when youre a child and you dont pay attention: You grow up to be a crossword puzzle blogger, responsible for explaining the puzzle to a large number of people, and then you wind up solving  or rather, not solving  a crossword that incorporates music notation theory as part of the theme. Its like one of those stress dreams we all have, but this is for real.

Somewhere in Florida, my mother is laughing her behind off.

This is as good a time as any to admit to you that I had to look at the answers to crack the theme. That is not as bad as it sounds; who amongst us has not revealed an answer here or there? No one, thats who, and that is a good lesson for all you beginning solvers out there. Dont feel that you cant take a peek if you think youll learn something from it. That knowledge is stored away for the next time you will see it in a puzzle. Streaks be damned. [Cleans off the remains of the tomatoes thrown at me.]

Sidenote: I originally thought this puzzle was going to be a commentary about footballs DEFLATEGATE and that the black squares in the lower center of the grid represented goalposts. You see how misdirected you can get on a Thursday?

Anyway, if, unlike me, you did not fall asleep in music theory class, you will recognize that there are supposed to be two musical notes in three of the squares of Andrew Zhous mirror symmetry puzzle. Each note is used once: one note for the Across entry and one note for the Down entry. For example, at 16 Across and 6 Down, we have the respective entries MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY and THE SHARPER IMAGE. Where the two entries cross, we have the two rebus elements: F NATURAL going across and E SHARP going down.

And because you havent had enough agita for the day, all of the notes are different. If you are solving this on the web or in our app, please note that the accepted entries are supposed to be either the entire entry (either Across or Down) or the first letter. So, for 16 Across and 6 Down, the accepted answers should be F NATURAL, F, E SHARP or E.

As a public service, I would like to present you with the six theme entries:

16A/6D: MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY / THE SHARPER IMAGE

65A/53D: LOOKING SHARP / GET A FLAT

66A/55D: DEFLATEGATE / CARD SHARP

In addition, Mr. Zhou has thrown in some long Downs that highlight the theme, MUSICAL NOTE and TWO TONE CARS (sort of). For my money, One added to the staff? also wins Clue of the Day.

Constructors Notes:

A couple of months back, Evan Birnholz espoused his theory that music and crossing words have much to do with one another. Ive always thought that a good crossword works like a piece of Bachian counterpoint, in which both the vertical (harmony) and the horizontal (melody) are required to maintain absolute integrity. In that spirit, todays puzzle puns in the form of ENHARMONIC spellings, wherein the same sounded pitch (in equal temperament) is notated in two different ways. I hope it offers a significant contribution to the canon of musical puns, which includes beloved classics like, If you dont C-sharp, youll B-flat. Heres to a music-filled Thursday!

And that is why I failed to solve todays crossword puzzle, Officer. Please dont tell my mother.

We just have to move on to the Friday puzzle with this song:

A FIVE-BEDROOM VILLA ON A CANAL









$4.695 MILLION

This four-year-old house on Grand Cayman Island, in the 52-acre gated development of Vista del Mar, is on a canal leading into the North Sound. It is about a 15-minute walk from crescent-shaped Seven Mile Beach and adjacent to the Cayman Islands Yacht Club, said Malin Ratcliffe, the owner-broker of West Indies Brokers Real Estate, which has the listing. The two-story white concrete home, about 9,000 square feet on a 0.58-acre lot, has a Caribbean-style limestone finish halfway up the lower level and a red tile roof. There are five bedrooms and five and a half baths, and furnishings are included in the asking price.

A grand staircase with a limestone facade leads up from the front lawn and turns at a landing toward a covered porch and a 12-foot-high arched mahogany front door.

With the main living areas on the second floor, the house enjoys canal and North Sound views, year-round breezes and very advantageous additional protection during hurricane season, Ms. Ratcliffe said.

A small foyer opens onto a grand hall with a coffered ceiling. This room and the dining room to its left have white Egyptian stone floors inlaid with hardwood. The rest of the house also has Egyptian stone floors. Beyond the dining room is the kitchen, a breakfast nook with a love seat and a 48-inch round mahogany table, a family room and two bedrooms with en-suite baths. A white wood bar is to one side of the grand hall.

The kitchen has twin center islands topped with Carrara marble, two Viking refrigerators with freezer drawers, a Viking gas range, a pot filler, an electric oven, a warming drawer, a microwave, a dishwasher and a ceramic double sink.

Open to the kitchen, the family room has a coffered ceiling, turquoise walls and accordion glass doors leading to a covered porch overlooking an inground pool, a large gazebo that serves as an outdoor living room and cocktail lounge, the canal and North Sound.

You can really take the inside out and the outside in when you open those doors, Ms. Ratcliffe said.

A study, a guest bath and the master suite are to the right of the grand hall. The master bedroom has a four-poster bed and a coffered ceiling. A door leads to the porch.

The master bath is tiled with Carrara marble and has a whirlpool tub and a separate walk-in shower. A double vanity has a Carrara marble countertop.

Downstairs, a three-car garage leads to the first-floor foyer, an elevator, a powder room, a laundry room and a staircase with a wrought iron railing to the second floor. The open layout downstairs incorporates a media room, a playroom, a billiards room and a game room opening to a covered patio with a heated whirlpool tub.

Two downstairs bedrooms share a bath. All the bedrooms have ceiling fans; the house has five air-conditioning zones.

Mature redwood, almond, mango and royal palm trees dot the lawn.

Behind the gazebo, a slip on the canal accommodates a 20-foot boat.

A dedicated slip for a 65-foot boat is at the Vista del Mar marina next door. There is also a tennis court in the development, which has about 27 homes. Restaurants, beach bars, shopping, resorts, hotels and spas are within walking distance on the nearby Seven Mile Beach corridor. Golf courses are also nearby. Owen Roberts International Airport is a 20-minute drive.

MARKET OVERVIEW

With about 58,000 residents, Grand Cayman, at 76 square miles, is the biggest of the three Cayman Islands, which are a British Overseas Territory in the western Caribbean.

The islands economy lags two to three years behind that of the United States, said Sheena Conolly, the broker-owner of Cayman Island Sothebys. Accordingly, 2011 and 2012 were tough years for the Cayman Islands.

The turnaround began in 2013. During the last nine months, the market has been extremely buoyant, Ms. Ratcliffe said. We are seeing a definite uptick. With inventory falling, the buyers market of the last few years is giving way to a sellers market.

Rentals and tourism are also up. The volume of transactions has gone up 90 percent in the last 12 months, Ms. Conolly said. Price points are shifting up.

The biggest increase was on Seven Mile Beach, where prices for condominiums range from $500,000 to many millions, Ms. Conolly said. In other beachfront areas, prices start at $350,000. Prices for canalfront, beachfront or oceanfront single-family homes begin at around $2 million, she said.

Along Seven Mile Beach, condominiums in buildings ranging from three to 10 stories are often bought for investment and rented out. Canalfront single-family homes are typically primary residences for executives from nearby George Towns financial center, or vacation homes for buyers with a penchant for deep-sea fishing or sailing.

WHO BUYS ON GRAND CAYMAN

People from 130 countries live and work here, Ms. Conolly said. Its very diverse and dynamic.

At least 75 percent of buyers come from the United States and Canada, Ms. Ratcliffe said, in addition to a smaller number from Europe and South America. Snowbirds living near cities in the United States with direct flights are prevalent among home buyers.

BUYING BASICS

Foreigners are welcome to buy real estate in the Cayman Islands, as long as they provide satisfactory due-diligence paperwork to comply with our money laundering legislation, said Ian Jamieson, a lawyer based on Grand Cayman. Potential buyers need to supply proof of identity along with references from a bank or similar financial institution plus references from a professional like a lawyer or an accountant.

Financing of up to 90 percent of the purchase price is available to qualified buyers.

There is no title insurance here in Cayman, so it is advisable to have an attorney represent a buyer in a transaction from the outset, not just at closing, Mr. Jamieson said. Lawyers review and investigate the title, handle the closing and register the transaction and buyer information with the governments Lands and Survey Department.

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Warhol and Avedon Form an Unlikely Tandem in London,['Farah Nayeri'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

LONDON  If his diaries are any indication, Andy Warhol had little affection for Richard Avedon. In an entry from December 1976, Warhol recalled running into a woman they both knew at a dinner party in New York.









We talked about how horrible Avedon is, Warhol wrote. She said he gets what he wants out of a person and then drops them. I agreed and then everybody screamed at me that I do the same thing.

Whatever their animosities, Avedon and Warhol are being posthumously paired in an exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery here. The show, which runs through April 23, presents 33 Warhol silk-screens and 22 Avedon works (including a single series of 69 portraits) dating from the 1950s to the 1990s.

At first glance, they form an awkward tandem, as towering figures in separate artistic disciplines.

But they had similar backgrounds and early career trajectories. Born five years apart in the 1920s to East European immigrant families, they got their starts in the New York fashion world, both working for Bonwit Teller and Harpers Bazaar. Although their paths then diverged  Avedon shifting from fashion photography to portraiture and Warhol becoming a painter and filmmaker and a Pop Art stalwart  they moved in the same New York circles, often portraying the same people.

Photo

The Gagosian is illustrating that overlap, eager to present the two men as equals who documented similar themes from different angles, thrusting aside hierarchical distinctions between painting and photography. The exhibition also has a commercial logic: It presents the work of two hugely famous artists, one of whom (Avedon) has the advantage of being relatively affordable.

The majority of the Avedons and a number of the Warhols are for sale, with prices that Gagosian says range from the tens of thousands to the millions of dollars.

The idea for a combined exhibition came up in 2011 after the Avedon Foundation  a nonprofit organization that owns Avedons photographs, negatives and archives and raises money through print sales  made the Gagosian its exclusive representative. The gallery thought of twinning Avedon with an artist to change peoples ideas about photography and the standing of photography in the world, said Kara Vander Weg, a director of the Gagosian in New York.

Mark Francis, a Gagosian director in London who previously steered the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, described both artists as recording angels of their period.

Its impossible to understand the visual world of today without either one of them, Mr. Francis said. So I dont think were trying to force a relation between them, either historically or iconographically.

The first room of the exhibition plays on the theme of power. On the main wall is Avedons The Family from 1976, a group of 69 portraits of American establishment figures including President Gerald Ford, Senator Edward M. Kennedy and his mother Rose Kennedy , and a young Donald Rumsfeld, a briefcase tucked under his arm. Hanging on other walls are Warhol portraits of personalities from the period, including Mao Zedong and the shah of Iran with his wife and sister.

A radically different family appears in the next room, in Avedons sprawling triptych Andy Warhol and Members of the Factory (1969). Warhol lurks in the corner of the image, while his disciples, five of them nude, take center stage. He reappears on the wall across  in the famous Avedon portrait of his scarred torso, taken in 1969, a year after he survived an assassination attempt. Other Warhols in the same room depict the artists Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring and the drag queen Wilhelmina Ross.

Photo

Death is evoked in the next gallery. Surrounding Warhols Last Supper (1986) are silk-screens of a skull and a gun, and a bewigged self-portrait. They are interspersed with Avedon portraits of the authors Samuel Beckett and Truman Capote, of the two killers depicted by Capote in his book In Cold Blood, and of a melancholy Marilyn Monroe.

The last room is a celebrity potpourri. There are Warhol silk-screens of a mourning Jacqueline Kennedy, of Liza Minnelli, Elvis Presley and Monroe. Avedon is represented by portraits of Mrs. Kennedy in happier times, Audrey Hepburn and a playful Charlie Chaplin.

Donna De Salvo, a deputy director of the Whitney Museum who curated Tate Moderns 2002 Warhol retrospective, and who is staging one at the Whitney in 2018, described Avedon and Warhol as a provocative pairing but a valid one, though she had not yet seen the Gagosian show.

Avedons work to me was always on this fine line between fashion and high art, and thats the line Warhol walked as well, Ms. De Salvo said. She noted that the two artists did in fact share a medium: Warhol would be inconceivable without the photographic image. Its so deeply embedded.

She described Avedon as a giant of photography who was a worthy exhibition companion for Warhol. In any event, nobody can diminish Warhol: You can put him with just about anything, she said. He becomes a great foil to play off.

In London for the opening was the Avedon Foundations executive director, James Martin, who was Avedons studio assistant before his death in 2004. He described the photographer as extremely demanding  a demanding that was absolutely invigorating and horrifying at the same time. You wouldnt want to mess it up.

Mr. Martin, who also was Avedons darkroom technician, said it sometimes took more than a dozen versions of a print to satisfy him. This needs to be more dramatic, Avedon would respond at first, Mr. Martin recalled. When the next version was shown to him, he would say, Well, maybe youve captured the ear. Match the rest of the print with the drama of that ear.

Despite the challenges, Mr. Martin said he missed having Avedon around, including for the installation of this show.

There is a burden that I have of no longer having his voice there to steer the ship, he said. What I miss is the certainty that he would take into all these decisions that were faced with.",[]

Bob Dylan is on the move yet again, with a new album and tour.

After returning from a series of concerts in Japan in April, Mr. Dylan, 74, will embark on a 27-date American tour in June and July, in support of a coming album, Fallen Angels, according to a brief announcement on Mr. Dylans website on Monday.

The tour, featuring Mavis Staples as the opening act, will start with two shows at the Chateau Ste. Michelle Winery in Woodinville, Wash., on June 4 and 5, and continue through July 17, with a performance at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford, N.H. The tour will include a stop on July 8 at the Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, where Mr. Dylan last played on Aug. 28, 1965. Tickets for the shows will go on sale at various times, with the first of them selling on Friday.

Mr. Dylans website gives little information about Fallen Angels, even a release date. The album is his first since Shadows in the Night, a year ago, with covers of traditional pop standards associated with Frank Sinatra, including Im a Fool to Want You  one of the very few songs in which Sinatra has a writing credit. One perk: for most shows, customers buying a pair of tickets will get a redemption code for the CD, the announcement said.

Some sleuthing fans, looking at recent statements from Dylan collaborators like the producer Daniel Lanois, have surmised that Fallen Angels will be another standards record. The title, for one thing, may be a reference to the 1945 film noir Fallen Angel by Otto Preminger, who also directed Sinatra in The Man With the Golden Arm.

Many conservatives believe that the Republican Party needs an overhaul.









Im not saying someone shouldnt blow up the Republican Party. Im saying that that someone shouldnt be an unprincipled imposter, David Harsanyi wrote last month in The Federalist, an arch conservative publication.

The impulse to blow the whole thing up has been out there for a while, but politicians whose skill we may have underestimated were able to hold the Republican coalition together. Whatever else you say about him, Mitt Romney won more than 60 million votes in 2012.

But this years campaign is the culmination of a shift in the composition of the Republican electorate that has been underway for some time.

Tom Davis, who served as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee from 1999 to 2003, argued in an interview that the Republican Party has been losing voters among whites elites in Northern suburbs while gaining ground in the heartland, from Appalachia to struggling towns and counties like Fall River, Mass., Atkinson County, Ga., and Macon County, Tennessee, where Donald Trump recently won primary contests by huge margins.

After the Bush administration, Davis said, with two unpopular wars and a financial meltdown, there was nothing left, the party was a shell. They destroyed it.

By the standards of contemporary ideological conviction, Davis, now the rector of George Mason University, is a moderate Republican.

Tony Fabrizio, a Republican campaign strategist, is well to Daviss right, but he has a complementary analysis:

For a while the base of the G.O.P. has been far closer to where Trump is on the issues than their leadership. The base of the G.O.P. has never really been true free-traders, theyve always been fair traders, the leadership of the party wants to embrace some form of amnesty for illegals, the base of the party does not.

This intraparty rift between the more traditional Republican voters who favor free trade and international goals and the ascendant protectionist and nationalist wing has fomented what we are seeing today with Trump, Fabrizio said.

The Republican Party, as it was, has gone into retreat even as it struggles to maintain control. The steady abandonment of norms and standards  the pro forma observance of which was once considered essential to the political process  has reinforced this development.

In National Review, Andrew McCarthy argues that cultural rot has infected the Republican electorate:

What is the natural progression from turning the campus and pop culture over to Amerika-hating radicals, to the vigorous years-long media defense of Bill Clintons right to turn the White House into a cathouse, to the inability of a father to watch baseball with his young son at one oclock on a Sunday afternoon without being ready to address erectile dysfunction? It is the cretinous Donald J. Trump campaign.

McCarthy, a former assistant U.S. attorney, continued:

Donald Trump is not the cause of deterioration in our politics. He is the effect of deterioration in our culture.

Tom Davis similarly noted that the shift of the Republican base to more working class white communities has changed the cultural character of the Republican electorate. Republican voters are now more guttural, as Davis put it, more comfortable with Trumps boastful, violent rhetoric and less connected to the cosmopolitan, modulated language of suburbia.

The deterioration of popular culture is a fact of life, as anyone who watches television knows. Politicians, of necessity, treat the electorate in much the same way corporations view the marketplace: failure to meet the customers needs, desires and values is a sure path to political suicide or corporate bankruptcy.

To the degree that Trump represents a substantial and growing sector of the Republican electorate, his success so far is the natural result of the primary process, not a corruption of it.

Some conservatives have trouble accepting this. Trumps brawling, blustery, mean-spirited public persona serves to associate conservatives with all the negative stereotypes that liberals have for decades attached to their opponents on the right, Michael Medved, the conservative talk show host, wrote in National Review in January:

Trump is the living, breathing, bellowing personification of all the nasty characteristics Democrats routinely ascribe to Republicans.

In an email, Jonah Goldberg, a senior editor at National Review and a columnist for the Los Angeles Times, expressed his concerns.

On one hand,

my own position is that this is a matter of honor and integrity now and that I cant belong to a party led by Donald Trump. But more practically I think that if the G.O.P. makes this joke its leader, it will do enormous and probably permanent damage to the party.

At the same time, Goldberg notes, a lot of the blame for the emergence of Trump lies with party elites who have failed to respond to issues raised by younger, reform-minded conservatives:

People like Ramesh Ponnuru, Yuval Levin, Arthur Brooks, Bob Doar et al. have been proposing everything from child-tax credits to apprentice programs, and they were criticized as social engineers, liberals, RINOs, etc. by self-appointed purists. Now, many of those same purists are swooning for Trump. Larry Kudlow is backing a protectionist! Jerry Falwell, Jr. is backing a Caligula!

Trumps direct appeal to racial and ethnic resentment  of Hispanics and Muslims, for now  has made him the most disruptive force in presidential politics since the emergence of Gov. George Wallace of Alabama in the 1960s and 1970s. Wallace, more than anyone else, amplified the salience of race in American politics, which led to the abandonment of the Democratic Party by white Southerners and spurred a Republican realignment of the region.

You could make a case that the politics of rage has gone from George Wallace, morphed into Nixon and the southern states strategy, then Gingrich and his merry band, into Fox News/Limbaugh/Tea Party Republicans, Larry OBrien III (a son of Lawrence Francis Larry OBrien, who was John F. Kennedys chief political strategist) wrote me, adding

Its not quite linear, but is Trump a sea change, a big leap, or merely the next iteration?

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Jack Shafer, writing for Politico, also points to the parallel between Wallace and Trump:

In 1964, during the presidential campaign, Maryland Sen. Daniel Brewster called Wallace a professional liar, a bigot and an aspiring dictator and a certain enemy of the Constitution of the United States. My, how that sounds familiar.

While Wallace used race to force a major restructuring of both the Democratic and Republican Parties, Trumps populism is driving a wedge into the heart of the Republican Party.

The alliance of the business wing of the G.O.P. and the working-class wing is already fractured, Heather Richardson, a professor of history at Boston College, emailed in response to my inquiry:

Trump is simply reflecting what poor voters already know: that they have been sold a bill of goods. They respond to his naked hatred of people of color and women because that is the language and the argument they have known their whole lives, but they also like his apparent attacks on the people who betrayed them.

Still, in political terms, the question is: Does Donald Trump represent a legitimate expression of the peoples will? Is his rise a manifestation of justifiable resentment among less privileged whites at their neglect by higher caste Republican leaders?

Dean Baker, a liberal economist, contends in an email that the Trump phenomenon opens future opportunities for a new populist politics. The big question, Baker writes,

is whether such a politics will be a dead end that tries to set the clock back by being a white peoples populism  treating African Americans, Hispanics, and other ethnic/racial groups as the enemy. Or whether it will be a forward thinking approach that formulates an economic policy designed to reverse the enormous upward redistribution that has been engineered by the leadership of both political parties over the last three and half decades.

Trumps nativist appeal will strengthen the anti-immigrant wing of the Republican Party. This success will mute the call of Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, to seek votes from the growing Hispanic population.

Regardless of the final outcome, Trump has proven that the traditional Republican Party has lost influence, so much so that a demonstrably duplicitous public figure, a man seemingly without conscience, can take the lead and hold it at least into March.

Trumps liabilities were put on full display before the 16.9 million viewers who watched the March 3 debate in Detroit, the most revealing (if least enlightening) confrontation of the campaign.

Despite that, Trump easily won the Michigan primary on Tuesday, a key test of the candidates strength in the rust belt. He won an outright majority in Mississippi and increased his lead in the delegate count overall.

Trump had already revealed the vulnerability of both the Republican Party and the conservative movement, institutions that together claimed the presidency in seven of the ten elections between 1968 and 2004.

He has reconvened the largely passive silent majority  the Reagan Democrats and the angry white men of past elections  and turned it into a renegade force that has rebelled against its marginal status in the Republican coalition.

How the Republican Party deals with this insurgency will define much of American political life this year, on into 2018 and 2020. If by popular acclaim Trump is legitimated, the party will be forced to acquiesce. But looked at another way, it no longer matters whether Trump wins the Republican nomination. His emotional baggage and his political doctrine have already had an incalculable impact, and it is not a force for good.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-02-25 00:00:00,Lessons From Game Theory: What Keeps Kasich in the Race?,['Kevin Quealy'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The Republican establishment has a problem. It is headed for a car crash.









With Jeb Bush out of the Republican presidential race, the two remaining mainstream candidates  Marco Rubio and John Kasich  are living out an issue studied for decades in game theory. Game theorists might call the G.O.P. predicament an anti-coordination game or even a volunteers dilemma. But most of us might call it by a more familiar name: chicken.

Although Mr. Rubio is the obvious establishment favorite, leading Mr. Kasich in national polls, prediction markets and delegate math, the two are splitting some votes. To have his best chance against Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, Mr. Rubio needs Mr. Kasich to drop out. The longer both candidates remain in the race, the worse it is for both of them. Its safe to assume neither would like to see Mr. Trump get the nomination.

In An Essay on Bargaining, a classic paper from 1956, Thomas Schelling lays out several strategies that may be useful for both Mr. Kasich and Mr. Rubio. Here, we focus on three: commitment, promises and threats. As Richard Thaler, the behavioral economist at the University of Chicago, explained, the strategies can be applied to anything: health care, nuclear deterrence, the last piece of pizza.

Mr. Kasichs first option, of course, is to stay in the race. But he could go further, by committing to stay in no matter what. In a classic game of chicken between two drivers rushing headlong toward each other, this strategy is like removing your steering wheel, leaving you no choice but to drive straight toward your opponent.

Mr. Kasich could defend this choice by pointing to his obstacle-strewn but possible path to the nomination. He might point out that only a tiny fraction of Republican delegates have been allocated; he might note that he could pick up many of Mr. Bushs voters; he could hope for another robotic debate performance from Mr. Rubio or even an implosion from the Trump or Cruz campaigns.

This series of events is unlikely, of course. It doesnt matter how long Mr. Kasich actually intends to stay in the race. All that matters is whether Mr. Rubio believes he will do so. (If youre going to remove your steering wheel, make sure the other driver sees you do it!) The more believable the commitment, the stronger his negotiating position for the far more effective strategy in brinkmanship games: cutting a deal.

Side deals, bargains or promises are the way negotiations actually get done. In a 1984 paper on the private supply of a public good, the economists Christopher Bliss and Barry Nalebuff wrote that binding agreements combined with side payments can always produce a superior outcome to brinkmanship.

Some deals are obvious; the best such deal would be a spot on the presidential ticket, which Mr. Rubio could offer Mr. Kasich in exchange for dropping out  provided he becomes the nominee, of course. (A simple Google search of Rubio Kasich side deals produces no shortage of opinions on the matter.)

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

There are other potential promises. It might take the form of a concession on another matter  Mr. Rubio could promise to adopt or address some of Mr. Kasichs issues, which would allow Mr. Kasich to end his campaign and claim a small victory. In the book Prisoners Dilemma, William Poundstone suggests that the best solution to a game of chicken is one that allows the losing party to give in while still saving face. He noted its role in bringing a peaceful end to the Cuban missile crisis.

Regardless of the details, the quality of the deal depends on how much a Kasich exit matters to Mr. Rubio. The more crucial his exit, the stronger any promise is sure to be.

There is a third strategy available to Mr. Kasich, which takes the form of threats. Here, Mr. Kasich might insist on a promise or concession from Mr. Rubio; if he doesnt get it, he could threaten to support a different candidate, like Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz. That move wouldnt serve shared establishment interests, but if the threat had the potential to damage Mr. Rubio enough, it could be a useful bargaining chip. Being crazy is a strategy, but only if your opponent actually believes it, Mr. Thaler said. Of the three strategies described here, this seems least likely.

Two external factors complicate this matter further.

Part of the reason this dilemma exists in the first place is that mainstream Republicans lack the unity or influence to compel any cooperation. After the New Hampshire primary, one Republican likened the battle among mainstream candidates to a hockey fight: The gloves are off and the refs cant get in the middle of it. Thats exactly right.

If establishment Republicans had a clear, unimpeachable leader who was not a participant in the race, that person might be able to compel a candidate to drop out and support whomever the party determined to be strongest, allowing candidates who quit to save face by saying they did it for the good of the party. At the moment, no such leader exists for mainstream Republicans, resulting in a tragedy of the commons-like failure of collective action.

Second, this is a game thats played just once. The chance to be your partys nominee for president comes along only every four or eight years, even for the very luckiest candidates. If the candidates lived in a universe in which they could run for president hundreds of times, they might agree that, on average, their shared interests were better served by cooperating. Once in a while, Mr. Kasich might try to win the contest outright against long odds, but, on average, he would probably agree that cooperating, including alternating victories, was the best way to serve his and Mr. Rubios shared interests. Game theory shows that in iterated dilemmas, played many hundreds or thousands of times, cooperation is a very stable strategy  one reason it is so common in nature.

But this is not an iterated dilemma. Its a one-time-only dilemma with a tremendous payoff for the winner. As much as Mr. Kasich might think about his legacy, the good of the party or even his own chances in 2020 or 2024, the future is very far away.

Ultimately, they risk an outcome neither he nor Mr. Rubio wants. As Daniel Diermeier, the dean of the public policy school at the University of Chicago, notes, A very important lesson of game theory is that sometimes the world is a grim place.",[]

WASHINGTON  The Secret Service on Tuesday night arrested a man suspected of shooting a pastor in Idaho after the man traveled here and threw unidentified objects over the White House fence, a spokesman for the Secret Service said in a statement.

Ths suspect, Kyle A. Odom, was arrested by uniformed officers for the Secret Service on the south side of the White House complex. Officials said the material thrown over the fence had been determined to be nonhazardous.

Officials quickly learned that Mr. Odom was accused by Idaho law enforcement officials of attempted murder in the shooting of the Rev. Tim Remington, who was shot six times Sunday outside his church in Coeur dAlene, Idaho.

Odom was arrested on the outstanding warrant, and he was transported to the Metropolitan Police Department for processing, the Secret Service said in a statement. The U.S. Secret Service, through its Washington Field Office and Spokane Resident Office, is coordinating with the Coeur dAlene Police Department.

Mr. Remington, who on Saturday led a prayer at a campaign rally for Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican presidential candidate, was recovering at a hospital on Tuesday and had regained consciousness, The Associated Press reported.

After the shooting, the A.P. reported, several news outlets received letters purporting to be from Mr. Odom that contained references to President Obama, members of Congress, members of the Israeli government and an official at the church with which Mr. Remington is associated.

The A.P. said Mr. Odom is a former Marine who has a history of mental illness. The news service said that he served in the Marines from 2006 to 2010 and had received an Iraq Campaign medal and other awards. According to the A.P., Mr. Odom was able to board a plane in Boise despite the fact that the authorities in Idaho had issued a warrant for his arrest after the shooting.

I think everyone can breathe a good sigh of relief that at least this part of the case has come to a conclusion, Lee White, the police chief in Coeur dAlene, told The A.P.

The Secret Service referred further questions about Mr. Odom to the Coeur dAlene police department.",[]

Donald Trump is a walking political science course. His meteoric rise is lesson No. 1 on leadership: Most voters do not listen through their ears. They listen through their stomachs. If a leader can connect with them on a gut level, their response is: Dont bother me with the details. I trust your instincts. If a leader cant connect on a gut level, he or she cant show them enough particulars. Theyll just keep asking, Can you show me the details one more time?









Trumps Republican rivals keep thinking that if they just point out a few more details about him, voters will drop The Donald and turn to one of them instead. But you cant talk voters out of something that they havent been talked into.

Many have come to Trump out of a gut feeling that this is a guy who knows their pain, even if he really doesnt. Many of his supporters are from the #middleagewhitemalesmatter movement, for whom the current age of acceleration has not been kind and for whom Trumps rallies are their way of saying Can you hear me now? and of sticking it to all the people who exploited their pain but left them behind, particularly traditional Republican elites. They are not interested in Trumps details. They like his gut.

And no wonder. Those G.O.P. elites sold their own souls and their party so many times to charlatans and plutocrats that you wonder when its going to show up on closeout on eBay: For sale: The G.O.P. soul. Almost empty. This soul was previously sold to Sarah Palin, the Tea Party anarchists, Rush Limbaugh, Grover Norquist, the gun lobby, the oil industry, the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson and Fox News. Will bargain. No offer too low.

Normally smart people, like Mitt Romney, discarded all their best instincts to suck up to this ragtag assortment of self-appointed G.O.P. commissars, each representing a different slice of what came to be Republican orthodoxy  climate change is a hoax; abortion, even in the case of rape or incest, is impermissible; even common-sense gun laws must be opposed, no matter how many kids get murdered; taxes must always be cut and safety nets shrunk, no matter what the economic context; Obamacare must be destroyed, even though it was based on a Republican idea; and Iraq was a success even though it was a mess.

The G.O.P. became an accretion of ideas that ossified over the years without the party ever stopping to ask afresh: What world are we living in now? What are the dominant trends? And how does America best exploit them by applying conservative values and market-based solutions?

The cynicism of todays G.O.P. could not have been more vividly displayed than when Marco Rubio, John Kasich (a decent guy) and Ted Cruz all declared that they would support the partys nominee, even if it was Trump, right after telling voters he was a con man. No wonder so many Republicans are voting for Trump on the basis of what they think is in his guts. All the other G.O.P. candidates have none.

But even if his support is weakening, Democrats take Trump lightly at their peril. He is still sitting with three aces that he hasnt played yet. They could all come out in the general election.

One ace is that if he wins the nomination he will have no problem moving to the center to appeal to independents and minorities. He will have no problem playing the moderate unifier  and plenty of people will buy it, saying: Why not give him a chance? He says he can make us winners. Sure, Mexico will have to pay for that wall, Trump will say, but it will be in installments. Deport 11 million illegal immigrants? Cmon, dont you know an opening bid on an immigration bill when you hear one? Ban all Muslims? Well of course we cant ban a whole faith community, but Trump will vow to be much harder on visas from certain countries. Have you never read The Art of the Deal?

His second ace is that given the position he staked out on terrorism, if, God forbid, there is a major terrorist attack on our soil between now and Election Day, Trump will reap enormous political benefits. Watch out. Ive seen how one well-timed terrorist attack tilted an Israeli election.

His third ace is that he will indeed go after Hillary Clinton in ways you never heard before and that will delight and bring back a lot of disaffected Republicans, whose hatred of Hillary knows no bounds. Did you hear what Trump said about Hillary last night? That she was Bills enabler! Finally! I will vote for him just for that. Again, beware.

But Trump is also holding two jokers with those aces. One of the lessons I learned covering the Middle East is that the only good thing about extremists is that they dont know when to stop  and in the end, they often do themselves in. See: Saddam Hussein.

Trump has already gone places no candidate ever has, even telling us he has a big penis. One day he may go too far (if he hasnt already) and sever his gut connection with voters. Trumps other joker is that among those attracted to his gut are racists and fascists with a taste for violence at his rallies. One day they may go too far and do something so ugly, so brownshirt, it will also turn people off to his gut.

In short, only Trump can trump Trump. Dont count on it, but dont count it out.",[]

The steaks in a presidential election have never been higher.









After his victories in the Michigan and Mississippi Republican primaries on Tuesday night, Donald J. Trump held a news conference at his golf resort in Jupiter, Fla., in which he briefly turned cable news networks into his own personal warehouse club. With the usual row of United States flags was a display table of products: Americas brand alongside Mr. Trumps, not necessarily in that order. There was Trump Water, wines from Trump Winery and, above all, a bloody heap of steaks.

It was the most brazen display of meat in an American presidential campaign since last Thursdays Republican debate.

On a literal level, Mr. Trumps prime-time infomercial was a rebuttal to, and a taunt at, Mitt Romney, who, in a broadside last Thursday, had painted him as a business failure. After some opening remarks about the days vote and his immigration proposals, Mr. Trump turned to Job 1: defending his brand. I built a great, great company, Mr. Trump said. You have the water. You have the steaks. He added, You have the wines and all of that.

There was something atavistic about the exhibition. Mr. Trump was a chieftain demonstrating his potency with a flourish of baksheesh. (He offered reporters there a free bottle of wine.) He was a Bronze Age ruler displaying trophies to his challengers. Look on my works, ye Mitt, and despair!

Were the Trump Steaks the same product Mr. Trump once sold through the Sharper Image catalog? Was the magazine he brandished the same one Mr. Romney cited as a failure? Apparently not, but then again this contest, if not Mr. Trumps entire career, has been about appearance versus reality, or the ability of appearances to create their own reality.

Branding, Mr. Trumps specialty, is the capitalist version of transubstantiation. The businessman-celebrity bestows his blessing on a humble slab of meat and lo, it becomes a Trump Steak. The word made flesh, water and wine  from a candidate who once referred to the New Testament book as Two Corinthians. It was like the wedding at Cana meets the miracle of loaves and fishes, had they been catered by Ruths Chris.

The event also proved, again, Mr. Trumps ability to lease news network airtime rent-free. The cable news networks stuck with his remarks even as returns came in from a nail-biter of a Democratic primary in Michigan and that partys front-runner, Hillary Clinton, gave her own speech.

Given that Mrs. Clinton was on her way to a surprise loss in Michigan to Bernie Sanders, Mr. Trump may have run welcome interference for her. Nor was Mr. Trump the only candidate on Tuesday engaging in visual branding. Mr. Sanders gave brief remarks in front of what looked like someones wooden backyard deck, a few campaign placards tacked up behind him  the image contrasting his campaign against Mrs. Clintons more traditional political theater, his populist roughage against Mr. Trumps Vegas rib-eye buffet.

In part, Mr. Trumps extended airtime once again owes to his decision to hold news conferences on election nights, rather than making a standard speech. By taking questions after his remarks, he guarantees the cameras stay on him longer.

But theres also the now-familiar rubbernecking effect, the sense that  even as he rambles on about his poll numbers and his golf courses and his theory of never settling lawsuits  he might just say something wild. That, again, is where the steaks come in. Mr. Trump has a knack for creating just enough bizarre spectacle that newsroom producers feel it would be televisual malpractice to cut away.

And in the meantime, there was the image of him, surrounded by the products that sent the gut message he wanted to convey: success, luxury, abundance. Attack the authenticity of Donald Trumps steaks all you want, with as many facts as you like. He will still be there, selling the sizzle.",[]

Harold H. Saunders, a diplomat who helped draft the Camp David peace accords between Israel and Egypt in 1978 and helped negotiate the release of American hostages from the United States Embassy in Tehran in 1981, died on Sunday in McLean, Va. He was 85.









The cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, Carol.

Mr. Saunders served under six presidents, including Richard M. Nixon, for whom he shuttled among Middle East capitals with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger in the 1970s.

Mr. Saunders was an indispensable member of the Middle East team who was especially important in emphasizing the psychological and moral dimensions of problems, Dr. Kissinger said on Wednesday.

Hal was imperturbable, Gary G. Sick, a former colleague, wrote in All Fall Down: Americas Tragic Encounter With Iran, published in 1985.

He had looked disaster in the face in one negotiation after another over more than two decades and had concluded that despair was an emotion the negotiator could ill afford, Mr. Sick wrote. As he told his staff on many occasions, Our job is to take a 10 percent chance of success, try to turn it into a 20 percent chance, and hope for a break.

Mr. Saunders was credited as one of the architects of the Camp David accords, which President Jimmy Carter had midwived and which led to a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. Mr. Saunders had reportedly hoped to extract more concessions from Israel.

He was also the leading adviser to Deputy Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher, the Carter administrations chief negotiator during the Iran hostage crisis, in which revolutionaries seized the embassy and held 52 people hostage for 444 days to try to force the United States to return the deposed shah from New York, where he was being treated for cancer.

Harold Henry Saunders was born on Dec. 27, 1930, in Philadelphia to Harold M. Saunders, an architect, and the former Marian Weihenmayer, a jewelry designer.

He graduated from Princeton University in 1952 with a bachelors degree in English and received a doctorate in American studies from Yale University. After serving in the Air Force as a lieutenant and as an analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency, he joined the National Security Council staff in 1961.

Mr. Saunders was named a deputy assistant secretary of state in 1974, then director of the State Departments Bureau of Intelligence and Research, and served as assistant secretary for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs from 1978 to 1981.

After leaving government, he wrote several books about diplomacy, was associated with the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution, and was director of international affairs at the Kettering Foundation, a research group dedicated to furthering democracy.

His first wife, the former Barbara McGarrigle, died in 1973. In addition to his wife, the former Carol Jones Cruse, he is survived by a son, Mark; a daughter, Catherine; a stepdaughter, Caryn Hoadley; three grandchildren; and two step-grandsons.

In 1980, after the United States voted to support a United Nations resolution condemning the establishment of Israeli settlements on the West Bank of the Jordan River, Mayor Edward I. Koch of New York branded Mr. Saunders and four other American diplomats members of an Arabist gang of five who, Mr. Koch said, were in a position to do great damage to Israel.

Mr. Carter immediately repudiated the vote. (He said it had resulted from a miscommunication.)

Mr. Saunders later said that he had come to realize how difficult it would be for Israel to withdraw from the occupied West Bank. But while deploring violence, he often argued, as he did in an Op-Ed article for The New York Times, that the Palestine Liberation Organization belonged at the negotiating table and that the U.S. remains committed to a Jewish state  but to one sharing Palestine with its Arab neighbors, not dominating all of it.

Mr. Saunders was credited by a number of colleagues with adopting (many say originating) the phrase peace process for Mr. Kissingers efforts in the Middle East. He defined the term for William Safire, the On Language columnist for The New York Times Magazine, as encompassing a full range of political, psychological, economic, diplomatic and military actions woven together into a comprehensive effort to establish peace between Israel and its neighbors.

He later came to the conclusion, though, that not every comprehensive solution could be imposed by government. Asked by The Times as the millennium approached to name the new era, he suggested The Citizens Century.

An era has begun in which governments face more and more problems they cannot deal with, he explained. Citizens outside government increasingly have an opportunity to fill that void.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,The Presidential Plot Thickens,"['Gail Collins', 'Brooks Gail Collins', 'Arthur C']","Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Arthur Brooks: Hi, Gail. What a week, right? No huge surprises on Super Tuesday, as Trump increased his plurality with wins in a majority of states. Thursdays Republican debate was yet another dumpster fire of insults and name-calling.









But then the plot thickened. On Saturday, Cruz had massive wins in Kansas and Maine, and only narrowly lost to Trump in Kentucky and Louisiana. As of now, Cruz is closely trailing Trump in the delegate count  Trump is up 384-300. Rubio is a distant third at 151.

The Democrats, on the other hand, have gotten enviably boring. At this point, the Clinton campaigns grim march to victory is looking inevitable, right?

Gail Collins: Arthur, I have already admitted that the Hillary-Bernie battle has ceased to be all that thrilling. Really  issues, issues, issues. Yawn. Im sure the Democrats wish they could have all the excitement and color of Donald Trump stomping toward the nomination over the still-struggling bodies of the most hated man in the Senate and an increasingly juvenile Floridian whos terrified hell lose his own state.

Arthur: Youre a regular Don Rickles today. Next youll call John Kasich a hockey puck.

Gail: Show respect. Kasich beat Marco Rubio for third place in Maine. And hes promised that if hes elected hell reunite Pink Floyd.

Arthur: Well, reuniting Pink Floyd could be a controversial policy. Theyre foreigners and will take the jobs of hard-working American rock musicians.

I wanted to ask your thoughts on an under-reported factoid that caught my eye this week: Sanders actually took a slightly larger percentage of Democratic votes cast on Super Tuesday than Trump took on the Republican side (39 percent versus 38 percent). They were dead even in places like Virginia and Massachusetts. Yet the media reported Super Tuesday as a humiliation for Bernie and a huge, huge win for Trump.

I continue to maintain that Trumpmania is as much a press phenomenon as a popular phenomenon, and supply is in large part creating its own demand. What do you think?

Gail: The press hardly made him up. In fact, speaking on behalf of the political writers of America, I would like to point out that 99 percent of us totally discounted his candidacy until he started to climb in the polls.

Arthur: Youre right, almost everybody discounted his candidacy at first. But the media covered him like the O.J. trial. During one window last summer, he was given 78 percent of the primetime CNN coverage of all the Republican candidates. That was seven times the total airtime for the next closest contender. This amounted to a de facto press blackout on everyone else. Kind of amazing that Cruz or Rubio could get any traction at all.

Gail: Bottom line from the last week is that Cruz will probably be the last non-Donald standing. I know you dont take sides in these matters, but you know a lot of serious, establishment Republicans. What fills them with more horror  Nominee Cruz or Nominee Trump?

Arthur: Well, I think the term establishment is increasingly problematic now that it is used to describe Tea Party favorites like Senators Mike Lee and Ben Sasse. But to answer your question without picking sides myself, I have heard many on the center-right say they would prefer Cruz. The chief reason they give is the Supreme Court, where Cruz has won five cases. Those who support Cruz feel that he can be counted on to make appointments in the Scalia mold. And there is no fear that he might nominate Judge Judy.

Heres something I always meant to ask you. As a loyal fan of your regular column, I sense that you were a bit more optimistic about some of the mainstream Republican candidates early on, but then soured on all of them. What happened?

Gail: Optimistic is a term I would never use about this group. But it is true that early on I was impressed by the fresh faces on the Republican side. Fresh faces was obviously not a great Democratic plus factor.

Then it turned out all the fresh faces were terrible candidates. Just take the way Marco Rubio turned into a Trump Mini-me  the man who gave the Republican campaign the new theme of undersized genitals. Geesh.

Arthur: As the father of multiple teenagers (pray for me), I am not going to defend silly name-calling. But I cant agree at all that Rubio is a Trump clone. Like or dislike him, he is a serious candidate with a lot of policy ideas. And as far as I know, theres no Rubio University, Rubio Palace or Rubio Steaks.

Gail: Im not totally sure if Marco had ever been offered a chance at a line of steaks, hed have turned it down. This is not a guy who should be looking to do battle about personal finances.

Arthur: Who among us would turn down a fabulous line of steaks bearing our name? I think Brooks Steaks has a nice ring to it. Although I dont really eat that stuff, and also everyone would think it was David Brooks. So scratch that. But sorry  go on.

Gail: Well see what happens in the Florida primary, but Im betting we wont have Marco to kick around much longer.

You know, theres more to this story than a lack of quality opposition to Trump. The Republicans have also lost contact with their people. The degree of alienation between the party and its voters is way, way more than on the Democratic side.

Arthur: Again, not so sure I agree here. Its hard to find a young Democrat who doesnt have a jaundiced view of the Clinton coronation process. Sanders is a reaction against the party establishment and has the same level of support as Trump.

Gail: Totally different. Sanders has a well-formed ideology thats perfectly consistent. His big targets are Wall Street and its big campaign donors, which is hardly foreign material within the Democratic Party. And while its true that a lot of young people are not thrilled by the idea of another Clinton in the White House, I dont think Ive met any who wouldnt come out to vote for her against Trump or Cruz.

Imagine what the Republicans would give now for a completely qualified, mainstream leading contender, whatever the downside.

Arthur: I admire your mainstreaming of Bernie, but I continue to maintain that hes mostly a protest vote. His ideology is indeed consistent  with Eugene V. Debs and other 1920s socialists. I hear his pick to replace Scalia would be the French economist Thomas Piketty. O.K., I just made that up for effect. But still.

As to everyone voting for Clinton over Trump, its sort of notable that erstwhile Democratic candidate Jim Webb this week said he wouldnt vote for Hillary Clinton, but he wouldnt rule out voting for Trump. Whether or not this would ever really happen, its kind of a striking statement, right?

Gail: Jim Webb is  I dont know. A guy who always thought he was a bigger deal than reality suggested. Now in such a deep sulk that hes looking for the most shocking thing he can say to get attention. Anybody who desperately wants publicity is going to announce for Donald Trump. If youre a Dancing with the Stars also-ran trying to rekindle a career, chances are your publicist is not going to urge you to endorse Marco Rubio.

Arthur: Before we finish, I want to get your prediction on whats about to happen in the Republican Party. What do you think are the odds that no one wins a majority of delegates and we wind up with an open convention in Cleveland?

Gail: Every political writer goes to bed at night and dreams of an open convention. Wed be breaking the news about sudden movement in the Nebraska delegation and the whole world would be hanging on every word. So I am definitely in favor, but sort of dubious that it will happen in the real world.

But youre way better at numbers than I am. Whats your bet?

Arthur: Lots and lots of unhappy Republicans are hoping for this, but I think you are right  it is still a pretty remote possibility. The winner-take-all primaries on the 15th make it more likely that even a candidate with considerably less than a majority of votes gets more than 50 percent of the delegates at the convention.

But if its Trump, what then? Heres a multiple-choice quiz for you:

Republicans fall in line and support Trump; the party fractures, with a big percentage overtly disavowing their nominee and staying home; a movement takes shape to start a new party or support a third-party candidate; we all wake up and say, I had the weirdest dream last night.

Gail: Well, if theyre going for C, theyd better get their act together and start collecting signatures this weekend. Since Trump has virtually no personal convictions when it comes to the issues, I can imagine him sewing up the nomination and then coming out with a traditional, responsible-sounding platform that would give some of the Republican mainstream cover.

Arthur: Plus, free steaks for everybody!

Gail: Can I throw a rhetorical question at you? Republican leaders like Mitt Romney who are suddenly standing up to Trump  where were they two months ago? Arent they a little late to the fair?

Arthur: I think they just didnt believe that Trump was an authentic threat, and didnt want to alienate his supporters unnecessarily. It kind of reminds me of what my Democratic friends explained to me when Al Sharpton  who they privately felt was a polarizing, negative figure  was briefly running for president in 2004.

Gail: The idea that a blast from Mitt Romney is going to mute the Trump boom at this point in the game is pretty hilarious. I am tempted to say that Romneys only chance of having an impact would be to tie Donald to the roof of his car.

Arthur: Ha. So much for your promise to retire Seamus the Irish setter.

I doubt Romney expected to move the race, but Im sure he felt it was the right thing to do to speak up publicly about what he sees as a major threat to his party and country. Perhaps it came too late, but at least he went on record with his views.

So what can we expect in the coming week? We hear from Michigan today, but afterward, the primary schedule gets remarkably quiet. Well have to content ourselves with returns from the Guam primary on Saturday. Also, I hear the District of Columbia holds its Republican caucus in Room 308 of the Capitol Hilton, if anyone shows up. Last I heard, the D.C. Republican Party membership was down to approximately eight.

Gail: As Guam goes, so goes the nation. And this week, weve got debates! Dems on Wednesday, Republicans on Thursday. All signs point to a boring, issue-oriented exchange on the Democratic side while the four guys in suits bring thrills, chills and lots of insults. Its like a PBS round-table discussion on campaign finance versus a Don Rickles Celebrity Roast. So lucky for the G.O.P. to be on the exciting end of everything, hehehehe.

Arthur: I think youre right that theres an exciting week ahead for the Republicans, but my spider sense tells me that it will be something more substantial than chair-throwing at the debate. Stay tuned.",[]

Season 2, Episode 7, Williams and Walker









Several significant things happened in Friday nights episode of The Knick, titled Williams and Walker. Lucy Elkins and Henry Robertson finally had sex. Thackery separated the conjoined twins Nika and Zoya. Gallinger reached his lowest point yet, sabotaging Edwardss surgery on D.W. Garrison Carr. The famous vaudeville duo of Bert Williams and George Walker entertained the swells at the gala benefit for the new uptown Knickerbocker Hospital.

But the real stars were Steven Soderbergh and his camera. Mr. Soderbergh (serving as his own cinematographer) opened the gala sequence with a continuous two-and-a-half-minute shot through a series of grand spaces that was showy but undeniably impressive. The camera followed two couples  the Edwardses, Algernon and Opal, and Bertie Chickering and his date, Genevieve Everidge  across a foyer and through a door into a ballroom, where it rose fluidly to survey the dancers, then slowly backed away in a different direction, into a corridor where it picked up Herman Barrow and Captain Robertson.

It changed direction again to follow them back to the foyer, where it rose and did a complete 360-degree circle around the clustered Robertsons and Showalters before once again slowly backing up, across the room, until Lucy and Henry walked in front of it, waving to the other Robertsons who were now in the distance. It was the kind of bravura moment Mr. Soderbergh indulges in every once in a while, as if to say, Yeah, its TV. So what? Planning and rehearsing that one shot must have taken as much time as some television shows devote to filming an entire episode.

Back to those other things that happened. There were actually two initial sexual experiences depicted in the episode. Chickering and Everidge were first, and their coupling was as playful and jittery as the Elkins-Robertson pairing was calculated and practiced. Literally practiced  Lucy sat in on a session between Ping Wu and one of his prostitutes, even offering Wu her unstockinged foot as a sexual aid.

Thackerys revolutionary surgery on the twins was a little anticlimactic  it was at best the third story line in the episode. Still unsure of himself, he snorted cocaine, swigged turpentine and made a late-night, pre-op visit to the grave of Sonya Smyslov, the little girl whose death haunts him (so much that he paid $65 for an imposing headstone). As the jangling metallic noises on the soundtrack grew louder, Thack reached into his pocket for a fix but then decided to call Abigail instead. The cure for addiction apparently isnt lobotomy or hypnosis, its having the woman you love say she believes in you. Now riding high, he went into his showman mode and successfully separated the twins before a packed gallery, though not before summoning Henry Robertson to record the operation on his new motion-picture camera. Afterward the always curious Thackery asked about the mysterious substance used to record the images, and was told it was a new invention called celluloid.

Cornelia Robertson finally got more than a few minutes onscreen, and her investigation of the health inspector Speights murder actually took an interesting turn  she determined that the skullduggery by which sick immigrants were snuck into the country (rather than sent back to Europe) was being initiated by her own familys shipping company. Later her creepy father-in-law walked in on her when she was in her robe, but rather than make advances, he berated her for wasting her time on Speight when she should be doing her duty to the Showalter family by getting pregnant. Then things got worse: her husband, Phillip, told her that her father was in debt to his father, and that she needed to go along with his fathers wishes or see her father ruined.

And then there was poor Algy Edwards, dumped on by everyone in sight. (1) Carr, with Opals support, forced Edwardss hand and got himself admitted as the hospitals first black patient (not counting those Edwards secretly treated in the basement). Thackery, who hadnt yet asked the hospitals board about admitting African-Americans, threw up his hands and said, You fight this alone. (2) After the gala, Opal confronted Captain Robertson about Edwardss role at the new hospital, and it was clear from his non-answer that Algy might not have any role. (3) Edwardss showcase, the hernia surgery on Carr, was ruined when Gallingers doctored curare caused Carr to stop breathing and lose his pulse. Gallinger then leaped to the rescue, correctly diagnosing the condition (which he had caused) and successfully blaming it on Edwards. The episode ended with Edwards trying to figure out what had happened  you suspect he will turn the tables on Gallinger before the season ends  and being comforted by Opal, who told him, in words freighted with meaning, Youre going to have better days.

A quick note on Williams and Walker, whose blackface minstrel-show act didnt appear to unduly offend even the proud Opal. They were the leading black performers of their day, popularizing the cakewalk dance and billing themselves as Two Real Coons  the phrase used by Herman Barrows wife when she introduced them  to distinguish themselves from the many white vaudevillians who wore blackface.

Let us know your thoughts about Williams and Walker. A question for discussion: will Lucy Elkinss bold strategy to win Henry Robertson prove effective, or will Cornelias warning about the difference in their stations  I dont want you to be crushed  be prophetic?",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,The Echo From Amazon Brims With Groundbreaking Promise,"['Farhad Manjoo', 'State Of The Art']","Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Many of the worlds largest technology companies have spent the last five years searching in vain for the holy grail, a machine to succeed the smartphone as the next must-have gadget.









They have made digital watches and fitness trackers, all manner of computerized glasses and goggles, and more doodads to plug into your TV than there are shows to watch on it.

Yet at the moment, the most promising candidate for the Next Great Gadget isnt made by Apple, Google, Facebook or Microsoft. Instead, it is the Echo, a screenless, voice-controlled household computer built by Amazon  a company whose last big foray into consumer electronics, the Fire Phone, was a humiliating flop.

This time it may be different. A bit more than a year after its release, the Echo has morphed from a gimmicky experiment into a device that brims with profound possibility. The longer I use it, the more regularly it inspires the same sense of promise I felt when I used the first iPhone  a sense this machine is opening up a vast new realm in personal computing, and gently expanding the role that computers will play in our future.

What is most interesting about the Echo is that it came out of nowhere. It isnt much to look at, and even describing its utility is difficult. Here is a small, stationary machine that you set somewhere in your house, which you address as Alexa, which performs a variety of tasks  playing music, reading the news and weather, keeping a shopping list  that you can already do on your phone.

But the Echo has a way of sneaking into your routines. When Alexa reorders popcorn for you, or calls an Uber car for you, when your children start asking Alexa to add Popsicles to the grocery list, you start to want pretty much everything else in life to be Alexa-enabled, too.

In this way, Amazon has found a surreptitious way to bypass Apple and Google  the reigning monarchs in the smartphone world  with a gadget that has the potential to become a dominant force in the most intimate of environments: our homes.

If all this sounds over-the-top, read some of the reviews. On Amazons site, the Echo has racked up more stars than an Oscars party. Amazon doesnt release sales numbers, but the company is investing big in Echo. It ran Super Bowl ads to push the device and last week it unveiled two new versions of the machine. One is a portable version of the Echo and the other is meant to plug into existing speaker systems.

Scot Wingo, the chairman of ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce consulting firm, said the early signs suggested that the Echo was on a path to become Amazons next $1 billion business.

Its one of the most sold-out things that I see on Amazon, Mr. Wingo said. Its an unusual thing for Amazon to be out of something, but for the Echo, its usually in stock just for a couple weeks before it goes out of stock for a few days  so it feels like theyre having trouble making enough of the devices. Mr. Wingo noted the Echo, which Amazon sells for $180 only through its own site, was selling for $200 to $300 on eBay.

When the Echo was introduced in a goofy video in late 2014, on the heels of the failure of the Fire Phone, it was widely ridiculed. The Echos utility was not obvious, and in its earliest incarnation, it seemed a bit of a ditz. But there are a couple of reasons it has earned such raves from users.

First, its simple to learn, and its voice-recognition capabilities are more intuitive than those of many other vocal assistants (like Apples Siri or Google Now). More than that, it keeps gaining new powers.

During an interview at a media event last week, Dave Limp, Amazons senior vice president for devices, said the company created the Echo because it had seen interesting possibilities arising out of advances in microphone technology, speech recognition and cloud connectivity. Amazons engineers spent years perfecting the devices unusual capabilities. Unlike competing assistants, the Echo can be activated hands-free from far across the room (Siri only works from a couple of feet away), and it can decipher your voice in noisy environments, even when its playing music.

Amazon also worked to make sure the device responded very quickly. Early on in the product, to play music took eight or nine seconds, and its just unusable when its like that, Mr. Limp said. Now its often 1,000 milliseconds or 1,200 milliseconds.

The speed makes a crucial difference. Compared with the trudge of chatting with Siri, speaking to Alexa feels natural, closer to speaking to a human than a machine  and even when it gets your request wrong, which in your early days with the device will happen often, it doesnt feel like you have paid a huge penalty for trying.

More important, just like the early iPhone, Amazon has managed to turn the Echo into the center of a new ecosystem. Developers are flocking to create voice-controlled apps for the device, or skills, as Amazon calls them. There are now more than 300 skills for the Echo, from the trivial  there is one to make Alexa produce rude body sounds on command  to the pretty handy. It can tell you transit schedules, start a seven-minute workout, read recipes, do math and conversions, and walk you through adventure games, among other possibilities.

Makers of digital home devices like Nest are also rushing to make their products compatible with the Echo. Alexa can now control your Internet-connected lights, home thermostats and a variety of other devices. Hardware makers can also add Alexas brain into their own devices, so soon you wont need an Echo to consult with Alexa  you could find it in your toaster, your refrigerator or your car.

Amazons open-platform strategy for the Echo calls to mind Amazon Web Services, its multibillion-dollar cloud business that also came out of left field to best competitors. It is patterned very much off of the successful formula that A.W.S. uses, Mr. Limp said.

The Echo also ties in to Amazons main business, its retail store. When you tell it to reorder popcorn, it gets your order through Amazon, of course. Still, Mr. Wingo noted that Amazon had so far kept the platform relatively open  other retailers and product manufacturers are free to build their own apps that will allow for interactions with their stores.

The Echo is far from perfect. It still gets queries wrong and it still feels like its missing potentially useful features. Mr. Limp concedes this. Amazons teams keep working to add new tricks to the Echo, he said. The device also faces limited retail distribution  its unusual enough that it would benefit from being displayed on shelves, but Amazons retail rivals are unlikely to stock it anytime soon. (Some analysts have speculated that Amazons retail plans may be an effort to show off its hardware.)

Amazon would be wise to step on the gas because while the Echo has no direct competitors, a few may be emerging. Among them is SoundHound, a start-up that has been working on voice-recognition for more than a decade, which is now offering hardware makers access to its service. Within the next year, according to the company, lots of gadgets will be using SoundHounds software to talk to users.

Do you want that? As I argued recently, the F.B.I.s battle with Apple over encryption should prompt deep questions about a future of Internet-connected devices spread around our homes. Amazon has strong privacy protections in the Echo. It doesnt stream anything without the wake word and it has a physical mute button that electrically disconnects the microphone but, as with all groundbreaking technology, there is no doubt we are entering new territory here.

Yet, the Echo is so useful it may be worth the gamble. Many in the industry have long looked to the smartphone as the remote control for your world. But the phone has limitations. A lot of times fiddling with a screen is just too much work. By perfecting an interface that is much better suited to home use  the determined yell!  Amazon seems on the verge of building something like Iron Mans Jarvis, the artificial-intelligence brain at the center of all your household activities. Who could say no to that?",[]

nytimes.com,2016-02-26 00:00:00,Review: Prodigals by Greg Jackson Skewers the Elite,['Dwight Garner'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The writing in Greg Jacksons first book of stories, Prodigals, is so bold and perceptive that it delivers a contact high. You know from the first pages that, intellectually, youve climbed into a high-performance sports car. Only one question remains: Will the author smash it into a tree?









Mr. Jackson is a student and a satirist of elite lives. His characters are filmmakers and architects and writers and tennis pros, some of them newly released from one of those prestigious East Coast schools whose graduates are cagey about where they went. A few are flourishing; others hang on by a fingernail.

Most are in their late 30s and approaching reckonings of various sorts. There are flashbacks to slightly earlier times, when there was indiscriminate sex and cocaine inhaled from the keys of ecologically responsible cars.

The micro-details of previous lost weekends pile up: We smoked cigarettes and joints, sucked on lozenges lacquered in hash oil. We tried one anothers benzos and antivirals, Restoril, Avodart, Yaz, and Dexedrine, looking for contraindications. We ate well: cassoulets, steak frites, squid-ink risotto with porcini, spices from Andhra Pradesh, Kyoto, Antwerp. Of course we drank: pure agaves, rye whiskeys, St-Germain, old Scotch. Two women are said to be so oppressively hip there are about four square blocks in the world where they can exist.

Photo

Clearly, Mr. Jacksons characters can sometimes be easy to dislike. They know this about themselves. This gives these stories some of their tang. No one is overly interested in being kind. When one man meets his wifes old friend, that friend looked me over like a rental billed a notch or two above its class.

These characters play rough, and for keeps. We grow into our toughness like snakes, one of them thinks, molting hope. They are past embarrassment. Their plain-spokenness gives Mr. Jacksons dialogue a lot of topspin. One woman speaks for many of them when she comments, I cant be held responsible for every dreadful remark that escapes my mouth.

Mr. Jackson enters these worlds with wit and sympathy and a good deal of heart. In terms of the entitled milieu, you may sometimes feel you are reading a furious, Instagram-era updating of Ann Beatties short stories, which makes a certain amount of sense: Mr. Jackson was her writing student at the University of Virginia.

Theres also the crunch of writers like Ian McEwan and Martin Amis in Mr. Jacksons prose. Best of all theres that sense  only the excellent ones give it to you  that whatever topic the author turns his mental LED lights toward will be powerfully illuminated.

Im not sure Ive read a better description of what it feels like to drink two bourbons on an empty stomach than this one: That sunburnt feeling is moving inside of me, like light breaking in double time over the crops.

And Im not sure Ive read a better description of a certain kind of successful man in late middle age, the kind who is giving off the captured firelight of time spent in the timbered lodges of Jackson Hole and has the vital febrility of coronaries survived.

There is goose-pimpling writing about Terry Gross (demotic ur-parent, Catcher in the WHYY), envy (You need people well enough informed to understand just how enviable you are), and the odd poignancy of The New York Review of Books, which continued to devote such good minds and scholarship to what after five minutes in the desert sun, driving with the top down by imitation-adobe strip malls full of nail salons and smoothie shops and physical therapy outlets, was almost painfully irrelevant.

This collection is front-loaded; the best of these eight stories come early. One is about a young couple in France, visiting a reclusive tennis star and his wife. Another is about a man and his female therapist, who are forced to share a long car ride to escape New York City during a hurricane. Other stories deal with families, especially siblings. Mr. Jackson has a special interest in friends and lovers who meet again after years apart, so he can explore the gaps between what is and what might have been.

The later stories in Prodigals, on the figurative B-side, are more experimental and a bit less persuasive. One of them, appropriately enough, is titled Metanarrative Breakdown. Yet none are a waste of time. None are car crashes.

What makes these stories radiant, rather than merely prickly, is how invested Mr. Jackson is in peeling off the rind of life, in getting to the juice. For what if not pockets of intensity, one of his characters thinks, were we in the business of living?

If these people are often brash, well, they have observed that life gave its fruit to the bold, the unhesitant. There is no small talk. One character describes himself as a person who doesnt believe in rules or in standing on ceremony, lifes too strange.

When Mr. Jacksons characters cant (or wont) hold one another up, they find solace in stories. One man in extremis says: In the days that follow, it is books and books alone that make me not want to die.

This man discovers that literature was the only sort of arrival I could count on, an intimacy that wouldnt desert me, that didnt ask too much or fray fatally in the endless conflict of our competing needs, that permitted  or maybe simply was  the passage of experience back through us, our way of ravaging the endless ravishment of life.

The passage of experience back through us  thats a powerful line, and it represents what this young writer is capable of delivering, right now and, if fortune smiles, long into the future.",[]

SATURDAY PUZZLE  Roland Huget is back, and he says below that he might have filled his puzzle differently these days, compared with how he filled it when it was submitted. Thats reasonable. We all evolve over time. And at least Mr. Huget can claim to be the guy who first introduced BARE IT ALL in The New York Times crossword.

There is some less-than-desirable fill here, like ENOL, TALCUMS and ECH, but there is also some really good fill, like SILENT TREATMENT, ILL BE THERE (I defy you to fill that in without humming), NO SIREE BOB, CRIME SCENE, MENNONITE, PETER FALK, THE HEIRESS (great movie!), ARMWRESTLE, HERE AND NOW and I LOVE L.A. I enjoyed filling in JASMINE, but had never heard of it referred to as the name of a color. I drink JASMINE tea, though and, come to think of it, it is sort of a pale yellow. Live and learn.

There was a lot of good cluing in todays puzzle, but the one that nearly made me do a spit take was 38 Acrosss Bush native to the South, for JEB. It just sits there so quietly, waiting to be discovered, and of all the ways to clue JEB, that misdirection is the last way I would have expected to see it. Very clever.

Lets check in with Mr. Huget:

Constructors Notes

This is my third crossword in The New York Times. From now on, Ill stop keeping count in the constructor notes. The crossword we see before us is actually the third version that was submitted using this grid skeleton. I recall several aborted attempts at this grid before I completed a fill that I felt comfortable in submitting, in the summer of 2013. It was rejected, and from that effort only HERE AND NOW made its way into the final version, although not in the same word slot. The second version was submitted in late 2013, just when I was starting to get the hang of crossword construction. It too was rejected, but the top and bottom stacks and the vertical SILENT TREATMENT got a thumbs-up. The final version, incorporating these elements, was completed in June of 2014, and was accepted for publication in September of that year. Its interesting to revisit an early construction that one hasnt seen in a while. Thankfully, there arent any entries here that make me cringe, but my style definitely has changed since this puzzle was produced. More than I realized, this puzzle is tailored to the over-50 crowd. I hope younger solvers arent put off by that. My favorite clues are 26A: MENNONITE: [One speaking the language Plautdietsch] and 56A: ARM WRESTLE: [Try to win hands down?]. I cant claim credit for either.

Its official: The shirt that turned the actor Colin Firth into a heartthrob  and helped fuel the continuing global Jane Austen pandemonium  is coming to the United States.

The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington confirmed that it has secured a loan of the billowing white shirt worn by Mr. Firth in an indelible scene in the 1995 BBC mini-series of Pride and Prejudice.

It will be on view starting in August as part of the exhibition Will & Jane: Shakespeare, Austen, and the Cult of Celebrity, alongside relics including a bundle of wood collected at Shakespeares birthplace, a bottle of Austen-inspired Bath Gin (tagline: Gin of a different persuasion), and Will and Jane action figures.

In the scene, Mr. Firth, playing the aloof Mr. Darcy, dives into a pond and emerges with the garment molded to his strapping physique.

The Regency wet T-shirt moment appears nowhere in Austens novel, but it has inspired homages like the 12-foot fiberglass-coated Darcy that temporarily rose out of a London pond in 2013 and a photo re-enactment by Benedict Cumberbatch, done as a charity fund-raiser, that caused heart palpitations across the Internet in 2014.

The shirt seemed like a celebrity object that demonstrated the kind of fun that people have with Austen as an author, said Janine Barchas, a University of Texas English professor who is a curator of the show with Kristina Straub of Carnegie Mellon University. It exemplifies the kind of play that is central to our whole exhibition.

The Shirt, as the exhibition label will call it, belongs to the British costume supply house Cosprop, which said it received several requests a year for Mr. Darcys garments. (Like Rin Tin Tin, the Shirt was actually played by several shirts, given the need for a dry one before each take.) And no, you cant rent it to wear, say, to your prom.

The costumes hired from Cosprops exhibition department are for display purposes only and must not be worn at any time, a representative said by email.

A half-serious proposal to keep the shirt wet and molded to its display dummy by using misters like those in grocery store produce sections was deemed curatorially unsound, Ms. Barchas said. But outside the protective glass case, the library is bracing for a humid reception.

We will be giving the Folger some Windex, to be used in what we anticipate will be a daily wiping-down of lipstick marks, Ms. Barchas said.",[]

PARIS  Firing an employee in France often means a court date, months of hearings and hefty payouts under the countrys 3,400-page labor code. Employers hate the thick book.









But workers  those lucky enough to have a job  love it. On Wednesday, thousands went into the streets across France to protect it, demonstrating against a new government plan to make firings slightly easier and Frances trademark shortened workweek slightly longer.

Nothing for years has so revived labor tensions  or divided the Socialist Party  as the governments plan to reform the voluminous labor code, removing, ever so slightly, a few layers of worker protection.

Desperate to reduce a near-permanent unemployment rate of more than 10 percent, the Socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls has risked taking a delicate paring knife to the Bible-thick labor code, a step that members of his party consider a heresy.

In doing so, Mr. Valls and his tiny reform faction have revived a conflict over labor overhauls that has already played out elsewhere in Europes left, but that has tormented the French Socialists ever since they took power in 2012.

Continue reading the main story Todays Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

Mr. Valls says he is determined to fix a broken French system that has left employers so fearful of long-term hires that 90 percent of jobs created in France last year were unstable, poorly paid and short term.

You engage yourself practically for life when you sign a contract, said Francois Asselin, a businessman who heads the confederation of small- and medium-size companies in France.

When you want to lay off an employee there is considerable legal and financial risk, he said. In France, to lay someone off, youve got to be totally documented, so you wont be accused of an abusive firing. 

Mr. Vallss departures from leftist orthodoxy, however, run the risk of breaking his own Socialist party.

Why are they doing this one year away from the election, groaned Catherine Lemorton, a Socialist parliamentary deputy, in an interview Wednesday. This law which offends so much of our electorate, or whats left of it?

Mr. Valls, pugnacious and combative, boxes in his spare time, and the law was introduced with characteristic brusqueness and little explanation. The reaction has been explosive.

For weeks the Socialist partys rank and file has cried betrayal. Hundreds of thousands have signed an online petition demanding that the government scrap its plan. Deputies in Parliament have revolted. The unions  its a return to the 19th century, grumbled one leader  have vowed to kill the plan.

One of the leading Socialist lights, the mayor of Lille, Martine Aubry, who wrote Frances 35-hour workweek as a government minister, wrote a furious editorial in Le Monde declaring: Not this, not us, not the Left!

On Wednesday, as the government hunkered down to ponder its dwindling options, thousands of demonstrators  workers, union officials, students  poured into the streets of the countrys cities.

The student mobilization against the plan was especially strong.

That kind of society, we dont want anything to do it! read one of the student demonstration banners at the Place de la Republique in Paris.

This baffled government officials, who said the plan was developed with students in mind, to open up more long-term employment and diminish exploitative short-term jobs.

They want to make us Kleenex employees, throwaway employees! said Patricia Deschamp, an Air France worker handing out leaflets at the big demonstration near the employers federation here on the Left Bank.

We have minimal security now, and we will have even less after, she said.

Yet the agitated crowds were in the streets for a level of protection far higher than in many developed countries and against a change that even its defenders characterized as no more than mild.

The main provision puts a cap on payouts to laid-off employees, based on seniority. Labor court judges would not have near-limitless discretion to award huge payouts.

Equally infuriating to the unions, the law defines more precisely when a company can invoke economic reasons to justify layoffs. Workers who refuse to go along with temporary workload increases in the event of increased business could be laid off, too.

It will simplify the procedures to layoffs, said Philippe Aghion, a Harvard economist who is French and who lectures at the prestigious College de France. You wont have to go through endless judicial procedures. There will be less discretion for the judges. Now, there is enormous discretion on the amount.

The uncertainty factor is a killer for hiring, the business owners say. All we are asking for is a limit on the ceiling, said Mr. Asselin, whose company is a leader in the restoration of Frances historic buildings.

Now, there are no limits, he said. Sometimes the fines are so big they endanger the employer. So today, it is risky to hire people.

The unions here, keen to protect their already-employed members, speak relatively little about the ranks of the unemployed. Yet many economists contend that the French level of protection for workers is poisonous to the job market.

There is a large body of evidence that increasing levels of protection for existing workers is detrimental to the labor market, particularly on weaker categories of workers, the young and women, said Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, a French economist who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley.

If we want to address the fact that its a labor market that excludes many, many people from a decent level of job protection by forcing them into short-term jobs, we have to address these conditions, he said. The current administration has accepted this perspective.

France, however is a difficult country to reform, as Mr. Aghion and others pointed out. Cultural shifts like those proposed by the current government always bring people into the streets.

We are a country of revolutionaries and conservatives, at the same time, said Marc Lazar, a historian at the Institut dEtudes Politiques. Playing into this is the French lefts deep attachment to advances acquired in the past, Mr. Lazar said.

The prevailing sentiment is that you shouldnt touch the labor code, because we prefer equality to liberty, protection to adventure.",[]

A new study suggests that women with asthma exposed to air pollution, even before conception, significantly increase their risk of delivering a premature baby.

Researchers studied 223,502 pregnancies among 204,175 women in 19 hospitals across the United States, gathering data on air quality in each region.

The study, in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, found that all women with asthma were more likely than those without to deliver preterm. But there were significant increases in preterm birth in asthmatic women exposed to air pollution, including traffic-related pollutants.

Air pollution also appeared to take a toll even before conception. Asthmatic women exposed to pollutants in the three months before conception were at a 28 percent higher risk for preterm birth than women without asthma exposed at the same time in the same conditions.

Thats a window that hasnt been studied before, said the lead author, Pauline Mendola, an epidemiologist with the National Institutes of Health. We saw the increase for both groups, but it was much higher for women with asthma.

Air pollution may be unavoidable, but Dr. Mendola said that pregnant women should avoid outdoor activity when pollution levels rise.

The Environmental Protection Agency issues air pollution advisories when conditions are bad, she said. Theyre not specifically for pregnant women, but pregnant women with asthma should be particularly aware of them.

TUESDAY PUZZLE  This was a straightforward circled-answer puzzle with a good number of long clues for early in the week  potentially slow going for a new solver, but the corners used crossword standards like ASSUAGE, THANE and UPROOT that you will encounter again. Odd little semi-words like AHH, URL and SLR contributed to the challenge here.

For some reason, I knew OTTO PREMINGER had directed Anatomy of a Murder. Right away and right across the middle, then, my answers spread quickly in all directions. I cant for the life of me remember seeing the movie itself, but, like most of us, I did go through a Jimmy Stewart phase so it could have happened. I registered otter at that point, but the nature of the beast didnt become clear until I got MINUTE STEAK. SETTHETABLE and FUSEBOX came fairly easily after that.

The spelling and definition of MESHUGA sent me to the archives and the Internet, because I had heard and spoken so many variations and it looked funny on paper, but that is The New York Times-ordained spelling, so that was something I learned today, my bubelehs.

David Steinberg corroborates my findings, and, as it turns out, I did get lucky with that Jimmy Stewart thing:

Constructors Notes:

I constructed this puzzle just over a year ago. At the time, I was making almost all themelesses, so I decided to construct a themed puzzle for the sake of variety. Im not sure where the inspiration for this puzzle came from, but I was fortunate to find just enough types of fur to scrape together a theme set. Interestingly, both OTTO PREMINGER and OTTO KLEMPERER wouldve worked for the center theme entry  I chose OTTO PREMINGER because I felt he would be more familiar to early-week solvers. I settled on this grid pattern because I wanted to give solvers something a little different from the several theme entries with a pair of long downs structure used in most themed 1515 crosswords these days. I personally use the traditional layout the majority of the time, but when I end up with a theme set that I could go a different direction with, I like to switch things up. The 74-word grid with all the 7s was definitely a challenge, but I was pleased to work in MESHUGA, JUNIPER and BLASTER. Keeping the less savory bits to a minimum was significantly harder, but Im pleased with how the fill turned out over all (with the exception of NATALE, which the Tuesday solver in me is grumbling about!). I hope you enjoy my puzzle. One of the R.A.s in my dorm just started solving The New York Times crossword  as of right now, he only attempts Mondays, so Im hoping this puzzle will persuade him to graduate to Tuesday!

It is Science Times Tuesday, and I was reminded by this puzzle of the Russian Fox experiment, a decades-long project that dissipated along with the Soviet Union, but still pops up on nature shows and in genetics classes. An attempt was made to breed foxes that were less aggressive and less inclined to bite their captors on a fur farm; the result was a complete and rapid domestication, and the new, sweeter foxes proved more lucrative as exotic pets for the ultrarich than fabric for same.

Lucky little critters. Although, you never know...

It was, they both acknowledged, an unlikely romance: Margaret Lavigne and Chris Plum had met, fallen in love and married at a long-term acute care hospital in Connecticut, where they continued to live, both of them using wheelchairs because of muscular dystrophy.

Yet the marriage flourished in the time they had together, and they let it be widely known, as the subjects of Good Night Margaret, an 11-minute video documentary produced in 2014 by The New York Times. In the video, Ms. Lavigne and Mr. Plum spoke candidly about living with a disability, in their cases caused by muscular dystrophy, a group of inherited diseases that result in progressive muscle weakness.

Ms. Lavigne, who spent much of her life working on behalf of people with disabilities, died on Feb. 29. She was 44.

The two met in 2011 shortly after Mr. Plum moved into the Hospital for Special Care in New Britain, Conn., which treats critically ill patients, many of whom have few prospects for improvement.

Mr. Plum said he worked up the nerve to ask her out about a year later. They spent their first date in a private area of the hospital watching the movie Fantastic Mr. Fox and eating takeout Chinese food.

Continue reading the main story Video

In 2013, they were married. Everybody wants the one, Ms. Lavigne, known as Muffi, said in the documentary. I did not expect to find him here, of all places.

Before her condition required more care, Ms. Lavigne lived in Rockville, Md., a suburb of Washington, for 13 years. She worked for United Cerebral Palsy as well as for the Presidents Committee on Employment of People With Disabilities, according to an obituary written by her family. She also testified for a presidential commission on consumer protection and quality in the health care industry.

Ms. Lavigne later enrolled in a masters degree program in architecture at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to focus on design in public buildings and housing, Mr. Plum said. But she fell ill about halfway through the three-year program and withdrew, moving into the Hospital for Special Care in 2008.

She had to make a very big transition from the big independent disability rights movement, where the idea of living in an institution is objectionable, Mr. Plum said.

Ms. Lavigne was born on March 12, 1971, in Concord, Mass. She was 7 when she learned she had muscular dystrophy.

My parents never considered me having a disability, and I didnt either, she said in the documentary. You learn to have a little tougher skin, but thats a lifelong journey for anyone.

Besides her husband, she is survived by her parents, Debora and James Lavigne; a sister, Laurie Kerr; and her grandmother, Nancy M. Lauriat.

Ive had people ask me, Do you ever wish you could walk again, or not have the disease? Ms. Lavigne said in the film. But if Ive got Chris, Id take it.",[]

PARIS  The final day of Paris Fashion Week brought epic thunderstorms and a shower of actresses, models and singers onto the Louis Vuitton front row.

There was Jaden Smith, son of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith and the star of the recent Louis Vuitton womens wear campaign, alongside the actresses Lea Seydoux, Jennifer Connelly and Alicia Vikander, still riding high after winning her Oscar last month and clad in Vuitton, of course. Karlie Kloss was a catwalk spectator for once, while Selena Gomez, the pint-size pop star and a favored face of the brand, was a little concerned about her straight locks as she sat waiting for the show to begin.

Selena, did you survive the deluge on your way in?

Well, I did, but Im a little concerned about my hair. Its super curly naturally, and Im surprised it hasnt frizzed up around my ears. I keep trying to surreptitiously check it is staying put.

What have you been doing since you arrived in Paris?

Mainly in the studio and rehearsing for my upcoming tour. This is my only fashion week show. And then Im off to London for more music projects.

Are there any traditions in Paris that you uphold?

Yes. I go to my favorite Chinese restaurant, its called Dave on the Rue de Richelieu, and the food is absolutely sensational. I go and eat there every time Im in the city. Its divine.

Wearing Louis Vuitton?

A Manhattan jury convicted Elliot Morales of murder as a hate crime on Wednesday in the fatal shooting of a gay man in the West Village nearly three years ago.









The jury of four men and eight women deliberated for two days after two weeks of emotional testimony in State Supreme Court, during which Mr. Morales represented himself and took the witness stand to declare he was not prejudiced toward gay people. Murder as a hate crime carries a minimum sentence of 20 years to life, five years more than a second-degree murder conviction.

Mr. Morales shook his head in disbelief and muttered under his breath as the jury foreman read the verdict sheet: guilty on all counts.

Several witnesses testified they saw Mr. Morales pull a silver revolver and shoot Mark Carson in the face after an argument during which he called Mr. Carson and his friend, Danny Robinson, faggots and gay wrestlers.

Mr. Morales denied that his motive had been bigotry and said he was bisexual. He claimed he acted in self-defense because he felt he was about to be attacked by Mr. Carson and Mr. Robinson. He said he raised his gun and fired after he saw Mr. Robinson pull what looked like a black pistol from his pocket. I just reacted, he said during his closing argument. This was not a deliberate act.

Continue reading the main story Video

But prosecutors argued that Mr. Morales, 36, had started on a violent, antigay tirade 15 minutes earlier when he burst into the Annisa Restaurant on Barrow Street, brandished his weapon and threatened a bartender, using antigay slurs.

That confrontation had started when a restaurant employee chastised Mr. Morales, who had been drinking heavily all day, for urinating in the street in front of the business, witnesses said.

A few minutes later on Avenue of the Americas, Mr. Morales encountered Mr. Carson and Mr. Robinson, two gay men from Brooklyn who were out on the town on a warm Friday night. As he passed them, Mr. Morales called the men gay wrestlers, Mr. Robinson testified. Mr. Carson spun on his heel and confronted Mr. Morales.

It was an explosive moment. Mr. Carson, 32, was a Brooklyn native, outgoing and proudly open about his sexuality, who worked at a gelato kiosk in Grand Central Terminal. Mr. Morales was from the Lower East Side of Manhattan, unemployed, broke and sleeping on a friends couch in Queens. He was armed with a .38-caliber revolver he said he wanted to sell. He had served 11 years in prison for a robbery during which three women were bound with duct tape, choked and assaulted with a pipe.

Spewing antigay insults, Mr. Morales dared Mr. Carson and Mr. Robinson to come around the corner onto Eighth Street to settle their differences, Mr. Robinson testified. They followed him, thinking it was a bluff.

There, just after midnight on May 18, 2013, in the shadow of a closed bookstore, Mr. Morales shot Mr. Carson while Mr. Robinson was on the telephone with the police, witnesses said.

This was bigotry, and this was unjustifiable rage, the lead prosecutor, Shannon Lucey, said in her summation. The defendant was able to shoot Mark Carson over nothing because Mark Carson was nothing to the defendant. Mark Carson was nothing to the defendant but a subhuman fag.

In his testimony, Mr. Morales said that he had had sexual relationships with transgender men; he called one of his longtime sexual partners as a witness. I, Elliot Morales, am not a bigot, he said. I dont hate gays.

But Ms. Lucey noted that he never took transgender men he slept with on dates or walked in public with them. The defendant is self-loathing; he wants no one to know or to see who he is, she said. He has a lot of self-loathing issues, and that came out when he saw Mark Carson and Danny Robinson being who they are.

When he was tackled by an officer and arrested a few minutes after the shooting, Mr. Morales said, I shot him because he tried to act tough. Then, as another officer turned on his video camera, Mr. Morales laughed maniacally and said, Diagnosis dead, Doctor.

One juror, who insisted on anonymity to protect his privacy, said no one on the panel bought Mr. Moraless claim he had acted in self-defense. Most of the discussion, he said, had been about whether Mr. Morales had singled out Mr. Carson because he was gay or for some other reason.

The juror, a financial services employee from the Upper East Side, said he was convinced that Mr. Morales acted out of prejudice because he seemed intent on attacking gay men the night of the shooting, starting with his belligerent antigay threats at the Annisa Restaurant.

Later, Mr. Morales not only used gay slurs in his argument with Mr. Carson, but also pointedly asked him if he was with Mr. Robinson just before pulling the gun, the juror said. He was kind of categorizing people, he said.

A second juror, a health care worker from the West Village who also declined to be named for privacy reasons, said the panel did not give much weight to Mr. Moraless argument that he was not a bigot because he had slept in secret with transgender women. I think we all felt he had some serious screws loose, she said.",[]

WHAT are the best mobile games to play these days? I decided to find out recently when a train I was riding came to an unexpected stop between two stations and there was no cellphone signal. That meant no Internet for distraction, no Twitter or Spotify to while away the time.









Fortunately, I had just downloaded some new iPhone games that have attracted a lot of attention. So during the train delay, I tested how the games measured up to their hype.

Photo

First up was The Swords, a gesture-based game that may remind people of Fruit Ninja, a game where you slash up a lot of fruits. In The Swords, you also have to swipe the screen to cut through fast-moving targets.

The game has a story line: You follow a sword master as he learns his craft, dealing with ever more difficult opponents and learning new moves. When you swipe at your phones screen to move your sword, you paint shapes in black ink to intercept the advances of your red-inked enemies. Each level requires more speed and more dexterity in swipes. Between levels, you see beautiful drawings that advance the sword masters story.

The Swords, which is $3 on iOS, is fast-paced but doesnt feel frantic. As I played, it relaxed me.

After some time, with my train still looking as if it wasnt going anywhere, I clicked on Dreii, which costs $4 on iOS and Android.

Photo

This is a physics-based puzzle game with abstract graphics. Theres no clock, and not much on screen other than a few minimalist graphics. By tapping here and there, you grab white building blocks with your character and drag them around in a gravity field. Then you stack the blocks to hit a pulsing target and move on to the next level.

Dreii may sound simplistic, but it is fascinating and the momentum quickly builds as new block shapes are introduced and targets prove harder to reach. Each puzzle piece moves and drops into place with little difficulty, and the lovely sounds add to this experience.

Dreii also has some advanced group-playing tricks, uniting you with other players from across the Internet to complete different goals.

The two games were so much fun that eventually, as my train moved, I searched for more to play. That led me to Rayman Classic, which is $5 on iOS. A huge success on Atari and PlayStation consoles in 1996, Rayman  an adventure game following the character Rayman  is now a mobile app.

Photo

Its makers have captured the look and feel of the original game without messing with the recipe much. Raymans graphics are classically blocky, and the gameplay is based on two-dimensional platforms and ladders, with jumping, collecting tasks and a mazelike path. Even the soundtrack will take you back to 1996.

Rayman was always fun to play and its characters were likable. You do need to perfect your timing, and learn to jump your character onto just the right pixel. I found it a lot of fun.

Ive also been playing Final Fantasy IX on my phone. The game is worth mentioning because it is such a huge contrast to my other favorite mobile games. Originally a console app, Final Fantasy IX for phones and tablets is a sophisticated role-playing fighting game with a mythlike story line and all the usual features like learning new abilities and scenes that move the plot along.

This 16-year-old game looks great today because its graphics have been updated. Its controls have also been adapted for touch screens. You can expect to spend many hours immersed in this app. But its expensive: Final Fantasy IX costs $21 on iOS and Android.

The annual Games Developers Conference is later this month, so the media spotlight may fall on Xbox, PlayStation and PC gaming. But as I found during my delayed train journey, games on phones remain innovative, fun and within easy reach at all times.

Mark Mattson, a neuroscientist at the National Institute on Aging in Maryland, has not had breakfast in 35 years. Most days he practices a form of fasting  skipping lunch, taking a midafternoon run, and then eating all of his daily calories (about 2,000) in a six-hour window starting in the afternoon.

Once you get used to it, its not a big deal, said Dr. Mattson, chief of the institutes laboratory of neurosciences. Im not hungry at all in the morning, and this is other peoples experience as well. Its just a matter of getting adapted to it.

In a culture in which its customary to eat three large meals a day while snacking from morning to midnight, the idea of regularly skipping meals may sound extreme. But in recent years intermittent fasting has been gaining popular attention and scientific endorsement.

It has been promoted in best-selling books and endorsed by celebrities like the actors Hugh Jackman and Benedict Cumberbatch. The late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel claims that for the past two years he has followed an intermittent fasting program known as the 5:2 diet, which entails normal eating for five days and fasting for two  a practice Mr. Kimmel credits for his significant weight loss.

Fasting to improve health dates back thousands of years, with Hippocrates and Plato among its earliest proponents. Dr. Mattson argues that humans are well suited for it: For much of human history, sporadic access to food was likely the norm, especially for hunter-gatherers. As a result, weve evolved with livers and muscles that store quickly accessible carbohydrates in the form of glycogen, and our fat tissue holds long-lasting energy reserves that can sustain the body for weeks when food is not available.

From an evolutionary perspective, its pretty clear that our ancestors did not eat three meals a day plus snacks, Dr. Mattson said.

Across the world, millions of people fast periodically for religious and spiritual reasons. But some are now looking at the practice as a source of health and longevity.

Valter Longo, the director of the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California, initially studied fasting in mice that showed that two to five days of fasting each month reduced biomarkers for diabetes, cancer and heart disease. The research has since been expanded to people, and scientists saw a similar reduction in disease risk factors.

Dr. Longo said the health benefits of fasting might result from the fact that fasting lowers insulin and another hormone called insulinlike growth factor, or IGF-1, which is linked to cancer and diabetes. Lowering these hormones may slow cell growth and development, which in turn helps slow the aging process and reduces risk factors for disease.

When you have low insulin and low IGF-1, the body goes into a state of maintenance, a state of standby, Dr. Longo said. There is not a lot of push for cells to grow, and in general the cells enter a protected mode.

Critics say that health benefits or not, various forms of intermittent fasting are too impractical for most people.

The 5:2 diet, for example, advocates eating without restrictions for five days and then consuming just 500 calories  roughly the equivalent of a light meal  on each of the other two days of the week. Another regimen, called alternate-day fasting, involves eating no more than 500 calories every other day.

A third regimen, which Dr. Mattson follows, is known as time-restricted feeding. The idea is to consume all of the days calories in a narrow window, typically six to eight hours, and fasting for the remaining 16 to 18 hours in a day. Studies of time-restricted feeding practices in both animals and humans have suggested that the practice may lower cancer risk and help people maintain their weight.

The scientific community remains divided about the value of intermittent fasting. Critics say that the science is not yet strong enough to justify widespread recommendations for fasting as a way to lose weight or boost health, and that most of the evidence supporting it comes from animal research. Advocates say the body of research on intermittent fasting is growing rapidly and indicates that the health benefits are striking.

The 5:2 diet, in particular, is backed by promising studies that show that it lowers weight and improves blood sugar, inflammation and other aspects of metabolic health, said Joy Dubost, a registered dietitian and a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the countrys largest organization of dietitians. She noted that fasting isnt appropriate for pregnant women, people with diabetes and people on medications.

Most people who do this understand that its not about binge eating, Dr. Dubost said. But they like that it gives them the freedom not to worry about calories, carbs and other restrictions on days when theyre not fasting.

Krista Varady, an associate professor of nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago, has studied the effects of alternate-day fasting on hundreds of obese adults. In trials lasting eight to 10 weeks, she has found that people lose on average about 13 pounds and experience marked reductions in LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, triglycerides and insulin, the fat-storage hormone.

Dr. Varady found in her research that intermittent fasting was easiest when people ate a moderately high-fat diet and were allowed to consume up to 500 calories on their fasting days. In her studies, 10 percent to 20 percent of people usually find the diet too difficult and quickly stop. Those who stick with it typically adjust after a rocky first few weeks.

Weve run close to 700 people through various trials, Dr. Varady said. We thought people would overeat on their feast days to compensate. But people for some reason, regardless of their body weight, can only eat about 10 or 15 percent more than usual. They dont really overeat, and I think thats why this works.

In 2011, Dr. Mattson and his colleagues reported a study of the 5:2 program that followed 107 overweight and obese women. Half of the subjects were assigned to eat no more than 500 calories each on two consecutive days each week. A control group was assigned to follow a low-calorie diet.

After six months, both groups had lost weight. But the intermittent fasting group lost slightly more  about 14 pounds on average  and had greater reductions in belly fat. They also retained more muscle and had greater improvements in blood sugar regulation.

Dr. Mattsons interest in intermittent fasting grew out of work on animals that showed that alternate-day fasting protected mice from strokes, Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease, and consistently extended their life spans by 30 percent. Dr. Mattson and his colleagues found that alternate-day fasting increased the production of proteins that protect brain cells, enhancing their ability to repair damaged DNA. Fasting, he said, acts as a mild stress that makes cells throughout the body stronger, shoring up their ability to adapt to later insults.

In this way, intermittent fasting is like exercise, which causes immediate stress and inflammation, but protects against chronic disease in the long run. Eating fruits and vegetables may have a similar effect. While very large doses of antioxidants can cause cancer in humans, moderate amounts of exposure can make cells more resilient, Dr. Mattson said.

There is overlap between the way cells respond to exercise, to fasting, and even to exposure to some of the chemicals in fruits and vegetables, he added.

Dr. Mattson is now starting a rigorous clinical trial of people 55 to 70 years old who are prediabetic and at high risk for developing Alzheimers disease. He plans to study whether intermittent fasting may slow cognitive decline.

Dr. David Ludwig, a professor of nutrition at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, said one benefit of fasting is that it forces the body to shift from using glucose for fuel to using fat. During this process, the fat is converted to compounds known as ketones, a clean energy source that burns more efficiently than glucose, like high-octane gasoline, Dr. Ludwig said.

The same process, known as ketosis, occurs when people go on extremely low-carb, high-fat diets. Dr. Ludwig said ketones seem to have unique effects on the brain. High-fat diets, for example, have been used for years to treat people who suffer from epileptic seizures.

There are extensive reports of children who had debilitating seizures who were cured on ketogenic diets, Dr. Ludwig said. If it benefits the brain to prevent seizures, then maybe it benefits the brain in other ways.

Dr. Ludwig noted that the long-term effectiveness of fasting had not been well studied. He cautioned that for many people, fasting is simply too difficult and may slow metabolism. A potentially more practical approach is to limit sugar and other processed carbohydrates, replacing them with natural fats, protein and unrefined carbohydrates, he said.

It takes a very disciplined person to skip a couple meals every day, he added.

But Dr. Mattson, who has been skipping meals for decades, said the adjustment to skipping breakfast and lunch was a lot like the change that occurs when a couch potato starts exercising.

If youve been sedentary for years and then you go out and try to run five miles, youre not going to feel very good until you get in shape, he said.  Its not going to be a smooth transition right away. It takes two weeks to a month to adapt.

How could narrators so prodigal in their empathy originate in the brain of that withholder? So muses the unnamed woman who speaks to us in Elizabeth Tallents story Narrator, which comes near the end of her enchanting new collection, Mendocino Fire. That withholder is a famous writer, sprawled on the steps of the stairwell at a welcome get-together for students in the creative writing program at Berkeley, and she has just watched him be flamboyantly rude to two young female admirers. Having thought highly of his novels, the new student has imagined the great man must have a radiance and generosity of spirit that are clearly not on offer. She feels betrayed.









But she has no idea how small and mean this famous writer will get, nor how quickly he will ensnare her in a sexual obsession that will reach its nadir when she steals a snapshot of his ex-girlfriend, a beautiful Chinese woman who rejected him. To keep it handy if she needs to make herself feel bad, she slips it into her copy of Middlemarch. Since the famous writer isnt a fan of George Eliot, she convinces herself that the immense sanity of Middlemarch made it a safe haven for the stolen photograph. Whenever I went back to Eliots novel, I imagined the magnanimous moral acuity with which the narrator would have illumined a theft like mine, bringing it into the embrace of the humanly forgivable while, at the same time  and how did Eliot manage this?  indicting its betrayal of the more honorable self that, in her narrators eyes, I would possess.

This offhand tribute to the genius of Eliots narrative prowess, delivered by an unnamed character writing in her own defense, is a move of breathtaking boldness, inviting a comparison that risks being invidious. The narrator maintains that if George Eliot were telling her story, it would be a better one! I confess that I immediately took Middlemarch down from the shelf to see if I agreed. Then I went skimming back through Tallents stories with a keener eye for her strategy.

Of the 10 stories, eight have third-person narrators, and one, an academic tale entitled Eros 101, is written in the form of a Q. and A. Although the narrators tend to stay close to one character, the subjects of the stories range widely, one might even say wildly, and they announce their concerns in the first sentence. Tabriz, which details the breakdown of a marriage after the husband brings home a valuable rug he found in a rubbish heap, begins this way: David Merson, heartsore in the way of old activists, a stooped, unkempt 48, leafs through his so-called love life for precedent and finds none. Never Come Back, a hair-raising tale of a fathers fixation with his sons girlfriend, opens with a straightforward statement of the case (This was his life now, his real life, the thing he thought about most: His boy was in and out of trouble and he didnt know what to do) and ends with a tantalizing nonconclusion (He knew enough not to go after them. He knew enough not to go after them yet). The final story, Briar Switch  in which an estranged daughter, desperate to reach her dying fathers bedside, manages to fly into an airport during a blizzard and rent a car  starts with a question and answer that toll like a death knell through the ordeal to come. Sure you want to go out in that? the rental agent asks. Frustrated by his slowness and deliberation, she insists, Im sure.

Such examples demonstrate how immediately engaging these stories are. Theres an overseeing, orchestrating voice, outside the characters but close enough to hear their thoughts. Though Northern California is often the locale, theres a lot of variety in socioeconomic status: It seems unlikely that these characters would ever get together in the same room, even by invitation. A fisherman, an eco-activist, a Virginia Woolf scholar, a refugee artist whose father was murdered by a firing squad, a mill worker, a young tree-sitter who has been living in a giant redwood for 143 days  all are presented from a vantage point both intimate and direct, with their courage and foibles and weaknesses intact.

The startling perceptions that slip out in the urgency of a moment are dissected on the scene. When the youthful tree-sitter misses a step in her daily scramble from branch to branch, she realizes that within the singularity of the fall, time can be observed, it seems, both backward and forward. In life, its now clear, consciousness is always so pinned down, and time is so much bigger than that pinpoint known as I. Nate Dawe, the fisherman in The Wrong Son, burdened by an overbearing father and his own collusion in illegal abalone excursions, goes out for some hard fishing on his fathers boat, the Louise. He was alone, leaning to toss a bucket of refuse, when a wave lolloped into the bow and the Louise shrugged him into the sea. Battling the deep troughs of water, Nate finds himself for once wholly aligned with necessity, rejoicing in the clear, clear light of live or die.

At a dinner party in Eros 101, Clio, the Virginia Woolf scholar, recognizing that shes being heartily seduced by a new colleague who will soon be up for tenure, is momentarily blindsided by this apercu: Clio is 42 to the others 20-something: fact. Fearful fact. Later in the story, when Clio fails to notice a diamond on her potential lovers ring finger, the reader is advised that since she is only a character, much of her own story is lost on her.

In The Narrator, the young writer wonders how George Eliot managed to draw characters who are at once both pardonable and blameworthy. She has hopes that this prowess has something to do with a writers radiance and generosity of spirit. But the ability to create characters who force us to withhold judgment and leave us gasping at their absolute, solid reality isnt the result of any special kindness or goodness on the part of the author. The magnanimous moral acuity Tallent claims for Eliot is a condition of philosophical distance, hopeful yet fearful, the kind that arises in old marriages after many years of deep commitment and, above all, close attention. Its not affection or defensiveness that can blast a character into the readers life. Its not pity or pitys upscale cousin, compassion. Its not even love. Beware of the writer who says, I love all my characters.

Its beyond love. Its knowledge. Thats what George Eliot had and so, Im pleased to report, does Elizabeth Tallent. It doesnt matter if shes a good person, or even a nice one. (I dont know her. I hope shes nice.) When a writer can tell a story as beautifully, as thoroughly and with as much knowledge as Elizabeth Tallent possesses, no one should care.",[]
nytimes.com,2013-04-27 00:00:00,Celebrity Guest Solver Elayne Boosler: Soft T's,"['Deb Amlen', 'Patrick Berry']","SUNDAYS PUZZLE  Ive written a few times about the Extremely Spunky Border Terrier who lives with me as the brains behind the Wordplay organization, and its rare to find someone who loves dogs even more than I do. I think Ive finally met my match in Elayne Boosler.

Ms. Boosler is known to us as a very funny comedian, yet she is so much more. In the 1980s, she successfully financed her own special at a time when women were not able to secure comedy specials on cable television, blowing the doors open for female comedians on cable TV. She has performed for people as varied as former president Bill Clinton and Queen Elizabeth II of England, and she has moderated a Democratic presidential candidates debate on C-SPAN for the National Organization for Women. Nearest to her heart, I believe, is her passion for promoting animal adoption, which primarily manifests itself in her activity with Tails of Joy, a nonprofit organization that raises funds for rescuers all over the country and beyond. Ms. Boosler is appearing as a regular on John Fugelsangs Current TV show, Viewpoint.

I see Soft Ts and my head takes off: Whats the formula? THs? Missing Ts? Soft tease  Gypsy Rose Lee? Softees  Snuggle Bear, Pillsbury Dough Boy, tissues, Mr. Softee, your grandma? If it wasnt The New York Times, it might be actresses who havent had implants. I always try to figure out the formula before looking at any clues. Its hard enough to write good jokes, but to construct a crossword containing twisted punch lines that surprise and delight, well, mad props. Any time I dont see the end of a joke coming, I doff my cap. Doff is such a crossword word, isnt it?

You can also usually count on STEN, E.L.O., ENO (the most famous musician in crossword history after ONO), either SSE or NNW (Im never good with directions), some state south or east of some other state, NONA Hendryx instead of Jimi, and either ETA or ETD. If they sold little crossword survival kits, those words would be included, along with coffee, a pen, and noise-canceling headphones. I cant work a crossword with any media on in the background. I cant come up with words while hearing words.

What I enjoyed about solving this puzzle was of course the wordplay of theths for ts, as Im a huge mangled language fan. Blame the Marx Brothers. I loved how beautifully the puns lent themselves to the clues. Once I got the formula, I had a lot of fun guessing the answers before checking the clues that led to them. I left four blank squares in this puzzle, as I dont know who Athena turned into a spider (ARACHNE) crossing a central Swiss canton (URI), though I feel I should. Im thinking by next Wednesday I will come back and just be able to write them in.

Ive been in about 45 newspaper crossword puzzles, mostly The New York Times. Funny Boosler. I dont flatter myself that its anything more than the puzzle creators trying to dupe the public with my Y, as opposed to Ela-I-ne. Ill take it, although on the last International Womens Day I was crossed by Golda Meir. Friends will excitedly say, Wow!! Youre 18 down!! But I know in my heart of hearts, real fame will only come when one day, the puzzle says, 62 Across. See 18 Down.

Years ago, I was negotiating to be in a Broadway show. We were far apart on money, when the big New York producer said to me, Frankly, I dont really even know who you are. That Sunday, I was in the New York Times crossword puzzle. I got the salary I asked for. I may owe you guys a commission.

Two years ago, I was having eye surgery. I was terrified. That morning I was in the New York Times crossword puzzle. I brought it into surgery and wrote across the top, Dear Dr. Devgan, please take very good care of 22 Across. He was delighted. I can see!

I absolutely love crosswords, Scrabble, word puzzles. My husbands one night off from the marriage list is Claudia Schiffer. Mine is Will Shortz. And Sandy Koufax, but I digress.

Im dyslexic. As a child riding in the car, I spelled my first word like this: Bar. R-A-B. Bar. I can sing backwards any song you can name, which once came in very handy while speaking to an assembly of fifth graders who wanted none of me until I had them shout out songs, after which they wouldnt let me go. I see everything backwards first, I can write upside down and backwards. I speak French, which means that my travel days are filled with French words backwards and forwards, followed by their English counterparts in every direction, after which they become the jumble, which I also do in my head without pen nor paper. Every day in Europe is exhausting for me. Rodney Dangerfield used to say to me, You have a very busy head.

For me, every crossword starts the same way. I look at 1 Across and then I do 1  4 or 5 Down in my head and so on, all through the puzzle. I use a pen and dont write anything down until I am sure of at least one solid letter. I love that when youve done all you possibly can, and finally walk away, your brain keeps quietly working on it, so that when you come back hours later you can just fill it all right in. I love that our brains quietly go about solving our problems while we consciously tend to other things. Ive also learned to accept imperfection, as in, there is usually one square in the puzzle that will remain blank. Whether its the second letter down of the blood of the Greek gods, or the second letter across of arsenic (rats bane), I never look words up. I accept that life is never neatly finished, that nothing is perfect, that things dont always fit, that you can always be better, that there is something to come back for. Of course Id rather solve it.",[]

On Thursday, we challenged Well readers to figure out the case of a 36-year-old man with a 20-year history of migrating joint pains along with other strange symptoms. Nearly 300 of you offered thoughtful suggestions of what he might have had. And one out of 10 of you were spot on.

The correct diagnosis is:

Ehlers Danlos syndrome

The first reader to correctly make this diagnosis was Bryley Williams, of New York City. She told me she knows nothing about medicine but found the answer on the Internet by investigating noninflammatory causes of joint pain and pneumothorax. All of the winners of this contest are extraordinary, but I think Ms. Williams may take the prize. She is 15 years old, a freshman in high school in New York City. Well done, Ms. Williams! Maybe you should consider a career in medicine once you graduate.

The Diagnosis

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or EDS, is a group of inherited disorders that affect the bodys connective tissues  the skin, muscles, tendons and ligaments that hold us together. Since the 1990s, the disease has been divided into six main types, depending on which connective tissues are most affected. Based on the gene study done in this patient, he was given a diagnosis of the least severe and most common variety, which primarily causes hypermobility of the joints as well as skin that is easily damaged and scars badly. EDS was probably recognized as early as 400 B.C., when Hippocrates noted that the nomads and Scythians had lax joints and multiple scars. This disorder came to more modern medical attention in the 17th century when, at a medical presentation in Holland, a Spanish sailor by the name of George Albes exhibited his remarkable ability to stretch the skin on his chest out an arms length. The first complete description of the condition was given by a Russian physician, Dr. A. N. Chernogubov, at the end of the 19th century. He presented a 17-year-old boy who suffered from recurrent joint dislocations and easily stretched and fragile skin. The boy had many scars resulting from minor injuries, because these patients do not heal normally. Based on these observations, Dr. Chernogubov predicted that the clinical manifestations were caused by an abnormality of the connective tissues. That report did not come to the notice of Western Europe for many years. So while the disorder still carries Chernogubovs name in Russia, in most places it referred to as EDS, after the two physicians who first characterized the disorder in Paris decades later: Dr. Edvard Ehlers and Dr. Henri-Alexandre Danlos.

How the Diagnosis Was Made

The patient, a 36-year-old man with a 20-year history of migrating joint pain, had been to dozens of doctors  internists, orthopedic surgeons, rheumatologists. All had examined him and seen nothing. Indeed, his last rheumatologist kept saying that she wanted to believe that he had this much pain but that she couldnt find anything physical to cause it. One orthopedist had asked him if his skin was particularly stretchy or if he was very flexible  obviously thinking of a diagnosis like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but the patient said no. He didnt think he was particularly flexible or that his skin was unusually stretchy. Later, once he had the diagnosis, he showed one of his doctors how he could move his thumb, and the doctor told him that he was popping it in and out of joint. And the geneticist told him that his skin was stretchy enough to fit the diagnostic criteria. Still, it all seemed normal to him. Not extraordinary in any way. Still, after 20 years of searching, the patient was finally willing to accept that he was just more prone to getting these pains. And he began keeping a list of the types of exercises or activities that seemed most likely to trigger the episodes of joint pain. His wife was unwilling to give up. She continued to search the Internet for answers.

Like Son, Like Father?

The final clue came not from the mans doctor but from his sons. The boy, age 11, went to see his pediatrician, Dr. Renee Brand, for his annual physical exam. He was tall and slender, like his father. He had a colt-like awkwardness about him, with arms and legs that looked just a bit too long to be well managed. And he had a stooped posture, as if he spent too much time gazing into a smartphone he didnt even have. Could he sit up completely straight? Dr. Brand asked. He couldnt, though he tried. Later the doctor asked him to bend over so that she could check his spine for scoliosis. He immediately flopped down, his chest almost touching his knees and his hands lying flat on the floor in front of him. Dr. Brand was surprised by this remarkable degree of flexibility. When the boy righted himself, she asked him to straighten his legs as far as they would go. When he did, his knees went well past straight, so that his legs bowed backward. Straightening his elbows produced a similar curve. I think maybe you should take him to see an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Brand suggested to the boys mother. Two weeks later the mom called Dr. Brand with a report. Shed taken the boy to see the surgeo,n and he had in turn recommended that she take him to see a geneticist. I thought so, replied Dr. Brand with satisfaction. Seeing how remarkably flexible the young man was, and how hard it was for him to stand up straight, Dr. Brand thought the boy might have a disorder known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

Getting a Diagnosis

After making the appointment with the geneticist, the boys mother sat down at the computer to read up on Ehlers-Danlos. As she read through the descriptions, she could definitely recognize her son. But in those pages she also recognized her husband. Joint pain, check; pneumothorax, check; osteoporosis, check; scoliosis, check. Ultimately this inherited disease was diagnosed in both father and son. Theres no cure for EDS, but its important to know that you have it. The son sees a cardiologist every couple of years, since EDS can lead to problems with heart valves and vessels. He was found to be at risk for a dangerous stretching of his aorta that, without repair, could lead to rupture. And both father and son now understand which exercises are going to be a problem for them  possibly causing joint dislocations or other musculoskeletal injuries.

A South Carolina high school teacher who says she was forced to resign after a student took her phone and circulated a nude picture of her has garnered the support of hundreds of students who signed a petition demanding she be reinstated.









The teacher, Leigh Anne Arthur, who had taught for more than a decade in Union County, which is about 70 miles northwest of Columbia, said she had left her phone on her desk and was out of the classroom when a 16-year-old boy took her phone. The phone was passed among several classes of students, and the photo  which Ms. Arthur said she had taken for her husband for Valentines Day  was copied and shared.

The Union County Schools superintendent, David Eubanks, said in an interview that Ms. Arthur shared responsibility for the episode because she had allowed students to use her phone in the past.

It became a regular piece of equipment that they used in that classroom, Dr. Eubanks said. Knowing that, why did she put that photograph on that cellphone?

He said the student discovered the photo on Feb. 18, a Thursday, and his office learned of the episode the following Monday from the director of the Union County Career and Technology Center, where Ms. Arthur taught an engineering course.

Ms. Arthur was confronted with the information on Tuesday, Dr. Eubanks said, and was told that she could either resign or face due process procedures. She tendered her resignation the next day, he said.

But Ms. Arthur said in an interview with a local CBS affiliate, The whole premise of my privacy being invaded is being ignored.

Ms. Arthur, who could not immediately be reached for comment, told a local NBC station that the student should be held responsible for his actions: He had to hit my apps button and to open up all my apps and then open my gallery.

She said that she had been forced to resign. But Dr. Eubanks said the resignation had been her choice.

The students online petition says: Leigh Anne Arthur is the victim of a blatant attack of her privacy. Personal photographs were illegally obtained by a student and were sent to other students in the school (Union County High). After being escorted off of school property, we (the students) are left to believe that she has been forced to, or given little choice but to resign.

As of 9 a.m. Thursday, the petition had more than 3,000 signatures.

On Wednesday, Ms. Arthur said that color copies of the picture were placed in her mailbox, according to the NBC affiliate. One had a handwritten message on the back of it. She called the Sheriffs Office.

The school district said that the initial episode was still being investigated. In a statement, Dr. Eubanks suggested that the student who had taken the phone may also be severely punished by law enforcement, as well as the school district.

I could care less about what kind of pictures she has on her cellphone, Dr. Eubanks said in the interview. But once students gain access to it, that becomes and still remains the big issue.

The superintendent said that his office had been inundated with calls from people disturbed by the episode, some of them coming from other parts of the country.

But he said any anger directed at his office was less upsetting than the fact that good students, good people will suffer from this.

Its going to affect the lives of several people, all because of her failure to properly supervise her class, he said.

Ms. Arthur said she knew who the student is but had forgiven him, according to the NBC station.

Hes 16, she said. Hes going to make stupid decisions. We all make stupid decisions when were 16.",[]

nytimes.com,2011-01-31 00:00:00,Tuesday: Celebrity Guest Solver Mollie Katzen,['Deb Amlen'],"Barbara Ireland/The New York Times

TUESDAYS PUZZLE  So, I was sitting here wondering how to introduce todays guest, when it occurred to me that what I needed was a really good segue. See if this works.

Ron and Nancy Byron have cooked up an especially fun puzzle for us today.

{Pause for effect}

Speaking of cooking, Id like you all to welcome our celebrity guest solver, the author of best-selling cookbooks Mollie Katzen, who wrote two of my favorite vegetarian cookbooks: the groundbreaking, original Moosewood Cookbook and The Enchanted Broccoli Forest. (She literally penned them: not only did she create the mouthwatering recipes, but she also illustrated them. And the books are almost entirely hand-lettered. Theyre beautiful.) Since then, Ms. Katzen has written nine other cookbooks, including three for children. She is currently at work on her twelfth book. If anyone can entice you to eat your veggies, Ms. Katzen can. Shes also hilarious and very honest about her solving experience. I know youll enjoy reading about it.

With the exception of the circles highlighting todays theme, this is a very straightforward Tuesday puzzle, heavy on the beverages (ODOULS, DADS Root Beer, and another that is a theme entry, so I wont give it away), which may account for Ms. Katzens relative discomfort in the early part of her solving experience. Ill let her explain:

Mollie Katzens Solving Notes:

I had never done a crossword puzzle before getting this fascinating assignment. I put that in quotes because over the years I had, once in a while, crept up to my mothers partially finished daily crossword  yes, in ink  while she would take a break (if she took a break or even a breath, she was that quick) and timidly ventured a word or two in very light pencil.

I also must disclose, in all fairness to myself, that I came to this with a small bit of general puzzle experience. Namely, I had been a true champ at finding the hidden items in those hidden pictures pages in Highlights magazine when I was in second grade. I found those very exciting, which might or might not say something about my childhood.

Moving along. So here I was with this Tuesday puzzle, and, still with a politely faint pencil, found myself glued to the chair for north of an hour. Is it oversharing to say I actually had to use the bathroom, but kept putting off getting up because I was so absorbed? I kept saying to myself, Just one more word, and Ill let me get up, but I was too enthralled. There were lots of three-letter quickies that were so fun: ECO, XED, I BE (as in May ___ excused?). Cool! This part was a blast, but then, I realized I had to face other clues requiring more spaces. Watery hue was one thing (yay, me!), but Pre-Russia int. economic coalition? (Is it me? Did I take the wrong courses in college?)

After an hour and a quarter, I had half of it done  in pencil so reticent, I could barely read what Id written. I decided to give it a rest until the following night, when I would be having dinner with a couple of my delightful and very articulate author friends. One of them, Marissa Moss (fluent in a ridiculous number of languages, and quick as lightning in most matters), was happy to help. Although I didnt appreciate her informing me that if its a Tuesday puzzle, its considered an easy one (thanks, pal!), I was nonetheless deeply impressed by her facility. She picked up a pen (dreaded ink!) and dashed off the other half of the puzzle in four and a half minutes flat. I tried to get a word in edgewise, but having blinked, I missed the chance. Being a charitable sort, she explained to me that years of doing the daily puzzle as part of her morning routine had conferred a fluency afforded by practice.

Nonetheless, I came away from this experience believing a) that my friend is a genius, and b) that it might indeed be meaningful (and someday  who knows, useful?) to ponder the fact that the actresses Garr and Hatcher share a first name, unusual spelling included. I stand enriched.

Thanks for playing, Ms. Katzen!

Every March, as St. Patricks Day approaches and Yeats and stout and the Undertones and other Irish matters are on my mind, I recall a conversation I often have. A friend is about to go to Ireland for the first time and asks me for recommendations. Inevitably, the first thing I say is: Dont skip the North.

This advice is usually met with skepticism. Memories of news about Northern Ireland during the Troubles  the 30-year period of conflict during which violence frequently flared up  still linger long after the Good Friday agreement of 1998, and many people remain wary of visiting. Thats a real shame, because Northern Ireland is home to some of that green islands most spectacular scenery, and its capital, Belfast, is among my all-time-favorite drinking cities.

Belfast is compact and brimming with distinctive bars full of character, particularly in the Cathedral Quarter, an arty district with St. Annes Cathedral at its heart. On a business trip in 2010, I was staying in the Quarter at the elegant Merchant Hotel, mostly because I had heard great things about its cocktail bar. I knew nothing about the Spaniard, a bar across the street from the Merchant, but decided to check it out. Appealingly cozy and dark, with most of its surfaces taken up by pictures and knickknacks, it felt like the sort of place where an unusually well-mannered pirate might make himself at home. I arrived with a sore throat, for which the quick-thinking barman prescribed an excellent hot whiskey (I later discovered the bars winning way with rum cocktails). A local woman  an off-duty constable  struck up a conversation. I mentioned that I was a writer, and she insisted that I next join her and her friends at the John Hewitt, a bar named for a Belfast poet and activist.

When we got there, a folk trio was playing, and playing well. A fire burned in a small hearth. I drank a pint of rich porter from a local brewery and was swept up in convivial chatter by everyone around me. Reading the fine print on the menu, I learned that the bar is operated by the Belfast Unemployed Resource Center and that its profits benefit the organization. I thought it was an ingenious model, and I knew the Hewitt would become a bar Id return to on every trip to Belfast.

I also return to the majestic Crown Liquor Saloon, a confection of ornate tile work, stained glass, high ceilings and intricately carved woodwork. The tough choice here is whether to belly up to the bar or try to claim one of the intimate snugs  private booths designed, it is said, for those who wish to drink discreetly.

I have wondered if the very things that put people off when I implore them to visit Belfast  the citys complex history and its enduring, though softening, scars  are what make the warmth and hospitality I have discovered in its bars not only surprising but also especially deep and affecting. Drink in Belfast. Youll have a great time. Youll meet great people. And give my best regards to all.

Recently, university researchers asked children and parents to describe the rules they thought families should follow related to technology.

In most cases, parents and children agreed  dont text and drive; dont be online when someone wants to talk to you. But there was one surprising rule that the children wanted that their parents mentioned far less often: Dont post anything about me on social media without asking me.

As in, no pictures of them asleep in the back of the car. No posts about their frustration with their homework. That victory picture after the soccer game? Maybe. The frustrated rant about the fight you just had over laundry? No way.

The answers revealed a really interesting disconnect, said Alexis Hiniker, a graduate student in human-centered design and engineering at the University of Washington who led the research. She, along with researchers at the University of Michigan, studied 249 parent-child pairs distributed across 40 states and found that while children ages 10 to 17 were really concerned about the ways parents shared their childrens lives online, their parents were far less worried. About three times more children than parents thought there should be rules about what parents shared on social media.

Sites like Facebook and Instagram are now baked into the world of todays families. Many, if not most, new parents post images of their newborn online within an hour of birth, and some parents create social media accounts for the children themselves  often to share photos and news with family, although occasionally in the pursuit of Instafame for their fashionably clad, beautifully photographed sons and daughters.

With the first babies of Facebook (which started in 2004) not yet in their teens and the stylish kids of Instagram (which started in 2010) barely in elementary school, families are just beginning to explore the question of how children feel about the digital record of their earliest years. But as this study, although small, suggests, its increasingly clear that our children will grow into teenagers and adults who want to control their digital identities.

As these children come of age, theyre going to be seeing the digital footprint left in their childhoods wake, said Stacey Steinberg, a legal skills professor and associate director of the Center on Children and Families at the University of Florida Levin College of Law. While most of them will be fine, some might take issue with it.

Some children and teenagers question both past and present sharing. I really dont like it when my parents post pictures of me on their social media accounts, especially after finding out that some of my friends follow them, said Maisy Hoffman, 14, an eighth grader who lives in Manhattan. I worry more about my dad. He doesnt always ask if he can post things, so I immediately turn away and ask if hes going to post it. Or Ill find out later because my friend saw something of me on his Instagram and Ill have to ask him to take it down.

Other parents can also present a problem for the child who prefers to control how she appears online. Wendy Bradford, a mother of three elementary-school aged children in Manhattan, said that when parent chaperones took pictures during a third-grade field trip to the zoo, her daughter hid when she saw the phones because she didnt want the pictures to be posted on Facebook with her in them.

Isabella Aijo, 15, a high school sophomore in Natick, Mass., said, I definitely know people who have parents who post things they wish werent out there. There was a girl in my eighth grade class whose mom opened a YouTube account for her in the fourth grade to show off her singing, she wrote to me in an email. Finally, on one of the last months of middle school, a peer played the song in class and almost the entire class laughed hysterically over it.

Those early posts from parents linger, not just online, but in our childrens memories  and the topics may be things we dont see as potentially embarrassing. The son of a friend (who asked that I not use her name) still brings up things she wrote about his picky eating when he was younger  years ago, she says.

But that kind of sharing  about food issues, potty training and tantrums  is exactly the kind of sharing that can be valuable. Children benefit from the community created when parents have the ability to share their stories, said Ms. Steinberg. Those posts about picky eating might have helped my friend find solutions, or a fresh wellspring of patience for a behavior her child would eventually outgrow.

When parents share those early frustrations, they dont see themselves as exposing something personal about their childrens lives, but about their own. As a society, says Ms. Steinberg, were going to have to find ways to balance a parents right to share their story and a parents right to control the upbringing of their child with a childs right to privacy.

Parents often intrude on a childs digital identity, not because they are malicious, but because they havent considered the potential reach and the longevity of the digital information that theyre sharing, said Ms. Steinberg.

In general, said Sarita Schoenebeck, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, who co-authored the research, both children and parents considered positive images, events and news more appropriate to share than negative ones. Parents can consider, too, the searchability and reach of the format (although those are always evolving). A frustrated tweet about a child who wont eat her cereal because its not in a red bowl is a lot less likely to resurface than a YouTube video of the resulting tantrum. Looking for advice or sympathy about a behavioral problem? Skip both the image, and your childs name, in a post to limit later searches.

At our house, I sometimes see the hesitation in my oldest son, who is 14, when I bring out the camera at a goofy moment, but we have a whole house rule: no sharing images of anyone else without their consent, ever. That trust means I get my candid shots, and he keeps his digital identity, whatever he eventually wants it to be, intact.

IN August 2009, I was betrayed by both my husband and my country.









A few months earlier I had left Iran  for good, perhaps, though I did not know it then. The government had harassed me for years for my work as a lawyer and a human-rights activist, and the threats against me had increased in the run-up to the presidential election that June. I took a vacation and, along with my younger daughter, Nargess, went to visit my older daughter, Negar, in Atlanta.

I usually spoke to my husband, Javad, two or three times a week, on appointed days. He had a SIM card for my calls, bought under someone elses name, to make it difficult for the authorities to trace.

One Monday, I wasnt able to reach him during our usual time. I wasnt unduly concerned. He often spent long weekends at our country house, where the reception was weak. But days passed, and there was no word from him. I finally called my sister in Tehran, Nooshin, and asked her to check on our apartment, but it was empty.

Then Nooshin called me to say that she had knocked again and found him at home. She said he had just returned from a trip, was unwell, and was going straight to bed.

The next day, Javad called.

Shirin? His voice shook.

Where have you been? Nooshin has been looking for you!

Shirin, I dont know if you can forgive me. I could hear him breathing shallowly.

Are you crying? My fingers flew to my throat. Whats happened?

Will you forgive me?

Javad, tell me first whats happened!

He began to explain, in a crushed, flattened voice, what had transpired in the nearly two weeks since we had last spoken. This is what my husband of 34 years relayed to me:

He had been feeling, in his words, very lonely and empty. One evening a friend of his, a Ms. Jafari, invited him over to her apartment.

Very unexpectedly, a mutual friend, Mehri, also stopped by. Javads voice dropped off.

Between Mehri and me ... a romantic relationship used to exist. But I had not seen her for a very long time. Years. We had stopped our relationship. But Ms. Jafari thought we should get back together. She kept pouring us more to drink and saying that we were both going through difficult times and could support each other. She kept stressing that now that my wife was gone, I was all alone and needed someone to show me some affection.

Apparently, at that point, this Ms. Jafari said she had an appointment and left my husband and the other woman alone.

Mehri started taking her clothes off, hugging me, saying how much she had missed me.

I said nothing.

Shirin, are you there? Are you listening?

I was not a suspicious wife. He had never raised questions about my male colleagues, and Id accorded him the same understanding. It had seemed to work for us, this mutual respect. Until now. I kept staring at the coffee table, with its magazines, a Rembrandt coaster; all of it looked the same as it had five minutes ago. How could it look the same?

Go on.

She kept touching me ... and I ... I succumbed ... We were embracing in the bedroom when suddenly the door of the second bedroom of the apartment burst open.

That was when an intelligence agent  a man I knew well, who had gone after my work for years  and two cameramen came in. They had recorded everything  the conversation, the whole event. They ordered Javad to dress, and in a few minutes the apartment was full of agents. Javad was handcuffed, blindfolded and pushed downstairs and into a car.

What happened to ... that woman? And your host? I tried to keep the rage out of my voice, but I couldnt bring myself to say her name.

They only arrested me. Im sure Jafari was cooperating with them. How else could they have set up all their equipment before I even got there? I cant really be sure about Mehri. All I know is they didnt arrest her.

Javad was taken to Evin Prison, where I had visited so many clients and where, nine years earlier, I myself had once spent 25 days, on a charge of disturbing public opinion.

Because he had been caught drinking alcohol, his bare back was lashed. Did the lasher hold a Quran under his arm, to prevent him from using too much force? I forgot to ask this.

And then they led him to a solitary confinement cell, perhaps only slightly bigger than a bathtub, and left him there for two days.

On the third day, two prison guards came. They blindfolded him again and led him to a sort of courtroom, where a bearded cleric, the judge, sat behind a wooden desk.

Javad later told me what the judge had said:

Ive watched the entire film. Theres really no room for denial. You are a married man and have committed adultery. According to Article 225 of the Islamic Penal Code, you are sentenced to death by stoning. The sentence will be carried out two days from now.

I want a lawyer, Javad said. Im not going to do anything without a lawyer.

A lawyer! the judge said, amused. What for? What is a lawyer going to say? We have a film of you, sir  your entire liaison is on camera! What kind of defense do you imagine you could mount? Just go. Go be ashamed of yourself, and spend your last two days repenting to God.

The trial took about 20 minutes. Iranian judges scarcely ever handed down stoning verdicts, but the situation seemed to require an especially horrific punishment. The real purpose of the arrest became clear a few hours later, when the intelligence agent who had arrested Javad, along with his boss, came to Javads cell.

I cant help imagining them standing over him, Javad unshaven, with dark circles under his eyes.

Now Ebadi can see the result of her activities, the agent told him grandly. I warned her so many times. So many times I told her, You need to shut up. But she never listened.

Javad had never been involved in my cases; he was not political. Why should I be responsible for what my wife does? he asked them. What kind of dirty games are you trying to play with me? Because of my wife, you harass me like this, in the name of Islam?

The agents eyes darkened. He lunged toward Javad, punching him, kicking him savagely.

Dont you dare ever mention Islam again, do you hear me? The word Islam is dirty in your mouth.

The intelligence agent said I had been proud; now I would see my weakness.

When Javad saw that pleading or protesting would only provoke more beating, he asked what it was they wanted.

For the first time, the agents boss spoke. He explained the problem:

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Advertisement Advertisement Continue reading the main story

If youre still defending your wife, it means youre her ally and collaborator. And you should be punished as such. If the truth is otherwise, you need to prove that to us.

All he had to do in order to gain his freedom was to read a short statement in front of a camera:

Shirin Ebadi did not deserve to receive the Nobel Prize. She was awarded the prize so that she could help topple the Islamic Republic. She is a supporter of the West, particularly America. Her work is not in the service of Iranians, but serves the interests of foreign imperialists who seek to weaken Iran.

He knew immediately he would do it. Surely, everyone would know that he had been pressured into saying those things.

And so the next day he shaved, showered and sat in a staged living room, with comfortable armchairs and a side table with a vase of plastic pink roses, and denounced me.

He told me all this, and it was bad enough. But what I heard next was worse. In order to overturn the stoning sentence for adultery, he and the woman he had slept with would have to go to a cleric for a certificate of temporary marriage, backdated by five years.

Javad was waiting for me to say something, but I was, for perhaps the first time in my life, unable to come up with a single thing. As a woman, a wife, I was sick with anger. He had betrayed me. But I was even more furious with the intelligence agents. They were prepared to do anything  crush peoples families, their marriages  to achieve their ends.

WHAT did they want from me? I didnt permit myself that thought very often. But it came careening into my head, and I wanted to run out onto the balcony and scream it. How much could they take away from one person? I had been the first female judge in Iran. After the Islamic Revolution, they took that from me. When I resurrected myself and built a human-rights center, they took that, too. With their violence and electoral fraud, I had lost my homeland. And now they had tried to take away my husband. I closed my eyes, wanting nothing but to go to sleep. But Javad was talking again, asking me  me!  for advice about his pending stoning sentence.

What do you think I should do?

I dont see any option but to do as theyve asked, I said. But, of course, only if ... that woman ... agrees.

Javad said he would try to contact her and would let me know what happened.

I waited to hear back. Moving around the apartment in Atlanta, I thanked God for small graces. That my daughters had been out when Javad called, and that they would  at least for a time  be spared knowing what had been done to their parents.

I swung between rage and guilt. It was my work that had caused this to happen to my husband. And yet was it not Javad who had betrayed me? But I was not in his shoes, isolated, away from my wife and daughters, vulnerable. I thought of telling him that he was not alone. That I knew of many cases where the Intelligence Ministry had done the same sorts of things to others, used sexual blackmail in order to force dissident politicians out of public life or simply to wound and silence critics. But knowing this didnt lessen my anger, and I doubted that it would lessen his pain.

A week later, Javad called and told me how things had gone. He had telephoned Mehri  he said her name, I did not  and she had agreed to go with him to see the cleric. As promised, the cleric had issued a backdated marriage certificate that showed them, at the date of filming, to have been sigheh, or temporarily married. Under sigheh, the duration of the marriage is determined in advance; it could be as short as an hour or as long as a decade. If a child is born, he or she is a rightful child, with all legal entitlements from both parents. When the sigheh expires, the couple should separate, unless the arrangement is mutually extended. The practice has existed for centuries but is shunned by younger and less traditional Iranians, who see it as an archaic religious loophole that effectively legalizes prostitution.

Javad had taken the certificate back to the court at Evin and paid a small fine. The punishment they had dangled over him, execution by stoning, the punishment they had used to force him to denounce me before the cameras, was null. But he had been required to turn over his passport and was barred from leaving the country.

In the days that followed, we talked several times. But I felt as though I was speaking to a stranger. Javad was broken, pleading during each conversation for me not to leave him. He sounded so unwell that regardless of my own feelings, I was worried for him. His denunciation of me had not yet been released, and the threat of it hung over our heads. He kept saying he wanted to see me and the girls, but it was impossible.

I tried to keep it from our daughters, but Nargess finally confronted me. She had overheard something Id said on the phone; she wanted to know what was happening.

After I told her, she just kept demanding: Why would he do such a thing and speak against you? Why would he go with that woman?

I decided to be frank. Nargess worked in The Hague, researching and documenting terrible atrocities. She needed to see how that work connected to what she was experiencing in her family. The field of human rights is not about pretty words; it involves the abuse of the vulnerable by those who wield power. That was the line that connected massacres in Sarajevo to atrocities in Sierra Leone to the systematic persecution of dissidents in places like Iran and Russia.

I told her that if she wanted to be a human-rights lawyer, she had to understand what that world involved.

Human beings are free, Nargess. But each individual has only a certain threshold for suffering. Your father couldnt take that kind of torture. This could have happened to any man, I said. This is something between him and me. But you have to look at it differently. You should be wondering why an intelligence agent was hiding with a camera in the second bedroom. Were the countrys problems resolved by determining who was cheating on whom? This was a trap they used against me, and that is how you must think about it.

It was a bitter lesson to impart to my daughter. More than six years later  after Javads denunciation of me was aired on television; after countless agonized phone calls; after we finally agreed to divorce  it is a lesson I am still learning myself.",[]

WEDNESDAYS PUZZLE  If you happen to be on Facebook, you know that you can express your approval of just about anything with the click of the LIKE button.

Wouldnt it be great if there were an I feel thankful button? Gratitude is an essential component of happiness, and I believe its important to acknowledge and express our gratitude on a regular basis. In fact, todays I feel thankful button clicks go to both the actor and writer Josh Radnor and to Will Shortz, our fearless puzzle master, for asking Mr. Radnor to be our guest solver.

Mr. Radnor plays the role of Ted on the CBS television series How I Met Your Mother, and in May, Mr. Shortz hilariously portrayed himself in the episode Robots vs. Wrestlers. After the cast crashes a highfalutin New York party where Mr. Shortz is among the guests, Teds intellectual snobbery ingratiates him with the highbrow crowd because a party isnt rocking until someone recites Dante in the original Italian, is it?

Now, Mr. Radnor makes his directorial debut with Happythankyoumoreplease, a film about gratitude, connection and love that opens March 4 in New York and Los Angeles, March 11 in San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas, and Phoenix, and expanding to other cities after that. He also wrote the screenplay and stars in it, so Im particularly thankful that he took the time out to solve Barry Silks very clever puzzle.

Oh, right. The puzzle. I thought this was a very nice Wednesday, with a cool theme that may not reveal itself entirely until you get to 54 Across. Be patient. Youre at least somewhat likely to get it. Having lived in New York City for most of my life, I got LEASH LAW right away, although I was held up momentarily by the fact that I can never predict which Mauna is needed.

Lets see how Mr. Radnor did. SPOILER ALERT: Mr. Radnor gives away far more than I normally do in a post (in fact, the theme is revealed), so if youre still solving, please wait until youre done to read his witty write-up:

Josh Radnors Solving Notes:

The crossword puzzle is a bit of a double-edged sword for me: I love doing it, but I often use it to avoid doing the things I really should be doing. (Weird meta-case in point: this morning, I delayed finishing this piece about solving the crossword puzzle by working on a crossword puzzle.) I started doing The New York Times crossword puzzle when I was 19, and there were years when I had to do the puzzle every day or I just didnt feel right. I have a freakish ability to stare at a tougher puzzle for an absurdly long time, but this tendency can also, if unchecked, get in the way of, you know, life. Nowadays, I try to limit myself to Sundays. Its an addiction, after all, and Ive had to manage it. As far as addictions go, though, its one of the more pleasant and least harmful ones to have.

So I generally scan all the clues very quickly for any gimmes, which is what I did on this one. The first five that popped out at me were all peoples names  ROONE Arledge, LON Chaney, IAN McShane, UMA Thurman, AXL Rose. It seems having a distinctive three-letter name pretty much guarantees crossword puzzle immortality. Im thinking of you, Emo Phillips and Yma Sumac. My first non-name was 62 Across, Russian pancakes (BLINI).

There are certain things I know only because I do crossword puzzles. For instance, there is absolutely no reason I would know that Ray KROC (43 Down) founded McDonalds were it not for crossword puzzles. (Ditto on a priests robe being an alb and fishermen being called anglers.) Arthur ASHE is a crossword regular, and he makes an appearance in this puzzle (37 Down, 1975 Wimbledon winner), as does ARLEN Specter (64 Across).

Some of the things I enjoyed in the puzzle: 1 Across and 9 Across, two great words: AGASP and ABHOR. One of the best-titled magazines Ive never read: UTNE reader (55 Down). I rather liked the clues for 65 Across (Its a plus, ASSET) and 45 Down (Watch a kitty, CAT-SIT.) One Down, Smart guys? took me a moment. I initially thought it was MENSA, but the question mark led me to ALECS.

The theme of the puzzle, OUTSIDE CHANCE was clever (well done, Barry C. Silk!). Twenty, 29 and 44 Across all split the word chance to flank the beginning and end of the answer: Big Bopper hit [(CHAN)TILLY LA(CE)], Barrier with a diamond pattern [(CHA)INLINK FE(NCE)], and the one that gave me the most trouble, Group overseeing Notre Dame Cathedral [(CH)URCH OF FR(ANCE)].

Ive long wondered why I enjoy the crossword puzzle so much (and when I say crossword puzzle, I mean the New York Times crossword puzzle  all other puzzles feel like imposters to me). I think it appeals to the part of my brain that longs for order  for everything to be, as Radiohead sings, in its right place. Writing and directing my first movie was, I realized, not unlike solving a crossword puzzle. Even though there are far more variables, there is something very puzzlelike in the construction of a movie. You can feel when a scene or line of dialogue is finally where it needs to be, and conversely, when it isnt. Directing a movie is intensely time-consuming, and Im getting set to direct my second one. Hopefully, Ill be able to limit my puzzle intake during the process. One day at a time.

Thanks for playing, Mr. Radnor, and thank you for helping me start a discussion about gratitude.

LONDON  The American promoter Charlie Stillitano could hardly have chosen a worse time to push for change in European soccer.









Stillitano, the chairman of Relevant Sports, runs summer tournaments called the International Champions Cup. It features elite soccer teams from Europe playing one another during their off-seasons in three different countries: the United States, Australia and China. Its novelty factor has drawn sold-out crowds and drummed up television and sponsorship money for, in effect, watching half-fit star players getting into shape for the coming season.

Europes best are coming, is the slogan on its website. Relevant Sports claims to have revolutionized the international soccer landscape by transforming the standard European club preseason tour into something remarkable: a competitive, world-class tournament.

Those words are like something from an old-school boxing promoter: The tournament features the heavyweights of the game, but it fails to mention that the teams are nowhere close to their peak when it comes to performance.

Last week, Stillitano met in London with executives of five English clubs: Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United. On satellite radio, Stillitano later talked about how those teams are the elite of the Champions League and, in his view, deserve permanent roles in the tournament and far more money.

Lets call it the money pot created by soccer and the fandom around the world, Stillitano said on a show on Sirius XM. Who has had more of an integral role, Manchester United or Leicester?

He acknowledged that Leicester Citys rise out of nowhere to lead the English Premier League this season is a wonderful, wonderful story. But, the promoter said, you have to look at it from Manchester Uniteds or Chelseas perspective.

Those teams are having a bad season (or several, in Manchesters case). They might not qualify for a place in the next Champions League and that, according to Stillitano, should not be allowed to happen. Essentially, he would want a tournament without relegation for the biggest clubs.

I guess they dont have a birthright to be in it every year, he said, but its the age-old argument  U.S. sports franchises versus what they have in Europe. There are wonderful, wonderful, wonderful elements to relegation and promotion, and there are good arguments for a closed system.

Is Stillitano really Silvio Berlusconi in disguise?

Nearly 30 years ago, when Berlusconis team, A.C. Milan, was ruling Europe, the Italian politician and club owner attempted to lead a breakaway of Europes richer clubs and close the door to any upstart from gate-crashing what is now the Champions League.

The word champion has become a misnomer. Nowadays, four clubs from England, Spain, Germany and sometimes Italy qualify  some, seemingly perennially  for the UEFA Champions League. The fact that A.C. Milan struggles now in Italy, or that both Manchester teams and Chelsea are suffering below-par seasons in England, is no reason to exclude them from the financial spoils of top European competition, according to the Berlusconi/Stillitano theory.

Over the weekend, Leicesters Italian coach, Claudio Ranieri, described that as anti-competitive, a proposal by the elite, for the elite.

You are afraid, Ranieri said. You are not strong. You should ask why is little Leicester doing better than us? Instead, you want to change the system because this year you are weak.

Beyond that, Stillitanos International Champions Cup is in danger this year of being pushed aside on two fronts. Starting in June, the Copa America Centenario, a special edition of the South American continental championship, will be played in 10 American cities to mark the events 100th anniversary.

The top South American players who normally would take part in the off-season tours by the big European clubs will instead be playing in the United States for their national teams.

In addition, the majority of the best European players will also be in action in June and July, when their national teams play in an expanded Euro 2016 tournament in France.

Barcelona is the champion of champions in world soccer at the moment, but it wont be traveling to Australia, China or the United States to play in the world-class I.C.C. this summer.

How could Barcelona take part? Its top three stars  Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez  will be playing for their countries at the expanded Copa America, while much of the rest of the team will be trying to defend Spains title at the Euro.

Barcelona will have a presence in the United States this summer. It will hold summer camps for children in nine cities as it increases its awareness abroad, the clubs president, Josep Bartomeu, told me on the same day in another London hotel just a few hundred yards from where Stillitano met with the club officials.

Bartomeu said then that his club, like all the rest, cannot ignore the rising popularity of soccer in the United States. But equally important, the club  the reigning Spanish, European and Club World Cup champion  appreciates that athletes do have a breaking point.

The off-season is when Messi, Neymar and their teammates can finally rest and recuperate and spend time with their families after a grueling nine-month season  or even undergo the surgeries needed to repair the damage taken from chasing so many trophies.

The schedules are too crowded already without further revolutionizing the international soccer landscape.",[]

PARIS  Sing, muse, of crinolines piled in layers, of blunt-cut bobs and Cupids bow lips?

Inspirations come in many forms during the fashion collections. It has been a surprise, though not an unwelcome one, to find that this season, an unexpected one joins their ranks: the fabulously eccentric fashion writer Lynn Yaeger, who watched her own avatars on the march from her place in the stands.

Ms. Yaeger, a fashion mainstay who wrote for decades for The Village Voice during its alterna-bible glory days and now contributes to Vogue, has a signature, unvarying style: an anachronistic little bob dyed flaming red, pyramidal layers of skirt and underskirt, the exaggerated lips painted a la Betty Boop, two traffic-light dots of rouge high on her cheeks.

During New York Fashion Week, early in the monthlong marathon of shows, a new model, Katie Moore, appeared with a bob cut almost exactly like Ms. Yaegers, and dyed tomato-red. W Magazine reported that the look was brand new; Guido Palau, the runway hairstylist, had cut what had previously been nearly waist-length corn-silk blond hair just before the shows.

With her new look, Ms. Moore opened the Alexander Wang show, a coveted get for models.

Its the Mamie Eisenhower bangs, Ms. Yaeger said with admiration. Most people wont go there.

At the Marc Jacobs show later in New York, the designer showed the oversize skirts in the inverted-top style Ms. Yaeger flatters. The similarity was not lost on her or her colleagues. Marc Jacobs was astonishing, Ms. Yaeger said in Paris. Yeah, it was flattering.

And, astonishingly, as fashion month wore on, so it seemed did little outcroppings of homage. Perhaps it was merely the acquisition of Yaeger-colored glasses, but one could see a bit of her style in the ever-enlarging ball skirts of the Undercover finale and even, too, in some of the ballooning pieces at Chloe. And Ms. Moore, the Lynn-alike model, had a banner season, walking major shows in London, Milan and Paris, including Moschino, Margiela and Balenciaga.

Ms. Yaeger was humble about the phenomenon, saying that she had no plans to alter her trademark style because of it.

I dont know why anyone would put anything else on a runway, she said. Nor could she fathom other styles off the runway. Did you notice some girls actually wear pants? she said. Ive never even seen pants for sale!",[]

Homeland

This was a very strange episode, wasnt it? The pacing off-kilter, the dialogue contrived, the background music oddly plaintive, and the characters both muted and, oddly, overdrawn  as though the regular actors had taken the night off and been replaced by a group of far less talented understudies.

The Walking Dead

Toward the end of this weeks The Walking Dead, Maggie, dejected and wandering through a sewer of waterlogged walkers and broken dreams, collapsed into an emotional heap of Glenn-grief, self-recrimination and anguished uncertainty. Read more...

The Affair

A full-floor aerie on the 30th floor of the Heritage at Trump Place on the Upper West Side, with ample outdoor space and far-reaching river, park and cityscape vistas, sold for $15,500,000 and was the most expensive closed sale of the week, according to city records.

The 4,673-square-foot apartment, PH-Suite 1, at 240 Riverside Boulevard, is one of two penthouse suites in the 31-story condominium, which is part of the 75-acre Trump Place-Riverside South development that extends from 72nd Street to 59th Street and borders the Hudson River.

The unit had been on the market since October 2014, when it was initially listed for $17.5 million, according to StreetEasy.com; the most recent asking price was $16.5 million. Monthly carrying charges total $16,179.

The sprawling home has four bedrooms and four and a half baths, as well as dining and living rooms, a library and a newly renovated chefs kitchen. There are two 31-by-7-foot terraces  one off the living room and another reached through a large reception hall  that provide stunning panoramic views of Riverside Park, the Hudson and city landscape.

The large master suite, which has views stretching from Riverside Park to the George Washington Bridge to Central Park, has a dressing room and an en-suite double bathroom with a whirlpool tub. The three other bedrooms have en-suite baths as well.

Two separate storage units were also included in the sale.

The buyer was identified in city records as Azimuth International Holdings. Michelle King of the Corcoran Group represented the seller, identified as Joel Vaturi.

The weeks runner-up, at $13,000,000, according to city records, was a four-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath apartment in a J. E. R. Carpenter-designed co-op building on the Upper East Side.

The unit, No. 6A, at 625 Park Avenue near 65th Street, also listed with Corcoran, carries $13,154 in monthly maintenance. It sold for $500,000 below its most recent asking price, according to StreetEasy.

The apartment offers many prewar flourishes: soaring ceilings, decorative moldings and an ornate coffered ceiling in the formal dining room.

There is an elevator landing that opens to a central gallery flanked by the living room, library and dining room, each with a fireplace. The corner master bedroom suite also has a fireplace, as well as a sitting room, dressing room and en-suite bath.

The buyer was Kurt Simon, the global chairman of mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase, and his wife, Katherine Simon; they were represented by Jaclyn Boulan of Stribling & Associates. The seller, a trust linked to Sy Syms, a pioneer discount retailer who died in 2009, was represented by Sharon Baum and David Enloe of Corcoran.

Around 11:30 p.m. on Oct. 10, 2012, a police officer in Nogales, Ariz., named John Zuniga received a call reporting suspicious activity on International Street, which runs directly alongside the Mexican border. Most of Zunigas calls involved shoplifters at the local Walmart or domestic-violence complaints, but he also worked as a liaison with United States Customs and Border Protection (C.B.P.). Though border security is the responsibility of the Border Patrol, the Nogales police can assist when illegal activity is happening stateside  if, for instance, drug smugglers have slipped over the fence and are making their way into Arizona.

For the past several decades, the population of Nogales has hovered around 20,000. The population of its Mexican sister city, also called Nogales, has grown in recent years to around 250,000. Depending on where youre standing, the abutting cities can start to seem like a single, sprawling Nogales; modest homes cover the surrounding foothills in every direction, and for years, locals referred to the region as a singular entity, Ambos Nogales  Both Nogales. A lot of us have families in Mexico, Zuniga, who grew up on the Arizona side and is 38, told me. I still remember, as a kid, youd have family members from over there suddenly show up at the house. You didnt ask any questions. People would just go back and forth. Immigration wasnt that big of a deal back in the day.

Photo

Things began to change after Sept. 11, Zuniga said, when border security became a political issue. Facing an electorate fearful about terrorism and angry about illegal immigration, Congress allocated $90 billion to border security over the next 10 years, which went toward 650 miles of new fence and, for C.B.P. agents, military hardware like drones, assault rifles and Black Hawk helicopters. The number of Border Patrol agents doubled during the second term of the George W. Bush administration, to 20,000 from 11,000. In 1995, the number of agents in C.B.P.s Tucson sector, which includes Nogales, was roughly 400; today, it has grown to more than 4,000. There are cameras everywhere  on towers near town, on drones, on the backs of flatbed trucks driven into the desert  as well as thousands of motion-detecting sensors, many of them hidden in rocks or buried in the sand.

The fence that now bisects Ambos Nogales cost about $4.14 million per mile to build, its height varying between 18 and 30 feet. It was installed in 2011, replacing a fence made of solid steel panels. Some Border Patrol agents prefer the new slat design, because they can look through the fence and observe activity on the other side. Slick anticlimbing plates lining the top increase the difficulty of scaling the wall, but it is by no means impossible. Undocumented immigrants and drug smugglers still manage to climb it every day.

Thats why the call Zuniga received in October 2012 was not especially remarkable. A Nogales police officer named Quinardo Garcia had arrived on the scene first and witnessed two men in camouflage pants and sweatshirts, with large taped bundles strapped to their backs, climbing the fence into the United States. Based on my training and experience, Garcia later wrote in his incident report, I identified the bundles as marijuana and immediately called out the incident to assisting graveyard units.

Garcia chased the men on foot, but they disappeared into an overgrown residential yard. Fearing an ambush, Garcia decided to wait for backup. Within minutes, Zuniga arrived, as did several Border Patrol agents. As they began to scope the area, Zuniga spotted two men scaling the fence back into Mexico. By the time I show up, theyre empty-handed, with nothing on their backs, he told me.

Police officers and Border Patrol agents refrain from climbing onto the fence themselves, for reasons of both safety and jurisdiction. I gave them numerous commands to climb down, Zuniga wrote in his own report. One of the men was having difficulty maintaining his grip and seemed on the verge of dropping back onto Arizona soil. I then heard several rocks start hitting the ground, Zuniga wrote, and I looked up, and I could see the rocks flying through the air.

So-called rockings are not uncommon occurrences at the border. The rocks are thrown from the Mexican side to distract agents and force them to take cover while smugglers pass contraband or make their escape. When its dark out and you dont know where theyre coming from, one agent told me, its a really tense situation.

What happened next remains contested. In their reports, Garcia and Zuniga claimed to hear gunfire but could not say where the shooting was coming from. I saw the rocks in the air and tried to take cover, Zuniga told me. I heard shots fired, but I wasnt sure who was shooting. The shots could have been from anywhere: behind me, from Mexico. I didnt witness the actual shooting myself.

In the days following the incident, C.B.P. issued only a terse statement. After verbal commands from agents to cease [assaulting the agents with rocks] were ignored, one agent then discharged his service firearm, it read. One of the subjects appeared to have been hit.

The subject who was hit was not one of the men who had been climbing the fence but a 16-year-old resident of Nogales, Mexico, named Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez, who was on the Mexican side of the border. He had been shot 10 times from behind; an autopsy later revealed that gunshot wounds to the head, lungs and arteries killed him. He was unarmed, carrying nothing but a cellphone. He collapsed on a sidewalk on Calle Internacional, in front of a doctors office, below a sign reading Emergencias Medicas. Six months later, you could still see the bullet holes in the wall. Someone had outlined them with a red marker.

The morning after the shooting, James F. Tomsheck arrived at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, the headquarters of United States Customs and Border Protection, and made his way to the briefing held each weekday for a dozen of the agencys top officials. Six years earlier, when Tomsheck was appointed head of the agencys Office of Internal Affairs, it felt like the capstone of a long and distinguished career. A stolid Nebraskan with a precise, nearly affectless manner of speaking, Tomsheck had spent his entire adult life in law enforcement, first as a police officer in Omaha, his hometown, and later as a Secret Service agent. He busted counterfeiters in Detroit, worked the presidential detail under George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton and eventually became a deputy assistant director of the entire Secret Service, where he oversaw half of its field offices. In 2006, he was recruited to C.B.P. by his former boss at the Secret Service, Ralph Basham, who had been appointed the C.B.P.s commissioner by George W. Bush.

In the early days of the Border Patrol, which was created in 1924, agents patrolled the border (primarily the northern border) on horseback. By 2012, the increasingly militarized agency held its morning briefings in a secure, windowless room in Washington known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or S.C.I.F., where electronic items are left at the door and classified information can be openly discussed. On Oct. 11, Tomsheck and his colleagues were informed that a teenage rock thrower had been killed by a Border Patrol agent in Nogales and that the shots had been fired in self-defense. Tomsheck told me that he was immediately suspicious of this official version of events. Border Patrol leadership, he said, had a well-established history of intentional misinformation. Having sat through these meetings for years, after every one of these shootings, theres an effort to spin and distort facts and obscure a clear understanding of what actually occurred.

Part of the problem was the many overlapping authorities. Tomsheck frequently found himself in an almost parodic bureaucratic scrum of competing government agencies. Within the Department of Homeland Security (D.H.S.), which absorbed various agencies into the newly created Customs and Border Protection agency after Sept. 11, the Office of Inspector General, known as D.H.S.-O.I.G., had right of first refusal when it came to taking the lead on investigations of officer misconduct. If D.H.S.-O.I.G. stepped away, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was second in line to investigate. Only if ICE passed would Tomshecks Office of Internal Affairs be able to take the lead on an investigation. Information sharing among the offices, according to Tomsheck, was minimal.

Outside D.H.S., the F.B.I. could run its own parallel investigations of Border Patrol misconduct. According to Tomsheck, however, the bureau was regularly being walled off by D.H.S.-O.I.G., which in many instances refused to share information and cooperate. Ronald Hosko, who served as assistant director of the F.B.I.s criminal investigative division from 2012 to 2014, described D.H.S.-O.I.G. as a troubled place that regarded sharing information as misconduct, adding that from his perspective, they fought us at every turn. I believe it was a deliberate attempt by senior people in D.H.S. and in the inspector generals shop to avoid cooperating with the F.B.I.

But Tomsheck was happy to work with the F.B.I., and his office had a dedicated liaison agent who reported to the bureaus headquarters daily. In the wake of the Nogales shooting, Tomshecks agents in the Tucson field office found that the official Border Patrol report was not consistent with the information they uncovered on the ground. That prompted discussion with the F.B.I. about how it seemed to be a problematic shooting, Tomsheck says.

Within a week of the incident, Tomsheck was at F.B.I. headquarters watching footage captured by the security cameras lining the border fence. According to him, the video very clearly shows the marijuana smugglers struggling to scale the fence, while the two Nogales police officers and a Border Patrol agent look on. (The footage has never been publicly released.) They do not appear to be displaying any concern for their safety whatsoever, Tomsheck says of the officers. There are no weapons drawn. People have their hands on their hips, standing there watching. If you were to give a title to the video up to that point, it would be: Its Another Day at the Border. 

Then a second Border Patrol agent arrives on the scene. Immediately after emerging from his vehicle, according to Tomshecks description of the video, the agent walks to the fence, pulls out his gun and begins firing. The agent did not interact with the other law-enforcement officers on the scene. He fired the round in chamber, all 12 rounds in the magazine, reloaded and fired at least one additional round, Tomsheck says. They seem absolutely shocked at first. Theres no audio, but theyre clearly thinking, What does he know that we dont?

Tomsheck says the footage he viewed demonstrated that Jose Antonio was certainly not throwing rocks at the time he was shot. He describes the shooting as the most egregious of any excessive-force cases hed seen at C.B.P. and says he felt angry and sickened. Even if he had been throwing rocks previously  its conceivable, but theres no evidence. But this was evidence of a Border Patrol agent shooting an unarmed boy. If charges werent brought against this agent, he thought, the message being sent would be, Its open season at the border.

On the morning of Oct. 11, 2012, just a few hours after Tomsheck learned of the shooting, Roberto Montiel was driving to court when he got a call from an old friend, Taide Elena. A native of Nogales, Ariz., Montiel served for 20 years as a Superior Court judge before opening a private criminal and family law practice. Elena, a Mexican immigrant like Montiels own parents, had worked for Montiels family for years as a housekeeper. My mother basically died in her arms, Montiel told me.

That morning, Elena was distraught. I need your help, she cried in Spanish. They killed Jose Antonio!

Elena was Jose Antonios grandmother. Though she and her husband had legally immigrated to the United States over 20 years ago, her sons family remained in Nogales, Mexico, in a barrio called La Capilla, the Chapel, about four blocks from the border. The neighborhood took its name from the white Spanish colonial church where Jose Antonio and his friends would play basketball. According to the boys family, thats what he was doing on the night of Oct. 10. When he turned onto Calle Internacional, he was walking to meet his older brother, Diego, who worked at a nearby Oxxo convenience store.

Beyond that, Elena later told Montiel, the family had very little information. They had been informed of the death by Mexican authorities, but no one from the United States had contacted them. The incident reports released by the Nogales Police Department listed a sole injured party by name: Tesko, the police dog who arrived at the scene with Zuniga. In his report, Zuniga claimed Tesko was hit by a rock.

It made no sense, Elena said. Her grandson had always been a good kid. Why would he be shot by la migra? When are they going to do something about this killing? she asked.

I explained to her how complex this was, because it involved two countries, Montiel recalls. He didnt know much about the history of cross-border shootings at the time, but he promised to find out if any criminal charges were being considered. Then he asked Luis Fernando Parra, a lawyer with whom he shares office space, to help with the case. Parra specializes in immigration law, and the two occasionally collaborate on international cases involving cross-border money laundering or domestic disputes.

Parra used his connections at the Mexican Consulate to obtain autopsy and ballistics reports from investigators. The findings were startling: Even if, as C.B.P. claimed, Jose Antonio had been throwing rocks at the agents  not an outrageous contention on its face, considering how much control the cartels hold over barrios like La Capilla, where scouts with walkie-talkies and binoculars monitor Border Patrol activity  the autopsy showed the bullet holes were angled from the back to the front, with entry points behind the auricle of the ear and in the posterior region of the neck, torso and deltoid. In other words, the shots had struck him from behind.

Before the autopsy report was publicly released, official accounts of Jose Antonios death had already begun to unravel. A person merely had to stand at the stretch of border fence where the shooting occurred and take in the view. That particular section of fence is 20 feet tall, but it sits on a rocky cliff, and the drop into Mexico from the base of the fence is another 25 feet. From Calle Internacional, hurling rocks over the top of the fence  or through the narrow gaps between the slats, which are only three and a half inches wide  would seem to be all but impossible. Its abundantly clear, Tomsheck, who eventually visited the site with the F.B.I., says, that there was no potential for Jose Antonio to have thrown any projectile from where he stood when he was shot that could cause injury on the U.S. side of the border, not even if he were a major-league baseball pitcher.

In the first months after Jose Antonios death, Parra and Montiel acted primarily in an advocacy role for his family, collecting information from authorities in Mexico, where a criminal investigation remains open, and passing it along to the United States Department of Justice. No lawsuit of any kind had been filed, but Parra told me he and Montiel absolutely had hope that there would be a criminal prosecution of the Border Patrol agent in Arizona.

Border Patrol agents are generally immune from the kind of transparency required of most state and local law-enforcement departments. A 2013 investigation by The Arizona Republic found that since 2005, C.B.P. agents had killed at least 42 people, a majority of them in the United States, but most of the agents identities had been kept secret, and the officers faced few, if any, public repercussions, even in cases in which the justification for the shooting seems dubious. Thirteen of the cases involved American citizens; at least three involved unarmed teenagers who were shot in the back.

From a legal perspective, the complexity of cross-border shootings confounded Jose Antonios case even further. Had the Border Patrol agent been in Mexico when he shot the teenager, he could have been arrested and tried by Mexican authorities; likewise, had Jose Antonio been standing on American soil, most legal scholars agree, he would have had constitutional rights. But the presence of the border fence created a strange extralegal limbo. A similar cross-border shooting took place in Texas in 2010, in which a Border Patrol agent named Jesus Mesa Jr. shot and killed a 15-year-old boy, Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca, who was accused of throwing rocks across the Rio Grande from Ciudad Juarez. In that case, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Hernandezs family had no grounds for a lawsuit because he was a Mexican citizen standing on Mexican soil and therefore not protected by the United States Constitution.

Lee Gelernt, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union who would eventually work with Jose Antonios family, notes that the Nogales shooting raises very, very big questions about the Constitution that the courts will have to resolve. It also raises even broader questions about what, exactly, our borders signify. From the beginning, the story upended the typical mysteries that surround a killing. Jose Antonios death was not the sort of whodunit that involved a search for a murder weapon, or poring over C.S.I. reports, or a hunt for an unknown perpetrator. Most of the important facts, including the identity of the Border Patrol agent who shot Jose Antonio, were known in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, at least by the authorities. Rather, the mysteries inherent in the case were territorial, jurisdictional and, ultimately, philosophical.

At Internal Affairs, Tomshecks duties included determining security clearances and investigating administrative misconduct. But he soon discovered that when it came to more serious infractions, particularly involving excessive use of force, his office held little real power. We had a mandate to hold the Border Patrol accountable but were given very few to no authorities to do that job, he told me. From Day 1, they aggressively resisted every effort.

Increasingly, Tomsheck found himself making better headway working with the F.B.I., where his work primarily involved corruption cases, assisting the bureau with investigations that eventually could be passed on to the Department of Justice. In 2007, working with the bureau, Tomsheck helped make a case against a Border Patrol agent named Eric Macias, who, using his badge to bypass airport security, boarded a domestic flight with five kilos of cocaine in his carry-on luggage. He eventually pleaded guilty to accepting bribes from drug smugglers and received a six-year prison sentence.

Tomsheck told me that he gave David Aguilar, then chief of the Border Patrol, a courtesy call to let him know Macias was going to be arrested. He expected appreciation, but Aguilar was furious. He said, You dont get this! We dont do what youre doing! We manage these problems. He told me that making these kinds of arrests causes embarrassment for the families of agents whove died in the field. (Aguilar declined to comment through a spokesman.)

By 2011, the sheer number of C.B.P. misconduct cases had become so glaring  an average of one C.B.P. officer was arrested every day between 2005 and 2012, 144 of them for corruption-level offenses  that C.B.P. redefined the way in which misconduct was categorized, Tomsheck said. Certain misconduct cases would be deemed mission-compromising and others non-mission-compromising; only the former would have to be reported to Congress.

John Sandweg, who joined Homeland Security in 2009, serving as senior counselor and acting general counsel under Secretary Janet Napolitano and later as acting director of ICE, confirms Tomshecks accounts of intra-agency jostling. A big source of tension, Sandweg said, was D.H.S.-O.I.G.s strong belief that C.B.P. Internal Affairs was violating protocol by passing leads to the F.B.I. instead of to the inspector generals office, adding that a massive backlog of corruption cases at D.H.S.-O.I.G. was a major concern for Napolitano. The backlog was inevitable, Sandweg says, after Congress doubled the size of the Border Patrol but never properly resourced D.H.S.-O.I.G. with enough investigators or funding. But Sandweg pushes back strongly against Tomshecks contention that he was stymied for political reasons. Thats a ridiculous allegation, he says. We were focused on ferreting out corruption cases, period.

Tomsheck was also concerned about the pace of the Border Patrols expansion. He believes it became impossible to properly screen all the new hires. When you double the size of an agency so quickly, you will get people who are minimally qualified, he says. I spoke with a former C.B.P. Internal Affairs investigator, E., who spent nearly two decades as a Border Patrol field agent in Texas and now works in corporate security. (He requested anonymity because his current position sometimes requires the help of old contacts at C.B.P.) E. also linked the hiring surge to problems at C.B.P.: Id see these chiefs Id known all my career, and theyd say, Weve got to take what they send us.  He continued, A lot of stuff was bypassed during the hiring surge. They were mandated to fill those numbers. And Border Patrol, being Border Patrol, said, O.K., bring it on.  In 2010, testifying before a Senate Homeland Security subcommittee, Tomsheck reported a staggering internal study: 60 percent of a pool of Border Patrol agents and customs inspectors who had been administered polygraph tests were deemed unsuitable for service.

Tomsheck thought many of the problems at C.B.P. could be attributed to the hiring of agents who had no law-enforcement experience. The new agents, Tomsheck says, were assured they were not law enforcement but part of a military agency tasked with securing the border. I heard people internally use the word cop in a derogatory way, which I took offense to. By the time I came to C.B.P., I had over 30 years of law-enforcement experience. I was a cop. But thats not what C.B.P. leadership led these people to believe. They came to believe they were not subject to the same constraints as the rest of law enforcement in the United States.

In one case from 2011, a Border Patrol agent fatally shot a 19-year-old American marijuana smuggler named Carlos LaMadrid four times in the back and thigh as he tried to climb over the border fence into Mexico from Douglas, Ariz. The agent, Lucas Tidwell, was never charged. The following year, a 37-year-old bricklayer named Guillermo Arevalo Pedraza was having a picnic in a park on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande when a Border Patrol agent in an airboat opened fire. C.B.P. later released a statement claiming the agents had been subjected to rocks being thrown at them, making no mention of the fact that Arevalo was shot and killed. No agents have been publicly disciplined. (C.B.P. would only confirm facts about its operations and would not comment on specific cases.)

E. has deep familiarity with the Arevalo case, including professional ties to members of the boat patrol, and he told me, Knowing the details  seven rounds, that distance, with no justifiable cause  its intent. He continued: Even if he couldve hurled that rock at that distance, for the agent to say he feared imminent bodily injury? If he did, he could have done something very simple: sat down. In E.s estimation, He was executed.

James Wong, who served under Tomsheck as deputy assistant commissioner of Internal Affairs from 2008 to 2011, previously worked as a state police officer in Louisiana. He not only confirmed Tomshecks recollections of the pushback against Internal Affairs investigations but also shares Tomshecks view that the militarization of the Border Patrol has taken officers into dangerous territory. When I started in law enforcement back in the early 70s, Wong told me, we learned very early on that you dont shoot a fleeing felon in the back, unless theyre shooting back over their shoulder or firing indiscriminately in front of them. To use deadly force just to prevent escape is illegal. The Border Patrol, on the other hand, has a viewpoint where they are on the front line defending the U.S. I have heard several Border Patrol agents say, We will never surrender a foot of U.S. soil  essentially, Ill never retreat. If you have that mind-set, that sets up potentially deadly confrontations. When he questioned agents about the use of deadly force in response to rockings, he said, the typical response was,  Youve never worn green, so you dont understand. The Border Patrol likened themselves to the Marine Corps. No offense  my son-in-law is a Marine. But if youre a law-enforcement agency, thats not what you should be modeling yourself after.

One afternoon last September, I visited the block of International Street where the shooting took place. A dog in front of a run-down house furiously tested its chain. Several of the fences bars had been tagged with stickers, each one about twice the size of a baseball card and illustrated, Shepard Fairey-style, with a portrait of Jose Antonio. The artist had painted the boys skin yellow, the shade of a butterscotch candy.

Id been standing at the fence for approximately 20 seconds when the first Border Patrol car drove slowly past me. About a minute later, a second Border Patrol vehicle pulled up nearby. An agent emerged, wearing a stiff green uniform, a flak jacket and a sidearm. Youre not allowed to pass anything through the fence, he told me. I held up my notebook and identified myself as a reporter. Looking dubious, he replied, If I see you doing anything, Im going to have to do something about it. I said O.K., and he returned to his truck, where he sat and watched me.

As I walked back to my rental car, the agent waved me over and asked what I was writing about. He was familiar with the case. Sad story, he said. Lowering his voice in a conspiratorial way, he added: Thing is? It was totally legit. He meant the shots. He wouldnt elaborate, only to say that hed had rocks thrown at him and that it was some scary [expletive]. Then he pointed out a section of fence down the street that he said was a popular climbing spot. Sure enough, when I went over to take a look, the rust color of the bars had been worn away by overuse, leaving vitiligous blotches of white.

Just beyond that section of fence, Jose Antonio lived in one of the older barrios of Nogales. When I visited the site of his death, at the corner of Calle Ingenieros (Engineers Street) and Calle Internacional, the bullet holes in the wall of the doctors office had been filled in, but posters featuring images of Jose Antonios face and the word JUSTICIA! were pasted to the wall. Though it was after 8 p.m., a group of kids wearing uniforms came walking past on their way home from school. (Because of overcrowding, students attend school in Nogales and other parts of Mexico in shifts.) One boy was holding a basketball; a girl strummed a ukulele.

Jose Antonio lived a short walk from the corner, at the top of a hill and across the street from a primary school. His familys home, surrounded by a variety of ramshackle dwellings, sits on a rocky outcropping, a couple of feet of which must be scaled to reach the yard, which is partly surrounded by a half-built cinder-block wall. Inside, in a modestly decorated living room with cracked plaster walls, a shrine had been erected atop an end table: a framed photograph of Jose Antonio at 15 surrounded by ceramic angels, flowers and religious candles. The photograph was the original image used by the poster artists. Jose Antonio seemed impossibly young, a crew-neck T-shirt visible beneath his striped polo shirt and a placid, searching expression on his face.

Araceli Rodriguez, Jose Antonios mother, was wearing a red blouse and jeans when I visited. (Jose Antonios family members all spoke in Spanish.) Her hair was pulled back, and her mouth remained fixed in a melancholy, anxious smile. She grew up in Navojoa, a small city not far from the Gulf of California coast. At 18, she moved to Nogales to join her brothers family and soon met her future husband, Roman Elena Zojo. She didnt want to talk much about him: They had four children together, but he was convicted in 1999 for his part in a kidnapping incident in which the victim died, and he spent 10 years in prison. The couple separated during this period. Not long after his release, he was found dead in Nogales, Mexico, a plastic bag over his head and a cardboard sign attached to his body referring to los bajadores of the area, the workers. News articles at the time of his death said he had been smuggling drugs and undocumented immigrants into the United States.

Jose Antonio was 13 when his father was murdered. He had visited him in prison on occasion but never got to know him very well. Supporting her four children as a single mother, Araceli had taken a job cleaning a bank in Navojoa, a nine-hour bus ride from Nogales. The two youngest children, both girls, lived with their mother, while the boys remained at the house in Nogales, looked after by Taide Elena and an aunt. Araceli said she spoke with her sons constantly and visited as often as she could.

Jose Antonios brother, Diego, 22, is tall and slender, with a wispy goatee. He sat on a kitchen chair, beneath a crooked door frame. Norteno music drifted up from the street below, through the tight mesh of a metal screen door pocked with larger holes. When I asked Diego what sorts of things he and his brother did for fun, his face reddened, and he began to weep.

It was six months after Jose Antonios death before a pair of assistant United States attorneys from the Department of Justice finally arranged to speak with Araceli and Diego. Parra said the interviews took place in a room at the main border-crossing station in Nogales. (Despite living so close to the fence and having family on the other side, none of the family members had ever been granted a visa or visited the United States.) It was pretty hard-nosed questioning, Parra, who was at the interview, said, but the family is absolutely sure Jose Antonio wasnt involved in anything.

The D.O.J. also interviewed witnesses in Mexico. A 34-year-old security guard named Isidro Alvarado told investigators he was walking along Calle Internacional about 20 feet behind Jose Antonio when two young people came racing past them and turned onto a side street. Seconds later, multiple shots rang out, and Jose Antonio fell to the ground.

Another witness, a local restaurant owner who lived across the street from the doctors office where Jose Antonio collapsed, was pulling into his driveway when he heard a commotion near the fence. He told investigators that he saw the smugglers trying to climb back into Mexico. Then, he said, four men on the Mexican side of the border threw rocks toward the fence and ran past his house. After that, he heard multiple shots. When the gunfire stopped, he went outside and saw Jose Antonios body.

After their interview, the Rodriguez family received no further word from the Justice Department. Parra and Montiel couldnt get any information, either  not about the status of the D.O.J.s investigation or even if a criminal case would ever be brought against the agent.

Unknown to Jose Antonios family, whose grief had been magnified by the silence of the United States government, the incident had roiled the Border Patrol. By late 2012, news reports about the shooting of Jose Antonio had increased scrutiny of the agency. Tomsheck had also been telling the acting deputy C.B.P. commissioner, Thomas Winkowski, that there was a use-of-force problem within the agency. In response to these external pressures, C.B.P. commissioned a study by the independent, nonprofit Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), which reviewed every incident between January 2010 and October 2012 in which a Border Patrol agent had used deadly force: 67 cases in all, 19 resulting in deaths.

The damning report, which was leaked in February 2014, described agents who intentionally put themselves into the exit path of suspects fleeing in vehicles, thereby . . . creating justification for the use of deadly force; in the case of rockings, the authors noted that too many cases do not appear to meet the test of objective reasonableness with regard to the use of deadly force. They recommended that C.B.P. train agents to de-escalate these encounters by taking cover, moving out of range and/or using less lethal weapons. The report also recommended that officers/agents should be prohibited from using deadly force against subjects throwing objects not capable of causing serious physical injury or death.

The report did not cite specific details, but certain of the fatal Border Patrol shootings covered by the investigators had long been public  and troubling. In 2010, Miguel Torres Vasquez, a Border Patrol agent in Douglas, Ariz., shot and killed a fleeing undocumented migrant named Jorge Alfredo Solis Palma; Vasquez claimed Palma had been throwing rocks. That same year, in Eagle Pass, Tex., a Border Patrol agent named Taylor Poitevent chased down a pickup truck being driven by Juan Mendez Jr., an 18-year-old American citizen. Mendez had been trying to drive away with 320 pounds of marijuana that had been smuggled across the Rio Grande; Poitevent fatally shot Mendez in the back after the pair came to blows on a residential lawn. The following summer, a Border Patrol agent, Dorian Diaz, shot and killed Jesus Yanez Reyes, an undocumented migrant; Diaz claimed Reyes was throwing rocks from a tree on the Mexican side of the fence, near the Tijuana-San Diego border. No criminal charges were ever brought against any of the agents.

By the time the report was leaked, Tomsheck had had a copy for a year. Many within the agency had dismissed it. The Border Patrol perspective was that many of the recommendations were not appropriate or valid, Tomsheck told me. I saw this as another example of the Border Patrol attempting to advance a pattern and practice that departed significantly from use-of-force policies common throughout U.S. law enforcement. But in May 2014, three months after the report leaked, a new C.B.P. commissioner, Gil Kerlikowske, released a revised use-of-force policy that incorporated a number of the reports recommendations.

The following month, Tomsheck received a letter from Kerlikowske that he says is known, colloquially, as a 3R. It forced him to resign, retire or accept a reassignment. He had had an inkling that he was going to be removed from his post at Internal Affairs. His constant clashes with C.B.P. leadership had made him deeply unpopular, and the PERF report had leaked after he had provided a copy, against the wishes of C.B.P. leadership, to D.H.S.-O.I.G. (Congress had been requesting copies from C.B.P. since the previous fall but had been given only summaries.)

Within an hour of receiving his reassignment letter from the new C.B.P. commissioner, Tomsheck saw that a story about his removal had appeared on the website of The Los Angeles Times. In it, a single unnamed senior official at Homeland Security was quoted as saying Tomsheck had failed to aggressively pursue abuse and excessive-force complaints.

I didnt see that coming, Tomsheck told me. Over a year later, he said that the accusation continues to haunt me. He vigorously denied the claims, which were subsequently picked up by news outlets across the country, including The New York Times. I think a very strong case could be made that no one was more aggressive than I was when it came to use-of-force issues, Tomsheck said. They were looking for a scapegoat to address the fact that they were responsible for egregious misconduct. Tomshecks contention has been publicly supported by former colleagues: his assistant James Wong; Ronald Hosko, the former assistant director of the F.B.I.s criminal-investigation unit, with whom he worked closely; and the former C.B.P. commissioner Ralph Basham.

Tomsheck also found his reassignment suspicious. His new position, executive director of national programs for C.B.P., had not existed until days before his reassignment was announced, and he found it unusual that he was placed within C.B.P., the agency with which he had been in a state of constant conflict while running Internal Affairs. I came to believe the position was created to warehouse and silence me, Tomsheck says.

After learning of his reassignment, Tomsheck filed a federal whistle-blower complaint, claiming that it was retaliation for his outspokenness about C.B.P.s problems with excessive use of force and corruption. The complaint became part of mediated settlement negotiations between Tomsheck and C.B.P. (which remain confidential).

In September 2014, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson gave C.B.P. Internal Affairs new authority to investigate criminal misconduct by agents and tasked Tomshecks interim replacement, a former F.B.I. agent named Mark Morgan, with reviewing all 67 shootings that appeared in the PERF report. Last June, an independent report commissioned by Johnson described Internal Affairs as woefully understaffed and recommended the agency be given the lead on investigations rather than D.H.S.-O.I.G. That same month, Morgans findings were released: According to the internal review, only four of the 67 use-of-force incidents merited further investigation.

As the two-year anniversary of Jose Antonios death approached, the lawyers advised his family to move ahead with their only other recourse for justice: filing a lawsuit against the Border Patrol agent who shot him. The case had to be filed as a John Doe suit, because the agent was still anonymous; C.B.P. had not even indicated if the agent had been removed from his post or disciplined at all.

Parra and Montiel asked the A.C.L.U. for help with the lawsuit, eventually partnering with Gelernt, who has been a human-rights observer at Guantanamo Bay and has argued before the Supreme Court. The constitutional question Jose Antonios case is raising  about the extent to which the Constitution applies extraterritorially  is one that the A.C.L.U. institutionally has been working on in various contexts, Gelernt told me. At some level, its just common sense and basic fairness that the law has to allow his family to bring this lawsuit. It cant be that a U.S. agent is going to put his gun through the hole in the fence and shoot at Mexican kids, 20 feet away, and therell be no ramifications. In a town where people are just necessarily walking along the border, there has to be some reciprocity of the rule of law. There cant be just a situation where everybody who lives in a border town, in Canada or Mexico, runs the risk of being shot, without any ability to vindicate their rights.

Because of the failure of the previous lawsuit filed in Texas by the family of Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca (which is being appealed), Gelernt understood that the case would be difficult  but also that, if a judge in the federal Court of Appeals allowed the lawsuit to move forward, it could set up a Supreme Court case, because two circuit courts of equal stature would have ruled in opposition on the same constitutional question. Rodriguez v. John Does was filed on July 29, 2014. At the time of the shooting, the agents and/or officers were not under threat by [Jose Antonio] or anyone else standing near him, the complaint read. J.A.s death was senseless and unjustified.

That November, Jose Antonios family members scored their first legal victory in the lawsuit when Raner Collins, a federal district judge in Arizona, ordered that the name of the Border Patrol agent be unsealed and released to the public. The agents name was Lonnie Ray Swartz. No other information, not even a photograph, was released, and Swartz did not appear in court. Nor did Araceli or Diego Rodriguez, who were still not allowed to enter the United States.

Judge Collins rejected Swartzs immunity claim seven months later, a ruling that directly contradicted the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which had found, in the Hernandez case, that the boys family had no constitutional grounds for a lawsuit. Collins, in his decision, noted that Jose Antonio was not suspected of, charged with or convicted of violating any law; that he was visible and not hiding; that witnesses stated that he did not pose a threat, but was peacefully walking down the street; that he was not a citizen of a country with which the United States are at war; and that upon information and belief, Swartz did not issue any verbal warnings before opening fire. Swartz has appealed the ruling.

Just as the civil case appeared to be moving forward, there was another surprise, one that many of the interested parties had nearly stopped expecting: In September, it was announced that Swartz had been indicted by a federal grand jury in Tucson for second-degree murder. According to the indictment, Swartz did with malice aforethought, and while armed with a P2000 semiautomatic pistol, unlawfully kill Jose Antonio. On Oct. 9, 2015  the day before the third anniversary of the boys death  Swartz appeared in a Tucson courtroom for the first time, the first Border Patrol agent to be prosecuted by the Department of Justice for a cross-border shooting. The Arizona Republic described him as a tall man with crew-cut red hair and a light red mustache. A Border Patrol union representative revealed that Swartz had been transferred to Nevada and that, in the wake of the indictment, he had been put on administrative leave.

Why now? Tomsheck, for one, had seen the evidence gathered by the F.B.I.  the videos, the autopsy report, the interview transcripts  in the immediate months after the shooting, all of which had been handed over to the Department of Justice. I dont understand why it took three years to indict, Tomsheck says. Collinss ruling, its toughness, may have ultimately played a role. He made it very clear that the civil case needs to proceed, but he went beyond just saying that, using very strong language to indicate this is clearly excessive use of force, Tomsheck said. At the end of the day, it might have created a scenario where, if they didnt criminally charge Swartz, there would have been a lot of explaining to do on the part of the Department of Justice.

The Border Patrol union released a statement saying it supported Swartz 100 percent. Swartz has pleaded not guilty. Collins has placed a protective order on the trial evidence, meaning that for now, the thousands of pages of documents and videos of Jose Antonios shooting submitted by the United States attorneys office will not be made public.

Jose Antonios family was elated by the indictment. Diego called the claims of rock throwing a bunch of lies. Elena said, Thats always an excuse that they use. He wasnt a hoodlum.

Elena would cross into Mexico regularly to visit her grandsons. The night before Jose Antonio died, he walked her back to the border checkpoint. He was a good kid, she said. He was focused. He had goals. She had already bought him the oversize watch he wanted for Christmas, even though it was only October. She ended up placing it inside his coffin.

Araceli and her children were given permission to attend the indictment, and they entered the United States for the first time. In court, seeing Swartz, Araceli said she was struck by his size. He was a massive, large man, she said. She couldnt understand how a man that size could have felt endangered by her son. She didnt look him directly in the face, and he never looked in the familys direction. She doesnt want to see any of the video or photographic evidence of her sons death. I want to remember my son as he was when he was alive, she said. She plans to attend all the future hearings, anything that requires the presence of that man in court. The next hearing is scheduled for this month.

Wiping away tears, Araceli had told me when I visited her at her home: There are times when were bad and we start thinking about Jose Antonio, and we kind of make believe that hes still around. Because its unreal that hes not.

It must be difficult to be asked to conjure a portrait of a lost child, to fix in time a person on the verge of growing up; inevitably, such efforts will feel woefully incomplete. According to his family, Jose Antonio was reserved. He preferred cloudy days. Diego used to tease him for crying during The Lion King. Jose Antonio knew his brother could be squeamish and a bit of a hypochondriac, and once tricked him into climbing out of a swimming hole by saying, It looks like your eyes are about to pop out! How long have you been in there? He had a girlfriend. He chided his brother for having his arm tattooed and refused to get any ink himself, out of fear it might hurt his chances to join the military when he turned 18, a plan he had made with a group of friends. For the same reason, he was determined to finish high school. He had been forced to temporarily drop out because his family couldnt afford to pay tuition. The Monday after his death, he was scheduled to return to class.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,2 Baltimore School Officers Arrested in Assault on Teenager,['The Associated Press'],"Two police officers for the Baltimore schools have been arrested after the release of a cellphone video showing one of them slapping and kicking a teenager while the second officer stood by.

One officer, Anthony Spence, 44, was charged with second-degree assault, second-degree child abuse by a custodian and misconduct in office in the episode, which occurred March 1, according to a statement by the Baltimore police. Officer Spence posted bond and was released Wednesday.

The second officer, Saverna Bias, was charged with second-degree assault and misconduct in office. She also posted bond and was released, according to court records.

In the video, an officer, who was later identified as Officer Spence, can be seen slapping and kicking the teenager.

Officer Spence acknowledged in a conversation with The Associated Press on Friday that he was the subject of a criminal investigation into the actions captured on cellphone video last week at the Reach! Partnership School.

Right now Im the bad guy, he said. He referred questions to his lawyer, Michael Davey, who did not immediately respond to a phone call Wednesday morning.

The school district has its own police force separate from city police. The Baltimore City Police began a criminal investigation into the incident at the school after the eight-second clip surfaced.

School officials initially said that the officers had responded to a reported intruder, and that the young man in the video was not a student. On Friday, the school system said in a statement that he was believed to be a student on the schools roster. The young mans lawyer, Lauren Geisser, says he is a 10th-grader.

On Monday, the chief executive of Baltimore City Schools, Gregory Thornton, met with parents to discuss the video and said he would review training and selection of school police officers.",[]

PALATINE, Ill.  Gov. John Kasich of Ohio suggested on Wednesday that the Republican contest was now a three-man race among Donald J. Trump, Ted Cruz and himself, casting aside Marco Rubio as he talked about his competition.

Mr. Kasich, at a town-hall-style meeting in Lisle, Ill., told the crowd that about half the delegates were still up for grabs, and that he, Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz were dead even going into the last half of this whole match.

So dont be thinking its over yet, Mr. Kasich said.

Mr. Kasich, unlike Mr. Rubio, has yet to win a nominating contest. Later, speaking to reporters after a town-hall-style meeting here in Palatine, Mr. Kasich insisted he would win his home state on Tuesday. Illinois also votes that day, and Mr. Kasich spent Wednesday campaigning in the Chicago area.

Everybody is saying now, except for a handful of people, that John Kasich is surging, Mr. Kasich said, without specifying who holds that view. And Im beginning to surge because for the first time in this campaign, people are finally beginning to hear my message.

The Kasich campaign has embraced an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday that found Mr. Trump, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Kasich and Mr. Rubio bunched up among likely voters in states that have not yet held their nominating contests.

I dont mean to say anything to disparage Marco, Mr. Kasich told reporters. But what I will say is, its starting to turn our way.

He also made clear that he was not suggesting that Mr. Rubio leave the race.

I would never do what other people say  somebody ought to drop out or not drop out, he said. Im just talking to you about what the numbers look like today, because anybody whos in this race should decide on their own what they want to do.

As for Mr. Kasichs path forward, his analysis was strikingly rosy, given his performances to date.

His best showing on Tuesday was in Michigan, where he had spent considerable time. But he still failed to win second place, finishing slightly behind Mr. Cruz and well behind the states winner, Mr. Trump. Mr. Kasich ended up claiming about 24 percent of the vote, and he won 43 percent of those who decided which candidate to vote for in the last week, according to exit polls.

Mr. Kasich portrayed his finish in Michigan as an impressive achievement, citing earlier poll numbers that had put his support in the single digits. He said he went from obliterated, where everybody counted me out, to effectively tying Mr. Cruz.

They call it the Kasich surge, and I would agree with that, he said. If the primary had been a day later, he said, God knows what would have happened.",[]

Gallery,['Su Wu'],"When Hauser Wirth & Schimmel acquired its new space, a former flour mill in L.A.s Arts District, it was already remarkably painted  with graffiti. There are a lot of places that people would consider dodgy, but where people have created work that requires craft and commitment, even though they know theyre going to put it up and itll be gone, says Steve Grody, the street art historian who worked with Hauser Wirth & Schimmel to identify the works. But the murals painted on the buildings walls arent going anywhere  in fact, the gallery commissioned the artist Kim West to expand upon her dreamlike mural on the old warehouses exterior.

The factory complex on a two-and-a-half acre city block was once known to tagging crews as a place to piece in peace. Thanks to a relative lack of patrol, it has been covered with unsanctioned murals over the years  with layers upon layers of activity that sometimes spiraled into little battles in which they disrespected each others work, says the gallerys senior director Stacen Berg. One such wall will eventually overlook an edible garden that will supply an on-site restaurant opening in the summer. We want it to be recognizable as our building. But then it was also: What is a complete work, that is still intact enough that it seems worth hanging on to? Berg says, referencing also architectural details dating from the 1890s to the 1990s, when the abandoned factory was a hot spot for graffiti. Were trying to keep the history of the building alive, without being overly nostalgic.

Whitewashed walls may be a renovation trope, but just as the last Hauser & Wirth outpost in Somerset basked in the rolling farmland, the preserved tags here provide a visual trace of the always grittier past. Brass knuckles and marijuana frame the downtown skyline and classic gangland block lettering on a wall covered by the crew Out for Action, a.k.a. One Fallen Angel. (Not every piece could be saved: A code-violating fence tagged by the artist Mister Cartoon, whose smaller lines are tattooed on such hip-hop luminaries as Dr. Dre and Beyonce, was removed per the city.) A new piece in full-wall scale, across from the sculpture atrium, is the gallery artist Mary Heilmanns largest work ever executed, of an abstract crashing wave. You can walk in this neighborhood, which you cant in a lot of other parts of L.A., and we wanted to integrate that and open it up, so people can cut through, Berg says, standing in view of several murals, in a public walkway that traverses the length of the space. Maybe they never go into the galleries, but they still interact with something, even if theyre just on their way to get coffee.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,What It Takes for This Actor to Wear That Red Speedo,['Kate Taylor'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Alex Breaux faced a twofold challenge in portraying Ray, a champion swimmer in the dark and twisty Red Speedo at New York Theater Workshop. He had to look convincing as an aspiring Olympian who spends the whole show in the swimsuit of the title. And he needed to, well, play dumb  at least outside the water, where his character is caught up in a doping scandal that could derail a lucrative future.









He applied his background as an athlete to both.

Six-foot-three and slim, Mr. Breaux, a 30-year-old former Harvard University wide receiver, was in good shape when he was cast in Lucas Hnaths play last fall  he has taught spinning seven mornings a week since he was in graduate school at Juilliard  but he said he didnt want audience members to have to suspend any disbelief.

So he undertook a grueling exercise and diet regimen that has dramatically reduced his body fat while giving him an extremely defined chest, back and washboard abs. He acknowledged losing more weight than he intended  he wouldnt say what he weighs now  but said he feels satisfied with the look he has achieved for the role.

Photo

As for why Ray seems dense, Mr. Breaux noted that athletes who have to do a very repetitive movement over long periods  running or rowing or swimming  need to be able to get into a Zen-like state.

To rip Ray out of the flow zone, out of that spaciness, and then start peppering him with questions, as his brother does, youve just changed the rules of engagement for him, and of course hes going to come across as inarticulate, Mr. Breaux said.

Critics have praised the play and his performance, with Charles Isherwood of The New York Times writing: It takes a very smart actor to play dumb as well as he does.

Indeed Mr. Breaux  yes, its pronounced BRO  doesnt agree that Ray, who spends large chunks of the play staring at the middle distance, absent-mindedly munching carrots, is unintelligent. Hes very articulate under water, physically  hes a genius, he said.

Mr. Breaux himself was animated and energetic during an interview last week, which seemed incredible after he admitted that during previews he was getting only three to five hours of sleep a night.

He is remarkably earnest. To not succumb to the constant rejection an actor experiences, he posts motivational quotes around his room, like Love your guts and Want is more popular than work.

He was born in Richmond, Va., but grew up mostly in Oakland, Calif. He described his family as sports-oriented and not artistic at all. He played football in high school and was the homecoming king. His coach and English teacher, Jamie Donohoe, with whom he is still close, said he had imagined that Mr. Breaux might ultimately have some kind of job on the business side of sports, doing that hustle, where he could use that creative mind of his, but also that charm and that work ethic.

His freshman year at Harvard, he got a lot of playing time at wide receiver. In a dazzling moment, he scored a touchdown that tied The Game with Yale late in the fourth quarter. Harvard won in three overtimes, and his picture appeared in Sports Illustrated.

As a sophomore, Mr. Breaux was majoring in economics, with plans to work after graduation at an investment bank when, on a whim, he went to see a play at the American Repertory Theater. He had never really been interested in theater, he said, which at the time he associated mostly with big Disney musicals.

But this sounded different. It was bobrauschenbergamerica, by Charles Mee and the SITI Company, an absurdist collage of vignettes. A marching band came onstage at one point, he recalled. A pizza delivery man confessed to a triple homicide.

In a talk after the performance, he asked an actress who had recited a monologue while consuming an entire birthday cake if she ever worried she would choke.

Photo

She was like, I pretty much choke on the cake every night, he recalled. And I loved that.

Mr. Breaux cherished football, he said, in part because the experience of catching a pass was like knowing youre about to get in a car crash, but you dont know from which direction or how heavy the impact. It felt to him like the cast of bobrauschenbergamerica was doing something similarly dangerous and daring.

He began auditioning for student productions, but didnt get any roles until his junior year, when he was cast as Father Flynn, the priest who may or may not have molested a boy in Doubt. His senior year he played Joe Pitt, the closeted Mormon lawyer, in both parts of Angels in America.

He still played football, so he would go to practice, then run  without showering  to rehearsal. Halfway through the year, he decided he would be unfulfilled working in finance and turned down a job he had accepted at Barclays. He auditioned for Juilliard and was accepted.

Ellen Lauren, the actress who had talked about choking on the cake, became one of his teachers.

Shortly before he graduated, he was cast in the Broadway revival of Tom Stoppards The Real Thing, directed by Sam Gold, in which he played the boorish young Scottish soldier, Brodie.

I made sure I was incredibly rude, cocky and generally misbehaved while in the room, Mr. Breaux said of his auditions for the role.

Mr. Hnath and Lileana Blain-Cruz, the director of Red Speedo, both said they were impressed by how much work Mr. Breaux had done before his audition, especially concerning the playwrights language and punctuation, which is very specific. (The scripts opening pages define the differences among ellipses, a line break and a dash in terms of how they should affect an actors delivery.)

Then there was his experience on the field.

At one of the callbacks, I just remember he spoke really eloquently about being an athlete, Ms. Blain-Cruz explained. He just spoke about the kind of high that you get when youre constantly working your body and it puts you in a certain state, and I thought that was really helpful in thinking about Ray.

In the last year, Mr. Breaux has shot two independent films that have not yet been released: Bushwick, an action movie set in the near future, about a second American civil war, in which he gets beaten up by Dave Bautista, the professional wrestler turned actor; and Katie Says Goodbye, in which he plays a long-distance trucker with a debilitating stutter, who asks out the title character. Its a rare, sympathetic, nonbloody role for Alex Breaux, Mr. Breaux said.

He is auditioning for other film and TV jobs and also revising a pilot about college football. He wrote, directed and acted in a short film, Hotline, about a combat medic home from Afghanistan who is contemplating suicide. He has also written a screenplay based on Pat Conroys memoir, My Losing Season, about his senior basketball season at the Citadel during the Vietnam War.

Mr. Breaux doesnt know what his next job will be after Red Speedo, which is scheduled to run through April 3. But he has envisioned the blowout meal hell eat, at his favorite restaurant, the Cheesecake Factory, when hes done. There his favorite dessert, the 1,400-calorie Lindas Fudge Cake, awaits.",[]

Well Family Welcome to Well Family, Wells new home for news about parenting, child health and relationships plus advice from our experts to help every family live well. Sign up for our Well Family newsletter.

When I look out into my classroom, and take the emotional temperature of my students, Im usually checking for engagement. I want to make sure they feel supported, are interested in the lesson at hand, and that the lesson is relevant to each student.

But happiness? I stopped looking for happiness long ago. I see it periodically, when the conditions are perfect, and the stars align just so. When happiness strikes in my classroom, I relish it as I would any other rare anomaly, like thundersnow or a two-faced calf. Regular sightings, however, seem too much to hope for given the inhospitable climate in many American classrooms.

Emma Seppala, however, the author of The Happiness Track, and science director of Stanford Universitys Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education, has not lost hope. Dr. Seppala admits that yes, happiness can be a rare beast in our classrooms, but we can create and protect learning conditions in which happiness can flourish.

Happiness, Dr. Seppala explained in an email, is not something we can afford to lose at home or in our classrooms, as it forms the very foundation of deep, meaningful learning. Happy kids show up at school more able to learn because they tend to sleep better and may have healthier immune systems. Happy kids learn faster and think more creatively. Happy kids tend to be more resilient in the face of failures. Happy kids have stronger relationships and make new friends more easily.

Unfortunately, we put our childrens happiness at risk when we model what Dr. Seppala calls the myths of success: the belief that success is inextricably tied to stress and anxiety, perseverance at all costs, avoidance of personal weakness, and a myopic focus on cultivating expertise in a specialized niche.

We may tell kids that we want them to be happy, and that we care about their learning more than we care about their grades, but when we model the myths of success in our own lives, they know the truth. Perpetuating these myths, whether through our words or actions, undermines the very happiness and learning we claim to value.

If we truly want to cultivate happiness in our homes and schools, we cant just pay it lip service. We must model behaviors that, according to Dr. Seppala, make us happier, healthier and more productive.

Live in the moment. Rather than encouraging children to live from one to-do item to the next, help them focus and enjoy whatever activity they are engaged in now. Research shows our minds wander off task 50 percent of the time. Yet when our mind wanders, we have more negative emotions. While a little bit of stress about the next to-do can serve as a motivator, long-term chronic stress impairs both physical health and intellectual faculties such as attention and memory, Dr. Seppala said in an email.

Model resilience. While we cant often change the work and life demands our children face in their lives, we can help them train their nervous systems to be resilient, and to thrive in the face of difficulties and challenges, Dr. Seppala said. Talk about how you have overcome challenges, model healthy resilience, and help kids find respite from the pressures of achievement. Techniques such as meditation, yoga and breathing exercises help your children rest their minds and bodies, and allow them to recover from the physical and emotional damage stress can impart.

Manage your energy. While negative emotions can be damaging to kids mental and physical health, our societys penchant for constant, high-intensity positive emotions takes a toll as well. Western societies value excitement and other high-intensity positive emotions over low-intensity positive emotions such as calm. While theres nothing wrong with excitement and fun, children need to know how to balance excitement with the ability to calm down and function from a centered, peaceful place, saving precious mental energy for tasks that need it most, Dr. Seppala said.

Do nothing. Taking time off to disconnect and relax focus helps promote kids creativity and insights, Dr. Seppala wrote. Children need time for idleness, fun and irrelevant interests, and as research shows C.E.O.s currently value creativity higher than any other trait in the incoming workforce, it behooves you to let your kids relax and access their inner inventor.

Be kind to yourself. While its good to strive for improvement, excessive self-criticism can backfire, and become self-sabotage. Self-criticism maintains focus on the negative, leaving kids anxious, afraid of failure and less likely to learn from mistakes. Self-compassion, however, improves childrens ability to excel in the face of challenges, to develop new skills and to learn from their mistakes.

Be kind to others. Research shows that people who are supportive and compassionate toward others are more successful. Fortunately, Dr. Seppala said, Children are naturally compassionate and kind; we simply need to protect these traits.

Children should not be surprised by joy. If they are, the responsibility for its absence lies at the feet of parents, teachers and administrators who have pushed happiness out of its native habitat to make room for the toxic, invasive species of anxiety, stress and fear.

nytimes.com,2014-09-22 00:00:00,Gary Hewitt's Numberplay Comment Enhancer,['Gary Antonick'],"The New York Times Numberplay blog, like many blogs featured in The Times online, offers a terrific way to connect with a community of passionate and articulate readers from around the world. Numberplay conversations are a lot like those youd find gathered around any blog, with a couple additional features: The conversations are about math, which means formulas may be sprinkled into the mix, and theyre also highly collaborative.

Fortunately, Numberplay reader Gary Hewitt has developed a tool  the Numberplay Comment Enhancer  to support these distinct requirements. If you already use the tool, you probably find it indispensable. If you dont yet use it (or havent tried all of its cool features), heres a short introduction.

Before activating the Enhancer, a blog post and its related comments will look a bit like this:

Photo

The Enhancer turns the post and comments into this:

Photo

Added features are:

1. A text search box

2. A graphical summary of the ongoing conversation

3. Numbered comments, rendered TeX and displayed images

To activate the Enhancer, load a Numberplay posts comments and then click the word Enhancer found near the end of the post.

To generate the graphical summary, just hit the green Graph Navigation box next to the search box. This graphical view shows a dot for every comment left during the week (larger dots mean longer comments), connections between comments (created when a comment refers to a previous comment by number), and recommended comments (circled by dark rings).

TeX is the ubiquitous way to create math symbols and formulas on the web, and a major reason for using the Enhancer is to convert expressions like $a,b,c,...$ into a, b, c, ... Although its not necessary to use TeX when entering comments in Numberplay, the basics are easy to learn and there are plenty of resources online.

That concludes this short introduction. Enjoy the Enhancer! If you have any questions or suggestions let me know. Just send an email to gary.antonick@NYTimes.com.",[]

TUESDAY PUZZLE  This was a straightforward circled-answer puzzle with a good number of long clues for early in the week  potentially slow going for a new solver, but the corners used crossword standards like ASSUAGE, THANE and UPROOT that you will encounter again. Odd little semi-words like AHH, URL and SLR contributed to the challenge here.

For some reason, I knew OTTO PREMINGER had directed Anatomy of a Murder. Right away and right across the middle, then, my answers spread quickly in all directions. I cant for the life of me remember seeing the movie itself, but, like most of us, I did go through a Jimmy Stewart phase so it could have happened. I registered otter at that point, but the nature of the beast didnt become clear until I got MINUTE STEAK. SETTHETABLE and FUSEBOX came fairly easily after that.

The spelling and definition of MESHUGA sent me to the archives and the Internet, because I had heard and spoken so many variations and it looked funny on paper, but that is The New York Times-ordained spelling, so that was something I learned today, my bubelehs.

David Steinberg corroborates my findings, and, as it turns out, I did get lucky with that Jimmy Stewart thing:

Constructors Notes:

I constructed this puzzle just over a year ago. At the time, I was making almost all themelesses, so I decided to construct a themed puzzle for the sake of variety. Im not sure where the inspiration for this puzzle came from, but I was fortunate to find just enough types of fur to scrape together a theme set. Interestingly, both OTTO PREMINGER and OTTO KLEMPERER wouldve worked for the center theme entry  I chose OTTO PREMINGER because I felt he would be more familiar to early-week solvers. I settled on this grid pattern because I wanted to give solvers something a little different from the several theme entries with a pair of long downs structure used in most themed 1515 crosswords these days. I personally use the traditional layout the majority of the time, but when I end up with a theme set that I could go a different direction with, I like to switch things up. The 74-word grid with all the 7s was definitely a challenge, but I was pleased to work in MESHUGA, JUNIPER and BLASTER. Keeping the less savory bits to a minimum was significantly harder, but Im pleased with how the fill turned out over all (with the exception of NATALE, which the Tuesday solver in me is grumbling about!). I hope you enjoy my puzzle. One of the R.A.s in my dorm just started solving The New York Times crossword  as of right now, he only attempts Mondays, so Im hoping this puzzle will persuade him to graduate to Tuesday!

It is Science Times Tuesday, and I was reminded by this puzzle of the Russian Fox experiment, a decades-long project that dissipated along with the Soviet Union, but still pops up on nature shows and in genetics classes. An attempt was made to breed foxes that were less aggressive and less inclined to bite their captors on a fur farm; the result was a complete and rapid domestication, and the new, sweeter foxes proved more lucrative as exotic pets for the ultrarich than fabric for same.

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"Introducing Matthew Zapruder, the Magazines New Poetry Editor",['Matthew Zapruder'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Matthew Zapruder is the new poetry editor for the magazine, succeeding Natasha Trethewey in this annually rotating position. His first selection, You Throw a Stone by Juan Felipe Herrera, appeared in the March 6 issue.

As I started to choose the poems that will appear each week in The New York Times Magazine over the next year, I imagined who might be reading them. I thought about how life is already so complicated and busy, and how, on Sunday mornings, people might want to just sit and drink coffee and quietly move through the paper. I thought that people might turn the page and see a poem and say: Oh, no. Something else I have to do. Except for the crossword, I thought I was safe.

For most of my life as a poet, I have been thinking about this very moment, when a poem enters into someones life. Most of the time, this happens in expected situations: a classroom, a wedding, a funeral. Maybe we have even chosen to pick up a book of them. But I believe that poems are meant to be a part of our lives. They are made up of our language, reconfigured and rearranged to make our minds move in different directions than they ordinarily would. At their best, they make something close to a waking dream.

Its great to have the chance to put poems in front of people in the midst of what they are otherwise doing. I like the idea that someone would turn the page of the magazine and see a poem, and that those words in the poem would have a chance to follow up on, refract, amplify, reconfigure the language of culture and news. The poem gets a chance to exist in a place that is not isolated or rarefied. It gets to be a part of life, and we get to read it that way too.

Poetry is in fine shape now, as it has always been, even though there is a small industry of people periodically informing us its dead. Nevertheless, people go on writing it in all sorts of different ways. Why? I guess we need it. Virginia Woolf wrote, The poet is always our contemporary. I believe she meant that poets, for all time and in all lands, have always found the places in language that continue to be common to human experience. Poems are, in and of themselves, an assertion of both a particular imagination and a common humanity, the possibility that my dreams can be yours, and vice versa. Thats why very old poems can still feel completely present and meaningful to us and why the great new poems can feel very ancient.

My exciting and somewhat daunting task is to pick, each week, a poem and write a very short introduction, which somehow manages to open up the poem without interfering with it. When I think of these introductions, I imagine them as little keys that will open the lock of the poem. And each time, just like in those old stories we heard as children, once the lock opens, the lock and key will disappear, and it will be clear that nothing was ever locked at all.",[]

Which ones?

A

By your early 20s, theres a good chance you are due for some boosters, said Dr. Wanda Filer, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. You may also need to play catch-up if youve missed any vaccines or failed to complete a series, she said.

Everyone needs a tetanus and diphtheria booster every 10 years; the shots are often combined. So if you were 12 the last time you had a tetanus shot, youre due for one at 22.

Adults ages 19 to 64 should also get a pertussis, or whooping cough, booster. Pregnant women should be vaccinated against pertussis toward the end of each pregnancy in order to protect their newborns from this disease, which can be devastating for a baby.

If you are not pregnant but may become pregnant, its a good idea to plan ahead and be tested for immunity to two other childhood diseases: rubella and chickenpox. If you do not have evidence of immunity -- and are not pregnant -- you should be vaccinated.

If you were not vaccinated against the human papilloma virus, or HPV, or did not complete the recommended series of three doses, women can complete the series through age 26, and men through age 21, with more leeway for men who have sex with men and those with compromised immune systems, who who may be vaccinated through age 26. The HPV series protects against viruses that cause cervical cancer, head and neck cancers and anal cancer.

Beyond childhood immunizations, flu shots are recommended every year for just about everybody, Dr. Filer said. The shingles vaccine is also recommended for older adults.

You may also want to check whether youve been vaccinated against meningitis, said Dr. Carolyn Bridges, associate director for adult immunizations at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Its a good idea to obtain a record of your vaccinations, she said, and to encourage your physician to input your record into a state vaccine registry.

The above recommendations are for the general population. Additional vaccines may be advised for anyone with a chronic health condition such as a compromised immune system, asthma or diabetes; those who work in the health care field; men who have sex with men; people who travel to certain parts of the world; and adults 60 or older. Talk with your doctor.

You can find out if youre due for shots by taking the C.D.C.s online vaccination quiz, Dr. Bridges suggested. Vaccine recommendations are confusing.""",[]

FRIDAY PUZZLE  When you dont have a theme to cling to and the clues are ramped up to weekend-level, it can be difficult to conquer a crossword puzzle. If you are just dipping a toe into the late week, themeless puzzles, there are only two things you will need to be successful, and they are 1) patience and 2) more patience.

There are two ways to approach a late-week puzzle. You can scan the clues looking for something, anything that you definitely know, or you can take an educated guess. I highly recommend starting out with the former approach. Nothing boosts your solving self-esteem like filling in that first entry in a blank grid. This first entry will vary, depending on your personal wheelhouse. In my case, I started with 57 Downs Janies got A GUN' and Almond ROCA at 60 Down (I know. Aerosmith and candy. Sorry, Mom.) If those are not your speed, how about Al JOLSON at 9 Down, who sang the timeless Toot Toot Tootsie (Goobye)? Or perhaps you are a bit of a dandy, and you are all about the PERIWIGS. I can remember reading The Bobbsey Twins as a child, so NAN went in right away.

No matter what you know, fill it in and pat yourself on the back for embarking on a late-week solve. From there, branch out and try to connect as many of the entries as you can. The patience comes in when you feel stuck. Put the puzzle down and go do something else. Your brain will continue to process what youve seen in the clues and when you come back to it, youll be surprised at how much more you suddenly know.

The second approach, which can also work, is to take an educated guess at entries that might not be what they seem. At 61 Across, the clue One who can see right through you? is obviously misdirection, what with the question mark at the end. So it probably doesnt mean someone who can see that youre not being honest, which is one possible definition of ... see right through you. Who else can see right through you? My first guess was SUPERMAN, but that doesnt fit. The only other person that could possibly see through you is a RADIOLOGIST.

Having fun yet? You should be. Remember, this is a game. Its a pastime, and its supposed to be fun. Getting angry because you dont know or like a certain word or you think that crosswords should be a strict test of intelligence is pointless and bad for your health. So, if youre having trouble with the puzzle, put it down and come back to it when you can solve it in the fun spirit in which it is meant to be solved.

Evans Clinchy offers us this Friday puzzle and has quite a bit to say about it, so Ill stop lecturing and let him take the mic:

Constructors Notes

So this is my second crossword published in The Times, and if you compare this puzzle with my previous one, youll notice a host of similarities. Both are themeless, both feature stacks of 11-letter entries across the top and bottom three rows, and both are built around the seed entry of a famous N.B.A. player. Last time, back in 2014, it was KEVIN DURANT; this time, I give you Kareem ABDUL-JABBAR. I swear, I have other ambitions in life beyond cramming as many basketball players as possible into Times puzzles. Eventually Ill have no names left to play with besides FESTUS EZELI or someone equally obscure. I should quit now while Im ahead. Anyway. This puzzle was a joy to construct  I remember it began with the realization that the fun CARTOONLIKE fit perfectly beneath ABDUL-JABBAR, and it all flowed from there. I liked getting to sneak in PERIWIGS (which Ive always thought is a cool word, no?) and ONE-TWO PUNCH. Including the name LOUIS C.K. in a puzzle was always something of a bucket-list goal, as the comedian has always been a favorite of mine. Funny, though  I thought I was so original for including Louie at the time I wrote this puzzle, as hed never been featured before. Then his name showed up three times shortly thereafter  in November 2014, January 2015 and March 2015. Great minds think alike, or something? At least I had the neat twist of crossing the comics name with TITLE ROLE, since he has one on his FX show. Its the little victories. As for the clues, Im happy with a few that I wrote (especially the pyramid scheme wordplay for CHEERLEADER), but Im equally grateful for Will sprucing up some of my duller clues with some flavorful ideas of his own. One who can see right through you? for RADIOLOGIST is great. Wish Id thought of that. Also, a picture in one of the clues! [The picture is in the print version only. D.A.] Thats crazy  didnt even know it was a thing. I understand its very, very rare, so Im honored that Will chose my puzzle to decorate. Thanks for reading (and solving), everyone. Ill be back with a Sunday puzzle next time, obviously, because how else am I gonna fit GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO into a grid?

And now for something completely different: a PERIWIGged game of charades:

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"George Martin and the Beatles: A Producers Impact, in Five Songs",['Allan Kozinn'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

When we hear a great recording, we tend to think of the music as having sprung fully developed from the imagination of the musician or band that cut the tracks. But that ignores the role of the producer, who translates the musicians vision into the sound we experience.









The contributions that George Martin, who died Tuesday at 90, made to the Beatles recorded catalog were crucial, and although he was the first to say that most of the credit belongs to the band, many of the groups greatest songs owe their sound and character to his inspired behind-the-scenes work. Here are a few of his most telling musical fingerprints:

From Me to You

When the Beatles turned up at EMIs studios on Abbey Road to record their third single, on March 5, 1963, they brought From Me to You, a short song that John Lennon and Paul McCartney had started writing less than a week earlier. Mr. Martin pondered the possibilities through the first four takes, and then proposed a solution for the songs two biggest problems, its brevity and lack of variety. After two verses, a bridge and a repeat of the first verse, the Beatles would play the verse yet again, this time with the first two lines as a short instrumental break, punctuated with the phrases from me (after the first line) and to you (after the second), before singing the final two lines. To fill out the break, Mr. Martin had Lennon play the songs melody on the harmonica, shadowed by Mr. McCartney on the bass.

For the introduction, Mr. Martin experimented with a string of overdubs. In one, Lennon played the tune on the harmonica. In another, the group hummed it. They also sang it, twice using the syllables da-da-da, da-da, dun dun da, and once with a falsetto floating across the top. In the end, Mr. Martin chose a combination of the harmonica and the sung line (sans falsetto), which establishes the songs bright character immediately.

Yesterday

Mr. McCartney first played Mr. Martin his classic torch song during the groups Paris residency in January 1964, so the producer had plenty of time to mull how to handle it. The group may have considered it, at first, as simply a ballad that would get the full-band treatment. But when Mr. McCartney decided to record it, during the Help! sessions in 1965, Mr. Martin proposed that Mr. McCartney accompany himself on an acoustic guitar, with a string quartet taking the place of the other Beatles.

Mr. McCartney had his doubts: In his view, string arrangements on rock records were suspect. But Mr. Martin played him some recordings and sat him down at the piano to show him what could be done. In the end, Mr. McCartney was convinced, and Mr. Martin  typically open to the groups ideas  worked out his quartet arrangement with Mr. McCartney present. Mr. Martin has said, in fact, that one of the arrangements highlights  the descending cello line, after the lyric Im not half the man I used to be  was Mr. McCartneys idea.

In My Life

Mr. Martin began adding keyboard parts to the Beatles recordings virtually from the start, a notable early example being the ringing celesta line on Baby Its You. But the finest such contribution was his solo on In My Life, an autobiographical meditation by Lennon, on Rubber Soul. When the Beatles recorded the song, on Oct. 18, 1965, they left an instrumental verse open, to be filled with a solo, the nature of which was yet to be agreed upon. By Oct. 22, the group agreed to turn the solo over to Mr. Martin, who decided to give it a Bachian twist, writing a part that had the character and ornamentation of a Two-Part Invention.

On his first pass, he used a Hammond organ but didnt care for the result. A piano worked better, but Mr. Martin, a functional but not virtuosic pianist, was unable to fully channel his inner Glenn Gould. So he played the master tape at half-speed, recording his part slowly and precisely. When the tape was played at full speed, the piano line was not only suitably crisp, but the speed change gave the instrument an unusual character  somewhere between that of a piano and a harpsichord, but not quite either.

Strawberry Fields Forever

Strawberry Fields Forever, the first song recorded for the sessions that produced the Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band album, had as difficult a birth as any song the Beatles and Mr. Martin created. Lennon wrote this psychedelic dreamscape while filming How I Won the War in Almeria, Spain, and recorded demos of all kinds  on acoustic guitar, electric guitar, with and without keyboard overdubs  before taking it to Abbey Road on Nov. 24, 1966. That night, the Beatles recorded a simple, short version with harmony vocals and a Mellotron approximation of a slide guitar, but they junked it two days later and started again, recording a tougher, tighter version with Mr. McCartney playing a fluty Mellotron introduction.

Lennon didnt like that one either, and asked Mr. Martin to write an orchestral score. Mr. Martin responded with a hard-driven chamber score for brass and cellos. He sped the piece up, and moved the song to a higher key so that he could use the vibrant sound of the cellos lowest open string. On Dec. 8, the band and its symphonic friends recorded this third version, which also boasted a raucous timpani part, played by Mr. McCartney, and an Indian zither, played by George Harrison.

Lennon liked it, briefly, and then he didnt. He told Mr. Martin that he enjoyed both the bands version and the chamber version, and envisioned a combination. Mr. Martin protested that the two were in different keys and at different tempos, but Lennon knew the extent of his producers magic, and said, You can do it, George. As it turned out, the key and tempo changes worked to Mr. Martins advantage: by slowing down the orchestral version and speeding up the band take, he found common ground without making either sound too unnatural. If you listen closely, you can spot his splice exactly one minute into the song.

A Day in the Life

The song that closes Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, and is, for many listeners, the most astonishing track on an astonishing album, actually began as a pair of unrelated songs: The melancholy outer verses were Lennons, the brighter central section was Mr. McCartneys. What transformed these fragments into a cohesive whole is a touch of avant-garde string scoring by Mr. Martin. By the time the Beatles set to work on the track, on Jan. 19, 1967, they and Mr. Martin had mapped out its structure. Two of Lennons verses would open the song, followed by Mr. McCartneys verse, which would lead back to final thoughts from Lennon. Between the two composers sections, though, the band would vamp for 24 bars, and there would be another long vamp after the closing verse. How these would be filled  well, Mr. Martin would figure that out later.

For several weeks, the group tweaked the main parts of the song, polishing the vocals, drums and bass, adding extra percussion parts, and trying to imagine what should occupy those long vamped sections. Mr. McCartney thought an orchestral section would be good, but left the question of what that should entail to his producer. Mr. Martins solution was to take a page out of the playbooks of classical composers like John Cage and Krzysztof Penderecki, who at the time were creating works in which chance played a role. Mr. Martin hired 40 symphonic musicians for a session on Feb. 10, and when they turned up, they found on their stands a 24-bar score that had the lowest notes on their instruments in the first bar, and an E major chord in the last. Between them, the musicians were instructed to slide slowly from their lowest to highest notes, taking care not to move at the same pace as the musicians around them.

The sound was magnificently chaotic, and it became more so once Mr. Martin combined the four takes he recorded (some with Mr. McCartney on the podium, some conducted by Mr. Martin himself). It was a brilliant solution: as Lennons voice faded into the echoic distance, the orchestra began its buildup, ending sharply on the chord that begins Mr. McCartneys section.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Missouri Senate Approves Bill Protecting Foes of Gay Marriage,"['Austin Huguelet', 'Richard P Rez-pe A']","Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.  A bill to give some of the nations broadest legal protections to opponents of same-sex marriage took a crucial step forward in Missouri on Wednesday, winning approval in the State Senate after Republicans used a rare procedural move to break a 39-hour filibuster by Democrats.









Since the Supreme Courts ruling in June legalizing gay marriage, legislators in many states have introduced bills that they say would protect religious freedom and opponents say permit discrimination. In some respects, the Missouri bill would go beyond any law now in place, prompting challenges that could keep the issue before the courts for years.

The bill, a proposed amendment to the state Constitution, would shield religious groups and businesses from having to facilitate same-sex weddings. Opponents contend that the bill is probably unconstitutional, and that the wording could lead to much broader consequences, like denying social services, education, employment or housing to married gay people.

Democrats began a filibuster on Monday, but with Republicans holding an overwhelming Senate majority, it was clear that opponents could only delay the bill. The Legislature allows lawmakers to cut off debate by submitting a letter signed by a simple majority of the members; the rule is often invoked in the House, but rarely in the Senate.

On Wednesday, entering the third day of debate, 21 Republicans signed such a letter. The vote was called, and the bill passed, 23 to 9. The Senate must pass the bill again before sending it to the House, which is also controlled by Republicans. If both chambers approve it, the measure will go on the ballot this year.

To stand up for people whove been discriminated against and disenfranchised, of course it was worth it, said Senator Maria Chapelle-Nadal, a Democrat. She predicted a very difficult session for Republicans, saying that Democrats would keep using stalling tactics.

Each side accused the other of being unwilling to compromise.

Senator Ron Richard, the Republican president pro tem, said the majority had no choice but to force a vote. We rarely use it, but we couldnt come to a negotiated settlement that was fair to the sponsor and to our caucus, he said, and we had to move on.

The long debate veered from same-sex marriage, to unrelated bills, to topics far removed from public policy, like which shoes were best for a filibuster. Sleep-deprived Democrats appeared in shifts, holding the floor while others took breaks to nap, shower or change clothes.

Twenty-one states have what backers call religious freedom laws, which do not mention same-sex couples but make it harder to win a lawsuit for discrimination based on religious belief.

The Missouri bill is one of a new batch of measures that explicitly address same-sex marriage and attempt to pre-empt such lawsuits entirely. None have become law so far. The Missouri bill says that clergy members and religious groups would not have to facilitate gay weddings and celebrations, a widely agreed-upon principle. But it also would give businesses like caterers and florists the right to refuse their services.

What troubles opponents most is a passage that does not mention weddings; in fact, it does not limit what actions it would apply to. The passage would shield religious groups from being penalized for acting in accordance with a sincere religious belief about same-sex marriage, and lists many things that could qualify as religious organizations, including schools, charities and retirement homes.

Critics say that could mean denying married gay people housing, employment, social services and schooling.

Missouri law does not bar discrimination against gay or transgender people, but a handful of local ordinances do; the proposed amendment would supersede elements of those.

Such laws in some states have been used as weapons against people of religious faith, said Senator Bob Onder, the Republican sponsor of the bill. My bill, on the other hand, is a shield, not a sword.

Sarah Warbelow, the legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, a prominent gay rights group, said, This reckless legislation has nothing to do with religious freedom and everything to do with enabling discrimination against L.G.B.T. Missourians and their families.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"At High Street on Hudson, Prime Time Starts Early in the West Village",['Pete Wells'],"High Street on Hudson is an adventurous and often exciting restaurant trying extremely hard to pass for an ordinary West Village cafe. Philly spinoff providing house-made breads & pastries, elevated sandwiches, coffee & cocktails, is Googles capsule summary. The description is factual to the last ampersand, yet it doesnt go past the camouflage this place wrapped around itself when it sidled into town in December.









What is missing, what you may miss at first if you came for breakfast or lunch, the only meals High Street on Hudson served in its first few weeks of life, is the high level of intelligence the kitchen applies to everything it does from morning through evening.

The chef, Eli Kulp, is unmistakably trying to make his mark in New York after making his name in Philadelphia. (He was traveling between the two cities last year when his Amtrak train derailed, leaving him with serious spinal injuries.) At dinner, the time when chefs make their big statements, the menu turned out to be full of small oddities and unexpected ripples of flavor when it was finally unveiled in January. Yet his restaurant doesnt just put on a show at night and wait for you to be impressed. Mr. Kulp and his business partner, Ellen Yin, understand that coffee and a great pastry can be just as meaningful before noon as an artfully plated duck breast is after dark.

Restaurants that aim to be useful and interesting all day long are becoming more common in Los Angeles and other cities; New York could use more of them.

The view into the windows from Hudson Street says bakery: You can see bread on shelves, a squarish seeded rye and a round buckwheat loaf with dried cherries inside. Baked by Alex Bois, they have the roughness and flavor of whole grains, the complicated taste of slow-rising dough, and the kind of dark, thick, crackling crust you want to feel between your teeth.

In a glass case by the door are a few of Samantha Kincaids pastries, fewer as the day goes on. The neighbors are especially fond of carrying off the round doughnuts rolled in spiced sugar and filled with salty cider caramel.

Unlike Sadelles, which also has a retail bakery up front, High Street on Hudson puts virtually all of its pastries on the daily menus. An ideal breakfast could be made of coffee and the witty red-eye Danish, a flaky golden swirl with warm country ham over a bulls-eye of bittersweet pastry cream made with espresso.

Or it could revolve around a black bialy. This oddball creature, dark with squid ink and strewn with sesame seeds, is soft and chewy, with pickled peppers and a mound of tart, uncreamy whitefish salad pressed into its divot.

Cooking at breakfast takes the form of egg sandwiches. My choice of these is the Bodega, an incongruous name for a countrified affair of flattened sage sausage and Cheddar on a biscuit with a mule kick of black pepper. Like the other sandwiches, the Bodega arrives alongside a grilled hot pepper on an irregular block of wood. This is both affected and counterproductive; a boring old plate would do a better job of keeping food off the table. (Whats going to happen to all these fancy boards once they stop being cool and everybody admits what a pain they are?)

I am tempted to jump from breakfast straight to dinner out of cowardice. I would rather not have to say that lunch is the weakest meal of the day. The sandwiches are the trouble. The pastrami is a buzz kill, an inert mass of cold pink meat sliced too thickly on too much rye. Another is called the Best Grilled Cheese Ever. It isnt. (Granted, calling a sandwich the Best Grilled Cheese Ever is like naming your child Jesus Buddha.)

If a place is going to go to the trouble of baking those first-rate breads, it should keep a closer eye on the laws of contrast and proportion that mean success or failure in the sandwich universe. Sandwich engineering is a skill of its own, or maybe an instinct.

When it gets dark, High Street on Hudson doesnt entirely pack up the bakery. One of Mr. Kulps more clever moves is to integrate dinner into the overall program with a few breads and some of the regionally grown grains theyre made from.

Vollkornbrot, a dark German rye riddled with sunflower seeds, is a wonderful thing to eat when its buttered and griddled and spread with rutabaga hummus, which could double as vegetarian chicken-liver pate. Slices of anadama, a venerable New England cornmeal loaf sweetened with molasses, are topped with very rich, very tender, very smoky eel.

I was happily surprised that sunflower seeds cooked into a creamy mock risotto could be so appealing. A less pleasant surprise was the portion size, too small to be served as a separate course to our table of four. Apart from the breads, the menu is a longish list under a single category, To Share. The kitchen decides what to send out when, and it doesnt always make the right call.

Tempura-style broccoli is at the start of that list and, ideally, at the start of your meal. Impressively crisp, it gets a refreshing assist from pickled wood-ear mushrooms and an exhilarating dribble of spicy chowchow relish.

Halfway down the menu you come to the pastas. Do not, for any reason short of an allergy, ignore the bucatini with squid and mussels. Mr. Kulp, who was chef de cuisine at Torrisi Italian Specialties before he moved to Philadelphia, knows what he is doing in the pasta department. The bucatini are flavored with seaweed, a terrific idea, and the plate is finished with lobster bottarga shaved into rose-colored petals, an even more terrific idea. It may be the finest use of lobster coral anybody has come up with.

Toward the bottom of the menu are what used to be called main courses. Arctic char is sauced with a very smart remix of a gribiche; the eggs are pickled for extra snap. And while the phrase soured grains does not make the heart go pitter-pat, I could work up some affection for the thing it described, a tart, almost refreshing porridge served under fat slices of duck breast with especially flavorful skin.

You may expect a place serving soured grains to go salty and savory with its desserts. And youd be correct. I like them, mostly, but Id rather have a piece of the spiced kabocha cake, or the cream puff, with its soft spill of Meyer-lemon cream, followed by a cookie offered on a tray by a smiling woman at the door.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-02-26 00:00:00,Unearthing Bogota's Past on the Carrera Septima,"['Annie Correal', 'Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Reference Timestopics People C Annie_correal Index Html']","Leer en Espanol.

A century ago, the Carrera Septima, Bogotas main thoroughfare, was bordered by the stately homes of the well-to-do. Like a European promenade, it led to the city center: grand municipal buildings, a towering cathedral, the expansive Plaza de Bolivar. Its electric streetcars were a symbol of progress, high in the Andes.

Now, little remains of the Septimas grandeur. The old city was nearly reduced to rubble after a political assassination in 1948 sparked riots that left buildings ransacked and burned, the streetcars tipped over and torched. Those who could moved north, leaving the city center to fill with soulless office buildings and the indigent.

Its dirty, its ugly, it smells, and its full of thieves, said the photographer Juan Cristobal Cobo, summarizing the popular attitude toward the old center, also known as the Candelaria, which has been partly restored and attracts international tourism.

But for eight months last year, Mr. Cobo visited a still-rough part of the area weekly, concentrating on four blocks of the Septima that were closed to vehicular traffic not long ago. There, he mined for visible signs of a past often forgotten by Colombians in their eagerness to move forward. Historic centers interest me, he said. In Colombia, they are centers of forgetting.

Mr. Cobo, 52, was born in Cali, Colombia, and studied film at New York University. Since the early 1990s, he has lived in Bogota and worked as a cinematographer and commercial director. A few years ago, I reached a point where I couldnt stand to do any more advertising, he said. As we say in Spanish, I kicked my lunch pail.

He embarked on a number of personal photography projects, including this one.

Remnants of the past abounded on the Septima, where the streetcar tracks were embedded like scars in the street. In one image, a man smoked on a bench in the spot where the populist leader Jorge Eliecer Gaitan was killed in 1948  arguably the most important spot in Bogota, for were it not for that event, the city wouldnt have been destroyed, Mr. Cobo said.

Photo

Mr. Cobo also spotted living relics of the past: older gentlemen in suits and ties crossing the street. Retired public servants and office workers, they lingered in the city center, walking alone or sitting in cafes discussing events from long ago. These men are the last of a type known as el cachaco, the quintessential Bogotano of the last century.

They come from the early 20th century when the British and European influence was strong, Mr. Cobo said. They have a certain formality, a certain courtesy. They probably dont have a place to sleep, or live in rented rooms, but they wont go out without fixing their tie and putting on their sweater and overcoat.

He also found plenty of what he called rebusque, buskers and swindlers of all stripes: fortune-tellers, men selling emeralds, or offering to let him in on a deal. By the Plaza de Bolivar, vendors sold bags of corn to working-class Colombian tourists to feed the pigeons. A one-armed man did push-ups for change, his knuckles leaving a groove in the concrete from his 1,000 daily repetitions (Slide 18). A handful of Michael Jackson impersonators took turns dancing for coins, among them a 14-year-old who had fled Uraba, one of the flashpoints in Colombias decades-long civil conflict.

Its like a very, very, very sad Times Square in a third world country, Mr. Cobo said.

Photo

Despite the details in his work that speak to daily life and the passage of time and history, Mr. Cobo said he did not consider himself a photojournalist. He wanted to stir feelings in the viewer. As often as he saw brokenness, Mr. Cobo said he sensed strength in his subjects. And he wanted to convey this.

Colombia is a complex country, but very resilient, he said. There is a spirit of resilience. The Septima is a mirror of that.

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"Iran, Up Close, Though Far Away","['James Estrin', 'Http Jamesestrin']","Hossein Fatemis photos of Iran provide an unvarnished and intimate view of his homeland. His project An Iranian Journey, which was published on Lens in 2013, earned Mr. Fatemi the World Understanding award in the Pictures of the Year International contest last month.

Im trying to get away from the stereotypes and cliches that Western cultures have about the Iranian people, said Mr. Fatemi, 35. Most Americans have a third world perception and cant even separate Arab culture from Persian culture.

Mr. Fatemi says there is a lifetimes worth of photographs for him to make in his country.

But he cannot.

Photo

The day after Mr. Fatemis story was featured on the website of his photo agency, Panos Pictures, he received the first of many emails from conservative hard-liners who wield power in political parties, official news media and the government. They accused him of undermining Islam and of having a Western ideology and perspective, Mr. Fatemi said. Similar emails were sent to his photo agency, and its website was blocked in Iran.

At the time, Mr. Fatemi was visiting a photo festival in San Diego, and it quickly became clear to him that it would be too dangerous to return to Iran.

Although he settled in Chicago, he did not give up on documentary photography in Iran. He enlisted eight of his former students and started A Journey Inside, a documentary project on social issues in Iran. Although he could not be there physically, Mr. Fatemi stayed in contact through Skype, social media, email and phone.

The stories the participants  four men and four women from different parts of the country  chose focused on the place of women in Iranian society, university students, drought and a disabled war veteran. Mr. Fatemi did not tell them to take any particular point of view or political position.

I just want them to be free and take the pictures they need to, he said. I chose a subject that would not cause them to be arrested or get into any trouble if they were published. There are many subjects that could force photographers to leave the country as I did.

Photo

Indeed, scores of photographers have fled Iran since the post-election protests and 2009 crackdown, he added.

Mr. Fatemi arranged and led virtual workshops throughout Iran to teach his students how to be better visual storytellers and to have an open-minded viewpoint. At times, local government officials banned his workshops because they included men and women together and because a critical documentary viewpoint was politically unacceptable.

The project lasted 14 months, including training and photographing under the supervision of Mr. Fatemi and Panos Pictures, with the assistance of Maryam Athari. The photographers included Zahra Ostadzadeh, Bahar Aslani, Hossein Heidarpour, Hamid Akhlaghi, Negin Kiani, Saeed Zeidi, Mahya Rastegar and Ali Tajik.

Ms. Ostadzadeh, who has a masters degree in sociology, concentrates on womens issues in her photography and video work. For the project, she documented an all-girls boarding school in Kerman Province where, she said, the girls were satisfied by what they have, even though in the larger society women are sometimes seen as inferior.

I wanted my photos to improve their life, she said. My approach wasnt looking down at them. I dont want my photos to only show poverty. Instead I want to show lifes happiness and the great goals they envision. I want to show that despite all the poor conditions and poverty that should be changed they are still content.

Photo

For Mr. Fatemi, receiving the award from POYi was a little bittersweet. Although he cannot return to Iran for now, he has forged a new way forward  with his students. The Journey Inside project was, he said, another way to get at the truth.

Iran is a very complex and complicated country, he said. We photographers think that through this kind of photography we can understand ourselves, our beliefs and our viewpoints.

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,New Procedure Allows Kidney Transplants From Any Donor,['Gina Kolata'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In the anguishing wait for a new kidney, tens of thousands of patients on waiting lists may never find a match because their immune systems will reject almost any transplanted organ. Now, in a large national study that experts are calling revolutionary, researchers have found a way to get them the desperately needed procedure.









In the new study, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, doctors successfully altered patients immune systems to allow them to accept kidneys from incompatible donors. Significantly more of those patients were still alive after eight years than patients who had remained on waiting lists or received a kidney transplanted from a deceased donor.

The method, known as desensitization, has the potential to save many lives, said Dr. Jeffery Berns, a kidney specialist at the University of Pennsylvanias Perelman School of Medicine and the president of the National Kidney Foundation.

It could slash the wait times for thousands of people and for some, like Clint Smith, a 56-year-old lawyer in New Orleans, mean the difference between receiving a transplant and spending the rest of their lives on dialysis.

Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Science Times Newsletter Every week, we'll bring you stories that capture the wonders of the human body, nature and the cosmos.

The procedure, Mr. Smith said, changed my life.

Researchers estimate about half of the 100,000 people in the United States on waiting lists for a kidney transplant have antibodies that will attack a transplanted organ, and about 20 percent are so sensitive that finding a compatible organ is all but impossible. In addition, said Dr. Dorry Segev, the lead author of the new study and a transplant surgeon at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, an unknown number of people with kidney failure simply give up on the waiting lists after learning that their bodies would reject just about any organ. Instead, they resign themselves to dialysis, a difficult and draining procedure that can pretty much take over a persons life.

Desensitization involves first filtering the antibodies out of a patients blood. The patient is then given an infusion of other antibodies to provide some protection while the immune system regenerates its own antibodies. For some reason  exactly why is not known  the persons regenerated antibodies are less likely to attack the new organ, Dr. Segev said. But if the persons regenerated natural antibodies are still a concern, the patient is treated with drugs that destroy any white blood cells that might make antibodies that would attack the new kidney.

The process is expensive, costing $30,000, and uses drugs not approved for this purpose. The transplant costs about $100,000. But kidney specialists argue that desensitization is cheaper in the long run than dialysis, which costs $70,000 a year for life.

Although by far the biggest use of desensitization would be for kidney transplants, the process might be suitable for living-donor transplants of livers and lungs, researchers said. The liver is less sensitive to antibodies so there is less need for desensitization, but its certainly possible if there are known incompatibilities, Dr. Segev said. With lungs, he said, desensitization is theoretically possible, although he said he was not aware of anyone doing it yet.

In the new study, 1,025 patients at 22 medical centers who had an incompatible donor were compared to an equal number of patients who remained on waiting lists for an organ or who had an organ from a deceased but compatible donor. After eight years, 76.5 percent of those who received an incompatible kidney were still alive, compared with 62.9 percent who remained on the waiting list or received a deceased donor kidney and 43.9 percent who remained on the waiting list but never got a transplant.

The desensitization procedure takes time  for some patients as long as two weeks  and is performed before the transplant operation, so patients must have a living donor. It is not known how many have someone willing to donate a kidney, but doctors say they often see situations in which a relative or even a friend is willing to donate but is incompatible.

Often patients are told that their living donor is incompatible, so they are stuck on waiting lists, for a deceased donor, Dr. Segev said.

In recent years, an option called a kidney exchange has helped some in this situation. Patients who have incompatible living donors can swap donors with someone whose donor may be compatible with them. Often, there are chains of patient-donor pairs leading to a compatible organ swap.

That process can be successful, said Dr. Krista L. Lentine, the medical director of the living donation program at the Saint Louis Center for Transplantation, but patients often still cannot find a compatible organ because they have antibodies that would reject almost every kidney. In those cases, desensitization may be the only realistic option for receiving a transplant, said Dr. Lentine, who was not involved with the study.

Dr. Jeffrey Campsen, a transplant surgeon at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center who also was not a study investigator, said his group focused on exchanges and had been fairly successful. But he also comes across patients whose donors do not want to participate. There is a hurdle if the donor and patient have an emotional bond, he said.

The new data showing the success of desensitization lets people get behind it, Dr. Campsen said, adding, I do think it is something we would consider.

Mr. Smith, the New Orleans patient who went through desensitization, had progressive kidney disease that slowly scarred his kidneys until, in 2004, they stopped functioning. His sister-in-law, Allison Sutton, donated a kidney to him, and he had a transplant, but after six and a half years, it failed. He went on dialysis, spending four days a week hooked up to dialysis machines for hours. It was keeping him alive, he told his friends, but it was not a life.

Then a nurse suggested that he ask Johns Hopkins about its desensitization study. I was like, whatever I could do, he said. He discovered that he qualified for the study. But he needed a donor.

One day, Mrs. Smith was talking on the phone to a college friend, Angela Watkins, who lives in Augusta, Ga., and mentioned that Mr. Smith was praying for a donor. Mrs. Watkinss husband, David Watkins, a judge in state court, had been friends with Mr. Smith in college and the two wives, also college friends, had kept in touch over the years.

Mrs. Watkins told her husband about the conversation, and they asked themselves if they should offer to donate.

We talked and researched and prayed, Judge Watkins said. Finally, he said, they came to a conclusion. We have a moral obligation to at least see if we would qualify. And he thought that he should be the one to go first. If he did not qualify, his wife could be tested.

Mr. Smith warned his old friend that donating was an enormous undertaking. He said, You cant grasp what you are doing. I heard him but it didnt register, Judge Watkins said. I told him, I have something you need, so whats the big deal? 

Of course, it was a big deal. Although Judge Watkins had prepared by getting himself in top physical shape, it still took about six months to recover from the operation.

That was four years ago, and Mr. Smiths new kidney is still functioning and he is back to his active life, forever grateful to his friend.

Every night. he says, during my nightly prayers with my wife, I thank God for bringing David and Allison to me and for giving me the gift of life.

But for David giving me this gift, I would still be in that dialysis chair.",[]

Even before revelations that the Fox Sports reporter Erin Andrews was secretly videotaped naked by a stalker in a hotel room in 2008, female sportscasters have understood how frightening obsessed fans can be.









Andrea Kremer recalled being in a hotel room while she was at NFL Films in 1988 when a man called late at night as she was falling asleep.

He started saying all these things he wanted to do to me, and it scared the living hell out of me, Kremer, who is now with NFL Network and HBO Sports, said. I hung up, called downstairs, and said: I got a really threatening call. Can you trace it? They said it was coming from inside the hotel. Then he called back  it was so chilling and terrifying. I was shaking. My heart was beating fast.

After another call to the front desk, she said, the hotel stationed a security guard outside her door.

I told the men on my crew, and they were livid, she said. They said: Why didnt you call us? We would have slept on the floor.

In an age of round-the-clock sports broadcasting and the widespread dissemination of their work across social media, female sportscasters have unparalleled reach. There are more of them now than ever, across multiple channels and websites.

But the flip side can be unwanted attention from an audience that is male dominated, from stalkers or even from self-described fans who recognize them and simply get uncomfortably close.

Female newscasters and celebrities have long faced such harassment and threats  one newscaster in St. Louis two years ago said she had to quit her job under repeated threats from a stalker  but some sportscasters work in potentially vulnerable and highly visible places like stadiums and arenas where they are in close proximity to passionate fans, many of them males.

They routinely take precautions like asking hotel clerks not to say their name loudly when checking in, refusing to step in elevators if they see glaring male eyes, and opting for private transportation in late hours, to avoid the flock of people who often gather outside studios, innocently or not. Some check to make sure the hotel door peephole has not been tampered with, as it was in Andrewss case.

In one of the most disturbing episodes faced by a female sportscaster, a determined fan named Michael David Barrett used a hacksaw to alter the peepholes of Andrewss hotel rooms in Nashville and Columbus, Ohio. Jurors on Monday found Barrett and the companies that manage the Nashville Marriott responsible for invading Andrewss privacy and awarded her $55 million in damages.

Jessica Mendoza, an analyst on ESPNs Sunday Night Baseball, said that what happened to Andrews made her wonder about taking more than minor precautions like closing the blinds in hotel rooms.

You think about all the times youre in a room  and how scary that someone could see me in there, she said.

But even less egregious encounters can leave female sportscasters unsettled and almost always on guard.

Ill try to avoid ever being in the hall of a hotel by myself, Kim Jones, a reporter for NFL Network, said. And Ill allow whoever is behind me to pass me before I put my card or key in the door. You have to be so aware because unfortunately that one time out of 10,000 something can happen.

Alyssa Roenigk, a reporter for ESPNs magazine who also appears on ESPN television, primarily covering action sports like the X Games, said she rarely gave her security much thought. For years, she usually walked from venues to her hotel, even late at night. But as she began to do more television, and was recognized more often, she was told by her bosses to start taking the courtesy car provided by the network.

At first I thought I was getting special treatment, and I dont want special treatment, Roenigk said. Its not special treatment. Its being safe.

Jamie Little of Fox Sports, who primarily covers Nascar and other motor sports, said: Just last week, I got on an elevator and there were some race fans in there, and they were drinking and it made me a little nervous. And they were kind of watching what floor I was going to, so I pressed the wrong floor. So I go to the wrong floor, get off the elevator, wait for them to go and get back on.

In another instance, she said, she was on an airport shuttle on her way to pick up a rental car when a man approached her. She is still not sure if he was an ardent fan, or something else.

This guy turns right into me and says, Hey, Jamie, so you going to so-and-so today? I was like, Whoa, hey, well, Im here for Nascar,  she recalled. And he kept trying to make small talk. I went down another escalator, and when I looked over, he was literally standing there staring at me, on his phone.

That kind of stuff makes you worry, she continued. You want to give people the benefit of the doubt. Yeah, Im on TV, its not a big deal. But you have to watch the mannerisms, the body language, the constant following you as they try to ask questions. I tend to be overly nice to people. When weird things happen, I honestly kind of forget about it because its your job and Ive got to get on a plane the next week.

Laura Okmin, a sideline reporter for N.F.L. games on Fox, dealt with a stalker in the mid-1990s when she was working at a TV station in Chattanooga, Tenn. The man became angry when she did not respond to letters he sent her and gifts he dropped off for her. Eventually, police officers escorted her home several times and security was provided at events that she covered. Later, a man kept calling her at every hotel she checked into.

She uses these experiences at seminars she holds for aspiring female sportscasters at her company, Galvanize.

I tell them that sometimes someone will be lovely and pay you a great compliment, but if you dont respond the right way in person or on social media, they turn angry and belligerent, she said. Nowadays, it can be 24/7 with all the ways they can come at you.

After the jury award, Andrews was thankful for the encouragement she said she had received from other victims of harassment, and she suggested the cases outcome would improve safety.

Ive been honored by all the support from victims around the world, she said on Twitter. Their outreach has helped me be able to stand up and hold accountable those whose job it is to protect everyones safety, security and privacy.",[]

Your hand may be fondled and examined as if it were some kind of mysterious bauble, then perhaps placed on a naked hip. A kiss may be planted on a fingertip. And at many points, you may find yourself being suddenly stroked as you wander the rooms of the lavishly restored Billy Roses Diamond Horseshoe nightclub in the basement of the Paramount Hotel.

Queen of the Night, directed by the talented set designer Christine Jones (American Idiot, the Metropolitan Operas Rigoletto), blends several strands of currently fashionable theatrical DNA. Among its presenters is Randy Weiner, who is among the producers of Sleep No More, the wildly popular riff on Macbeth that requires you to don a beaky mask and wander several floors of a building in Chelsea in search of dark doings. As at Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812 (at least when it first opened in the meatpacking district), a full meal is included in the ticket price: kale salad and potatoes, and one of three theatrical main dishes: chunky beef ribs presented on a huge wooden platter, a roast suckling pig plopped down on the table still on the spit, or lobster. (A vegetarian option, mushroom risotto, is also available.)

Although there is a sprig of drama involved  characters modeled on the principals in Mozarts Magic Flute have central roles in the floor show  the foursquare aim of this meticulously produced spectacle is to satiate appetites other than traditionally dramatic ones. Just how sated you will be depends on chance, to a degree. As with Sleep No More, every individuals experience will be different. You might drink, dine and watch the performance, most of which takes place on a raised platform in the middle of the ballroom-size dining room, without being accosted by any of the butlers, as the wranglers who spirit customers away for private encounters are called.

Or you could be lassoed (literally) almost the moment you descend the marble staircase leading to the festivities, as my companion was, and led off into a private chamber for some intimate talk about intimate matters. (Have you ever been in love?)

Or you could find yourself, as I did, shoeless and sitting in a fur- and mirror-lined boudoir with a pert young woman making goo-goo eyes at you as she strokes your face with a feather.

Or you could be hijacked during the dinner service and swept off to a small chamber and invited to engage in a game of striptease, as the handsome hedge fund guy sitting next to me was. (I expect the young, toned and beaming-with-extroversion are selected for this option.)

If youre in the mood for these kinds of things, Im not sure I can give any advice about how to convey your inclination. Maybe just look for a young man sporting raccoon eyes (the eyeliner budget alone must stretch to the thousands a month) and a come-hither look, and throw yourself in his path. These assistants can also be identified by their black-and-white ensembles, created by the fashion designer Thom Browne, who provided all the costumes. Of course, as with real mating games, maybe its better to look like youre not looking. Try clutching your drink tightly and staring in anguished anxiety at the floor, and see what happens.

In fact, staring at the floor, and the walls, and the light fixtures, is among the most reliably pleasurable diversions at Queen of the Night, and one that does not require curatorial assistance. The design is a collaborative effort among the interior designer Meg Sharpe, the set and scent designer Douglas Little and the creative director Giovanna Battaglia. (I recall a little incense, but nothing too wild in the olfactory department.) It features a riot of different styles, with an emphasis on opulence twisting toward the decadent.

A stuffed leopard, posed as if on the prowl and draped in jewels, stands sentinel in one of the antechambers, looking as if hed just crawled down from an Erte print. One room I was led through, in which a female cast member was bathing as nonchalantly as you can bathe while strangers stroll by, featured walls and a chandelier molded from white wax. Another wall in one of the antechambers features an elaborate inlaid design created from metallic blue beetle shells and butterfly feathers. The handles on the doors to most of the rooms are outstretched hands, a clever symbol of the shows theme of connection and seduction. (Take care to establish the gender of the hand on the bathroom door you choose, or you could find yourself treating some patron to an unwanted moment of interpersonal engagement.)

You may also notice that some attendees have little hand-shaped amulets hanging from ribbons around their necks. These would be the guests who opted for the higher tiers of pricing. General admission tickets begin at $135 and include a cocktail and full dinner with unassigned seating, but there are levels of increased coddling that can push that price north of $500. (For that sum, you get to select your own premium wine and have special canapes in the kitchen.)

I was assured, however, that the butlers have no instructions to give extra attention to patrons who have paid more. Everyone has an equal chance at being treated to a little knife throwing, a magic trick, a back rub or even a ritualized milk bath. Given the shows general air of fin-de-Bloomberg-era lavishness, it was good to know that at least when it came to the elaborately stage-managed intimacies, all were on the same footing. At Queen of the Night, decadence and democracy are shaking hands.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-02-26 00:00:00,Why Tech Degrees Are Not Putting More Blacks and Hispanics Into Tech Jobs,"['Quoctrung Bui', 'Claire Cain Miller']","Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Technology companies employ strikingly few black and Hispanic workers. They blame the recruitment pipeline, saying there arent enough of them graduating with relevant degrees and applying for tech jobs.









Yet the data show that there are many more black and Hispanic students majoring in computer science and engineering than work in tech jobs. So why arent they being hired?

Those who enter the candidate pipeline fall out somewhere along the way  and the culture and recruiting methods of tech companies seem to have a lot to do with it.

The pipeline problem is not a myth. Black and Hispanic students are underrepresented in computer science and engineering programs, relative to their share of the population, while Asian students are overrepresented.

Yet the pipeline is more fruitful than tech companies make it out to be. Among young computer science and engineering graduates with bachelors or advanced degrees, 57 percent are white, 26 percent are Asian, 8 percent are Hispanic and 6 percent are black, according to American Community Survey data. At the top 25 undergraduate programs, nearly 9 percent of graduates are underrepresented minorities, according to Education Department data analyzed by Maya A. Beasley, a sociologist at the University of Connecticut.

But technical workers at Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter, according to the companies diversity reports, are on average 56 percent white, 37 percent Asian, 3 percent Hispanic and 1 percent black.

One issue is that black and Hispanic computer science and engineering graduates are less likely than white and Asian ones to go into tech jobs. Forty percent of young Asian graduates do so, compared with 16 percent of black graduates and 12 percent of Hispanics, according to American Community Survey data.

Meanwhile, 10 percent of black computer science and engineering graduates have office support jobs, which include administrative support and accounting jobs, compared with 5 percent of white graduates and 3 percent of Asians.

Continue reading the main story What Jobs Do Computer Science and Engineering Majors Have? Occupation Black Hispanic Asian White

Ms. Beasley studied why talented black students ended up in lower-paying, lower-status careers for her book Opting Out: Losing the Potential of Americas Young Black Elite. Those who studied science and technology were less likely than white students to stick with their majors when they felt they were underperforming, she found. Those who did stick with their majors were less likely to apply for technical jobs. They often pursued nonprofit or business work instead, she said, sometimes because they had heard negative things about the culture at tech companies, and seen how few black people worked there.

One example: At Facebook, where some employees had written black lives matter on the walls, others in recent days have crossed it out to write all lives matter. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, called the actions malicious and deeply hurtful.

Any student of color looking at the numbers from the tech giants is going to be turned off and wary about taking a job there because it tells you something about what the climate is, Ms. Beasley said. They dont want to be the token.

Recruiting is another issue. Part of it is looking not just at Stanford and M.I.T. but also at places like historically black colleges. Even at the colleges that tech companies typically recruit from, students who are not white or Asian might not be in the networks to know about opportunities at tech companies.

Tristan Walker, a tech start-up founder and chief executive of Walker & Company, said he didnt know about Silicon Valley until he was 24 and arrived at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

There definitely isnt a pipeline problem, even going to the same schools companies go to, Mr. Walker said. He puts the onus on the companies. These folks arent working hard enough, theyre just not.

Tech companies need to look into more places to find students outside the mainstream network, said Mr. Walker and Laura Weidman Powers, who together started Code 2040, a nonprofit that connects black and Hispanic engineering students with tech companies. (By the year 2040, some people predict, minorities will become the majority in the United States, and the group says its goal is that they are proportionally represented in the tech sector by then.)

When companies come to campus to recruit, for example, black and Hispanic students often simply dont show up for information sessions, Ms. Powers said. But theyre more likely to come to workshops, like for writing resumes or preparing for interviews.

That gets a higher yield in terms of students showing up, and they leave with an impression that we value them and their growth, as opposed to it just being a sales pitch, she said.

Tech companies often give coders whiteboard interviews  asking them to solve a problem by writing code on a whiteboard, so the interviewers can see their thought process. At Code 2040, however, they discovered that many black and Hispanic students, unlike white and Asian ones, had never heard of this type of interview and were unprepared for it.

Theres still a dominant cultural narrative in black and Hispanic communities that you have to be twice as good and keep your head down and work hard, Ms. Powers said. That does not translate to Valley culture, starting with the whiteboard interview, because it requires people to work through errors in front of the interviewer, as opposed to presenting only the right answer.

Research has found that during hiring, managers are biased against black-sounding names on resumes, for instance, and interviewers weigh too heavily whether theyd want to hang out with someone. Software can help remove human bias, such as with new tools for stripping resumes of biographical information, offering blind auditions to job applicants or analyzing job postings for language that excludes certain groups.

Many tech companies have started doing things like requiring training on unconscious bias and hiring corporate diversity chiefs. But it is unclear how much of a difference these efforts make. Holding hiring managers responsible for diversity works far better than either staff diversity training sessions, which dont work well, or networking and mentoring programs, which help a bit, according to a study analyzing three decades of work force data from 708 companies.

Some researchers offer other strategies: Use standardized interview questions, not subjective ones; evaluate hiring managers based on whether they bring in diverse candidates; build a Rolodex of potential hires by working with networking groups for minorities; hire more than one minority member in each batch of new hires, so they have a support network.

Techniques like these could expand the pipeline for tech companies  and for any other industry, too.",[]

Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders will convene in Miami for the second Democratic presidential debate of the week on Wednesday night, ahead of big primaries in Florida and Ohio next Tuesday. Their previous encounter was a testy affair, as the candidates clashed over the economy, guns and campaign finance. While Mr. Sanders won in an upset over Mrs. Clinton in the Michigan primary on Tuesday, her delegate lead still widened because of her victory in Mississippi.

Heres how to tune in:

On television

The debate begins at 9 p.m. Eastern and will be shown on Univision, CNN and Fusion.

Online

There are also plenty of free options to view the debate online, with the websites of Univision, CNN, The Washington Post and Fusion streaming it live.

On social media

Facebook and Twitter will be full of commentary about the debate, and readers can find the conversation using the hashtag #DemDebate. Also, Purple, a new messaging app, is collaborating with the networks to provide real-time updates about the debate via text messages in Spanish.

And you can follow along with The New York Times for our live chat and analysis of the action.

FRIDAY PUZZLE  When you dont have a theme to cling to and the clues are ramped up to weekend-level, it can be difficult to conquer a crossword puzzle. If you are just dipping a toe into the late week, themeless puzzles, there are only two things you will need to be successful, and they are 1) patience and 2) more patience.

There are two ways to approach a late-week puzzle. You can scan the clues looking for something, anything that you definitely know, or you can take an educated guess. I highly recommend starting out with the former approach. Nothing boosts your solving self-esteem like filling in that first entry in a blank grid. This first entry will vary, depending on your personal wheelhouse. In my case, I started with 57 Downs Janies got A GUN' and Almond ROCA at 60 Down (I know. Aerosmith and candy. Sorry, Mom.) If those are not your speed, how about Al JOLSON at 9 Down, who sang the timeless Toot Toot Tootsie (Goobye)? Or perhaps you are a bit of a dandy, and you are all about the PERIWIGS. I can remember reading The Bobbsey Twins as a child, so NAN went in right away.

No matter what you know, fill it in and pat yourself on the back for embarking on a late-week solve. From there, branch out and try to connect as many of the entries as you can. The patience comes in when you feel stuck. Put the puzzle down and go do something else. Your brain will continue to process what youve seen in the clues and when you come back to it, youll be surprised at how much more you suddenly know.

The second approach, which can also work, is to take an educated guess at entries that might not be what they seem. At 61 Across, the clue One who can see right through you? is obviously misdirection, what with the question mark at the end. So it probably doesnt mean someone who can see that youre not being honest, which is one possible definition of ... see right through you. Who else can see right through you? My first guess was SUPERMAN, but that doesnt fit. The only other person that could possibly see through you is a RADIOLOGIST.

Having fun yet? You should be. Remember, this is a game. Its a pastime, and its supposed to be fun. Getting angry because you dont know or like a certain word or you think that crosswords should be a strict test of intelligence is pointless and bad for your health. So, if youre having trouble with the puzzle, put it down and come back to it when you can solve it in the fun spirit in which it is meant to be solved.

Evans Clinchy offers us this Friday puzzle and has quite a bit to say about it, so Ill stop lecturing and let him take the mic:

Constructors Notes

So this is my second crossword published in The Times, and if you compare this puzzle with my previous one, youll notice a host of similarities. Both are themeless, both feature stacks of 11-letter entries across the top and bottom three rows, and both are built around the seed entry of a famous N.B.A. player. Last time, back in 2014, it was KEVIN DURANT; this time, I give you Kareem ABDUL-JABBAR. I swear, I have other ambitions in life beyond cramming as many basketball players as possible into Times puzzles. Eventually Ill have no names left to play with besides FESTUS EZELI or someone equally obscure. I should quit now while Im ahead. Anyway. This puzzle was a joy to construct  I remember it began with the realization that the fun CARTOONLIKE fit perfectly beneath ABDUL-JABBAR, and it all flowed from there. I liked getting to sneak in PERIWIGS (which Ive always thought is a cool word, no?) and ONE-TWO PUNCH. Including the name LOUIS C.K. in a puzzle was always something of a bucket-list goal, as the comedian has always been a favorite of mine. Funny, though  I thought I was so original for including Louie at the time I wrote this puzzle, as hed never been featured before. Then his name showed up three times shortly thereafter  in November 2014, January 2015 and March 2015. Great minds think alike, or something? At least I had the neat twist of crossing the comics name with TITLE ROLE, since he has one on his FX show. Its the little victories. As for the clues, Im happy with a few that I wrote (especially the pyramid scheme wordplay for CHEERLEADER), but Im equally grateful for Will sprucing up some of my duller clues with some flavorful ideas of his own. One who can see right through you? for RADIOLOGIST is great. Wish Id thought of that. Also, a picture in one of the clues! [The picture is in the print version only. D.A.] Thats crazy  didnt even know it was a thing. I understand its very, very rare, so Im honored that Will chose my puzzle to decorate. Thanks for reading (and solving), everyone. Ill be back with a Sunday puzzle next time, obviously, because how else am I gonna fit GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO into a grid?

And now for something completely different: a PERIWIGged game of charades:

MIAMI  Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida who ended his presidential bid after a string of disappointing finishes, is planning to meet with three of the remaining Republican candidates while theyre in Miami for the Republican debate on Thursday night.

Mr. Bush has plans to meet with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, an aide to Mr. Bush confirmed. The lists glaring omission, of course, was Donald J. Trump.

Mr. Bush will meet with Mr. Rubio on Wednesday, and Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich on Thursday, the aide said. It was unclear whether Mr. Bush intended to make an endorsement before Tuesdays winner-take-all primary in Florida.

As a candidate, Mr. Bush made taking on Mr. Trump, forcefully and repeatedly, a hallmark of his campaign, criticizing him for disparaging women, Hispanics and the disabled, and warning that he was insufficiently serious to be commander-in-chief.

Mr. Trump, meanwhile, always seemed to hold Mr. Bush, and his dynastic family, in poor regard, attacking him from almost the first moment he entered the race. It was Mr. Trumps two-word insult  dubbing Mr. Bush low-energy  that helped devastate Mr. Bushs campaign, as voters parroted back the phrase and Mr. Bush, who in fact routinely held several free-wheeling events every day, was never able to fully shake the moniker.

The relationship between Mr. Bush and Mr. Rubio is especially fraught. As governor of Florida, Mr. Bush helped mentor Mr. Rubio, then a charismatic, up-and-coming lawmaker, even bestowing on him a sword when he became speaker of the Florida House. But Mr. Bushs team was livid when the young protegee entered the 2016 race, refusing to cede the Florida political world to Mr. Bush, in what many viewed as a betrayal.",[]

PALM BEACH, Fla.  After testing the bounds of vulgarity, factuality and decency, the most surreal presidential campaign in modern times now arrives in the state where hanging chads, romantic dalliances and a mishmash of voting allegiances have made and unmade political careers.









This is Florida, where campaign money flows like sugar cane runoff and the Republican Party establishment is planning to make what could be its last stand against a man, Donald J. Trump, who embodies many of the states stereotypes  the love of a year-round suntan, an obsession with golf, a preening ostentation.

The states winner-take-all primary on Tuesday is shaping to be a climactic moment. Mr. Trumps insurgent candidacy faces the biggest test yet of whether it is built to endure. Marco Rubio, Floridas junior senator, will have to decide whether he should stay in the race if he loses. And Senator Ted Cruz of Texas will see how far his efforts to chip away at the support of both rivals can go.

A glimpse of the antics that lie ahead came Tuesday night, when Mr. Trump won Hawaii, Michigan and Mississippi. He celebrated at his golf club in Jupiter, Fla., where he set out on display an array of Trump-branded products like steaks, wine and water while he talked up the Jack Nicklaus-designed course. (Upon closer inspection, however, those steaks carried the label of a local meat purveyor.) I love Florida. Special place, he told the crowd.

This special place will have its fill of politicians over the next week. Univision was to host a Democratic debate on Wednesday night, and CNN a Republican debate on Thursday night, both in Miami.

But with little drama expected in the Democratic race  Hillary Clinton is comfortably ahead of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont here in polls  most of the attention is on the Republican contest.

Mr. Rubio, in the fight of his life, is trawling the state, from a paella cookout in the Cuban enclave of Hialeah, near Miami, to a high-dollar fund-raiser in Palm Beach to events in Sarasota and St. Augustine. Mr. Cruz also plans to visit Miami, Mr. Rubios home base.

It will be an expensive race, with Floridas 10 news media markets and $12 million in ads swamping televisions in the final two weeks before voting.

It will be bitter, too, with many supporters of the former governor, Jeb Bush, refusing to back Mr. Rubio. Some are threatening to vote for Mr. Bush, who dropped out of the race last month, because his name remains on the ballot.

And it will be a spectacle.

The guys I see every day are having ministroke episodes, said David Johnson, a Republican consultant in Tallahassee, the capital, who was supporting Mr. Bush in the presidential race. He will be one of those still voting for the former governor.

In a twist that Mr. Rubio cannot enjoy, much of the anti-establishment anger that he rode to victory in the 2010 midterm elections is now working against him. Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz, who party leaders fear would lead the Republicans to historic defeats in November, are the anti-establishment now.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Its a very similar thing, Mr. Johnson added. People are angry. They dont know what they want, but they dont want what they have right now.

Every 15 years or so, Florida manages to send a shock through the presidential race, whether in the form of a romantic escapade on a yacht named Monkey Business, which helped sink Gary Hart, or in the form of hanging chads, the half-punched ballots that sent the 2000 election to the United States Supreme Court.

This time, the shock wave is Mr. Trump.

For evidence that this is Mr. Trumps Republican Party now, look no further than here in the blue-blooded beachhead of Palm Beach. When the local party hosts its annual Lincoln Day dinner this month, a tradition that dates back decades, Mr. Trump will not only headline the event but also host it. His private club Mar-a-Lago is the venue.

Many Republicans here, people who have opened their homes to Rockefellers and Bushes, are getting behind him.

Have you ever hunted grouse? asked Byron Thomas, a longtime Palm Beach resident, explaining Mr. Trumps appeal. Grouse, which he said he hunts on his property near Cooperstown, N.Y., need to be flushed out of the brush before you can shoot them. And to do that, he said, you have to startle them and make them angry. What Trump has done is hes flushed out these impostors, he added.

Sure, the real estate developer has done things that Mr. Thomas finds crass, like putting his picture on the water bottles handed out at his golf courses. But he can look past that. Bob Dole couldnt win. Mitt Romney couldnt win. So lets try something different, he said.

Many conservatives like Mr. Thomas lost trust in Mr. Rubio shortly after he went to Washington and began working on a bipartisan immigration overhaul plan. His time in the capital, they say, has eroded his anti-establishment credibility.

Florida allows ballots to be cast before Election Day, and the early-voting data contains signs that Mr. Trump should find encouraging. According to an analysis of the more than 600,000 votes that Florida Republicans have already cast, 18 percent came from people who did not vote in November 2012 or in 2014 when Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, was re-elected.

Daniel Smith, the University of Florida political scientist who conducted the analysis, said that the number accounted for more than just population growth and could be seen as a sign that Mr. Trump is pulling in new voters, much as he has done in other states.

But not all the data is discouraging for Mr. Rubio. In Miami-Dade County, where Mr. Rubio hopes to make up for the ground Mr. Trump is likely to gain in the more conservative north of the state, Mr. Smith said the rate of Hispanic Republicans participating is above average. That, he said, should be good for Mr. Rubio.

Beyond Miami, it has been slow going for the Rubio campaigns get-out-the-vote operation. One afternoon over the weekend at the Orlando headquarters, which opened only last week, about 20 volunteers were working from lists of likely Rubio voters who had requested absentee ballots and calling them to make sure they had voted. Their surroundings were bleak: the vacant offices of what used to be an architecture firm, the floor littered with broken ceramic tiles and orange cones marking where hazards protruded.

Complicating matters for Mr. Rubio is Mr. Cruz, who despite not being particularly competitive in Florida has decided to be at the very least a nuisance, and at the very worst a drain that keeps the senator from catching up with Mr. Trump.

Mr. Cruz announced recently that his campaign had opened 10 offices across the state  a move that seemed aimed at goading Mr. Rubio, since at the time the Rubio campaign had only five formally open. Rubio campaign officials circulated photographs of what they said were the Cruz locations, which looked vacant.

If Mr. Rubio has much of a campaign treasury left, he is not spending it on ads here but rather relying on the support of the super PAC backing him. The Conservative Solutions PAC placed nearly $6 million in advertising for the two weeks before the primary. Some of that will be spent attacking Mr. Trump, who is already the target of $4 million in negative ads by an array of groups working to take him down.

Even if Republicans were spending more to swamp Mr. Trump in negative ads, it is not clear they would agree on a candidate to support in his place. Mr. Rubio has spoken to Mr. Bush at least twice since Mr. Bush quit the race on Feb. 20, and was planning to sit down with him this week. (Mr. Bush also was meeting with Mr. Cruz and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio.) But the Rubio campaign has all but written off the possibility that Mr. Bush will endorse him.

Mr. Bushs friends say some Bush loyalists still think that Mr. Rubio did not show the respect he should have to the man who helped nurture his career when he was a young state legislator.

I talked to Jeb, and he doesnt have any harsh feelings about this, said Mel Martinez, the former senator whose seat Mr. Rubio won. I think he obviously wishes Marco would have been a little more loyal a friend. But what are you going to do?

Its a tough deal, he added.

Given that absentee votes were circulated before Mr. Bush dropped out, he is still expected to register some support on Primary Day.

Its probably going to be at least 2 percent, said Michael P. McDonald, who studies elections for the University of Florida and the Brookings Institution, basing his assumptions on the results in Texas, where Mr. Bush drew votes even after dropping out. In Florida, like in Texas, he said, they like their Bushes.

Whether it is the feuding between the Rubio and Bush camps, or Mr. Trumps outrageousness, or Mr. Rubios perceived betrayal of the conservatives who elected him in 2010, Floridians may not agree on much these days. But they all seem to want the primary to end quickly.

This has been immature and childish. Its like grade school kids  all the fighting and talking over each other, said Virgil M. Price II of Palm Beach, who is not sure whom he will vote for except that it will not be Mr. Trump. Its been horrible.",[]

Her conversation with James Estrin about covering the ceremony has been edited.

Q.

Tell me about your first Oscars.

A.

It was at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in 1999. I shot the red carpet, and that was it. I shot film and it wasnt a tight deadline. At that time, The Times would run the red carpet story the Tuesday following the awards.

Q.

What is the difference between 1999 and last year?

A.

The difference is the technology and new media. The fan base has always been there, but its even larger now because of the technology that lets people experience this on their phones. Theres an insatiable appetite for films and movie stars.

Q.

Now the Oscars photos are essentially broadcast live. You take a photo, and it ends up on the New York Times home page minutes later.

A.

Its gone from dropping film overnight and picking it up the next morning to transmit, to running memory cards to an on-site editor to beat the closing time for the next days paper. When the first wireless transmitters came out, we started using them. We work under an extremely tight deadline on East Coast time.

Josh Haner made all the difference when he devised an ingenious system where every single frame we shoot is transmitted immediately to the editors in New York. They are actually seeing the pictures in real time. They caption them with the names of the stars and the designer and post them on the web.

You work on a lot of serious, in-depth stories. Yet these award shows are among the most popular slideshows we do.

A.

Yes. The Oscar slide shows get the most views of any shows all year, which is quite amazing. Last year, it got over three million views over all. But do you want to hear something incomprehensible to me? The red carpet slide shows for last months Golden Globes got 13 million page views. And thats pretty much somebody posing in an evening gown. But we were faster. We were beating the wires. They were still dealing with on-site editors.

Q.

What is involved in shooting the red carpet?

A.

We have more access now so its gotten much more interesting and challenging. It used to be all about logistics  setting up days in advance to make sure all that technology works.

I have shot every position, from the red carpet to the photo room, where there are bleachers full of hundreds of photographers screaming at the winners when they come to pose for pictures; to a position inside of the theater, which is essentially what is seen on television.

Once I got the backstage position in 2014  and along with that the ability to move around on the red carpet  I could roam, take pictures, observe and work the light. Youre not in one position waiting for something to happen in front of you. You can actually start to take real pictures. The first year, I felt like a kid in a candy store.

Q.

And how did this happen?

A.

It took many years of asking. Only a handful of photographers are granted that access, and the biggest news and entertainment organizations are represented. The New York Times is one of them, and our reach has grown tremendously, especially the last few years, through our website and social media.

Photo

Q.

Whats it like to be in the bleachers?

A.

You get into your position in the photo room and everybodys dressed in formal attire. You wait for the winners to come in with their awards and when they do the whole room just goes crazy. Theres a stage thats set up and they pose with their statues.

You just try to capture whatever moment you can with somebody standing in front of you posing.

Q.

And the other photographers screaming in your ears.

A.

Yes, but sometimes that might work to your advantage if youre sitting next to somebody who gets the winners attention and they kind of look your way. Im not inclined to scream at people. Its just pandemonium.

Then the celebrity walks away and everything quiets down. The next one comes and the room erupts again. It can be entertaining, but also sort of a sensory overload at times.

Im at my best when Im like the only photographer around. And so this is quite the opposite. The red carpet positions are pretty much the same. Essentially youre stuck in a tiny position waiting for somebody to walk by and pose and you try to make visual sense. You want to make a clean image, but you want to make an interesting one. Sometimes youre a little limited and they breeze past you.

Photo

Q.

Are you taking note of the clothes or are you just trying to make a sharp head-to-toe image?

A.

A little bit of both. There are some dresses that do really stand out. Now, being able to roam on the carpet, you can be a lot more discerning. You can follow a person or gown that looks really great. When youre in position you really have to get it while theyre there. Its like shooting theater or sports. It takes a lot of technical prowess  you really have to be on top of it. You have to capture that moment. Once theyre gone, theyre gone.

Q.

Half of Americas watching whats happening onstage. Whats it like backstage?

A.

Its really quite impressive and a little intimidating at first. There is so much activity going on in a crowded, confined space. Im fairly new to it and there are great photographers like Al Seib of The L.A. Times who have been shooting backstage for a long time. I learned a lot from them.

I use flash sparingly and shoot with fast primes because if youre shooting into a black hole it doesnt always look good and it creates a big disturbance. Ill raise my ISO as high as 6400, and work with the light thats there.

There are all the stagehands and different sets coming in and moving out at a very fast pace. And you have to stay out of the way of the performers, musicians, presenters and stage managers. You dont want to interfere with their flow but you still want to get your pictures. So its kind of an intricate dance, knowing when to step in  and knowing when to step out.

Q.

What have been your most memorable Oscar moments?

A.

Backstage, when Lupita Nyongo won, she had a big smile on her face and then she came out and she was just so quiet (Slide 10). She just stood there like she was just trying to take it all in, but it was just such a quiet moment. I mean, theres so much excitement and activity going on all the time, and I was just there, shooting, and it was dark.

Q.

As photographers we see so many famous people, presidents and stars, that we have been somewhat inoculated against being impressed. And then every once in a while theres someone youre impressed by.

A.

The most obvious pictures are of the famous people onstage. But I have to remind myself to resist the urge to blast away when I see a familiar face and to look for something that is interesting in that moment, even if its an expression or a gesture.

In some ways its like shooting politics. I went to Nevada for the caucuses, stayed for a week and flew back on Wednesday to go straight from the airport to the Oscars venue for the first walk-through. So I went from one American ritual to another.

Photo

Q.

How are they similar and how are they different?

A.

Well, there are the obvious differences: One group of people is dressed much more elegantly than the other.

The similarities are that these are rituals the American public feels that it has a vested interest in. And that dominate our television screens and social media. People can get very passionate about entertainment and politics.

Q.

Theyre both theater.

A.

The challenging part of both is finding the real human moments in between the staged moments  finding something that looks different from what everybody else is shooting. I mean not only the angles, but also the little off-moments. Like the workers who are behind the scenes carrying the big Oscar statues around.

Q.

Did you watch the Oscars when you were growing up?

A.

Absolutely.

I love movies. The town I grew up in  a small suburb east of L.A.  had a drive-in that played all the first run movies. I saw all the movies of the 70s there with my parents: The Godfather, The Exorcist, Jaws, even Carnal Knowledge. We went to the movies every single week. That was a big part of my life growing up. I always watched the Academy Awards. The Oscars were a special occasion when I could stay up late and watch the show with my parents. I never dreamt that I would get so close to the actual awards ceremony.

Q.

So I wonder whether the 8-year-old Monica, what she would have thought about the fact that you are now backstage.

A.

Actually the 40-something Monica would be pretty impressed, after all the years of shooting from all the other positions.

I remember watching in the living room with the family. I remember the streaker one year, and when Marlon Brando, sent the Native American woman (Sacheen) Littlefeather to decline his award. I remember Jane Fonda. Its a reflection of society and the times.

Thats whats going on this year, too. I remember the palpable elation when Denzel Washington and Halle Berry won the Best Actor and Best Actress awards the same year, in 2002.

So its interesting to see the controversy going on now and how different people are responding to it. As gilded and removed as it is from reality, the Oscars cant avoid being a reflection of our society as well.

Sam Sifton emails readers of Cooking five days a week to talk about food and suggest recipes. That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here.

Good morning. Brett Anderson is the restaurant critic for The Times-Picayune of New Orleans, but this week hes on the cover of our Food section with a paean to pot roast, a dish of his Midwestern youth that he says is due for a mass reappraisal. Bretts recipe for the pot roast is adapted from one that the Minneapolis chef Gavin Kaysen serves at his Spoon and Stable restaurant, and we hope youll find it a must-make for coming days.

We feel the same way about Martha Rose Shulmans new recipe for roasted vegetable bibimbap, adapted from Lukas Volgers new book, Bowl  and about Pierre Franeys classic recipe for sauteed salmon with leeks and tomatoes as well.

But today is Wednesday, the center of the workweek, the evening on which we often dont cook with a recipe, but with a narrative no-recipe recipe instead.

Todays comes from Julia Moskin. Scatter a bunch of sliced onions and shallots across the oiled bottom of a large roasting pan, then put a bunch of chicken thighs on top of them, skin side up. Season it all with salt and pepper and then slide the pan into a hot oven to roast until the chicken is crisp and cooked through. Mix the onions around below the chicken every so often and add wine or stock if they are browning too fast. Meanwhile, make some croutons from good chewy bread, toasting them until golden in a pan or in the oven. They can be sliced or torn up  no matter. Put the croutons on a warm platter, place the chicken on top, then dump the contents of the roasting pan over everything. Serve with green salad. Boy howdy.

Those looking for an actual recipe to cook tonight can turn to Cooking. We like miso chicken in the middle of the week, with rice and baby bok choy. Also: a baked potato with crab, jalapeno and mint, which is easier to make on a Wednesday than its ingredients suggest, and is awesomely delicious to boot. Maybe vegetarian mapo tofu? Spaghetti carbonara? A big Persian salad by way of Los Angeles? So many choices!

Save the recipes youre interested in cooking to your recipe box, so you can track them down later, like in the supermarket when youre looking for pecorino Romano and pancetta. And when youve cooked them? Rate the recipes. Leave notes on them. Share them with family and friends.

NEWARK  Elevated levels of lead caused officials in New Jerseys largest school district on Wednesday to shut off water fountains at 30 school buildings until more tests could be conducted, officials said.

The district, Newark Public Schools, told the State Department of Environmental Protection on Monday that annual testing found concentrations ranging from undetected to above the departments action level for lead, which is 15 parts per billion. That level requires additional testing, monitoring and remediation.

The department, which requested test results from previous years to perform a complete analysis, said in a statement that no building had more than four samples above the action level.

The department also said lead had not been found in the citys water supply. In the vast majority of cases where lead is found in drinking water, it enters through the water delivery system itself when it leaches from either lead pipes, household fixtures containing lead or lead solder, the department said.

Notices have been posted and bottled water and water coolers delivered to the buildings.

Lead in drinking water has drawn increased attention recently because of the crisis in Flint, Mich., which began after the city switched from the Detroit water system to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure in 2014. Lead from aging pipes leached into the drinking water because it was not treated with anticorrosion chemicals.

Lead in school water is a longstanding issue in the United States and has been a focus of federal and local regulators.

I understand in the Flint environment that any sign of elevation is going to make everyone go haywire, but here, the water system in Newark is still safe, its still drinkable, the citys mayor, Ras J. Baraka, said at a news conference. Mayor Baraka also asked for cases of water to be donated to the schools.

Parents should have no concerns about their childrens water and food consumption at school, the environmental department said, because the act of drinking water is usually not associated with elevated levels of lead in the blood on its own. It is the buildup of lead from all sources over time that determines whether harmful health effects will occur, the agency said.

Concerned parents can have their children tested for lead at Newarks Department of Health and Community Wellness.

The state chapter of the Sierra Club, an environmental group, called for more testing and pipe replacement.

New Jersey cities have old, outdated pipes in our streets and homes, which can mean even higher levels of lead in our water, Jeff Tittel, the groups director, said. Many of our water systems go back to the Victorian era, and even homes built in the 30s and 40s have pipes made with lead solder.

The Newark school system has 35,054 students in 66 schools.",[]

Donald Trump once had you physically removed from a news conference for asking questions about his proposed immigration policies. Now hes the front-runner for the Republican nomination. The only other time that has happened to me was with Fidel Castro in Guadalajara, Mexico.









As a member of the Spanish-speaking media, do you blame the mainstream media for Trumps rise? I hoped he would have been asked harder questions. How is he going to deport 11 million people in two years? That would require more than 30 jumbo-jet flights every day. How is he going to build a 1,900-mile wall? It will cost at least $20 billion. I spoke with former President Vicente Fox, and he clearly told me: Mexico is not going to pay for that wall.

I think white voters cant really imagine what its like to be the target of the sort of language that Trump uses when talking about illegal immigrants. Do Latino voters feel it more personally? Yes. President Obama has deported more than two million undocumented immigrants in seven years, more than any other U.S. president. Trump is talking about deporting 11 million. Ted Cruz said he wants to deport 12 million. For us, immigration is not something abstract. It is personal. Very, very personal.

How strong is the voting bloc? Do you think theres really a Latino firewall that could prevent a Trump presidency? Absolutely. Trump seems to think he can win the White House with only the white vote. I believe that the only way to win the White House is with the Latino vote. If the Republican candidate cannot get 33 percent of it, he cannot win the White House.

Do you think a Trump nomination could be energizing, in a way, to Latino voters? Young Latinos have been telling me that they want to register to vote because of Donald Trump. Not because they want to vote for him, but because they want to vote against him.

What about the 16 percent of Latino voters who support Donald Trump? Who do you think they are? I think these are Latinos who at some point in their lives decided to turn their backs on other immigrants. There used to be a tradition within the Hispanic community that regardless of your political party, you would support undocumented immigrants. That ended with Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.

Rubio and Cruzs families came from Cuba, whereas the bulk of illegal immigrants who are here are from Mexico and Central America. Do you think their heritage has anything to do with their politics? What Ill say is that Cuban-Americans dont have to deal with the same immigration issues as other nationalities because of the wet feet, dry feet policy. For Cubans, one year after you touch United States territory, you can become a legal resident.

He refused to talk to the families of the 43 students who disappeared in Ayotzinapa. It was a different pope from the one we saw here in the United States.

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Padma Lakshmi Opens Up About Rushdie in Memoir,['Christine Hauser'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Padma Lakshmi, the cookbook author and reality television star, has a signature repertoire as host of Top Chef on Bravo. It plays out at key moments in the competition, when anxious chefs stand opposite her as she tastes their dishes, their faces scrutinizing hers for some clue about what she is thinking.









She chews silently and then puts down her utensils, often without a flicker of expression. Thank you, she finally says, before turning away gracefully and moving on to the next contestant.

Part of the appeal of the moment is that Ms. Lakshmi, 45, leaves so much unsaid.

Not so in her new book, Love, Loss and What We Ate, which was released on Tuesday. In the 324-page memoir, Ms. Lakshmi opens a window into her life, weaving together stories from her childhood, her love affairs and her work through the lens of the culinary experiences that eventually shaped her fame. The book appears to spare little, delving deeply into personal details about uncertainty over paternity during her pregnancy, the pain of a custody case and her efforts to overcome the insecurity she felt being Indian.

I am going to own my history, she said in an interview on the Today show on NBC.

Ms. Lakshmi particularly highlights her high-profile relationship with the author Salman Rushdie, which was overshadowed by a fatwa, or religious edict, that had been issued in 1989 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Irans former supreme leader. It called for Mr. Rushdie to be put to death for his supposedly blasphemous book The Satanic Verses.

The two met at a party in New York in 1999, when he was married and she was an aspiring model and actress. They shared a high-profile love affair, and then a marriage. But health and professional tensions frayed their relationship.

Ms. Lakshmi suffered from endometriosis, a painful uterine disorder in which tissue grows outside the organ. The struggles of dealing with it  she had extensive surgery  upended their sex life and contributed to the demise of their marriage, she writes. Ms. Lakshmi said Mr. Rushdie at one point called her a bad investment and was insensitive to her medical condition even as she tried to recuperate.

She wrote that he believed she was using her ailment to justify not having sex with him. Deciding she was better off alone, she said, I was free to wallow in my malaise, and nurse myself without seeing the disappointment in his face.

Ms. Lakshmi said in an interview with People magazine that she told Mr. Rushdie that she was writing about their marriage. And he said, You have the right to tell your side of the story as you see it, Ms. Lakshmi said.

Photo

Mr. Rushdie has also written about their relationship in his 2012 memoir Joseph Anton, which is told in the third person and derives its title from the security code name that he used as he lived in the shadow of the fatwa. In the book he refers to Ms. Lakshmi as his Illusion, and he describes her as irrational, vapid and vain.

Her feelings for him  he would learn  were real, but intermittent, he wrote. She was ambitious in a way that often obliterated feeling. They would have a sort of life together  eight years from first meeting to final divorce, not a negligible length of time  and in the end, inevitably, she broke his heart as he had broken Elizabeths.

He also suggested that she was competitive with him and thought he was blocking her light.

She didnt like playing second fiddle.

But Ms. Lakshmi leavens dark memories of Mr. Rushdie with bright ones, reflecting in her memoir on the love and the passion the couple shared in their eight years together courting and as a married couple.

She said the book initially started out to be one about healthy eating, but then it broadened into a narrative of a life that bridged cultures.

Ms. Lakshmi was born in India and spent some of her childhood years in the southern city of Madras, which she says was the starting point for the culture and chemistry of food that eventually formed the backdrop to her life. She describes knocking tamarind pods out of trees to be used for cooking, watching the white shavings fall from her grandmothers wood coconut grater and inhaling the scent of frying mustard seeds.

The vivid flavors I experienced there will forever be the standard to which I hold any food I eat today, she writes.

Her memories in the book are interspersed with recipes  yogurt rice; kumquat and ginger chutney; and kichidi, a rice and lentil porridge.

She immigrated to the United States as a child, and said she struggled with self-confidence as she tried to come to terms with her identity, to overcome a brown girls self-loathing and to fit in.

It took years for this internalized self-loathing to fade, she writes.

Ms. Lakshmi pursued modeling and acting (she appeared in the Mariah Carey bomb Glitter, from 2001) in Los Angeles. Years in Paris and in Italy contributed to her personal growth through culinary and sexual adventures.

Ms. Lakshmi said that after her marriage ended, in 2007, she struck up relationships with Adam Dell, a venture capitalist, and Theodore J. Forstmann, a colorful financier and philanthropist several decades her senior who she said taught her unconditional love.

When she discovered she was pregnant, in 2009, a paternity test later established Mr. Dell as the father of the girl, Krishna. A contentious custody case played out in the media, but she said she and the girls father reached a rapport in their parenting.

Ms. Lakshmi went on to become a co-founder of the Endometriosis Foundation of America. For all her struggles, she writes, cooking staked out emotional markers in her life. It bolstered her confidence when, in the presence of Mr. Rushdies friends, it allowed her to keep her hands busy, to mask her insecurities.

It provided a wholesome distraction. Alone in an empty new temporary home after their split, Ms. Lakshmi decided to whip up a chutney to revive her spirits.

Through the simple ritual of cooking, she writes, I could lift myself, at least gastronomically, from the gray.",[]

If you dont mind spending more on shipping, you may want to order from Tot Brill, an artist living in East London, who buys fine vintage linens which she, too, re-embroiders. A former theatrical designer with art-school training, Ms. Brill sells antique table linens via her online shop, Brill and Ben.

Whether Ms. Brill embroiders insects, Italian graffiti or Fornasetti-like faces, her sales on Etsy are strongest in New York and California. Though no two sets are alike, her trompe loeil wine stains series are the most popular. She embroiders realistic-looking wine stains on her napkins and table clothes, with different specific threads for different grapes (claret, malbec, Beaujolais and shiraz-colored stains).

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,New Procedure Allows Kidney Transplants From Any Donor,['Gina Kolata'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In the anguishing wait for a new kidney, tens of thousands of patients on waiting lists may never find a match because their immune systems will reject almost any transplanted organ. Now, in a large national study that experts are calling revolutionary, researchers have found a way to get them the desperately needed procedure.









In the new study, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, doctors successfully altered patients immune systems to allow them to accept kidneys from incompatible donors. Significantly more of those patients were still alive after eight years than patients who had remained on waiting lists or received a kidney transplanted from a deceased donor.

The method, known as desensitization, has the potential to save many lives, said Dr. Jeffery Berns, a kidney specialist at the University of Pennsylvanias Perelman School of Medicine and the president of the National Kidney Foundation.

It could slash the wait times for thousands of people and for some, like Clint Smith, a 56-year-old lawyer in New Orleans, mean the difference between receiving a transplant and spending the rest of their lives on dialysis.

Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Science Times Newsletter Every week, we'll bring you stories that capture the wonders of the human body, nature and the cosmos.

The procedure, Mr. Smith said, changed my life.

Researchers estimate about half of the 100,000 people in the United States on waiting lists for a kidney transplant have antibodies that will attack a transplanted organ, and about 20 percent are so sensitive that finding a compatible organ is all but impossible. In addition, said Dr. Dorry Segev, the lead author of the new study and a transplant surgeon at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, an unknown number of people with kidney failure simply give up on the waiting lists after learning that their bodies would reject just about any organ. Instead, they resign themselves to dialysis, a difficult and draining procedure that can pretty much take over a persons life.

Desensitization involves first filtering the antibodies out of a patients blood. The patient is then given an infusion of other antibodies to provide some protection while the immune system regenerates its own antibodies. For some reason  exactly why is not known  the persons regenerated antibodies are less likely to attack the new organ, Dr. Segev said. But if the persons regenerated natural antibodies are still a concern, the patient is treated with drugs that destroy any white blood cells that might make antibodies that would attack the new kidney.

The process is expensive, costing $30,000, and uses drugs not approved for this purpose. The transplant costs about $100,000. But kidney specialists argue that desensitization is cheaper in the long run than dialysis, which costs $70,000 a year for life.

Although by far the biggest use of desensitization would be for kidney transplants, the process might be suitable for living-donor transplants of livers and lungs, researchers said. The liver is less sensitive to antibodies so there is less need for desensitization, but its certainly possible if there are known incompatibilities, Dr. Segev said. With lungs, he said, desensitization is theoretically possible, although he said he was not aware of anyone doing it yet.

In the new study, 1,025 patients at 22 medical centers who had an incompatible donor were compared to an equal number of patients who remained on waiting lists for an organ or who had an organ from a deceased but compatible donor. After eight years, 76.5 percent of those who received an incompatible kidney were still alive, compared with 62.9 percent who remained on the waiting list or received a deceased donor kidney and 43.9 percent who remained on the waiting list but never got a transplant.

The desensitization procedure takes time  for some patients as long as two weeks  and is performed before the transplant operation, so patients must have a living donor. It is not known how many have someone willing to donate a kidney, but doctors say they often see situations in which a relative or even a friend is willing to donate but is incompatible.

Often patients are told that their living donor is incompatible, so they are stuck on waiting lists, for a deceased donor, Dr. Segev said.

In recent years, an option called a kidney exchange has helped some in this situation. Patients who have incompatible living donors can swap donors with someone whose donor may be compatible with them. Often, there are chains of patient-donor pairs leading to a compatible organ swap.

That process can be successful, said Dr. Krista L. Lentine, the medical director of the living donation program at the Saint Louis Center for Transplantation, but patients often still cannot find a compatible organ because they have antibodies that would reject almost every kidney. In those cases, desensitization may be the only realistic option for receiving a transplant, said Dr. Lentine, who was not involved with the study.

Dr. Jeffrey Campsen, a transplant surgeon at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center who also was not a study investigator, said his group focused on exchanges and had been fairly successful. But he also comes across patients whose donors do not want to participate. There is a hurdle if the donor and patient have an emotional bond, he said.

The new data showing the success of desensitization lets people get behind it, Dr. Campsen said, adding, I do think it is something we would consider.

Mr. Smith, the New Orleans patient who went through desensitization, had progressive kidney disease that slowly scarred his kidneys until, in 2004, they stopped functioning. His sister-in-law, Allison Sutton, donated a kidney to him, and he had a transplant, but after six and a half years, it failed. He went on dialysis, spending four days a week hooked up to dialysis machines for hours. It was keeping him alive, he told his friends, but it was not a life.

Then a nurse suggested that he ask Johns Hopkins about its desensitization study. I was like, whatever I could do, he said. He discovered that he qualified for the study. But he needed a donor.

One day, Mrs. Smith was talking on the phone to a college friend, Angela Watkins, who lives in Augusta, Ga., and mentioned that Mr. Smith was praying for a donor. Mrs. Watkinss husband, David Watkins, a judge in state court, had been friends with Mr. Smith in college and the two wives, also college friends, had kept in touch over the years.

Mrs. Watkins told her husband about the conversation, and they asked themselves if they should offer to donate.

We talked and researched and prayed, Judge Watkins said. Finally, he said, they came to a conclusion. We have a moral obligation to at least see if we would qualify. And he thought that he should be the one to go first. If he did not qualify, his wife could be tested.

Mr. Smith warned his old friend that donating was an enormous undertaking. He said, You cant grasp what you are doing. I heard him but it didnt register, Judge Watkins said. I told him, I have something you need, so whats the big deal? 

Of course, it was a big deal. Although Judge Watkins had prepared by getting himself in top physical shape, it still took about six months to recover from the operation.

That was four years ago, and Mr. Smiths new kidney is still functioning and he is back to his active life, forever grateful to his friend.

Every night. he says, during my nightly prayers with my wife, I thank God for bringing David and Allison to me and for giving me the gift of life.

But for David giving me this gift, I would still be in that dialysis chair.",[]

Can the government help Donald Trumps supporters?









The political system is in shock over the insurrection of the white working class, which has flocked to Mr. Trumps candidacy.

On the wrong side of globalization and technological change, no longer at home in an increasingly multiethnic America, these voters have eagerly embraced his simple proposal to make things better: walls against the imports and the people they believe have robbed them of a shot at prosperity.

That strategy, if it amounts to that, would visit a disaster of epic proportions upon the world economy. It harks back to the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of the 1930s, which pushed the world into a tit-for-tat trade war in which everybody raised their barriers against everybody elses imports, entrenching the Depression.

As Lawrence H. Summers, Treasury secretary under President Clinton and former chief economic adviser to President Obama, warned, Even the possibility of Trump becoming president is dangerous.

But the raw anxiety of his supporters remains unaddressed.

It is not obvious how to restore the America Mr. Trumps legions pine for. The nations diversity would not go into reverse regardless of how high he built his wall along the nations southern border.

Their economic discontent  born of the mismatch between expectations based on an earlier America, where plenty of blue-collar jobs offered a decent standard of living, and the more cutthroat reality they face today  can seem intractable, too.

Its not clear what public policy can do for someone who was expecting his income to grow from $50,000 to $80,000 but instead saw it stagnate at $50,000, said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist.

Stumped by the economys inability to deliver more decent jobs, policy makers are struggling to come up with solutions.

The routine promise that economic growth will automatically spread prosperity has proved empty, belied by the long slide in the real earnings of all but the best-paid workers.

Any long-term strategy to improve workers lot, of course, must include improving their skills. But just kicking the challenge down the road under the fuzzy prescription that all America needs is better education and training  a favorite of policy makers and their economic advisers  is no longer acceptable for workers who have suffered multiple rounds of dislocation over several decades.

Stepping into the vacuum, the technologically endowed of Silicon Valley are talking about a future that bypasses the labor market entirely. They are offering up a universal basic income  financed by taxing rich capitalists and an elite corps of computer programmers tasked with making sure the robots perform meticulously  as the tool to satisfy peoples basic needs without any work involved. (Its the subject of an online conversation between me and my fellow columnist Farhad Manjoo.)

But before we enter the world of science fiction, its worth looking at some policies that could improve jobs for most American workers, in the here and now.

For all its strengths, the American job market has some troubling features. Unemployment might be lower than in many other industrialized nations, but the employment rate for prime-age workers has been on a downward trend for 15 years.

Whats more, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the research arm for the most advanced industrialized nations, the United States suffers the highest incidence of low pay among its members. A quarter of workers earn less than two-thirds of the median wage.

Americans also suffer from the steepest earnings inequality and limited income mobility. Workers who start with low wages more often get stuck with them for a very long time. And for American men, mobility has declined over time.

Instead of enhancing these trends, as it now does, government policy could push back. As Professor Katz noted, over the last few decades, about 13 percent of the nations gross domestic product was redistributed to the top 1 percent from the rest of the population. It is not crazy to suggest, he said, that some percentage of that could be shared with a broader group.

The earned-income tax credit  a wage subsidy for low-income workers that has become the nations most powerful antipoverty tool  could be expanded to include more workers and phase out at higher incomes. Combined with a higher minimum wage, it could be calibrated to ensure that workers earnings totaled, say, at least $15 an hour.

Employers could be subsidized, too, to hire workers from problematic populations, including the long-term unemployed. The government could set itself up as an employer of last resort.

The Obama administration has been quietly deploying a screwdriver or two from this tool kit. New rules proposed by the White House last year would make millions of workers eligible for overtime pay.

The White House also supports increasing the earned-income tax credit for adults without children; so does Speaker Paul Ryan, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives.

In this years State of the Union address, President Obama proposed wage insurance, to protect workers who lost their jobs and had to take new ones for less money. He said that Washington should cover half the difference in pay, up to $10,000 over a two-year period.

These proposals represent only a start. They are far from full solutions for the struggling working class.

Yet modest though they may be, they are still highly controversial. Indeed, the most critical question is whether politicians divided by an ideological gulf could agree on any effective labor market strategy.

The idea of direct government employment  a once common practice  has been anathema on the American right since the late 1970s. Strengthening American workers collective bargaining power, among the weakest in the rich industrialized world, seems equally fanciful.

Research by Suzanne Mettler and Julianna Koch from Cornell University underscores how any plan to help Mr. Trumps beleaguered supporters may end up entangled in ideological knots. They found that on closer inspection, many Americans who deny ever benefiting from a government social program actually received far more public support than they realized. And the most strenuous denials come from conservative Republicans.

Many citizens of red states and members of the struggling working class  supporters of Mr. Trump, not to mention Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida  oppose programs to benefit poor people. Even if the poor people these programs would help is them.",[]

As Volkswagen continues to deal with the fallout from its emissions scandal, the company announced on Wednesday that Michael Horn, the head of its American operations, was stepping down.

The decision, which the company said was reached by mutual agreement, is effective immediately. In the interim, Mr. Horn will be replaced by Hinrich J. Woebcken, who was recently named the new head of the North American region and chairman of Volkswagen Group of America.

The departure is the latest in a string of executive changes at Volkswagen in the wake of its emissions scandal. Volkswagen acknowledged last year that its diesel cars did not meet emissions standards in the United States and used a so-called cheat device to produce fake emissions during testing.

Mr. Horn, 54, who has worked for more than 25 years at Volkswagen, took the top job in North America in January 2014. Before that, he was the companys global head of after sales.

nytimes.com,2016-02-25 00:00:00,Review: Pandemic Explains How to Host the Perfect Pathogen Party,['Jennifer Senior'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Sometimes, the best approach to a book about deadly pathogens is to read it in a slightly dissociated state  it allows you to marvel at the cunning adaptability of microbial life, rather than contemplate the far creepier possibility of your own doom. In her introduction to Pandemic: Tracking Contagions, From Cholera to Ebola and Beyond, Sonia Shah, a science writer whose previous books include The Fever and The Body Hunters, does not seek shelter in euphemisms or shy away from scary numbers. Instead, she cites a study in which 90 percent of epidemiologists say they believe a global pandemic will sicken one billion and kill up to 165 million within the next two generations.









Looking closely at the source of this statistic  a paper by the epidemiologist Larry Brilliant and three colleagues  Im not convinced that things are quite so dire. (The number of epidemiologists he surveyed is actually quite small.) But theres no doubt that new forms of pestilence are appearing in the world with an almost metronomic regularity and that old ones are reappearing in new places, the Zika virus being only the most recent example.

And pandemics are never pretty. Here is Ms. Shahs description of what happened to Parisians when they were infected with cholera in 1832:

Fluid blood turned tarry, clotting in the blood stream. Muscles, deprived of oxygen, shuddered so violently that they sometimes tore. As the organs collapsed in turn, victims fell into acute shock, all the while fully conscious and expelling massive amounts of liquid stool.

The good news is that cholera made quick work of its victims. It was said that someone with cholera could feel perfectly fine at dinner and expire by dessert.

Yet once you get past the unfriendly statistics of the books introduction, and once you get past the chilling biology lesson of Chapter 1  which explains how these sneaky organisms jump from one species to the next  Pandemic is far less terrifying, perhaps because errant microbes are only one component of what makes a pandemic a pandemic. Theyre the known unknowns, as Donald R. Rumsfeld might put it. The other components are known knowns, which by definition are at least familiar: filth, political corruption, increasing population density and mobility.

Ms. Shah uses cholera, one of the most obdurate of pandemics, as a paradigm to explain how new deadly pathogens both emerge and circulate. If you already know something about cholera  if youve read Steven Johnsons excellent The Ghost Map, say  you may find yourself disappointed; she covers, inevitably, some of the same ground.

But this structuring conceit is also useful for simplifying an unwieldy topic. A discussion about the East India Companys expansion into the wetlands in the Bay of Bengal, which exposed many Indian workers to the tiny crustaceans that carry vibrio cholera, becomes the perfect segue to discuss how modern deforestation in Guinea encouraged more interaction between people and fruit bats, which are thought to carry Ebola.

As wetlands were paved over and forests were felled, different species came into novel, prolonged contact with each other, she explains. From a pandemics point of view, the more mingling among species the better.

For those who dont know much about the history of cholera, Ms. Shahs dense, compact book is a decent primer, explaining how new forms of transportation encouraged the spread of this waterborne disease, as did rising urban density, as did political corruption. (It was Aaron Burr who thwarted an attempt to bring clean water from the Bronx River into New York City  as if this man needed any more negative publicity.)

Perhaps my favorite chapter, though, is about waste  or, as Ms. Shah puts it, the rising tide of feculence. Nothing seems to awaken the muse in Ms. Shah like excreta, the ideal delivery system for all kinds of diseases. In each gram is up to one billion viral particles; yet somehow, Christianity shunned water-based rituals for centuries. Martin Luther went so far as to eat a spoonful of his own feces every day.

In 19th-century New York City, sanitation was extravagantly grim. By 1820, Ms. Shah writes, privies and cesspools covered one-twelfth of the city. Human and horse waste covered the streets and seeped into the groundwater; it was sometimes sold as fertilizer for sewage farming in Brooklyn and Queens.

The same conditions that drove cholera  overcrowding, corruption, poor hygiene, expanded transportation  are what drive pandemics today.

In the age of cholera, shipping trade helped spread disease. Today, its air travel  if you want to understand the helter-skelter distribution of flu outbreaks, simply consult a map of airline routes. In the age of cholera, politicians obfuscated and denied their way through the epidemic; today, the World Health Organization, the globes dedicated first responder, is so deprived of public funding that its private donors disproportionately control the agenda  which often has nothing to do with controlling pandemics.

Today overcrowding is not just in cities, but on farms, which have gotten denser and dirtier. In the United States, theyve become breeding grounds for E. coli; in China, poultry farms have grown so large theyve created many opportunities for interactions with wild waterfowl, which can lead to new strains of the flu.

Complicating matters is climate change. Warmer waters have washed cholera-rich surf into Alaska and Chile and Iceland. A cold winter altered the migration patterns of wild swans in 2006, which meant they ferried a new flu into more than 20 countries in Europe; an unseasonably warm New York winter in 1999 contributed to the West Nile outbreak.

To me, however, the most provocative  and sci-fi  part of Ms. Shahs book is not about the ways humans have altered the evolution of pandemics. Its about the ways pandemics have altered the evolution of humans. Pathogens, Ms. Shah explains, have always been the bodys antagonists. Every time we adapt to combat one, it counter-adapts to harm us back.

It is for this reason, she writes, that some evolutionary biologists believe weve evolved to have sex, rather than to clone ourselves  by diversifying the gene pool, were confounding pathogens, making it harder for them to keep up with our ever-shuffling genetic variations.

Ms. Shah ends her book on both a hopeful and cautious note. The cautious note is intriguing: Ms. Shah suggests that the real danger with pandemics is that humans often start to treat them as mere inconveniences, rather than crises (which is how many Africans treat malaria and many Americans treat the flu). As for the optimistic note: I wasnt buying it. She makes a case for building a worldwide, highly attuned surveillance system. A network of clinics, she writes, staffed with health care workers trained to recognize and report new pathogens, could do the trick.

No doubt it would. But, politically speaking, achieving this goal is about as likely as eradicating pathogens themselves. Now that is scary.",[]

Eat your soup. Its good food, my paternal grandmother, Bubbe Mary, would say.

Eat your soup. Its good food, my dad would playfully tell me, as he reminisced over the wonderful Jewish dinners his mom used to cook for him when he was a boy.

Split pea soup, poppy seed challah with six strands, braised brisket and potato kugel were a frequent occurrence.

Your Bubbe loved to fatten me up even when the doctors would shame her for how obese I was, he said. But Bubbe was proud that her job as a fluffer in the garment district could provide me with such extravagance. Every dairy meal had butter, milk and cheese, and Bubbe made sure there was plenty for seconds and thirds.

I giggled remembering some of the holiday meals at Bubbes, and how I hardly had a chance to swallow one thing before my plate was filled again.

Just a little more, she always encouraged. Food is meant to be eaten, not wasted, shed say, squeezing my cheeks until they were bright red and stung with pain. Think of all the hungry children in the world.

With each bite I took, Bubbe would profess her love. Shayna maideleh! Beautiful girl! Who loves you the most in the world? she would say, as she checked that I polished off every last crumb on my plate.

But other than holidays, we did not visit Bubbe much. My dad was a rising star in the ad industry  he was an international creative director at the ad agency McCann Erickson, but Bubbe was confused about what he did for a living and was disappointed that he did not have a regular job like his brother Melvin, who was an accountant. Even before I knew what an accountant was, I knew my dads job was super-fun as he got to work with Tony the Tiger and the Pillsbury Doughboy. But Bubbe was never impressed: A Jewish boy should be a doctor or a lawyer!

My dad felt that if they were not talking about food, the room was silent, so he made jokes  most of which Bubbe did not understand  to break the silence. Even when my dad was a child, he did things that she did not understand, like creating satirical comic books, or questioning why they had two different sets of dishes, or turning the lights on and off on Shabbat when she strictly forbid it.

As my dad showed me how to slice the mushrooms for the soup, he talked about his new account: Campbells. The current campaign, Mm! Mm! Good! was no longer generating enough sales, and it was my dads job to help create a slogan that would sell more soup.

While we stirred in the barley and shredded the meat for the broth, my dad shared the story of how when he was in the sixth grade, he got beaten up by a bunch of bullies who jumped him from behind, hitting him with lead pipes until he was unconscious.

Fat mamas boy! Fat mamas boy! they taunted. The beating was so bad that he spent a week in a coma, and the doctors didnt know if he would live or die.

Helpless, my bubbe cooked all day and all night, praying for his recovery. She hoped the smells of her famous mushroom barley soup, which she schlepped to the hospital, would revive him. When my dad awoke, Bubbe was standing there with a big pot, a bowl and a ladle  fully believing in the healing powers of her thick broth, made with beef bones, beef chuck and tomato paste.

My bubbe cooked all through the night when my dad was in the hospital, showering him with cinnamon raisin rugelach, sponge cake with an orange glaze, and mandel bread with big chocolate chips  feeding him obsessively, but never telling him she loved him.

My dad wanted to feel comforted by all the amazing food she had worked so hard to prepare, but he felt angry. He wanted to be thin. He wanted to be popular. He wanted to have self-confidence. The very food, which brought him such extreme pleasure, caused him to be bigger than the other kids, leading to ridicule and worse, landing him in the hospital.

When my dad dieted, he felt as if he was betraying my grandmother and dissolving the one bond they shared. Of course, as a child I didnt know any of this; I didnt understand the relationship between my father, my grandmother and food. I just knew that Bubbe Mary was a wonderful baker, and my dad missed her even though he would never say it.

As my dad served us each a warm bowl of mushroom barley soup with sweet parsnips and bay leaves, we looked at each other. Eat your soup. Its good food, we said in unison  imitating Bubbes Yiddish accent.

The next day when my dad came home, he smiled, announcing the new tag line and jingle for Campbells soup, Soup Is Good Food, inspired by my bubbes soup.

The soup that revived my dad when he was in a coma. The soup he taught me to cook. The soup that said I love you the way Bubbe showed her affections best  spoonful by spoonful.

Mushroom Barley Soup : This soup is made with nourishing bone broth and root vegetables.

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,The Enduring Curse of Caste,['Ananya Vajpeyi'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

NEW DELHI  Of the many protests to convulse public universities across India in recent weeks, the one held on Feb. 23, in which thousands of students, faculty and activists marched through central Delhi demanding Justice for Rohith, was the largest and perhaps the most palpably indignant.









A month before, Rohith Vemula, a 26-year-old Ph.D. student at the University of Hyderabad, in southern India, hanged himself from the ceiling fan in a friends hostel room. Mr. Vemula was raised by his single working mother, who is from a scheduled caste, the lowest rung of the hierarchical system that structures traditional Hindu society, and which used to be deemed untouchable until Indias independence in 1947. Mr. Vemula identified as Dalit, a word meaning crushed or ground down and refers to the oppression, often violent, suffered by scheduled castes over centuries of Indian history.

Mr. Vemula had secured admission to a prestigious graduate science program, as well as a highly competitive national research fellowship. He was a brilliant scholar and a popular and vociferous campus activist for the rights of disenfranchised communities. He killed himself because of relentless caste discrimination.

He left behind a searing suicide note: The value of a man was reduced to his immediate identity and nearest possibility. To a vote. To a number. To a thing. Never was a man treated as a mind.

Mr. Vemulas suicide  hardly a rarity among Dalits at Indias best universities  is emblematic of the problems of the countrys affirmative action program. Within a few years after independence, India had set aside for Dalits and other disadvantaged castes about 23 percent of government jobs and seats in public universities. Today, the reservations apply to many more groups and cover about 50 percent of such posts and seats. But numerical improvement does not an equal society make.

Dalit students still come from severe poverty. They lead de facto segregated lives on nominally diverse and inclusive campuses. They still face daunting disadvantages in the job market even after they graduate with degrees. The ability of reserved candidates is always suspect, regardless of their performance.

The gap between the high and the low castes, between so-called backward and forward communities, not only persists, it also manifests itself through ever-more subtle and complex forms of discrimination and violence. Being the beneficiary of reservations can itself be a stigma.

B.R. Ambedkar, a Dalit and an architect of Indias 1950 Constitution, warned the Constituent Assembly in 1949 that the political revolution inspired by Mohandas K. Gandhi, which had led to Indias freedom from British rule, must be accompanied by a social revolution upholding the ideals of fraternity and dignity for all.

Together with other progressive founders of the Indian Republic, Ambedkar helped make social, economic and political justice the first item of business in the statute books. The Constitution they drafted made it a punishable offense to treat anyone as untouchable, outlawed discrimination based on caste, and encouraged the state to pass measures correcting its effects. With that, the bare bones of affirmative action  the reservations, or quota, system  were in place.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Ambedkar believed that within a decade or two quotas would bring about the annihilation of caste and become unnecessary. But this was not to be. In the late 1970s the government set up the Mandal Commission to study which other groups, even if not among the lowest castes, might also be suffering from social, economic or educational deprivation. By the early 1990s, India had begun to expand reservations to include the so-called Other Backward Classes.

But today it is clear that even the Mandal reforms have failed to bring about Ambedkars dream of a genuinely equal society. Caste, instead of withering away as Indian democracy matures, has asserted itself in new ways.

Mr. Vemula viscerally understood this unhappy truth. Since August 2015, he had faced the hostility of university authorities for being politically engaged and unusually articulate. In just one semester, he had lost his hostel accommodation, his monthly stipend and access to the classroom.

For several nights leading up to his suicide, during the coldest stretch of the winter, he had camped on mattresses and blankets set outside the hostels gates. A few other students were with him, and they wryly referred to their makeshift arrangement as a Dalit ghetto.

Mr. Vemulas fault was not simply being a Dalit. He was also a leader in the Ambedkar Students Association, which actively campaigned to educate, agitate and organize students, following a rousing slogan from Ambedkar. The groups members discussed not only Dalit issues, but also other controversial matters: the death penalty; Kashmirs problematic relationship with the Indian union; communal violence against minorities, especially Muslims, in what is an officially secular nation.

Worse perhaps, Mr. Vemula had gained admission to the University of Hyderabad in the general, nonreserved category  meaning that his trajectory had not followed the standard script of marginality and exclusion. Politically aware and assertive youth like him face the brunt of double discrimination: Not only are they Dalit, but they refuse the victimhood expected of them.

Contrast that with groups that traditionally have been better off but increasingly are calling themselves victims in order to claim special protection. Castes like Jats in Haryana, Patidars in Gujarat, Marathas in Maharashtra and Kapus in Andhra Pradesh have been agitating recently, asking to benefit from reservations, even though they often are wealthy or own land.

India started opening up its economy at the same time that the Mandal recommendations were being debated. By the mid-2000s, overall prosperity increased, lifting many poor people into the middle class. But liberalization, along with urbanization, also created unforeseen types of inequality.

The so-called dominant castes agitating for reservations fall between two stools: the old model of social justice, meant principally for the weakest of the weak, and the gains brought on by the free market. The sociologist Satish Deshpande refers to them as the backward forwards.

My birth is my fatal accident, Mr. Vemula wrote in his suicide note. But his birth as a citizen of democratic India should have been a guarantee of dignity, opportunity and respect. He also wrote that he blamed no one. Yet there are culprits: his fellow Indians who have embraced democracy without understanding that its first principle is equality for all.",[]

PARIS  A skirt lifted above her ankle. A beauty mark painted on her cheek. A direct gaze. Sitting alone over a drink in a cafe.









These were some of the clues that a woman in 19th-century Paris might not be a person of standing but just might be a streetwalker.

Ambiguity about prostitutes in the public space is a central theme of Splendor and Misery: Images of Prostitution 1850-1910, which opens on Tuesday and runs through Jan. 17 at the Musee dOrsay here. Taking its title from Honore de Balzacs mid-19th-century Comedie Humaine novel The Splendors and Miseries of Courtesans, it is touted by the museum as the first major exhibition on the artistic representation of prostitution in Paris.

Paris during this period was a city in transformation. Its population of one million in 1850 almost doubled by 1870 as men and women abandoned the countryside for this capital. Traditional social structures and codes of behavior shattered. The rise of a wealthy urban class through trade and industry meant plenty of money to spend.

In this frenzied era of commerce, prostitution  already legal and considered a necessary evil  exploded.

Every major artist and writer (male, of course) explored the subject. Over the years, it was romanticized, exposed, caricatured and eventually condemned. Prostitution became so central to the artistic imagination that the poet Charles Baudelaire wrote in his personal journal: What is art? Prostitution.

Why was prostitution such a big theme for artists? said Richard Thomson, professor of fine art at the Edinburgh College of Art and a curator of the exhibition. There was the sexual aspect, of course. But there was another reason. The city was slippery. Everything was speeding up, becoming more commercial, more ambiguous, more of a spectacle. How can we be sure this person filled a certain role and not another? Who was who? Was she or wasnt she? These questions disturbed and fascinated artists.

In this show, the museum has brought together masterpieces by artists of the day, including Edgar Degas, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Edouard Manet, Edvard Munch, Vincent van Gogh and Pablo Picasso.

The artists explored only the world of female prostitution; male prostitution was treated as a homosexual act subject to criminal prosecution. However, the exhibition includes a small number of police reports and photographs of men together in sexually suggestive poses.

To illustrate the interaction between the artists representations of the prostitutes world and its harsh reality, the show has drawn on the vast collection of police records, photographs, periodicals and pornographic material from Frances national library.

There are also objects of the trade, including jetons (tokens) paid by clients to prostitutes in lieu of cash, which went directly to the bordellos madame; brothel guides for tourists; and business cards advertising ambiguous services. (One offered hygienic massages in a setting where English was spoken.)

One room of the show is dominated by the Armchair of Love, or Chair of Voluptousness, a brocade-upholstered contraption with a seat and bronze stirrups on the top and a place to recline below, to have relations with two women at once. It was built in the late-19th-century for the Prince of Wales and future King Edward VII, who visited Paris for pleasure.

The cornerstone of prostitution in the mid-19th-century was the maison close  closed house, or bordello, a controlled legal entity where women were registered with the police and subjected to regular medical examinations.

Several bordello paintings by Toulouse-Lautrec are here, the women depicted neither as victims nor femmes fatales, but as working women. In one, a woman lifts her dress for a medical inspection; in another, a nude woman pulls a black stocking over her knee.

As more women decided to work as independent contractors, the number of brothels declined. Women working in poor-paying jobs as florists and laundresses, for example, might supplement their incomes with part-time prostitution. In the streets, in cafes and bars, at the theater or the opera, it was often difficult to tell the honest women from those who sold their bodies.

In the opening room of the exhibition, for example, hangs the 1892 painting Sur le Boulevard (La Parisienne), by Louis Valtat, of a heavily made-up woman wearing flat black tie shoes and a long black boa. She is lifting her skirt several inches to reveal her ankle, a sign that she is a prostitute.

The exhibition also explores the world of courtesans, the top of the hierarchy. These were kept women who were often showered with jewels and elegant clothing and housed in luxuriously decorated mansions. (Cash payments were considered vulgar.)

A painting of Valtesse de la Bigne, one of Pariss most celebrated courtesans, portrays her in a ruffled white dress, holding a white umbrella, a half-smile on her face. There is nothing to suggest she sells herself. In a nearby display case, however, is her walking stick and a whip with six thin metal strands that can be neatly hidden inside.

One of the exhibitions centerpieces is Manets Olympia, the painting of his muse, the 17-year-old Victorine Meurent, posing as a reclining prostitute, with a gaze of independence and defiance that shocked the art world. Among the telltale signs of the profession: the orchid in her hair and the black cat at her side.

With the advent of photography came a new medium to represent prostitution. Photographers were prohibited from working inside brothels, so they recreated these scenes in their studios. The photographers and their subjects remained anonymous; the photos were sold illegally.

Behind heavy red velvet curtains are two small rooms off limits to those under 18. In them hang pornographic photographs of heterosexual and homosexual activity and women in various sexual poses.

A number of artists focused on the suffering of prostitutes. Picasso was allowed access to the Saint-Lazare prison, where prostitutes, many with syphilis, were locked up. He painted them in shades of blue, as sad Madonnas, with elongated bodies and sculpted faces.

Most jarring in the show are 1910-1912 photographs of women whose faces and bodies have been disfigured by syphilis.

The show ends with the moralistic portrayal of prostitution by early-20th-century artists. France was by then cursed with high rates of alcoholism and syphilis, and prostitutes came to be considered disease-carrying corrupters of men.

A dozen films about prostitutes are to be shown, including Luis Bunuels 1967 Belle de Jour, in which Catherine Deneuve plays a bored bourgeois housewife who becomes a high-class prostitute.

The issue of prostitution continues to perplex the French. The exhibition coincides with a protracted debate in the French Parliament about whether a prostitutes customers should be subject to prosecution, although prostitution is, and is likely to remain, legal here. Last spring, some prostitutes protested the bill in front of the National Assembly. One sign read: Youre sleeping with us. Youre voting against us.

Prostitution still retains the scent of the romantic. Among the corporate sponsors of the Musee dOrsay exhibition is the Maison Souquet, a boutique hotel in a former bordello in Pigalle, near the Moulin Rouge nightclub. It has kept the bordello decor, and each of its rooms is named after a famous Parisian courtesan.",[]
nytimes.com,2015-12-17 00:00:00,The Curators of a Homes Brooklyn Look,['Penelope Green'],"The stoops and sidewalks of Brooklyn Heights on this November afternoon were napped with gold  drifts of maple, oak and willow leaves  appropriate dressing for the gold coast neighborhood that was the citys first historic district. Its de facto caretaker, Robert Taffera, a mild-mannered contractor from Washington State, walked the fog-slick streets and pointed out his handiwork: nearly 40 houses that have been renovated by his company.









At an immaculate brownstone midblock, with rigorously landscaped window boxes, a wine cellar and a roof deck, he slipped off his shoes and padded through the soaring period parlor and modernist kitchen that is a signature of this millenniums version of the Brooklyn townhouse.

Mr. Taffera showed how the plaster walls had been gently roughed up after new wiring had been laid in, and how rotted pine floors on a second floor had been replaced with antique planks harvested from another site and carefully gouged to match their 165-year-old mates in the hall.

Continue reading the main story NYT Living Newsletter Get lifestyle news from the Style, Travel and Food sections, from the latest trends to news you can use.

Like many Taffera clients, the lawyer and publisher who live here prize 19th-century patina (or the illusion of it) as much as the complex 21st-century systems and flourishes  elevators, central air, wine cellars  installed by Mr. Taffera and his crew.

While the houses of brownstone Brooklyn have always been romantic money pits, said Ingrid Abramovitch, author of Restoring a House in the City, and require major bucks to keep them standing and safe, much less beautify them, the current wave of Brooklyn Heights settlers are focused on more than just preservation. They consider the energy efficiencies that come from passive house technology, for example, and they have the means to go wide and deep.

Among this cohort  the anti-masters of the universe, as Tom Scheerer, the interior designer of one Taffera-renovated house on Willow Street, described a financier client who favors Birkenstocks over Oxfords (and Brooklyn over Greenwich, Conn., or Park Avenue)  there is an interest in using more house than ever before. Residents dig down to create wine cellars, and build up to fabricate roof decks. Now, as Mr. Taffera pointed out in a dizzying tour, a Taffera townhouse tends to have a view of Manhattan. Elevators are standard fare, not an easy flourish to shoehorn into a historic house.

None of this comes cheap. A Taffera renovation may require many millions of dollars, clients say, but it will come in on time and on budget, an approach that inverts the natural order of the contractor-client relationship, which can follow the path of some marriages: a delirious courtship, then a scorched-earth divorce.

I know its weird: How can you be friends with your contractor? said Joanne Witty, a longtime client and lapsed lawyer, as she called herself. Nobody finishes a job liking their contractor.

On this afternoon, Eric Taffera, Roberts younger brother, was shooting texts back and forth with Amy Larocca, fashion director of New York Magazine, who was giving him advice about preschools for his son. After the renovation of their Cobble Hill townhouse last year, she and her husband, Will Frears, a theater director, now count themselves as part of a network of Taffera-linked families.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

I think we got in under the wire, said Ms. Larocca, whose neighbors architect tried and failed to secure the Tafferas for her renovation. (Ms. Larocca ran into Robert on the street, and he promised to reconsider.)

In the last year Mr. Taffera has turned down 15 or so small projects and eight houses. Those with lots of money arent necessarily difficult, he said, and those with less arent by nature easygoing.

Money isnt what decides the job, he said. Its the relationship we can have with them.

Luke Fichthorn, an amiable financial manager with a townhouse on Willow Street (Taffera-renovated, and now on a Taffera maintenance program), said: They dont take every job. I was shocked because they turned down a friend of mine. I saw him and he was like, Your guy turned me down.

But its not like getting into kindergarten, he added, somewhat unconvincingly.

On any given weekday in the Heights, most of the passers-by seem to be Taffera employees, easily identified by their dark blue T-shirts emblazoned with a gold T (created by Michael Gericke, a partner at Pentagram Design and one of Mr. Tafferas first clients).

Mr. Taffera likes the esprit de corps that a uniform gives his crew, but is still conflicted about putting his name on a job site, as other contractors do, with a branded billboard. Theres no swearing on a Taffera job. Do it safe, do it well, be productive, have fun are Mr. Tafferas core principals, he said. Maintaining a profanity-free site is a grace note that supports them.

The eldest of six children, Mr. Taffera was raised as a Jehovahs Witness in Shelton, Wash., a town of just under 10,000. In 1983, he arrived in Brooklyn Heights to volunteer for his church, working as a painter and scaffolder on its many Heights properties.

Mr. Taffera has long since left the church (Its a fairly conservative religion, he said, though he appreciates many of its values), but in those early days, like many Witnesses, hed moonlight on weekends.

One of his first jobs was with Kathy Marshall and Brian McGorry, a banker and a lawyer, who were filled with renovation fever when they bought a house here in the late 1980s. Ms. Marshall recalled that Mr. Taffera was a bit hesitant about the scope of the job, and so her husband said, Why dont you just do one good days work?

Ms. Marshall continued: We decided wed start with demo, we all worked together, and my first memory of Robert is this skinny kid covered in brown debris. At the end of that day, my husband said, O.K., would you like to do another day?

That was nearly three decades  and three renovations for Ms. Marshall and Mr. McGorry  ago.

Robert has exquisite taste and is an incredible problem solver, Ms. Marshall said, and he ended up being our construction marriage counselor.

Ms. Marshall passed Mr. Tafferas name along to Helen Simonson, the author of the best seller Major Pettigrews Last Stand, and her husband, John Simonson, a financial regulatory consultant, who in the early 1990s bought a dilapidated early -19th-century former clapboard that had been McMansioned in 1922, as Ms. Simonson said, with a stucco facade. The Simonsons had tried and failed to renovate it themselves, and then they had hired a local contractor whose crew walked off the job one day because he had neglected to pay them.

Kathy told us, Ms. Simonson remembered, Im passing you this name, but dont tell anyone and dont use him too much. Later, I would do the same: I would size people up for whether they were worthy of being admitted to this very select club. Now, Robert has moved on to museum-quality restorations and mansion-level jobs with swimming pools on the roof, but we still have breakfast and he still doesnt forget old-time clients like me who have an emergency sewer problem.

On Grace Court Alley, amid the remnants of 81 carved pumpkins at the entrance of their carriage house (this is a family that goes big on Halloween), Sarah Steinberg, a gastroenterologist, and Peter Steinberg, a web start-up entrepreneur, hugged the brothers and recalled the scene on the day of their wedding, seven years ago, when the house was filled with Taffera crew members knocking out the punch list and Robert was installing a toilet-paper holder.

Mr. Steinberg bought the place in 2003. (It was notable, he said, for a garage that was once part of the ground floor, where Marilyn Monroe was said to have gotten drunk.) With a design by Baxt Ingui Architects, the Tafferas gutted the house to its stone shell. The rebuild was not exactly a speedy one, said Mr. Steinberg, raising an eyebrow at Eric.

Then, in early March 2008, he met Sarah on the dating website JDate; by the end of the month, they had planned a June wedding at the house, a screeching deadline for the Tafferas. The day of the ceremony, with the toilet-paper holder installed and the paint touched up, the Tafferas raced home to change. They were back at the Steinbergs in time for the festivities, which was a good thing because when a toilet overflowed, Eric was on hand to fix it.

Architects promise you the moon and stars, Ms. Witty said, but then Robert looks at the drawings and says, You cant get a steel beam into the cellar. He catches what an engineer might not, and he gets the landmark process because hes done it a million times and hes just a great guy in an environment where there are no great guys.

When the Tafferas finished the renovation of James La Force and Stephen Hendersons Chelsea loft last year, the couple were so happy with the process that they hosted a dinner party for the entire crew.

It was last year, too, that Phyllis Norton-Towers, a real estate broker who lives in a Taffera-finished house on Remsen Street, tripped while doing a walk-through and broke her ankle badly enough to put her in a wheelchair. When she came home from the hospital, a ramp had been installed over her front stoop. Mr. Taffera never mentioned it, and he still hasnt sent her a bill.

And when Ms. Marshalls husband died last year, Mr. Taffera called her immediately.

Dont worry about the house, he told her. Ill take care of everything.",[]

Throughout the country, the arts are pumping new life into the bodies and minds of the elderly.

Two summers ago, a remarkable documentary called Alive Inside showed how much music can do for the most vulnerable older Americans, especially those whose memories and personalities are dimmed by dementia.

The film opens with a 90-year-old African-American woman living in a nursing home being asked about her life growing up in the South. All she could say in response to specific questions was, Im sorry, I dont remember.

But once she was fitted with an iPod that played the music she had enjoyed in her youth, her smile grew wide and her eyes sparkled as vivid memories flooded her consciousness. She was now able to describe in detail the music and dances she had relished with her young friends.

At another nursing home, a man named George with advanced dementia refused to speak or even raise his head when asked his name. He too was outfitted with an iPod, and suddenly George came back to life, talking freely, wiggling to the music in his wheelchair and singing along with the songs he once loved.

The Music and Memory project that provided the iPods was the inspiration of a volunteer music lover named Dan Cohen, and has since spread to many nursing homes and facilities for the aged around the country. Alas, not nearly enough of them. Medicaid, which fully covers the cost of potent drugs that can turn old people into virtual zombies, has no policy that would pay for far less expensive music players. So the vast majority of nursing home residents who might benefit are deprived of this joyous experience.

Nonetheless, across the country, the arts in their myriad forms are enhancing the lives and health of older people  and not just those with dementia helping to keep many men and women out of nursing homes and living independently. With grants from organizations like the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Institute on Aging, incredibly dedicated individuals with backgrounds in the arts have established programs that utilize activities as diverse as music, dance, painting, quilting, singing, poetry writing and storytelling to add meaning, joy and a vibrant sense of well-being to the lives of older people.

Through a program called EngAGE in Southern California, 90-year-old Walter Hurlburt, who once made a living as a sign painter, now decorates rooms at the Burbank Senior Artists Colony, a retirement facility where he lives, with lovely oil paintings he creates from pictures he finds in magazines and books. Mr. Hurlburt regularly attends classes on various art forms at the residence where, he told me, Im always learning something new.

His buddy at the residence, Sally Connors, an 82-year-old former schoolteacher, surprised herself by writing and directing a screenplay that was performed by fellow residents. Then, with Dolly Brittan, 79, a former early childhood educator, they both surprised themselves by writing their life stories in rap and performing their rap memoirs on a stage for at-risk teenagers they were mentoring.

Both she and Ms. Connors said their newfound involvement with the arts has made them feel decades younger.

Tim Carpenter, the executive director of EngAGE, is now working to expand this approach to senior living in other cities, including Minneapolis, Portland, Ore., and Raleigh, N.C. His goal is to create a nationwide network of programs for seniors that keep them healthy, happy and active through lifelong learning in every conceivable art form, enabling them to live independently as long as possible.

As in Burbank, Mr. Carpenter is promoting the development of arts colonies in senior residences where residents can study and create art in all its forms and where they can see their artistic creations come to life on a stage.

Dr. Gene D. Cohen, a gerontologist at George Washington University who died in 2009, was a staunch advocate for the mental and physical benefits of creativity for the elderly. He directed the Creativity and Aging Study, a controlled study sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts at three sites, including Elders Share the Arts in Brooklyn, N.Y., that showed after only a year that the health of elders in the cultural groups stabilized or improved in contrast to a decline among those in the control groups.

In a film called Do Not Go Gently, Dr. Cohen, who founded the Creativity Discovery Corps, featured an architect who, at age 96, submitted a plan for redeveloping the World Trade Center site. Dr. Cohen pointed out that creativity challenges the mind and results in the formation of new dendrites, the brains communication channels.

At 26 different facilities in the Washington, D.C., area, 15 teaching artists work with seniors in centers where they live or visit regularly. Janine Tursini, director of Arts for the Aging in Rockville, Md., seeks to get at what best jazzes up older adults. Groups of about 20 older adults get involved in what she calls art making  music, dance, painting or storytelling.

Ms. Tursini said the N.E.A.-sponsored study showed that when older people become involved in culturally enriching programs, they experience a decline in depression, are less likely to fall and pay fewer visits to the doctor. In another study among people with Alzheimers disease, a sculpting program improved the participants mood and decreased their agitation even after the program ended.

The arts open people up, giving them new vehicles for self-expression, a chance to tell their stories, Ms. Tursini said. The programs capitalize on assets that remain, not on whats been lost.

Naomi Goldberg Haas created the Dances for a Variable Population program to get older adults dancing. People who havent moved in years, even those who can no longer stand, can participate. Young professionals and older dancers go to various sites  libraries, churches, senior centers  where elders gather and encourage them to move more.

Movement enriches the quality of their lives, Ms. Haas said. Its absolutely healing. Balance, mobility, strength  everything improves.

Social engagement, which nearly all these programs provide, has been repeatedly found in major population studies to prolong life and enhance healthy aging. Clinically, the programs have been linked to lowered blood pressure, reduced levels of stress hormones, and increased levels of the happiness hormones that are responsible for a runners high.

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Coming Home to Pot Roast,['Brett Anderson'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

MINNEAPOLIS  Pot roast was one of the first dishes the chef Gavin Kaysen learned to cook, if you can call it cooking. The recipe he used as a teenager growing up in Bloomington, Minn., a Twin Cities suburb, required no culinary training.









Id just Crock-Pot it, Mr. Kaysen said. He then mimicked the act of pouring packaged beef stock into a slow cooker and grinned.

Mr. Kaysen had just slid a more technically advanced pot roast into the oven in the open kitchen at Spoon and Stable, the restaurant he opened here in late 2014 to much anticipation. I cant wait for that gravy, he said.

Northeasterners cook Yankee pot roast. Jewish brisket and most beef daube in New Orleans are pot roast by other names. But to many who grew up in Americas heartland, pot roast tastes and smells of home.

Comprising little more than a large cut of beef (chuck roast is common), onions, root vegetables and braising liquid, pot roast has none of the meddling influence of haute cuisine.

Pot roast was a dish my mother made more Sundays than I can count, said Rick Nelson, the longtime restaurant critic and food writer at The Star Tribune, the Twin Cities largest newspaper, which gave Mr. Kaysens restaurant four stars last year. I can picture her preparing it and putting it in the oven before going to Cross of Glory Lutheran Church. I can still remember that smell.

Photo

Mr. Kaysen sums up the dish as simply meat and potatoes. Growing up, he said, It was my favorite thing to eat.

Growing up in the Twin Cities, I also developed an affection for pot roast, but hadnt given the dish much thought until Mr. Kaysen recently brought it back to my attention. Ive tested a half-dozen different recipes since our meeting late last year. The results left me convinced that pot roast is overdue for a mass reappraisal.

Pot roast shares virtues with many dishes that have enjoyed the validation of ambitious chefs. The meat is texturally similar to the tougher cuts of meat (beef short ribs, lamb and veal shanks) that chefs love to cook until the flesh falls from the bone. The vegetables hold their shape, but are somehow softer than those served mashed or pureed.

The consistency of the cooking liquid depends on the recipe. Those that dont call for flour tend to yield something like consomme, while those that do fall somewhere between beef gravy and demi-glace.

That liquid is what captures the heart of many pot roast fans. It tastes restorative, akin to the current appeal of bone broth, and is one of the reasons Mr. Kaysen likes to eat pot roast this time of year, when Midwestern hospitality boils down to the act of bringing people together when its freezing outside.

Yet he did not intend to make pot roast when he returned home after cooking all over the world, at least not for paying customers. The first drafts of the menu at Spoon and Stable featured clear nods to the region: Canadian bison, cheese curds in the creamed spinach, dill-cured salmon.

But pot roast was not in the mix because Mr. Kaysen feared that a dish commonly associated with slow cookers and bouillon cubes would hurt his bid for local acceptance.

I didnt want people to think, Oh, this New York chef comes home and only cooks what he thinks we like to eat, which is pot roast, Mr. Kaysen said. I didnt want to offend people.

Photo

A little history here to explain Mr. Kaysens anxiety: He left Minnesota for culinary school at 20. The appeal of pot roast is linked to comfort-food predictability and ease of preparation. The young Mr. Kaysen sought adventure. He got that and more working in respected restaurant kitchens in Switzerland, London and California, and later under the wing of Daniel Boulud in New York.

When Mr. Kaysen, now 36, returned to the Twin Cities in 2014, it was as one of the most impressively credentialed culinary talents ever to set down roots in his hometown. Advance expectations for Spoon and Stable were stoked by Mr. Kaysens resume, highlighted by a seven-year run as executive chef at Cafe Boulud and his success, as both contestant and coach, at the Bocuse dOr, the French cooking competition named for the legendary chef Paul Bocuse.

The very accomplishments that would seem to guarantee his success in this relatively small market also gave the native son pause. Mr. Kaysen feared that the hype surrounding his homecoming (Spoon and Stable was fully booked through its first two months before it opened) could alienate a population with a reputation for prizing modesty and recoiling from East Coast exceptionalism.

I thought people were going to be offended by the pot roast, he said, but they went crazy for it.

On a whim, Mr. Kaysen included a version of his grandmothers pot roast on Spoon and Stables pre-opening menu. It remained through much of the winter. I ate there on a visit home, shortly after the restaurants grand opening, and was as delighted by the pot roast as the locals who made it a best seller.

Spoon and Stables pot roast departed from my moms in satisfyingly upscale ways. The vegetable sides  chanterelle mushrooms, pommes puree, parsley root cooked in milk and then sauteed  owed as much to the influence of Mr. Boulud, his mentor, as that of Dorothy Kaysen, his grandmother.

I missed mashing and then eating the unfashionably soft vegetables that emerge from a home cooks pot (Mr. Kaysen said he feeds those to his staff), but the gravy was silken and redolent of rosemary; the beef spoon-tender.

Instead of chuck, the cut favored by most home cooks including Dorothy, Mr. Kaysen uses a richer-flavored shoulder cut the French call paleron and butchers here often call a flat iron roast.

Photo

Its got this really fantastic tendon that runs right in the middle of it, Mr. Kaysen said, drawing a knifes blade across the length of a raw roast. If you cook it down enough, the tendon almost turns into, like, a marrow. He beamed at the thought. At Cafe Boulud, whenever we made pot au feu, wed always use this paleron.

Considering his globe-hopping past, its not surprising that he defines Midwestern cuisine broadly. He believes his food is reflective of an increasingly diverse and urbane Midwest. It has to be, the chef suggests, given that hes a Midwesterner working collaboratively with a mostly Midwestern staff.

Before we put a new dish on the menu, Mr. Kaysen said, we ask ourselves: Is it accessible? Is it true to who we are? Is it our collective voice?

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Kaysen appears younger than he is, which, coupled with a deal-closing smile and an impulse toward self-effacement, creates the impression of someone who can charm his way into opportunities where his reach exceeds his grasp. He had already completed his first year at the New England Culinary Institute, having talked his way into an internship normally reserved for second-year students, when he realized he was getting a little ahead of himself.

I had no idea what foie gras was, he said. I didnt know beets came out of the ground and not out of a can.

After his stint working in Europe, Mr. Kaysen landed at El Bizcocho, a restaurant in San Diego, rising to executive chef after just seven months. He ultimately crossed paths with Mr. Boulud, who offered him a job as executive sous-chef at Daniel. Mr. Kaysen accepted, only to discover a better job waiting for him in New York.

I surprised him and I said, We have something else to propose to you, Mr. Boulud said. Andrew Carmellini had recently resigned his position running the kitchen at Cafe Boulud, and Mr. Boulud offered it to Mr. Kaysen. I always had trust in Gavin, Mr. Boulud said. Hes impressive. And I wanted to get him out of San Diego. I thought his talent needed to be nurtured in a bigger city.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Quality-of-life considerations influenced Mr. Kaysens decision to return home. He settled with his wife and children in a suburb with well-regarded public schools.

Photo

His presence in Minneapolis also brought fringe benefits to the city. Mr. Kaysen paved the way for the return of Christopher Nye, a fellow Minnesotan who had been working for the chef Fabio Trabocchi in Washington, and is now Spoon and Stables chef de cuisine. Mr. Boulud, Thomas Keller and Jerome Bocuse, all Spoon and Stable investors, appeared at the restaurant on opening day.

Mr. Kaysen recently announced the Synergy Series, a string of special dinners featuring top-shelf guest chefs from New York. The first seasons lineup: Michael White, Michael Anthony, April Bloomfield and Mr. Boulud.

One of Gavins greatest strengths is his Rolodex, Mr. Nelson said. Hes really well connected, and I think thats really good for the city.

His return to Minnesota could turn out to be really good for pot roast, too. The dish hasnt been widely embraced by Twin Cities restaurants (the Modern Cafe, a notable exception, closed last year), although there are signs its star is rising.

In his book The Food Lab, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt hails pot roast as superior to boeuf bourguignon. Stephen Stryjewski calls the beef daube he serves at Cochon, his Cajun-influenced restaurant in New Orleans, New Orleanss version of pot roast. Joseph Lenn, the former chef at Blackberry Farm in Walland, Tenn., braises a stewed lamb neck so reminiscent of his mothers pot roast that hes considering renaming it when he writes the menu for the restaurant he plans to open in Knoxville, Tenn., later this year.

Pot roasts position in Spoon and Stables urbane Midwestern repertoire lends the dish much deserved prestige, as does Mr. Kaysens now unconflicted love affair with it. With any luck, his efforts will incite other chefs to occasion a true pot roast renaissance.

Sometimes it just takes one place to open, or one thing to happen, for people to discover what theyve been missing, Mr. Kaysen said.

Recipes: Pot Roast | More Roasts

And to Drink ...

This recipe calls for a bottle of cabernet sauvignon for deglazing the pan. I dont hold to the old saw suggesting that one should drink the same wine used in cooking, but cabernet would be a fine choice, whether from the Medoc or greater Graves region, or a balanced but fruitier selection from California. You may also try cabernets from Washington State or South Africa, or good cabernet francs from the Loire Valley, or softer blends of merlot-and-cabernet-franc from St.-Emilion. Unrelated grapes may go even better. The tomato element suggests sangiovese, which is also an excellent accompaniment to beef. A firm Chianti Classico is one possibility. Another is a good Brunello di Montalcino or its sibling, Rosso di Montalcino, which is usually cheaper and easier to drink when young. ERIC ASIMOV",[]

nytimes.com,,Radiohead to Present New Album at 2016 Primavera Sound Festival,['Chris Payne'],"Thom Yorke performs during Pathway to Paris at Le Trianon on Dec. 4, 2015 in Paris, France.

When Primavera Sound unveiled its 2016 lineup today (Jan. 21), the announcement came with some unexpected good news.

Radiohead will not only perform, but present its forthcoming, shrouded-in-mystery ninth studio album as well. According to a Primavera press release (via Rolling Stone) the festivities will include the presentation of the new album by the British band Radiohead.""

Yup, that Radiohead.

Primavera is set for June 1-5 at the Parc del Forum in Barcelona, Spain.

Radiohead will also perform at Portugal's Nos Alive festival on July 8 and Switzerland's OpenAir St. Gallen festival, which runs between June 30 and July 3. These three recently-announced shows mark Radioheads first concerts since 2012.

Radiohead's New Company Filing Could Signal New Album

The Thom-Yorke led band has been working on the forthcoming studio album at least since Sept. 2014. So far, no title, release date, or other details have been shared. One thing we do know is that it will include a song that originated during Radiohead's Bends/OK Computer era.

Stay tuned.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"Mr. Leahy vs. Stupid, Stupid, Stupid","['Http Downesnyt', 'Lawrence Downes']","Photo

Ive never heard such a stupid, stupid, stupid thing, said Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, on Wednesday.

He was at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The witness was Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The subject was the troubling phenomenon of young children being forced to go through immigration court without lawyers.

Its the result of the influx of tens of thousands of Central American immigrants seeking asylum at the border, many of them minors traveling alone. The Obama administration has been rushing them through deportation hearings. The case loads are overwhelming, and the pro bono lawyers are few.

Mr. Leahy asked Ms. Lynch about recent remarks by an immigration judge, Jack Weil, in a deposition in a federal lawsuit, that children as young as 3 or 4 could, with patient instruction, be made to understand immigration law and represent themselves competently in deportation hearings.

Mr. Leahy made it clear what he thought of that. He hammered on the word stupid as if with a baseball bat.

Ms. Lynch was mild in reply. I share with you your puzzlement over those statements, she said. She added, We do not take the view that children can represent themselves.

She also noted that the Department of Justice isnt required do anything about the problem. The current law does not provide the right to counsel, she said.

This is true  unlike defendants in criminal cases, defendants in immigration court cannot demand lawyers at taxpayer expense. But what the Justice Department is obligated to do is different from what it should do. Mr. Leahy tried to address the distinction.

Q. D.O.J. has the authority to make sure these children have lawyers. Yet children are going before immigration hearings without counsel. Why not just have a blanket policy that they must have counsel?

A. We do certainly support that as a policy matter. We support efforts to provide counsel to  not just children but others in immigration court who dont have counsel, through pro bono representation, through nongovernmental groups, and we also support congressional efforts to strengthen the policies and laws that would enable us to have a lawyer for every individual.

It was a friendly-sounding non-answer. Mr. Leahy tried again.

Q. Why not just say, there wont be a hearing with a child unless they are represented?

A. Well, senator, I think you raise an excellent point. We may find ourselves there. I think were looking to find various ways to support that. And were looking to find various ways to get legal counsel appointed in every situation.

Q. I think its a mark against this country... I think it is a bad, bad image for a judge who would say something that stupid, that reprehensible, to be the face of the United States.



And then, having not gotten a firm commitment to a solution, the senator moved on.",[]
nytimes.com,2015-04-05 00:00:00,James Hannahams Delicious Foods,['Ted Genoways'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

When readers first meet Eddie, one of the principal characters in James Hannahams much anticipated second novel, he is struggling to steer a stolen vehicle out of Louisiana and north up Interstate 45, to where hes told his aunt and longtime protector now lives, in St. Cloud, Minn., a place whose very name sounds to him like heaven after the hell he has just endured. Eddie has no hands. How exactly he came to have them severed, a final act of desperation in a novel singularly focused on desperate acts, isnt revealed until the end. But one thing becomes brutally apparent from the start: Eddies mother, Darlene, is overtaken by drug addiction born out of grief over the early, violent death of Eddies black activist father, Nat  and her clouded judgment leads to any number of miseries for herself and her son. When she is tempted in her stupor into a van and into a contract with a company called Delicious Foods, which also gives the novel its title, she is secreted away to a camp where she is forced to work, in order to pay off the debt of her room and food and the diet of crack cocaine overseers use to keep their slave laborers subdued. The drug so utterly annihilates Darlenes autonomy that it speaks for her, narrating her portions of the novel as Scotty  a sinister, wiseass monologuist who often sounds like a cross between Katt Williams and the Devil himself.









In short, Hannaham is never lacking in ambition  and he means to tell a sweeping American tale that draws equally from Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass and The Grapes of Wrath. Unlike those classics of captivity and exploitation, however, Hannaham actively resists allowing his characters to stand in as exemplars whose stories unearth a larger system rigged against the innocent. Instead, Darlene and Nat are accidental iconoclasts, whose small-bore rebellions are often the result of naive idealism (as when Nat decides they should move to Ovis, La., in order to become civil rights activists, because the name sounded humble to him, like the sort of place where he could organize and mobilize small-town black folks). That their rash decisions often guide them into dangerous terrain is part of Hannahams mission, allowing him to explore the thorny nexus of systemic racism and the personal destruction that often hounds the hopeless. The voice of Scotty, the drug working on Darlenes brain, is never less than seductive, assuring her no one loves her the way he does.

But its important to note that the depraved exploitation at the center of Delicious Foods is based on real events. Hannaham (whose first novel was the well-received God Says No) has said he drew inspiration from the particular case of Bulls-Hit, a farm in Hastings, Fla., south of St. Augustine, in which overseers are said to have plied black workers with crack and alcohol, exactly as the book describes. But even Hannaham acknowledges the case was unusual. A vast majority of recent instances of what could be called modern slavery, especially in the American food industry, have involved Hispanic workers  and have almost all been in Florida, not Louisiana, where the book is set. (One such case, in Immokalee, is harrowingly depicted in the recent documentary Food Chains.) Thus the abuse and manipulation as depicted serve more to comment on the long history of slave labor on Southern plantations and the equally inescapable trap of indentured servitude under Jim Crow than the realities of field work in the food industry.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Nevertheless, Hannahams decision to focus on African-American characters seems to give him the freedom to fully inhabit the voice of Scotty while also achingly describing the early-life struggles that Eddie faces as the child of a dead father and drug-addicted mom. Early in the novel, for example, Darlene tells her son that his Vietnam-veteran father, who peers out from a fading photograph in his Air Force uniform, was killed by Southern racists, not the Viet Cong. Charlie didnt get your daddy, no sir. He had to come home to Jim Crow for that. The turn of phrase is striking  but it gains its deeper resonance in the way that Eddie comes to associate black birds with death. At one point, Eddie remembers scattering grackles from behind his house when he was still a boy. In his fantasy, Hannaham writes, Eddie knew that if he could only clear all the birds from the backyard, his father would return  not the stiff, fading image, but the real, lanky man whose crossed leg he would ride like a horse into that unhad future. Much later, when Eddie finally finds his mother, long after her kidnapping, he chances upon her chasing a grackle. She is so focused on catching the bird that she cannot snap out of her trance, even after her half-forgotten son wraps her in his arms. Eddie clung to her waist and bellowed, Ma, Hannaham writes, while she screeched and howled in the direction of the grackle, which leapt into even higher branches, then took flight above the treetops and into the smudgy sky, its black wings flapping quickly, then slowly, then fading into nothing.

Such moments of deft lyricism are Hannahams greatest strength, and those touches of beauty and intuitive metaphor make the novels difficult subject matter much easier to bear. Delicious Foods, however, is more often messy and scattershot when it comes to more basic issues of pacing, structure and, sometimes, simple narrative detail. When we finally witness the scene in which Eddies hands are severed, for example, Hannaham cant seem to decide whether to play it for dark comedy or gothic horror  and the uncertainty makes what should be the books most gripping scene into something that is painstakingly described yet nearly impossible to picture. In the end, the novels finest moments are not in its grander ambitions, but rather in the singular way that Hannaham can make the commonplace spring to life with nothing more than astute observation and precise language.

This poses a fascinating quandary for Hannaham as a writer with many novels yet ahead of him. Does he work to hone his skills as a social realist and commentator on larger issues of contemporary concern by better mapping out their connections to history? Or does he tighten his focus into the lives of people whose circumstances may be less obviously dramatic but whose worlds become large by way of Hannahams considerable gifts? Either path promises to make Hannaham a writer of major importance, and Delicious Foods is a notable and engaging step along that road. But I, for one, hope that Hannaham will not rest on the laurels that are almost certainly coming his way. If he can resist that temptation, his next book, whatever it turns out to be, will be not only eagerly anticipated but also long remembered.",[]

Many people take a daily low-dose aspirin to lower the risk of heart disease, and several studies have shown that regular aspirin use reduces the risk for some cancers. Now a long-term analysis has found that its population-wide benefits against cancer may be even greater than previously believed.

Researchers studied aspirin use in 135,965 health care professionals, men and women, tracking their health for as long as 32 years. Over the course of the study, published in JAMA Oncology, there were 27,985 cases of cancer.

Regular aspirin use reduced the risk for all cancers by about 3 percent, though it had no impact on the risk for breast, lung or prostate cancer.

But regular aspirin use reduced the risk for all gastrointestinal cancers by 15 percent, and for cancers of the colon and rectum by 19 percent.

The senior author, Dr. Andrew T. Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard, pointed out that even people who undergo regular colorectal screening can develop cancers, and aspirin could help prevent some of those cancers as well.

Based on our estimates, Dr. Chan said, we think that regular aspirin use could prevent almost 30,000 cases of gastrointestinal cancers a year, which account for almost 25 percent of all cancer deaths. So I think thats pretty substantial.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-02-29 00:00:00,"Once Upon a Greek Island, Migrants and Tourists",['Rena Silverman'],"Its hard to imagine enjoying a holiday getaway in an area rife with suffering. But it happens all the time, and not just in the developing world where verdant, gated resorts exist not far from impoverished shantytowns. Consider the Greek island of Lesbos, where sunbathers laze by azure waters while not too far away boats arrive daily full of families fleeing violence in Syria and other hot spots.

Marieke van der Velden and her partner, Philip Brink, decided to bring together these two disparate groups  tourists and migrants  in The Island of All Together. Conceived in May, carried out in August and completed in December of last year, the project includes portraits, a documentary short and an interactive website. But the central interaction is the encounter between two people whose paths crossed unexpectedly.

Lesbos is an interesting place because there are tourists and refugees coming to the island and they are both there for a week or two, Mr. Brink said. So thats how we came up with the idea to ask refugees and tourists to sit down and talk to each other and make a film out of it.

Last summer, a few months after United Nations officials expressed concern about the record number of migrants arriving on Lesbos, Ms. van der Velden and Mr. Brink traveled from their home in Amsterdam to the island, where they found tourists at their hotel and migrants at a parking lot where many were waiting for the next bus to register for transit to Athens.

We knew that people had to wait there for hours, Ms. van der Velden said. We didnt ask them when they were coming off the boats.

Photo

Ms. van der Velden and Mr. Brink paired up migrants and tourists for interviews in spots throughout the island. They handed out cards with questions for participants to ask each other, although in the end some questions came naturally. Each participant spoke in his or her native language  usually Dutch, English or Arabic  and used a headset for translations, often made by a Lebanese member of the film crew.

Selma Pabst, a 24-year-old German medical student visiting Lesbos with her sister and mother, was paired with Husam (Ms. van der Velden and Mr. Brink did not feel comfortable revealing any last names of migrants). He was a 26-year-old lawyer from Damascus en route to Germany. Hours before they met, Husam and some 50 other migrants had been packed in a black rubber boat intended for only 30 passengers.

What was your life like five years ago? was among the first questions they posed to each other.

Five years ago I had dreams and ambitions, Husam told Ms. Pabst. I had already started realizing them and I had achieved my goals. But the situation changed and there was nothing more for me to do. Everything in my life stopped.

When Ms. Pabst asked him to name those dreams and ambitions, he told her that when the war in Syria started (around five years ago), he had just graduated from law school. I wanted to work as an attorney, he said. The war put an end to that.

The trip was relatively safe, because I was nearly killed three times in Syria.  Mohamad

Mohamad, a Kurdish, 50-year-old former restaurant manager from Aleppo who spent two years in Turkey before arriving on the island, was paired with Jan Winkel, 56, from the Netherlands. Mr. Winkel often looked surprised by Mohamads candor.

The trip was relatively safe, because I was nearly killed three times in Syria, Mohamad said, adding that his wife and son were still in Turkey and his daughter in Syria.

Its hard to hear this story from you, Mr. Winkel replied. Then you think everything is torn up and we are here with the entire family.

Then there were the two little boys, one from Damascus, the other from a Channel Island between England and France. They sat on swings, discussing soccer players. My favorite player is Cristiano, the 11-year-old Syrian boy, Alaa, said referring to Cristiano Ronaldo. Finn, the other boy, who is 9, agreed. Hes good.

At the end of each session, Ms. van der Velden took portraits of the pairs, which she let them stage. Mr. Brink and Ms. van der Velden also asked participants to take selfies with their partners, an idea that originated because they were trying to come up with a creative ending for the film.

At the end of the conversation, Mr. Brink said, people come close to each other to take the picture, so its really kind of an intimate moment.

(*If youre writing about race and gender inequality.)

The data comes in like clockwork, at least a few studies every year: Hollywood has an enduring problem hiring women and people of color, both in front of and behind the camera.

But when I set out, last fall, to get the personal, firsthand stories behind those numbers  as part of an expansive project on diversity and representation  I was nervous. I didnt know if anyone would come forward to talk about such a sensitive subject, least of all stars or filmmakers whose livelihoods depend on maintaining smooth relationships with the industrys executives and gatekeepers. (Its hard enough to get celebrities to go off their talking points when theyre promoting a film; how many times have we heard that their latest cast and crew were  really, truly  the best theyve ever worked with?)

I wasnt even sure that there would be specific moments that revealed, starkly, what it felt like to be the lone female voice or person of color in a room  or a gay, a trans, or other underrepresented artist, fighting merely to be seen.

Man, was I wrong.

Certainly, not everyone I approached for the project wanted to take part. A few agreed and then backed off, skittish or weary of being mouthpieces for the larger problems of their field. But once some prominent people began talking, it was as if the gates were breached. People werent just coming to the table, they were crowding it, eagerly. That openness is new.

And, dishearteningly, everyone seemed to have a story. I barely had to get my question out before my subjects were nodding in understanding, ready to offer up their accounts. I was worried that nobody would want to talk; instead, they didnt want to stop. Ive got so much to say! the actor Wendell Pierce told me, as our conversation stretched long past its allotted time. Almost all of them did.

It felt personal right away. Many people began by talking about their childhoods, their parents or how they were raised  an indication, to me, of how deeply representation matters. Even for people whose job it is to play someone else, these questions cut to the heart of their own identity.

Several people were jolted by long-buried memories; one said that talking about this was like therapy. There were tears. It was intense for me, as well. I thought that I was already pretty cynical about the flaws of Hollywood, having spent five years covering the awards season and all the politicking that goes into the Oscar race, and many more years writing about and observing the business. And I didnt know the half of it.

I started the project months before #OscarsSoWhite erupted again, and eventually we decided to run it around the time of the Oscars broadcast, since it seemed to dovetail with reader interest in that topic. Because we thought of it as akin to a massive oral history, our photo editor and designers had already been working on how to make it visually accessible, especially online and on mobile. They were, crucially, involved from the get-go.

So when I returned from several reporting trips to Los Angeles and elsewhere this winter, with more than 30 hours of interviews, my editors were standing by to help carve out the story. Three of them joined me in reading through the pages and pages of transcripts. (Thankfully, I had some transcription help.) Patterns emerged quickly: how overtrained many of these people were for the menial roles that were available to them  that clinging sense that they always had to be more prepared than everyone else. And how often they had to learn to navigate these obstacles in the most neutral way possible, both for their professional survival and for their sanity. Also, sadly and predictably, only the women ever talked about negotiating family and career; I never brought it up with anybody, but they volunteered those stories.

Gratifyingly, there were also mentors and doors opening. My favorite comment might have come from Jimmy Smits, who felt permission to aspire when he saw other artists of color perform.

Its been two weeks since the story was published, and the responses are still rolling in. Ive received hundreds of emails from others whove been in similar circumstances, in the entertainment industry and beyond. Hollywood is a rarefied world, but these experiences are all too common. Now, at least, were emboldened to talk about them.",[]
nytimes.com,2014-11-13 00:00:00,Preparation for the Next Life by Atticus Lish,['Dwight Garner'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Atticus Lishs first novel, Preparation for the Next Life, is unlike any American fiction Ive read recently in its intricate comprehension of, and deep feeling for, life at the margins.









This is an intense book with a low, flyspecked center of gravity. Its about blinkered lives, scummy apartments, dismal food, bad options. At its knotty core, amazingly, is perhaps the finest and most unsentimental love story of the new decade. Its one that builds slowly in intensity, like a shaft of sunlight into an anthracite mine.

One of this novels two central characters is Zou Lei, who works in the kitchen of a forgettable Chinese restaurant in Flushing, Queens. Shes an ethnic Uighur from northwest China, and the other workers dont understand her language. She finds a blackened mattress in an overcrowded rooming house. She seems like the loneliest person alive.

Zou Lei slipped into America; she has no papers. Here are the first two paragraphs of Mr. Lishs novel, which tell a shred of her story. They also show off Mr. Lishs sentences, which are confident, loose jointed, strewn with essential detail.

She came by way of Archer, Bridgeport, Nanuet, worked off 95 in jeans and a denim jacket, carrying a plastic bag and shower shoes, a phone number, waiting beneath an underpass, the potato chips long gone, lightheaded.

They picked her up on the highway by a plain white shed, a sign for army-navy, tires in the trees. A Caravan pulled up with a Monkey King on the dash and she got in. The men took her to a Motel 8 and put her in a room with half a dozen other women from Fookien and a liter of orange soda. She listened to trucks coming in all night and the AC running.

So begins a particular kind of American story. It includes a scary stint in prison (the Patriot Act, in this novel, is a phrase of dread), and a series of dead-end jobs. Zou Lei rides the subway selling bootleg DVDs, which she fans out. She looks at the other riders and says: Deeweedee, deeweedee. Hello, deeweedee.

The other central character in Preparation for the Next Life is Skinner, an injured, tattooed, depressed and mentally unbalanced veteran of three tours in Iraq. He takes a basement apartment in Queens, with fitness magazines, pornography and pizza boxes spread around his bed.

Theres been a surfeit of wounded warriors in recent American fiction, and his arrival worried me; these men can, in lesser hands, be stock characters. Not here. The encrusted detail in Mr. Lishs prose flicks the switch on in every sentence. Here is Skinner approaching his new apartment for the first time:

Photo

One of the houses had its postage-stamp yard filled with statues and figurines  of elves, wise men, the crucifixion, leprechauns, animals, plastic flowers, a sleigh, a whirligig that spun in the wind. There were wind chimes on the porch and an American flag bumper sticker for 9/11 on the house. This was where he was going.

Skinner and Zou Lei  he calls her Zooey  dont meet cute. He bumps into her while looking for an erotic massage. They bond in part over their shared love of working out, intense sessions that are like purification rituals, sessions that are almost the only thing that makes sense to them. They become one more unlikely couple in Flushing, going home to open a Styrofoam shell in the dark, eat something hot together.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Skinner is a decent man who does bad things. He doesnt trust himself. He sometimes treats Zou Lei badly. This is a love story with a lot of ache in it. He tells her to shut up and, Mr. Lish writes, this pulled the power cord right out of her. She accuses him of thinking she is some garbage person, just another piece of unwanted human biology.

Mr. Lish has taught English in Central Asia, and he works as a Chinese-English translator of technical material. Hes a former Marine who, according to his biography, has held a long series of blue-collar jobs.

I dont doubt his resume: This book is thick with the kind of sub-countertop-level detail that cant be faked. He also arrives with a literary pedigree. His father is Gordon Lish, the writer and influential editor, most famously of Raymond Carver.

Atticus Lish has written a necessary novel, one with echoes of early Ken Kesey, of William T. Vollmanns best writing and of Thom Joness pulverizing short stories.

His writing about Queens is superb. The graffiti-covered steel gates on businesses at night resembled a thousand tattooed eyelids. Flushing is where you see a hard glint in peoples eyes, the knowing look of someone who wasnt going to be fooled again.

Hes just as good on Skinners memories of war. The explosion leaped out of the road and rose like batwings. In the following vehicle, Skinners ears popped and cut off like overloaded speakers.

Neither Zou Lei nor Skinner is particularly religious. Yet she is a Muslim, and Preparation for the Next Life takes its name from a saying on the doorway of a mosque she enters at one point. This novel helps one understand the appeal of ready-made answers to lifes vexations.

Zou Lei is optimistic, in the face of the odds, about where life is dragging her. After all, things are worse back in China. She is a fierce patriot of a sort. She thinks to herself: The N.Y.P.D. would not stop her. If they scanned her, they would see an American flag under the scan.

The N.Y.P.D., as it happens, may be the least of her concerns. The final chapters of this indelible book pulled my heart up under my ears.",[]

MONDAY PUZZLE  The main challenge I faced while solving this nicely symmetrical Monday puzzle was swallowing the emotions that surfaced, a tasty mix of fondness and revulsion for the cute little decade sandwiched between the Awesome 80s and the terrifying era we live in now. Im Generation X, though. Eating our feelings is one of our specialties.

The four clues to 90s phenomena were clear enough for me, therefore, although I wonder if that was the case for everyone. As the puzzles center readily admits, these are 90SFADS  for anyone unconcerned with the zeitgeist of that slice of time, solving could have been a challenge.

One wonders if THE RACHEL, for example, will really stand the test of time, and although THE MACARENA is probably an earworm for many of us, does anyone wonder what really happened to Los Del Rio? TAMAGOTCHI is a portmanteau that means absolutely nothing in English but is pretty fun to say out loud, so maybe the word will last longer than the demanding little trinkets it refers to ever did.

DRMARTENS are classic, however, and will be with us until the end of time. Even post-apocalyptic zombies wear Docs.

As a funny twist to this nostalgia trip, this is the first time that any of these definitions appeared in a New York Times puzzle. Itll be interesting to see if any of them come back and when.

Some other nice related touches by the constructor were references to earlier pop culture phenomena  the SAYHEY kid is a moniker that supposedly dates back to the early 50s, and WHAMO is older (although the Frisbee will turn 60 next year). I believed the SMURFS to be pure 80s, weakly reprised this decade, but to my surprise the little blue characters actually began as a 1950s Belgian cartoon, so maybe the Smurfs of my memories are also a weak reprise of Les Schtroumpfs. What goes around, comes around, right?

If the Macarena is still playing in your mind, this should knock it out:

I wanted to be up-to-date on what was going on in the profession.

The judging and the conference energized her, she said. Young photographers sought her out for advice. But perhaps the biggest lesson they could have learned came from what she did in her down time.

When they asked me to be a judge for the contest, it lifted my spirits. You get to be a certain age in your profession and you think its almost time to turn the corner. This got me excited.

In January, I judged thousands of photos, and that revived me, made me hungry again and excited about what I was doing. After that, they invited me to the conference, which I wanted to attend to catch up on the latest information, gear and tricks. I really just went to enjoy the conference.

That was short-lived, because one of the kids there asked me to look at her portfolio. O.K., I did. Then she told about somebody elses. Before you knew it, I was looking at portfolios until three in the morning!

In a lot of portfolios, they were just putting stuff in there. I knew what they were doing: They were letting me know they can do this. I told them theyre in the neighborhood, but theyre not there yet. Why? Dont show me your stuff until youre ready.

That Saturday, I was in the midst of going from workshop to workshop, taking the hotel elevator, when I saw this lady with this cute little girl and boy. The lady had a fancy dress and shoes, as if she were going to a wedding.

Are you the flower girl? I asked the one child, Milan Hutchinson.

No, she told me. Im in the pageant.

Her mother, Sade Bell, told me that Milan, who is 7, was in the Miss Celebrity Spotlight Pageant and that they were going to get her hair done. I asked her, Can I follow you for a minute?

Sure, Ms. Bell replied.

You dont mind me photographing? I asked.

No, she said. I want her to get used to being photographed, I want her to get used to dealing with it and not think about it.

She was my kind of girl, so we hung out for two hours.

What really attracted me was not so much the little girl, but the whole thing. This was an outside activity that was earned: If she didnt do well in school or clean her room, she wouldnt be participating in the pageant.

Her mother got Milan an outfit a size larger, so she could use it for a while, because these dresses are very expensive. She had to pin it to make sure it fit properly. At one point Milan was fidgeting, so I decided to step back and let her mother take care of those pins. I took a little break, then came back. By then, her 4-year-old brother, Tristen, wanted some me time. You wouldnt believe the patience Milan had dealing with her brother right before the pageant.

All of this was going on, and I was so honored to be able to be there and disappear.

We all went down to the lobby for her final makeup. After that, they called her number and we went up. There was a big guy at the door who asked me Do you have a stamp? I told him Im her photographer! and walked in real fast with the mother so they wouldnt have a chance to check me. I did the best I could to get close without getting kicked out.

The weekend had energized me. It was that energy inside me that led me to make those pictures. In a spiritual way, this is my calling; this is what Im about. Im not going to ignore a moment. I might be told, No, go away. But Ill find a way to get into the next door.

If that little girl had said No, there was hotel full of them and I was going to find one. She was my calling.

As told to David Gonzalez.

For a new generation of consumers, the traditional notion of gendered fragrances is starting to go a little stale. The days when floral notes were exclusively for women and musks were solely for men are all but gone, and mass-market brands that peddle colognes and perfumes are starting to catch on.

Next month, Calvin Klein is releasing CK2, a self-described gender-free fragrance complete with a global advertising campaign that includes steamy images of epicene youths photographed by the artist Ryan McGinley. The scent is a sequel to Calvin Kleins 1994 unisex bombshell, CK One.

In September, Bond No. 9 introduced the eau de parfum B9 (which is, according to the brand, fascinatingly gender-fluid) around the same time that Aesop debuted its own unisex smell, Tacit. Lubin, one of the oldest French perfume houses, released Upper Ten this year, for men and women.

And Russell Westbrook, the Oklahoma City Thunder point guard and noted clotheshorse, recently collaborated with the Swedish company Byredo on Westbrook, a scent for either sex sold exclusively at Barneys New York.

Were definitely seeing an increase in unisex fragrances from the mass brands, said Theresa Yee, the senior beauty editor at the trend forecasting firm WGSN, who noted that niche brands have been offering them for some time.

Smaller businesses, like Le Labo and Brooklyns D.S. & Durga, have had bolder smells or unisex products on their rosters, but what was once a specialized field is now gaining widespread recognition. Ms. Yee said she saw the emphasis on versatility as part of a continuing marketing push to reach millennials by appealing to their free-spirited attitudes on gender identity.

The new scents are in keeping with gender-fluid celebrities like Miley Cyrus and Jaden Smith, not to mention the Amazon show Transparent and the film The Danish Girl. In the world of fashion, everything from Alessandro Micheles dandified vision at Gucci to the androgynous streetwear designs of Hood by Air are blurring the line between mens wear and womens wear.

Ann Gottlieb, a fragrance consultant who helped develop CK2, has another theory. I think the market became saturated with celebrity scents, and there was a yearning for a new sort of qualitative fragrance that was not fruity, floral and easy, she said. Hence, the class of more amorphous, complex smells has hit a tipping point, spilling over into the mainstream.

But the future of the gender-agnostic trend is still undecided. Its going to depend on how receptive consumers are, and also how willing retailers are to go out on a limb, Ms. Gottlieb said.

Ms. Yee said: I dont think well see things marketed to a man or a woman. With fragrances, its quite personal anyway. When choosing a fragrance, people dont think about what smells masculine or feminine. Its all about personal preference.",[]

If there was any doubt about why the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan seized the newspaper Zaman last week, consider this: Within 48 hours after the takeover, the paper began publishing pro-Erdogan propaganda.

Zaman, Turkeys largest circulation daily, was one of the countrys few opposition media outlets before the police used tear gas and water cannons on Friday to disperse a crowd outside the papers headquarters chanting, Free press cannot be silenced as it raided the offices. The police acted after a court in Istanbul, without explanation, put the paper under the administration of a panel of trustees.

Before the takeover was complete, the journalists put out a Saturday edition of the newspaper with the headline, The Constitution Is Suspended. In the end, the newspapers editor was fired and efforts were underway to eradicate the papers entire online archive, according to news reports.

The attack on Zaman is no surprise. The paper has been associated with Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who lives in exile in Pennsylvania. Mr. Gulen, once an ally of Mr. Erdogan, broke with the Turkish leader about two years ago and the media group switched from being pro-government to anti-government.

This crackdown is merely the latest of Mr. Erdogans increasingly authoritarian moves, which have included imprisoning critics, sidelining the military and reigniting war on Kurdish separatists. He now controls much of the media and has made Turkey a leader among countries that jail journalists. Along with his campaign to wipe out a free press, his governments prosecutors have opened nearly 2,000 cases against Turks in the last 18 months for insulting Mr. Erdogan, which is a crime.

Turkey was once on track to be a model Muslim democracy, though it now seems unlikely that Mr. Erdogan ever believed in democratic principles. The fact that he is moving the country ever further from that path raises serious questions about whether Turkey can continue to be a trusted member of NATO, which was founded as a security alliance based on common values.

It is unsettling that the United States and Europe have responded so meekly to Mr. Erdogans trampling of a free press. The Obama administration said the move against Zaman was troubling, while the European Union said Turkey needs to respect and promote high democratic standards and practices, including freedom of the media.

They may well be muting their criticism in hopes of persuading Turkey to help contain the refugee crisis that is roiling Europe. On Monday, Mr. Erdogan offered a harder stance, setting new demands for his cooperation, including billions more in aid and earlier membership in the European Union for Turkey.

Thats not the approach of an ally, and Mr. Erdogans turn toward authoritarianism will not strengthen Turkey, NATO or the European Union.",[]

Viewers will soon have to turn elsewhere for snarky snippets from Party Down South and Bad Girls Club.

E! announced on Wednesday that The Soup, the weekly Friday night survey of batty reality-show clips and other TV eccentricities, will end on Dec. 18. Joel McHale, who hosted the show for 12 years, will once again deliver the laughs as he hangs up his signature skinny tie for the last time, the network said in a release.

Throughout its 22 seasons, the show has used caustic mockery to highlight TVs crasser quarters, allowing viewers to remain vaguely abreast of the goings-on on The Jersey Shore or The Bachelor without actually having to watch the shows themselves. (Or admit that they do, anyway.)

The show debuted in 1991 as Talk Soup, so-named because its favorite targets in the early days were trash-talk shows like The Jerry Springer Show. Greg Kinnear, the first host, stayed on until 1995 and went on to an acclaimed acting career. Other hosts included John Henson, Hal Sparks and Aisha Tyler, until Talk Soup ended in 2002.

The show came back as The Soup in 2004 with Mr. McHale as host, and it had a new favorite target: the then-blossoming world of reality television. In its later years the show began to welcome actors, comedians and other celebrities for green-screen shenanigans. Mr. McHale stayed on even as the hosting job led to work in film and on television, most notably as the star of the sitcom Community, which ran on NBC and Yahoo.

In the weeks leading up to the Dec. 18 finale, The Soup will look back on some of its most memorable moments, the network said.",[]

In a 2004 television interview, Bill Moyers told his guest, Maurice Sendak, that hed cheated death, thanks to his sublime body of work. Most of us will live only as long as our grandchildren remember us, Mr. Moyers said. But you will never die.









I have news for you, Sendak replied. I am gonna croak.

This unblinking, unblinkered response was both typical and atypical of Sendaks attitude toward his mortality, as Katie Roiphe perceptively shows in The Violet Hour: Great Writers at the End.

Sendak had a lifelong obsession with death, which he dramatized with ferocity and vitality in his art, drawing snaggletoothed wild things and bakers who leavened their cakes with little boys; when his lover of 50 years, Eugene Glynn, died, he drew pictures of his corpse. In general, he cultivated a mordant persona and was genuinely captivated by gruesomeness. He would be happy sitting at the dinner table, Ms. Roiphe writes, watching a graphic reality-TV surgery show while eating spaghetti.

Photo

Yet in spite of his veneer of resignation, Sendak would still sometimes capitulate to anguish toward the end of his life. There was a howl, Ms. Roiphe adds, a sorrow that was not managed. Even for Sendak, king of all wild things. He died in 2012.

In his 1915 monograph, Thoughts for the Times on War and Death, Sigmund Freud wrote: In the unconscious, every one of us is convinced of his own immortality. But die we all do, and in this elegant volume of five case studies, Ms. Roiphe, the gleeful contrarian and culture critic (her more recent works include In Praise of Messy Lives and Uncommon Arrangements) has set out to show us how some of her favorite writers faced their last days. One is Freud. The others are Susan Sontag, John Updike, Dylan Thomas and Sendak. Her epilogue is a conversation with James Salter, who, though not ill at the time of their discussion, died in June.

Ms. Roiphe does not claim theres any special logic underlying her selections. She chose her subjects primarily based on love, admiration and a feral intuition, knowing they were especially sensitive or attuned to death not just in their work but in their letters, in their love affairs, in their dreams.

She scotches the traditional linear narrative for something more epigrammatic and associative  a wise choice, seeing that death turns time into a jumble and occasions all kinds of reflection and stray reminiscences. Her book becomes a nifty twofer, a meditation on how four men and one woman experienced death both in vivo, so to speak, and in their art.

Sontags story is the largest cage of paradoxes. Her very identity, in some ways, was predicated on the notion of survivorship: In 1975, she was given a diagnosis of Stage 4 breast cancer, which most doctors considered unstoppable; yet she stopped it. Vanquishing death enlivened her, helping create her self-mythology as the invincible genius who solves her disease like a math problem.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But in 2004, when doctors told Sontag she had a particularly incorrigible form of blood cancer, her sense of exceptionalism deserted her, and that upset her terribly. She submitted herself to all manner of grueling therapies. She didnt care about quality of life, Ms. Roiphe writes. She cared about life.

Nothing worked. She never fully accepted that, believing on some deep irrational level she would be the one exception to mortality. Among the many consequences of this denial was that her son could never say a proper farewell: This would mean admitting that she is dying.

And so the book spins, with each writer and thinker reacting to death in his or her own, idiosyncratic way.

Freud, ever the student of human behavior, was so intent on facing death with clarity and rationality that he refused all painkillers except aspirin for his throat cancer. Dylan Thomas, who may or may not have drunk 18 whiskeys at the White Horse Tavern in New York City before slipping into a coma, had such an operatic commitment to self-destruction that his benders could almost be read as a kind of celebration. How could someone with that much life in him die? Ms. Roiphe asks.

In the case of Updike, cancer helped him relocate his voice. His poems in Endpoint, Ms. Roiphe writes, carry the urgency of his early work, the sharpness and swiftness he was afraid he had lost: the power of having something pressing he needed to say.

Death is an excellent subject for Ms. Roiphe, who delights in exploring subjects that upset us. A psychoanalyst might say that her interest in this topic is also overdetermined: As a child, she had a pneumonia so dangerous and acute the doctors removed half of one of her lungs.

My only objection to her book is that it does not precisely deliver on what it promises: a look at writers in their last throes. Ms. Roiphe is, in her heart, a critic, with sensibilities heavily inflected by the work of Freud.

Which means these essays, at their finest, are often literary analyses. In her chapter on Updike, she explores the sexual restlessness of his characters, and how they use adultery as a defense against death. She quotes his Marry Me: He had become an athlete of the clock, bending odd hours into an unprecedented and unsuspected second life. The most poignant part of her chapter on Sendak is how he converted the ovens of the Holocaust, in which his young cousins perished, into an oven from which Mickey, naked in the night kitchen, could escape.

But the point is: Her main interest is in looking at how her subjects wrestled generally with aging and dying, not the moment of death itself.

This does not make The Violet Hour any less enveloping. I read it in bed, at the kitchen table, while walking down the street. But it does mean Ms. Roiphe seldom discusses the most obvious, physical aspect of dying: that as its happening, it can really hurt. I often think of what a friend once told me her father said in his final hours: I cant stand it.

It is so very hard to stand.

In her epilogue  her visit with James Salter  Ms. Roiphe indirectly acknowledges this oversight. He is the first to point out to her that her father, who collapsed from a heart attack in the lobby of his apartment building, must have felt pain.

This shocks me, she writes, adding, Why had I never thought of pain?

And then she explains: Because she couldnt bear to think of her father experiencing terror. Because it was easier to imagine that he made a hasty, painless exit. She suspects the panic, the knowing you are about to die is what made her write The Violet Hour in the first place. Who knows? It may even explain her guilt about phoning the friends and relations of Sendak, Updike and Sontag to discuss the most brutal days of their lives.

What normal person wants to blunder into this hushed and sacred space? she asks.

But the answer is all of us, and Ms. Roiphe does it with grace. Let the wild rumpus start.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Volkswagen Inquiry Expands to 17 Suspects,['Jack Ewing'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

FRANKFURT  German prosecutors said on Tuesday that they had expanded their investigation into the illegal manipulation of tailpipe emissions by Volkswagen, raising the number of suspects to 17, from six.









In line with German privacy rules, none of the suspects names were disclosed.

So far, no suspects are current or former members of the companys management board, said Klaus Ziehe, a spokesman for the states attorneys office in Braunschweig, a city near Volkswagen headquarters in Wolfsburg.

But Mr. Ziehe said that the investigation was continuing, and that prosecutors had not ruled out involvement by top management. We are looking at all levels, including the management board level, he said.

Mr. Ziehe declined to say what kinds of jobs the suspects held or where in the company they worked.

Volkswagen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In a second development, French prosecutors have opened a formal fraud investigation into the Volkswagen diesel cheating, following a preliminary inquiry that began in October. Nathalie Homobono, the head of the French anti-fraud authority, said at a news conference on Monday that a preliminary investigation had found that Volkswagens fraud was intentional.

In the German investigation, the increasing number of suspects, none of whom have been formally charged, raises the stakes for Volkswagen as the company takes a more aggressive stance against accusations that knowledge of the wrongdoing was widespread in the company.

In a court filing last week, Volkswagen said that, until last summer, no members of its management board were aware that software in 11 million diesel vehicles had been programmed to cheat on emissions tests. The filing portrayed the software manipulation as the work of individual employees whose activities could not be detected by outsiders.

The management board of Volkswagen had no knowledge either of the programming of the impermissible software nor of its later use in affected diesel motors, the company said in a document filed on Feb. 29 as part of its defense against lawsuits by shareholders.

The filing was not public, though Volkswagen released a summary last week. The New York Times subsequently acquired a full copy of the document, which was more than 100 pages.

The shareholders accuse Volkswagen of violating German laws requiring company managers to disclose information that could affect the share price, so the dates when top managers learned of the wrongdoing are crucial to the court case.

The illegal software recognized when a car was being tested and turned up pollution controls. At other times, the cars emitted many times the allowed amount of nitrogen oxides, which are linked to serious lung ailments and premature deaths.

In the document, filed with a civil court in Braunschweig, Volkswagen said that the software manipulation had taken place in November 2006 in departments responsible for engine electronics, diesel motor development and motor testing. The cheating occurred, the company said, because Volkswagen employees realized they could not meet emissions rules legally within the time and budget allotted.

Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board began asking questions about Volkswagen emissions in May 2014, after testing by technicians at West Virginia University revealed discrepancies between pollution levels in the lab and on the road.

According to the court filing, upper management at Volkswagen initially regarded the discrepancies as a routine technical issue and did not become aware of possible illegal activity until a year later. Even then, based on similar cases, they expected to be able to settle with regulators quietly and pay a fine in the tens of millions of dollars.

Volkswagen executives continued to believe that they had good relations with the Environmental Protection Agency until Sept. 18, according to the court filing, and they were shocked when the agency held a news conference to publicly accuse the carmaker of illegal activity. The maximum possible fine for the violation is $18 billion, though the final amount is likely to be substantially less.

It was only after the agency went public, Volkswagen said in the filing, that the management board discussed the issue as a group.

Mr. Ziehe of the Braunschweig prosecutors office said on Tuesday that investigators were looking into people who had been aware of the wrongdoing and took no action, as well as people responsible for the illegal programming.

A team of 20 investigators is working on the case, but it is not possible to say when the team would press formal charges or complete the investigation, Mr. Ziehe said.

Matthias Muller, the chief executive of Volkswagen, told workers gathered at the main factory in Wolfsburg on Tuesday that they needed to pull together to overcome the crisis.

Together, we must make the necessary changes to safeguard the future of Volkswagen, Mr. Muller said, according to excerpts from his remarks released by the company. Volkswagen is more than just a crisis.",[]

My father is one of three brothers who thrived in their respective professions, lifting themselves above the economic station of their Italian-immigrant parents. Theyre archetypal American success stories. Buoyed by their good fortune, my siblings, my cousins and I racked up athletic trophies, won scholarships, gained admission to competitive schools, built enviable careers.

So when the generations of Brunis reunite for mountains of pasta and a marathon of conversation, the talk is often like the text of one of those what-a-year-we-had holiday letters. Someone just bought and renovated a dream home. Someone else just directed a hit Broadway musical. Someone made partner. Someone finished the course work for a doctoral degree.

The goal is to catch everyone up; the impulse isnt boastful. But Ive risen from the table and walked away from these occasions feeling pressured, almost panicked: How can I be sure that I wont disappoint anyone in this crowd? What if I arrive for the next feast without shiny medals in tow?

The glory of a close family is that you never lack for cheerleaders, enveloping you in support. The flip side is that you never lack for judges, weighing you down with expectations. Ive seen this not just in my own life but in politicians Ive covered and public figures Ive admired. Like many clubs, a family has dues, and you have to figure out how to keep them from rising too high.

Every year my siblings, their spouses, their children, my life partner and I carve out an uninterrupted week to pack into a beach house somewhere. We prioritize it. We relish it: the card games, the group runs, the cocktail hour. Especially the cocktail hour.

But almost always, theres an awkward instance when a nephews or a nieces disappointing report card, abandoned sport or episode of bad behavior pops up in discussion  incidentally, accidentally. Frequently he or she sulks off, weepy and mortified. Because were the people he or she cares the most about, were the witnesses he or she cant shake off. Were the opinions that cant be ignored. Thats not our goal. But its a byproduct thats maddeningly hard to avoid.

Im more and more conscious of this. Recently, at the prodding of one of my siblings, I had a conversation with one of my nieces about working harder in school. I kept it short, studying her body language to determine the precise moment to end the admonishments. Then I switched quickly to a lighter topic, so that something other than a sense of recrimination might linger. I was careful to say, I love you, but I was just as careful to say it in a somewhat casual manner, not a pregnant, theatrical, shaming one.

Is that the way through this prickly briar patch?

The delicate ecosystem and difficult byways of family were much on my mind on the campaign trail over recent weeks, as I watched the Bushes gather around Jeb.

His stooped, 90-year-old mother, Barbara, trudged alongside him in frigid New Hampshire, making a last-ditch effort to reanimate his presidential bid. His older brother, George W., traveled from Texas to South Carolina for a special rally, where they did an offstage chest bump  perhaps a holdover from their roughhousing as kids  and then hugged.

I took in all of this and thought: What a lucky man Jeb Bush is. Surrounded by so much loyalty. Cushioned by such love.

Days later, he tearfully ended a campaign that hed never seemed entirely sure of. This time I thought: What a burdened man. Measured against daunting examples. Compelled to keep pace. His quest for the White House was a kind of parable of the blessing and the curse of a tightly knit family deeply invested in each members advancement.

Of course few broods fly at the Bushes altitude, with its privileges. But many know its tensions. And many know one of its obvious binds: How do you glue a family together strongly enough that its a dependably nurturing force without having it become an oppressive one? Have the Obamas figured that one out? Their daughters are clearly cherished, but they must also be daunted. Getting the balance of that right is a familys toughest, trickiest work.

On the athletic front, did the Mannings succeed? I bring them up because of all that chatter after the Super Bowl about Eli Mannings mien as he watched his older brother, Peyton, add another championship to his legendary career. Caught on TV, Eli had a blank  even downbeat  expression on his face.

The brothers now have two Super Bowl rings apiece. But Elis recent season with the New York Giants was a bust. Peytons with the Denver Broncos was triumphant. Peyton has always been the larger figure, casting a long shadow, and their father, Archie, was himself a distinguished pro quarterback.

Does Manning-hood entail as much obligation and torment as pride? That was no doubt the question on many viewers minds when they observed Eli during that game. And it probably struck close to home. Theyd wondered the same thing about their own families.

I actually started writing about the Bushes all the way back in 1999, when I was assigned to cover George W.s presidential campaign. I followed him almost daily for the next two years.

It was clear that family, more than anything else, had given him the confidence to pursue the highest office in the land. It was equally clear that family had made him feel compelled to do that  as proof that he was worthy, as evidence that he belonged. It informed all the decisions he made. It warped them, too, so that you couldnt be sure what was genuinely felt, what was pantomimed, what was a reaction, what was an overreaction.

I learned then about a pair of gold cuff links  a family heirloom  that the first President Bush passed down to George W. on the day of his inauguration as the governor of Texas, explaining in a heartfelt letter: Now, it is your turn. I believe those words and that jewelry were presented as comfort, not summons. How they were received is a different matter altogether.

Then I switched quickly to a lighter topic, so that something other than a sense of recrimination might linger. I was careful to say, I love you, but I was just as careful to say it in a somewhat casual manner, not a pregnant, theatrical, shaming one.

Is that the way through this prickly briar patch?

The delicate ecosystem and difficult byways of family were much on my mind on the campaign trail over recent weeks, as I watched the Bushes gather around Jeb.

His stooped, 90-year-old mother, Barbara, trudged alongside him in frigid New Hampshire, making a last-ditch effort to reanimate his presidential bid. His older brother, George W., traveled from Texas to South Carolina for a special rally, where they did an offstage chest bump  perhaps a holdover from their roughhousing as kids  and then hugged.

I took in all of this and thought: What a lucky man Jeb Bush is. Surrounded by so much loyalty. Cushioned by such love.

Days later, he tearfully ended a campaign that hed never seemed entirely sure of. This time I thought: What a burdened man. Measured against daunting examples. Compelled to keep pace. His quest for the White House was a kind of parable of the blessing and the curse of a tightly knit family deeply invested in each members advancement.

Of course few broods fly at the Bushes altitude, with its privileges. But many know its tensions. And many know one of its obvious binds: How do you glue a family together strongly enough that its a dependably nurturing force without having it become an oppressive one? Have the Obamas figured that one out? Their daughters are clearly cherished, but they must also be daunted. Getting the balance of that right is a familys toughest, trickiest work.

On the athletic front, did the Mannings succeed? I bring them up because of all that chatter after the Super Bowl about Eli Mannings mien as he watched his older brother, Peyton, add another championship to his legendary career. Caught on TV, Eli had a blank  even downbeat  expression on his face.

The brothers now have two Super Bowl rings apiece. But Elis recent season with the New York Giants was a bust. Peytons with the Denver Broncos was triumphant. Peyton has always been the larger figure, casting a long shadow, and their father, Archie, was himself a distinguished pro quarterback.

Does Manning-hood entail as much obligation and torment as pride? That was no doubt the question on many viewers minds when they observed Eli during that game. And it probably struck close to home. Theyd wondered the same thing about their own families.

I actually started writing about the Bushes all the way back in 1999, when I was assigned to cover George W.s presidential campaign. I followed him almost daily for the next two years.

It was clear that family, more than anything else, had given him the confidence to pursue the highest office in the land. It was equally clear that family had made him feel compelled to do that  as proof that he was worthy, as evidence that he belonged. It informed all the decisions he made. It warped them, too, so that you couldnt be sure what was genuinely felt, what was pantomimed, what was a reaction, what was an overreaction.

I learned then about a pair of gold cuff links  a family heirloom  that the first President Bush passed down to George W. on the day of his inauguration as the governor of Texas, explaining in a heartfelt letter: Now, it is your turn. I believe those words and that jewelry were presented as comfort, not summons. How they were received is a different matter altogether.

nytimes.com,2015-12-17 00:00:00,Love for Sale: The Shopgirl Has a Pop Cultural Moment,['Ruth La Ferla'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In the 1939 George Cukor classic, The Women, Crystal Allen is the ultimate spritzer girl. A perfume vendor by any other name, as portrayed by Joan Crawford shes a mantrap in a black sheath and pearls, as fetching a commodity as the amber-tinted potions that she sells.









Cukor cast his sales clerk in a hard-edge mold. Yet as an archetype, the shopgirl of pop culture lore persists, turning up this holiday season in a spate of films, in variations that are gentler, kinder, and less predatory than her celluloid progenitors but adventurous just the same  spirited and often chic, heroines for a modern age.

In Carol, the Todd Haynes melodrama based on a Patricia Highsmith novel, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) toils at a department store counter, solemnly conventional in a gray jumper and sweater.

I dont think she cares much about being a shop assistant at all, and she doesnt care much what she wears, said Sandy Powell, who created the films wardrobe, underpinning Thereses sad little pinafore with equally nondescript sweaters.

Photo

Ms. Maras shopgirl knows her place and seems not to give it much thought, that is, until she encounters Carol (Cate Blanchett), a blond Venus who offers her passage to a wider, more opulent world.

Carol is eye-catching all right, making her indelible entrance in a pale fur coat and saucy red hat, her look a sophisticated and tantalizing contrast to Thereses carelessly assembled schoolgirl turnout.

Small wonder Therese cant look away; its as if she had sighted a beautiful alien.

Shes in awe, Ms. Powell said. Her reaction is: Oh, my God, shes gorgeous. Who is she? Where did she come from?

As Eilis, the young Irish immigrant of Brooklyn, Saoirse Ronan is drab in her Peter Pan collars and timid to a fault. Yet she becomes a faultlessly groomed vendeuse. In a trim cardigan and crisp white shirt, she is as much at ease with her customers as she is in a fetching new wardrobe.

Then theres Lili Elbe (Eddie Redmayne), the transgender heroine of The Danish Girl, in a rustling silk suit, ruffles cascading from its collar, trading shoptalk with peers and beauty secrets with clients.

Like their earlier counterparts, the shop assistants of the current cinema share an eagerness to please, their coy smiles, gestures and dawning fashion sense accompanying transactions as emotional as they are material.

Equipped with reserves of taste and apparent good will, they offer style, expertise and friendly banter, tossing into the bargain, when it suits them, a bit of themselves.

The shopgirl-as-commodity seems an apt conceit for a consumption-driven society, with roots dating to the early 19th century, and the rise of the modern department store, a pleasure palace teeming with temptations, not least the lowly sales assistant.

Emile Zola sketched the type optimistically in Au Bonheur des Dames, his story of department store life in 1860s Paris. The tale, and a 1943 film it inspired, turns in part on the fate of Denise Baudu, the little clerk from the country, whose unassailable virtue wins the day and, with it, the heart of her department-store-magnate employer.

A flurry of Gilded Age musical comedies picked up the theme, inviting spectators to commiserate with the shopgirl (perceived in an earlier era as little better than a prostitute) and cheer her elevation as the heroine of her own compelling drama.

In those popular musicals of Londons West End, the young heroine manages against all odds to cling to her integrity as she climbs the social ladder.

Photo

A similar scenario was played out in more recent times. Mirabelle (Claire Danes), the wan glove saleswoman in the 2005 movie Shopgirl, based on the Steve Martin novel of the same name, can scarcely scrape together her rent.

Then she meets Ray Porter (Mr. Martin), the oh-so-wrong Mr. Right, who presents her with a pair of gloves she could never have afforded to buy for herself, attractively packaged with a dinner invitation. What struggling young woman could resist?

Something more is on offer in the latest films. In addition to the promise of love for sale, there is the vision of infinite perfectibility: the clerks as much as the clients.

Then as now, the sales assistant had at her disposal an arsenal of props, tools for seduction and stealthy self-improvement. They were weapons, in fact, something like those of the saucy little heroine of The Shop Girl, a musical comedy set and produced in turn-of-the-century London. Onstage, she trills about how a dear little girl makes up for men.

A touch of rouge that is, she sings, and just a touch and black in the eye, but not too much.

A similarly calculated understatement was mandated at the 20th-century department store. In the 1920s setting of The Danish Girl, sales assistants commonly wore uniforms, typically a black silk frock trimmed at the throat with a wisp of white lace. The objective, said Paco Delgado, who created that movies costumes, was to look like a maid or a well-dressed servant, but with upscale aspirations.

Photo

In the absence of a uniform, a dark suit or dress was required, Mr. Delgado said, meant to convey a hint of luxury and hold up a mirror to the customer, without overshadowing her.

Not that such store-imposed constraints mattered. The shopgirls of earlier eras, and of current films, are likely to have reveled in their newfound sense of chic. But there was an emotional payoff as well.

In Carol, Therese gets a glimpse of life thats beyond her station, her own style evolving as the courtship picks up steam.

Eilis in Brooklyn trades in her self-effacing shirtwaists for a suit, her stylish turnout reflecting a growing self-assurance.

And Lili, a model of coquettish femininity in The Danish Girl, derives her real satisfaction, and something approaching self-realization, from other facets of her job.

The department store scenes in The Danish Girl are key, said the director Tom Hooper, because they show Lili being accepted as a woman by other women.

True, she is positively aflutter in her new black silk dress and tidy bob. But what we see most of all, Mr. Hooper said, is the joy that her authentic self brings.",[]

PARIS  The French Culture Ministry announced on Wednesday that Guy Cogeval, the president of the Musee dOrsay in Paris since 2008, would be reappointed to his post  but for only one year rather than the expected three.

In a statement, the ministry praised Mr. Cogeval, who is also the head of the Musee de lOrangerie across the Seine, noting that he had helped to develop and renovate the Musee dOrsay and that recent exhibits there, like one on the artistic depiction of prostitution, had been met with repeated critical and public success.

But Mr. Cogevals governance came into question last month when half a dozen curators at the Musee dOrsay anonymously contacted the newspaper Le Monde to oppose his reappointment, arguing that he was neither physically, nor psychologically, nor scientifically able to run a museum of this stature.

Mr. Cogeval, 60, suffered a stroke in 2014. The anonymous curators said his health problems had left him unfit to manage the museum, calling his decision-making irrational and his programming extremely fluctuating.

Several high-profile curators have recently left the institutions under Mr. Cogeval, including Sylvie Patry, who left the Musee dOrsay last November to become chief curator and deputy director for collections and exhibitions at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia.

In an open letter addressed to Le Monde, Mr. Cogeval dismissed the anonymous criticism as rumors fostered by rivals vying for his job and denied the stroke had left him impaired.

Although the statement did not specify why Mr. Cogevals term would only last for only one year, the ministry said he would step down in March 2017 to head a center dedicated to the study of a movement of painters known as Les Nabis, which he specializes in.",[]

Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how daily news, features and opinion pieces come together at The New York Times.

Super Tuesday started with a map  a blank, gray map of 50 states stretching across the home page of The New York Times.

By the end of the night, 12 of those states would bloom in color  in various shades of red (Donald J. Trump), green (Bernie Sanders), blue (Hillary Clinton), purple (Marco Rubio) and yellow (Ted Cruz).

It was a way to show Times readers, in real time, how the vote was shaping up in the states that went to the polls on March 1  who was ahead, who had won, how many precincts had been counted, how many were out.

The map was a result of imagination, technology and teamwork; it was set in motion by The Timess digital graphics team and was built using real-time data feeds from The Associated Press.

Color appeared as soon as the first precincts began reporting, starting with Virginia (just after 7 p.m.) and ending with Alaska (in the early-morning hours on Wednesday).

The totals were fed by A.P. reporters, via The A.P., to The Timess infrastructure  and onto our map. And it wasnt just the state totals that readers were seeing; readers could click on individual states and see how each county voted.

States were first colored in pale stripes, but those often changed. Oklahoma, for example, went from Trump (red stripes) to Cruz (yellow stripes). When The Associated Press called a winner, the color for that state went solid.

In many of these cases, readers were being told the winner of each state about the same time our reporters and editors were getting the news. That gave our readers a real-time experience that was once available only from live reports on television.

There was a time, not too long ago, when our Super Tuesday map would have been impossible to put together and display. Even earlier in the digital era, a complete vote-totals map wouldnt have been available until every ballot was counted at the end of the night. (Not to mention that in the print-only era, no map would be available until two days after the vote, and then often only in black and white.)

As primary season continues, readers will see even more states fill with color. And if John Kasich takes a primary or state caucus, we will have to add a new one.",[]

Good morning.

Heres what you need to know:

 3 wins for Trump; Sanders takes Michigan.

Donald J. Trump solidified his lead for the Republican nomination, scoring victories in Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii. Ted Cruz took Idaho.

A focus on trade and jobs propelled Bernie Sanders to an upset in Michigan, but Mississippi strengthened Hillary Clintons Southern stronghold.

The Democrats debate tonight in Miami (9 p.m. Eastern, CNN and Univision). Mr. Trump campaigns in North Carolina; John Kasich is in Illinois; and Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz will be in Florida today.

Check out our takeaways, the full results and delegate tracker.

 Obamas plan for peace.

President Obama, who was unable to broker a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians, is weighing a plan that would preserve at least the principle of a two-state solution for the next president to pursue. It comes as an American tourist was killed in a stabbing rampage in Israel.

Separately, the president is in great health. We have highlights from his latest medical report.

 On Capitol Hill.

The Senate today again takes up a bill to fight the nationwide opiate crisis. The measure would provide hundreds of millions in funding for anti-heroin programs.

The heroin epidemic has grown largely out of a dependence on legal opioid painkillers and has spread to white, urban, suburban and rural areas. Nationwide, 125 people a day die from drug overdoses, 78 of them from heroin and painkillers.

 Missouri Senate filibuster is broken.

Republicans used a rare procedural move today to break a 39-hour filibuster by Democrats and advance a bill to give some of the nations broadest legal protections to opponents of same-sex marriage.

The bill is one of many that have been introduced in state legislatures and in Congress since the Supreme Courts ruling in June in favor of same-sex marriage.

Back Story

The mystery writer Mickey Spillane once said, Im not writing for the critics. They had dismissed his hard-boiled private-eye tales because of their sex, mayhem and violence.

Instead, he wrote for readers, and few American authors ever had more.

Photo

Spillane, born on this day in 1918, had seven of the Top 15 best-selling novels in the U.S. by 1980, with global sales of over 200 million copies.

After tiring of writing comic books, he attempted a novel: I, the Jury. It was a success when it was published in 1947, even though The Times called it a spectacularly bad book.

Spillane then wrote six novels in the next five years. He created Mike Hammer, the heroic but frequently sadistic gumshoe.

After more than two dozen volumes and appearances in several Miller Lite beer commercials, Spillane reached iconic status.

He died in 2006, but his latest work, completed by another writer, was released on Tuesday.

nytimes.com,2016-03-02 00:00:00,"Young Africans, Wrapped in Tradition",['Whitney Richardson'],"The young woman sat proudly, firmly placing her hand below her chin to profile her face. Colorful silk fabric was neatly wrapped around her chest, while the studio light and golden backdrop bathed her gently oiled skin. Small circular tribal markings were tattooed on her upper body. Her neck and wrists were adorned with layers of beaded jewelry.

Just a few hours before, she had been wearing jeans, a button-up shirt and stiletto heels.

This transformation was spurred by Joana Choumali, a photographer from Ivory Coast who has been documenting modern African women wearing their familys traditional clothing. She said these portraits allow her subjects to reconnect with their family history in a physical way.

Even if we dont speak the language or dont go to the village every day, we are still African, Ms. Choumali said. I think its time to redefine what being African is.

That motivation came from her own experiences. Ms. Choumali, 41, was born and raised in Abidjan  Ivory Coasts economic capital and West Africas most populous French-speaking city. She attended international schools and was surrounded by students from all over the world.

But at least once a year, her family would travel to Adaou, a small town in the southeast, to visit her paternal grandmother, Ettien Amalan Louise. The visits were brief, and Ms. Choumali often felt a cultural disconnect with her grandmother: They didnt speak the same language or have relatable life experiences. Ms. Choumali eventually got a top-level job at an ad agency, while her grandmother spent her life in the village working as a farmer and a trader.

When her grandmother died in 2001, Ms. Choumali realized how much of her family history would be lost because she had not been able to talk with her about her life.

I felt like a part of me was going and part of my family was fading away, she said. For a long time, I felt guilty. I thought, I dont speak the language, maybe Im not that African.

Photo

In her portrait series, Resilients, which was recently featured at the Photolux Festival in Lucca, Italy, sponsored by the African Artist Foundation, Ms. Choumali sought to document young, professional African women  mostly Ivorian  who also struggled with the lingering guilt of not being able to relate to their familys traditional past. Over the course of several months, each portrait session required intense research on the specific details of how the clothes, jewelry, skin and hair needed to be styled based on the specific tribe the family was from.

She initially found most of her subjects  lawyers, students, doctors and managers  on the streets of Abidjan. Her sole requirement for the portrait was that the women had to wear traditional clothing already worn by their grandmother or an older female relative. This was intended to emphasize the link between past and present, and also the cultural heritage, Ms. Choumali said. Inspired by the golden hues of Rembrandts paintings, she handmade a backdrop to give the portraits a feeling of time travel, she said.

Ms. Choumalis interest in portrait photography began when she was 13; like many West African families, her parents hired a professional photographer to do a traditional family portrait at home. That same year, she received a camera for Christmas and said she had since been exploring how photography can address social issues. After quitting her job as an art director in an advertising agency, she became a full-time freelance photographer and has created her own studio in Abidjan.

Over the course of her Resilient series, women began reaching out to her to participate. Of her more than 30 subjects, a student studying in France came to her studio with her mother wearing a miniskirt and Converse sneakers. They had descended from the royal family of Grand Bassam, a city that was briefly the French colonial capital in the late 19th century. She had asked the king of Grand Bassam if she could wear her great-grandmothers outfit for the portrait session (image above).

The mother was so emotional, Ms. Choumali said. We dont even know why we cried, but the energy was really special. I feel that they were feeling the same feeling as I felt  relieved and kind of reassured that they were also part of their culture.

nytimes.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,The Decorous Demise of the Establishment,['Mark Leibovich'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

We have a multicar pileup on Establishment Lane, with fatalities reported. The most mangled vehicle belongs to the defunct presidential campaign of John Ellis (Jeb) Bush.









The last time I saw Jeb before the crash, he was speaking at a town-hall meeting in Iowa and seemed to be bracing for something bad. I am part of the establishment, the former Florida governor said in a solemn tone, as though he were beginning a eulogy.

By the fine manners of the crowd, you gathered that they, too, were establishment-bred. People raised their hands and stood in line and waited for the microphone to be brought over. Everything was calm and orderly, as it was back when Republican presidential campaigns always ran through Establishment Lane.

Well save lanes for another day (or better yet, close them all) and focus here on the wounded establishment. What is the establishment other than one of those bloviation-chamber words that political types toss around to describe something that might not actually exist in the real world? No one really agrees, except that to be part of the establishment is most certainly a bad look in todays politics. It represents a catchall designation for people in charge  and implies that theyve been ensconced too long. The establishment is tired and musty and too comfortable. Yet it is still invoked constantly as a phantom solution: The establishment will step in and bring order to this chaos. They are the parents that will arrive home just as the party has grown out of control, the house is being trashed and the cops are taking names.

In the politics of 2016, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are the party crashers. Jeb and Hillary Clinton are the fuddy-duddy neighborhood-association types, and no shortage of contempt is reserved for them. I think the people of Iowa have sent a very profound message to the political establishment, to the economic establishment and, by the way, to the media establishment, Sanders said in his victory speech after finishing in a virtual tie with Clinton. It is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. That was five disparagements of the establishment from Sanders in two sentences.

Bill Clinton betrayed the telltale exasperation that has become characteristic among stalwarts of the establishment when asked about Sanderss health care plan. Every time we try to have a debate on this, they say, You dont understand,  Clinton said.  Were creating a revolution. Youre getting in the way. Youre part of the establishment. 

The establishment used to be a safe space. It represented an established or stable condition, according to one of many Oxford English Dictionary definitions. Membership suggested a secure position in the pecking order of American life. You were a made man or (less likely) woman and were assured a swaddling of fund-raising, endorsements and support from the select committee of the club.

In return, establishment candidates adhered to certain codes of behavior. They would be gentlemanly and magnanimous in victory or defeat and would write thank-you notes by hand on monogrammed stationery when it was all over. They would wait their turn to run for president and not threaten to run third-party. They would not pursue a floor fight at the national convention or pick a running mate who threw around expressions like going rogue. The establishment does not do rogue (the G.O.P. tried that once with Sarah Palin, and it proved not prudent).

Subcommittees abound within the establishment. They include the national-security, Wall Street, academic, legal and economic establishments. They all mean the same thing, essentially: a ruling class, mythical in some cases, but always believed to be powerful. The news media has its own establishment, of course, which works in lock step with the other establishments to perpetuate their myths and nourish the same tropes, cliches and circular logics that define establishment consensus (or conventional wisdom). Traditional journalists are only part of the media establishment. It also includes Internet personalities, campaign media advisers and Democratic and Republican strategists who pollute our cable news.

The various establishments have no borders. No one is proposing that anyone build a big, beautiful wall between any of them. A titan of the business establishment  Trump, say  can migrate freely to the media establishment and then maybe one day come to dominate the political establishment (as of now, hes still confined to Anti-Establishment Lane).

Most of all, the establishment makes for a potent straw man in the hands of people who otherwise might not know precisely what theyre fighting, only that theyre angry and frustrated. The media establishment loves angry and frustrated as a safe couplet of graveyard words to stand in for more precise and judgmental notions  like maybe nativist or gullible. A strong majority of Trump supporters in South Carolina, for instance, believe that President Obama is a Muslim, which could potentially shed much light on the mind-set behind a lot of Trumps support. And according to a recent Public Policy Polling survey, a good portion of Floridians  about 40 percent  thinks it is possible that Ted Cruz is the Zodiac killer. Yet the media establishment is always careful to lump everyone together as the angry and frustrated electorate. To be more specific would jeopardize the solemn commitment to fairness that the media establishment must always strive for.

It has always been politically expedient to fight the establishment. Insurgent conservatives like Barry Goldwater in the mid-20th century used to rail against the Eastern establishment, which implied an elitist, Ivy League and (implicitly) hail-fellow style. Goldwater was anti-establishment in the early 60s, as was Ronald Reagan. They built robust followings. Goldwater wound up winning the Republican presidential nomination in 1964, and Reagan ascended to the presidency in 1980, injecting their brands of conservatism into the core of the Republican establishment.

Likewise, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both ran for president as Washington outsiders, which suggested anti-establishment credibility. But living in the White House carries with it a lifetime membership in the establishment, with little opportunity for escape.

Recent conditions have fostered a particularly lethal stigma against their breed. Grass-roots movements like the Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street and social media (mainly Twitter and Facebook) have energized resistance to the vague establishment. Super PACs have placed huge amounts of political money into the hands of people far removed from the party operatives who used to control the coffers.

And of course, in 2015, a sui generis big bang came along to blow up the existing establishment with stunning efficiency  Donald Trump. Even now, nine months into the phenomenon, no one fully grasps what his rise really means, only that it might actually be transformative and (gasp) lasting and that the establishment, if not dead, really might be changed forever. It is hard to imagine future generations of candidates returning to the same establishment style embodied by Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush or going back to the same well of on-message orthodoxy. They wont spend tens of millions on ads, enriching the same cast of consultants and operatives.

When the casualties of these anti-establishment days are tallied and the saga is explained, there will be many cautionary tales. Once again, Jeb is the early front-runner. His demise was swift and tidy. He wound up finishing in sixth place in Iowa and fourth in New Hampshire and South Carolina before quitting.

Still, the political-media wiseguys and gals remain obsessed with which Republican candidate will inherit the establishment. Around whom will they coalesce? (Everyone keeps using the word coalesce  immediate moratorium on coalesce!) Clearly, its Marco Rubio, the young Florida senator who was elected in 2010 as a first darling of the Tea Party. There is a certain symmetry to his inheritance: The outsider becomes the establishment, for whatever thats worth now.

I was traveling with Rubio in Nevada on the eve of that states Republican caucuses last month. His campaign kept pushing out news of his latest establishment endorsement. They were collecting them like snow globes  Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, former Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Representative Peter King of New York, Bob Dole. Rubio seemed almost giddy about the Marcomentum he was feeling.

Weve had a great day today, he said in an impromptu meeting with reporters on his campaign plane. Weve had a lot of people come onboard and support us today  the governor of Arkansas, a number of senators and congressmen and local officials, a lot of people who were committed to Jeb. Thats what establishment love has been reduced to: a nice consolation prize and lovely parting gift. Trump won Nevada handily the next day. Rubio left Vegas with the love and blessing of Orrin Hatch.",[]

Neil Patrick Harris is collaborating with the producers behind the immersive theater spectacle Queen of the Night on a new, magic-themed nightlife project.

One of those producers, Randy Weiner  whose production credits also include Sleep No More and Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812  said in an interview that the currently untitled project with Mr. Harriss Prediction Productions was in the works, with an opening aimed for the fall. (Mr. Harris will not be performing in the show.)

Mr. Harris has performed magic at a variety of venues, including the Magic Castle in Los Angeles, where he served as president of the board. Mr. Weiner said the collaboration had come about casually. Mr. Harris wanted to work with him on an immersive theater project, he said, and Mr. Weiner reached out when he decided on a magic theme for his next one.

Details are scant but Mr. Weiner did say that the production, which has no opening date, would involve totally transforming 311 West 57th Street  which his company, Variety Worldwide, is to lease when the event space Providence leaves it this year. The site is the former home of the nightclub Le Bar Bat.

Magic is at the core of this venue for the production, Mr. Weiner said, adding that the space would be made to look like a mansion and that there would be dance, variety acts and one-on-one interactions. As with Queen of the Night, there will be a meal, which he said would be an unexpected culinary experience.

Mr. Weiner said he was in the final stages of securing collaborators for set design, choreography and cuisine. Workshops for the production are scheduled to begin this summer.",[]

Ah, the adolescent male appetite. Those always hungry growing boys who eat standing up, drain the quart containers of milk or juice, and are fully capable of finishing off as an after-school snack the whole lasagna or pot of stew or cold roast beef that was supposed to serve as dinner for the family. I have come home to this myself: the teenager who greets his parents in the evening with an empty refrigerator, a sink full of dirty dishes, and the hopeful question, Whats for dinner?

In January, when the recently revised Dietary Guidelines for Americans came out, adolescent boys were specifically mentioned in a slightly unexpected context: Some individuals, especially teen boys and adult men, also need to reduce overall intake of protein foods by decreasing intakes of meats, poultry and eggs, and increasing amounts of vegetables or other underconsumed food groups.

Are teenage boys eating too much protein? What do we actually know about the dietary habits of adolescent males, beyond the sitcom jokes?

Dr. Elsie Taveras, the chief of general pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, is an expert on childhood obesity. The forces that are working against good diet quality in adolescent boys, she told me, begin with that famous appetite. Theyre always hungry, and that hunger, and a lack of satiety with small portions, leads to impulsive eating and eating large portions. And the foods they are choosing arent really keeping them full, since foods with high fiber levels are the kinds of foods which do keep people full.

The dietary guidelines include graphs of what people in different age groups eat, drawing on data from the large National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and showing, for each food group and at each age, how those amounts compare with the recommended daily intake. No one will be surprised to hear that when it comes to vegetables, both males and females of all ages eat significantly less than what is recommended.

For protein, the graphs look very different. For males, intake rises steadily from the 9- to 13-year-old category up through 31- to 50-year-olds, so that by the time they reach late adolescence and young adulthood, males report eating significantly more protein than recommended. Females, on the other hand, report eating quantities at the bottom of the daily standards, and 14- to 18-year-old girls say theyre eating less protein than recommended.

Theres so little research focused just on boys, said Alison Field, an obesity and eating disorders expert who is the chairwoman of epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health. We know that at puberty, boys will acquire more muscle mass, and females will end up with more fat mass, she said. When males go through their growth spurt, which is longer than females, their appetite is tremendous.

These hungry fellows have big appetites, and as a group, they dont tend to fill up on salad. So the primary dietary advice for them is probably eat more vegetables, and the hope is that would mean less meat. What this recommendation really says is that teen boys should be eating more of their calories from vegetables but less from meat to better balance their nutrient intake, Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University wrote in an email.

We know as much as we do about the dietary habits of teenage girls because there has been so much concern about obesity and also eating disorders. Many, if not most, adolescent girls are trying to lose weight whether they need to or not. Eating disorders are less common in males, but adolescent boys, on the other hand, are often preoccupied with building muscle, particularly if they are athletes in a sport like football, where size matters. Males may want to bulk up, may want to be big, Dr. Field said.

We really underestimate how important weight and shape are to males, she told me, suggesting that airbrushed images of models and sports figures in the media promise quick results. Young men are just as influenced as young women by these images.

The extra protein in the supplements that many boys buy in hope of bulking up may be useless. The body can only absorb so much protein, said Jerel Calzo, a developmental psychologist who studies eating disorders in adolescent males and is an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. Boys who are eager to build muscle may exceed the recommended amounts, he said. If youre doubling up, youre only getting the extra calories  sugars and fats. Further, he said, the supplements are under-regulated, and the marketing is often deceptive.

In the worst-case scenario, these protein supplements can damage your kidneys, especially if you get dehydrated, so boys who dabble in protein supplements have even more reason to keep drinking fluids. But again, that can lead to problems, since sports drinks, also heavily marketed to young men with athletic ambitions, include additional refined sugars and empty calories. We do a lot to push the fact that children dont need sports drinks, Dr. Taveras said. Water is just fine.

Although some teenage boys are clearly preoccupied with their bodies, others manage to eat their way right through adolescence without ever making very clear connections between any aspects of diet and health.

The unbounded adolescent male appetite, the athletic ambitions and the concomitant desire to add muscle, taken together with the very deliberate drumbeat of marketing, can add up to a poor diet. To me, protein is a nonissue, Professor Nestle said. You cant talk about protein in isolation from everything else people eat.

The most essential message for adolescent boys and young men is a variant of the basic unsurprising message in the overall report: Eat more vegetables, and substitute healthier, less processed foods for the junk. Oh, and while youre at it, guys, be careful of the protein powders. By and large, extra protein is not what you need.

BEIJING  Migrant workers are the unsung heroes of Chinas economic miracle. Numbering more than 270 million, they abandon their impoverished farms and villages to move to the cities, where they run the factories and build the highways and high-rises that have made Chinas growth the envy of the world.









Now, as Chinas economy slows, the countrys leaders have a new mission for them: Buy homes.

China is looking for ways to get migrant workers to help buy up a huge glut of unsold homes that is dragging down the countrys economic growth. Chinese leaders have eased taxes and down payment requirements. They are taking new steps to offer mortgages. And they have eased the tough laws that traditionally have kept migrant workers from putting down roots in big cities.

The leaders want to turn people like Hong Qiwen into home buyers. Mr. Hong, 32, runs a small pastry shop in Xian, a city in Shaanxi Province in the countrys north. The province has said it will offer mortgages and other help as part of a $9.1 billion lending push to get people  especially migrants  to buy homes.

Photo

But Mr. Hong, a father of two young children who is from a rural area in Chinas east, represents the challenge to Chinas effort. He has no plans to buy one in Xian. I am like a fallen leaf that will eventually return to the roots, he said, invoking a Chinese proverb.

The housing glut is one of the biggest drags on Chinas economy, and therefore one of the major drags on global growth. The empty homes have discouraged further investment in real estate, idling cranes and construction workers around the country.

Investment in Chinese real estate reached nearly $1.5 trillion last year, according to official figures. Economists say the property sectors impact on the economy is even greater when related industries like steel and furniture-making are included. But growth has come to a standstill. After growing by double-digit percentage rates for more than a decade, Chinese real estate investment last year grew just 1 percent.

The precise size of the housing glut is unclear. China nationally tracks square meters available for sale. Government data shows that the space in unsold residential units reached a high last year at 452 million square meters, more than twice as much as in 2011 and 130 times the size of Central Park in New York. (A square meter is a little less than 11 square feet.) Unlike typical homes in the United States, which are generally single-family houses, the typical Chinese home is an apartment in a residential complex.

The real housing overcapacity may be more serious than official figures show. If we take into account the land that hasnt started construction or newly started projects, the pressure from overcapacity will be greater, said Yan Yuejin, a property analyst at E-House R&D Institute in Shanghai.

The problem stems from Chinas lending-and-spending binge eight years ago to stave off the effects of the global financial crisis. With $611 billion in spending, China rekindled growth but added to its surfeit of steel mills, cement kilns and glass factories  as well as empty homes. The glut was further fueled by Chinese investors looking for a place to park their wealth.

The problem is most acute in Chinas less developed cities. Rapid increases in home prices persist in wealthier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and the southern manufacturing mecca of Shenzhen, and analysts still warn of the potential for bubbles.

For now, Chinese leaders seem mostly preoccupied with the backlog of unsold homes. President Xi Jinping was quoted in November as saying that destocking the property market and promoting the sustained development of the sector were important tasks for the coming year. Changjiang Daily, an official newspaper in the central city of Wuhan, likened the task of unloading vacant homes to a battle of annihilation.

Government ministries have responded with a number of measures, such as reducing the deed tax and lowering requirements for down payments. The pressure is on: One Chinese provincial government has warned county- and city-level officials that they will be held accountable if they fail, without specifying the penalties.

Part of the solution, officials believe, lies with Chinas hundreds of millions of migrant workers. Many are from the countryside and lack an urban hukou  the household registration that provides access to social services such as subsidized health care and state schools and the right to buy a home. Originally, that system was designed to keep rural workers from flooding Chinese cities.

Now, provincial governments are encouraging the workers to stay, and many are focusing on initiatives tailored to migrants. In the central province of Henan, the government will subsidize city home purchases by migrant workers and give them easier access to an urban hukou. In Wuhu, in Anhui Province, the authorities have promised easy commercial bank loans to migrant workers.

The policies are aimed at people like He Yong, 28, a driver from a village in Jilin Province, which borders North Korea and Russia. He hopes someday to get married, settle down in the nearby city of Hunchun  population 250,000  and set up his own business. The policies to encourage that have not been introduced in his part of the country yet, but he hopes to take advantage of them.

Here no one wants to marry you and live in the village, Mr. He said. We all want to get a place in the city some day. Being a farmer is tiring and doesnt make much money.

Still, the effort could prove to be tough. Hu Xingdou, an economics professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology, said rural residents hesitated to move into cities because rural services were improving, and they worried about compensation for their land and a lack of jobs in less developed cities.

Mr. Hong, owner of the pastry shop in Xian, currently rents an apartment in Xian, but he doesnt plan to stay. Pollution and traffic make city life unpalatable, he said, adding that he could probably buy a modest home in a small city if he wanted to. Eventually, he said, he will probably settle down back in rural Jiangxi.

I dreamed about city life when I was young, because many of the villagers who went there bragged about the city, which they said was full of new things, he said. But once I began working in cities, I missed home a lot and was not entirely used to the city way of life.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-04 00:00:00,Bravo Zulu: On (Representative) Ryan Zinke,['Dan Brooks'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Welcome to Social Capital, a series devoted to analyzing the social-media presences of celebrities.









The key to understanding Representative Ryan Zinkes Twitter account  the ur-tweet, if you will  is this photo of an assault rifle printed with the stars and stripes, which his campaign offered as a raffle prize during the 2014 Montana Republican primary. It is a ridiculous object: Too garish for the solemn purpose of self-defense, it is similarly inappropriate for hunting, in which animals are not imagined to be in conflict with the United States. But it means something. There is a connection among the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, the American flag and the Republican Party, and Zinke has made it the essence of his social media persona.

As a freshman congressman  he became Montanas sole delegate to the House of Representatives in 2015  he criticized President Obama for participating in the Paris climate summit, on the grounds that it did nothing to stop ISIS. He made the same argument about gun control a month later. In his disdain for the hierarchies of Washington, his attention to cultural signifiers and his fixation on foreign enemies, Zinke represents the post-Tea Party strain of conservative populism. But unlike Sarah Palin or Ted Cruz, he actually fought in a war.

Zinke is a former Navy SEAL. Lest you forget, his office consistently refers to him as Commander Zinke. Shortly after he was elected, he tweeted his promise to push back against making decisions based on politics, rather than what is right for the mission. The mission is the representative government of the United States, and Commander Zinke will be damned if hes going to let politics get in the way. When @RepRyanZinke approves of something, he tweets the Navy expression bravo zulu  at his son Konrad, at the Special Olympian Dakota Shaffer, at CNNs Wolf Blitzer. The message is plain: He is a soldier doing politicians work, a gun painted over with the American flag.

If Commander Zinke were a fictional character, this presentation would be too flat: No real person could bravo zulu so hard. But on Twitter, were all fictional anyway. Zinke has taken the performance of identity that is social media and reduced it to one clear note. Ironically, his relentless message discipline compels us to imagine the man behind the curtain, or the phone, in this case. There must be a real Ryan Zinke, because Commander Zinke is obviously fake. This impression only deepens with the discovery that there are two of him on Twitter: @RepRyanZinke, the congressman, and @RyanZinke, the citizen.

Their identities are congruent  comically, almost maddeningly so. Consider the two portraits he has painted of himself. The official Zinke account offers the bio 5th generation Montanan. Retired #NavySEAL Commander. Husband, father, grandfather. Played 4 #OregonDucks. Teddy Roosevelt fan. Congressman for Montana. Meanwhile, his personal bio describes him as husband, father & grandfather. Montanas Congressman, former State Senator, and 23-year veteran of the US Navy SEALs.

Its a relief, I suppose, that he is keeping his admiration for Roosevelt out of his personal life. Otherwise, @RepRyanZinke versus @RyanZinke is a distinction without difference. His insistence on keeping them separate when they are functionally the same suggests that he thinks of himself as a man with two identities, and that idea is important to him.

Its tempting to assume that @RyanZinke functions as a kind of preserve for his Commander Zinke identity. But @RepRyanZinke tweets bravo zulu, too  for example, at the Montanan and X Games competitor Maggie Voisin. On both timelines and on his Facebook pages, an impressive number of his posts end with some variant spelling of hooah!

In recent years, that military expression has crept through the lips of public figures who did not actually serve. (Sarah Palin wore it as a rhinestone pin.) Hooah has become part of a rhetoric that is not strictly military but military-adjacent  in which actual service, support for the troops and support for conservative politics meld into a single, patriotic brand. Zinke epitomizes this fusion, hitching his identity as a veteran to the disdain for politicians that propels so much of contemporary politics.

About 13 percent of adult Montanans have served in the armed forces; no state but Alaska has a higher percentage. At the same time, the national rate of service is shrinking. In 1977, Congress was 77 percent veterans. Today, that number stands at 20 percent, making Zinkes war record a valuable commodity. But as his status as a veteran advances his political career, he undergoes the same blurring of previously distinct identities  soldier, patriot, Republican  that has transformed his party into a lifestyle brand.

Heres @RyanZinke with an unidentified Vietnam veteran and an inspirational quote: Weve been trained to solve problems. What a sign of relief that is for America.  Congressman-elect Ryan Zinke, former Commander at SEAL Team Six. The implication is that unlike other members of Congress, he has actually been trained to solve problems. This belief in the special relevance of warfare allows Commander Zinke to hold politicians in contempt even as he joins them.

Here he is riding his motorcycle to a parade honoring the Devils Brigade, the first American Special Forces unit. He is wearing a white T-shirt emblazoned with an American flag and the word Independence. This shirt will become conspicuous later in the day, when Zinke appears in a photo with three dozen other soldiers as the only man not wearing a suit or dress uniform.

Theres something sympathetic about that picture. Commander Zinke, rare in his experience and outsize in his public persona, has committed a faux pas familiar to ordinary men: He has dressed wrongly for an event. Memorialized on social media, the mistake humanizes him. It makes him seem fallible in a way Special Forces commanders generally do not.

Behind Commander Zinkes gung-ho social media facade lies a certain vulnerability. If Zinke is a soldier, not a politician, then the business of serving in the House must rack his nerves. In this context, his social media persona becomes a poignant archetype: the old soldier, hyper-competent in situations that would reduce most men to tears, befuddled by civilian life. The irony is that these two Ryan Zinkes seem identical to everyone else.

His hooah shtick is surely exaggerated. But if Commander Zinke is a role he plays on Twitter, it is also the character he has enacted his whole life. He was a teenager once. He had a first day in the Navy. As a soldier, he faced terrifying danger, but at least he knew his mission. Can we blame him for wanting to carry that certainty into the House, where so much seems unclear? His social media persona captures the central fantasy of contemporary politics: that running this country is simple, so long as we are bluff, hearty and unusually brave.",[]

The Barnes Foundation  which is still feeling out its new identity in downtown Philadelphia after relocating in 2012 from its original home in the suburb of Merion, Pa.  announced Thursday that it had chosen Sylvie Patry, a longtime curator at the Musee DOrsay in Paris, to be its new chief curator and deputy director for collections and exhibitions.

Ms. Patry, 46, is a specialist in Impressionist and Post-Impressionism, which is the strength of the Barness collection, built by Albert C. Barnes, a willful and eccentric pharmaceutical tycoon, and opened in 1922. A contentious 2004 court decision allowed the foundation to relocate downtown, a decision that circumvented the highly specific charter and bylaws of Barnes, who had stipulated that his collection could not be lent, sold or moved from its original home. The move, while still unpopular in many quarters, has allowed the foundation to expand its programming and conservation initiatives and explore exhibitions with contemporary artists whose work can play off the permanent collection.

Ms. Patry, in a telephone interview from Paris, said she sought the job because she felt the Barnes was a collection that is known but not so well known, which makes it a very interesting job for a curator. It was so isolated in a way for so many years and there are so many stories still embedded in the collection. My sense is that the relocation has really reshuffled the cards.

Ms. Patry will be joined in re-envisioning the museums shows and outreach by Martha Lucy, a former curator at the foundation, who will be returning as curator and as deputy director for education and public programs.",[]

George Martin, the urbane English record producer who signed the Beatles to a recording contract on the small Parlophone label after every other British record company had turned them down, and who guided them in their transformation from a regional dance band into the most inventive, influential and studio-savvy rock group of the 1960s, died on Tuesday at his home in Wiltshire, England. He was 90.









His death was confirmed by Adam Sharp, a founder of CA Management, a British company that represented Mr. Martin.

God bless George Martin, Ringo Starr, the former Beatle, wrote on Twitter. In a reminiscence on his website, Paul McCartney, the other surviving former Beatle, said Mr. Martin was like a second father to me.

Mr. Martin helped redefine a record producers role in pop music. He was one of a handful of pop producers  Phil Spector and Quincy Jones among them  to become almost as famous as the musicians they recorded. And when he left Parlophone, a subsidiary of EMI Records, to start his own production company in 1965, his reputation as the producer of the Beatles helped raise the stature of record production as an independent career, rather than as simply a record label function.

In the dozen years before he met the Beatles, Mr. Martin produced symphonic, chamber and choral recordings, jazz albums and a string of popular comedy records by Peter Ustinov, Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan. In the 1960s, as the recordings he made with the Beatles rode the top of the charts, he also produced hits by other British Invasion acts, among them Gerry and the Pacemakers, Cilla Black and Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas. He later worked with a diverse roster of pop and jazz performers, including Ella Fitzgerald, the Bee Gees, Jeff Beck, the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Paul Winter, Cheap Trick, America and Ultravox.

His collaboration with the Beatles inevitably overshadowed his other accomplishments. From 1962 to 1970, Mr. Martin produced 13 albums and 22 singles for the group, a compact body of work that adds up to less than 10 hours of music but that revolutionized the popular music world. After the Beatles broke up, he virtually doubled that output, overseeing archival releases drawn from the groups concerts at the Hollywood Bowl, BBC radio performances and unreleased studio recordings that reveal a great deal about the Beatles working process.

Musicians, celebrities and political leaders paid tribute to Mr. Martin on social media on Wednesday, including the producers Mark Ronson and Quincy Jones, who described him on a Facebook post as my musical brother who knew the secrets of our craft that so few know today.

A modest man who had been trained as a classical pianist and oboist, Mr. Martin always deflected credit for the Beatles success, telling interviewers over the years that his own efforts were secondary to the songwriting genius of John Lennon, Paul McCartney and, to a lesser extent, George Harrison. The Beatles, for their part, recognized that Mr. Martin came to the job with a virtually infallible ear for arrangements. His advice and his behind-the-scenes scoring and editing gave some of the Beatles greatest recordings their characteristic sound.

When the Beatles played Please Please Me for him for the first time, for example, it was in a slow arrangement meant to evoke the style of Roy Orbison, one of their heroes. Mr. Martin told them the song sounded dreary, and insisted that they pick up the tempo and add a simple harmonica introduction. His suggestions transformed Please Please Me, which became their first big hit.

Always intent on expanding the Beatles horizons, Mr. Martin began chipping away at the groups resistance to using orchestral musicians on its recordings in early 1965. While recording the Help! album that year, he brought in flutists for the simple adornment that enlivens Lennons Youve Got to Hide Your Love Away, and he convinced Mr. McCartney, against his initial resistance, that Yesterday should be accompanied by a string quartet.

A year later, during the recording of the album Revolver, Mr. Martin no longer had to cajole: The Beatles prevailed on him to augment their recordings with arrangements for strings (on Eleanor Rigby), brass (on Got to Get You Into My Life), marching band (on Yellow Submarine) and solo French horn (on For No One), as well as a tabla player for Harrisons Indian-influenced song Love You To.

It was also at least partly through Mr. Martins encouragement that the Beatles became increasingly interested in electronic sound. Noting their inquisitiveness about both the technical and musical sides of recording, Mr. Martin ignored the traditional barrier between performers and technicians and invited the group into the control room, where he showed them how the recording equipment at EMIs Abbey Road studios worked. He also introduced them to unorthodox recording techniques, including toying with tape speeds and playing tapes backward.

Mr. Martin had used some of these techniques in his comedy and novelty recordings, long before he began working with the Beatles.

When I joined EMI, he told The New York Times in 2003, the criterion by which recordings were judged was their faithfulness to the original. If you made a recording that was so good that you couldnt tell the difference between the recording and the actual performance, that was the acme. And I questioned that. I thought, O.K., were all taking photographs of an existing event. But we dont have to make a photograph; we can paint. And that prompted me to experiment.

Soon the Beatles themselves became intent on searching for new sounds, and Mr. Martin created another that the group adopted in 1966 (followed by many others). During the sessions for Rain, Mr. Martin took part of Lennons lead vocal and overlaid it, running backward, over the songs coda.

From that moment, Mr. Martin said, they wanted to do everything backwards. They wanted guitars backwards and drums backwards, and everything backwards, and it became a bore. The technique did, however, benefit Im Only Sleeping (with backward guitars) and Strawberry Fields Forever (with backward drums).

Mr. Martin was never particularly trendy, and when the Beatles adopted the flowery fashions of psychedelia in 1966 and 1967 he continued to attend sessions in a white shirt and tie, his hair combed back in a schoolmasterly pre-Beatles style. Musically, though, he was fully in step with them. When Lennon wanted a circus sound for his Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite, Mr. Martin recorded a barrel organ and, following the example of John Cage, cut the tape into small pieces and reassembled them at random. His avant-garde orchestration and spacey production techniques made A Day in the Life into a monumental finale for the kaleidoscopic album Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.

George Henry Martin was born in London on Jan. 3, 1926, to Henry and Bertha Martin. As a child, he was a talented and largely self-taught pianist who had perfect pitch and was able to learn classical pieces and popular tunes by ear. While a student at Bromley Grammar School he formed a dance band, George Martin and the Four Tune Tellers. He continued a part-time career as a pianist during World War II, when he was a pilot in the Fleet Air Arm of the British Navy. When one of his performances attracted the attention of a BBC producer, he was invited to play one of his compositions, a piano prelude, on the Navy Mixture radio program.

After the war Mr. Martin attended the Guildhall School of Music, where he took up the oboe in addition to studying composition, conducting and piano. He worked briefly as a freelance oboist and as a clerk in the BBCs music library before he was invited to become an assistant to Oscar Preuss, the recording manager at Parlophone Records. When he succeeded Mr. Preuss in 1955, at 29, he was the youngest label manager at EMI.

Parlophone was a poor relation among EMIs labels  HMV and Columbia were more prestigious  but it had a varied roster when Mr. Martin joined its staff in 1950. He was first assigned to the companys classical projects, including recordings by the London Baroque Ensemble and the conductors Malcolm Sargent and Charles Mackerras. But he soon moved on to orchestral pops, with Sidney Torch and the Queens Hall Light Orchestra; jazz, with John Dankworth and Humphrey Lyttelton; popular vocal music, with Matt Monro; and comedy, with Mr. Ustinov, Mr. Sellers and the Beyond the Fringe troupe of Jonathan Miller, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett.

For all its diversity, though, Parlophone had little success with rock n roll until Mr. Martin began recording the Beatles. When Brian Epstein, the groups manager, called on Mr. Martin in early 1962, the Beatles had already been rejected by virtually every British record label, including the other EMI subsidiaries. Mr. Martin turned them down, too.

But Sid Colman, the director of EMIs publishing arm, Ardmore & Beechwood, had heard demonstration discs of some early Lennon-McCartney songs, and pushed EMI to sign the group so that he could publish their music. The company resisted at first, but finally agreed, and assigned the band to Mr. Martins Parlophone label.

Mr. Martin remained uninterested, assigning the groups first session, on June 6, 1962, to Ron Richards, his assistant. But Mr. Richards found the Beatles interesting enough to send for Mr. Martin, who took over the session and was quickly won over by their charm and originality.

Still, he had doubts. He told the Beatles that their drummer at the time, Pete Best, was not good enough to record. They had their own doubts about Mr. Best, and quickly replaced him with Mr. Starr. Mr. Martin also had qualms about the first Lennon-McCartney songs he heard  Love Me Do, P.S. I Love You and Hello Little Girl  regarding them as derivative. He helped them find the spark that soon became their hallmark by insisting that they think carefully about their vocal harmonies and such niceties of the arrangers art as introductions and endings. They quickly internalized his advice.

By the end of 1963 Mr. Martin was virtually coining money for EMI, not only with the Beatles recordings but also with the hits he was producing for Gerry and the Pacemakers, Cilla Black and others.

Mr. Martin did not at first share in the wealth these successes generated. When Mr. Epstein offered him a share of the Beatles publishing, he turned it down on the grounds that it would be a conflict of interest. He had, however, been arguing since early 1962 that EMI should pay him a royalty on his productions, instead of a salary. In August 1965, when EMI refused to offer Mr. Martin more than a token bonus, he left the company and formed his own production company, Associated Independent Recording (AIR), along with two other producers from EMI and the competing Decca label. The Beatles insisted that EMI continue to engage Mr. Martin as their producer after AIR was established, as did most of Mr. Martins other artists.

In 1966, not long after he established AIR, Mr. Martin married Judy Lockhart-Smith, who had been his secretary at Parlophone. They had two children, Lucie and Giles. He also had two children, Alexis and Gregory, from an earlier marriage, to Sheena Chisolm, which ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife and children, as well as several grandchildren.

AIR opened its own studio in London in 1970, and a Caribbean branch, on the Caribbean island Montserrat, in 1979. When the Montserrat studio was destroyed in a hurricane in 1989, Mr. Martin decided not to rebuild. But he compiled an album of recordings made at the studio by Mr. McCartney, the Rolling Stones, Dire Straits, the Police, Elton John and others as a charity for the 12,000 people who lost their homes in the storm.

In 1993 Mr. Martin opened AIR Lyndhurst, a state-of-the-art studio in a converted Victorian church in London, which has become an important studio for orchestral film soundtrack recording. Mr. Martin remained involved in its operation long after he stopped producing recordings in the late 1990s.

Im there every week, he said in 2003. I listen to my friends who come and do film recording. I love sitting in a 100-piece orchestra and listening. And I still do a bit of writing, and I help a bit with studio work sometimes.

As a composer, Mr. Martin supplied incidental music to the soundtracks of several films, including the Beatles A Hard Days Night and Yellow Submarine as well as Live and Let Die, Honky Tonk Freeway and Pulp. He wrote the music for a recording of Dylan Thomass Under Milk Wood that he produced in 1989, using an entirely Welsh cast of actors and singers. Having made several recordings of his own arrangements of Beatles songs in the 1960s, he periodically conducted orchestras, mostly in Europe and Latin America, in concerts of Beatles music.

In the late 1990s, he toured as a lecturer, speaking about the making of Sgt. Pepper and tantalizing listeners with excerpts from the unreleased session tapes for that album. His last Beatles project was a collaboration with his son Giles, also a record producer, on the 2006 soundtrack for Love, the Cirque du Soleil show for which Beatles recordings were remixed and recombined.

Mr. Martin was also the host of several television programs, including The Making of Sgt. Pepper in 1992 and The Glory of Gershwin in 1993, and he wrote a handful of books, among them All You Need Is Ears (1979), Summer of Love: The Making of Sgt. Pepper (1994) and a lavishly illustrated limited-edition autobiography, Playback (2003). He was made a Commander of the British Empire in 1988 and was awarded a knighthood in 1996.",[]
nytimes.com,2011-04-14 00:00:00,Dana Delany Tackles a Friday Puzzle By Patrick Berry,"['Deb Amlen', 'Patrick Berry']","FRIDAYS PUZZLE  If you do the New York Times crossword puzzle every day, you know that some of them are light repasts and some of them are multicourse feasts. Now that its Friday, we have survived another week of puzzle challenges, and I consider this one by Patrick Berry a sweet finish to the weekday hustle. An AFTER-DINNER MINT, if you will.

We have a special guest with us today, and I was very pleased to learn that she is not only a terrific actress and health issues activist, but she is an experienced crossword puzzle aficionado as well. Among many other roles, Dana Delany won an Emmy for her role on China Beach, co-starred on Desperate Housewives as Katherine Mayfair, and is currently starring in the ABC-TV series Body of Proof. She sits on the board of the Scleroderma Research Foundation and memorably underwent a televised mammogram to increase awareness on the live broadcast Stand Up 2 Cancer in 2008.

Lets welcome Ms. Delany and see how she did:

When I was a child, I used to watch my mother sit at the counter with a drink, peanuts and the New York Times crossword puzzle. Or at the beach in a low chair with her Bain de Soleil and the Sunday puzzle in the summer. It was the height of sophistication for me.

I dabbled with the Sunday puzzle when I was in my 20s, but I didnt make the full commitment until I was 40. I was shooting a miniseries in Austin, Texas called True Women about the intrepid females who pioneered that wild west. They also had a LOT of hair. Which meant spending two hours in the make-up trailer adding extensions and crimping with a curling rod. Or rather, Joanie my hairdresser did; I just sat there bored. So my co-star Annabeth Gish and I started doing the puzzle. I wasnt very good at first but I quickly became addicted and faithfully completed every day of the week. Over the years, I have cut back to only Friday and Saturday with an occasional Thursday for fun. I need to do other things!

Now, lets discuss the iPad and the electronic crossword. It is my method of late, but I find the Google search way too tempting. And I do admit to succumbing once in a while. But not this puzzle. It was refreshing to pull out the ballpoint pen and remember the good old days. I am not sure if I found this Patrick Berry (for whom I have great respect) puzzle relatively easy because I used a pen or not. Maybe its a different neural pathway. Now that I am playing a former neurosurgeon on Body of Proof I should know the answer to that.

This was one of those puzzles where I didnt know all of the answers, but they became clear the more I filled in. I usually like the long crossings, but they may have made things a little too easy.

There were a few movie references, which should be easy for me. However, I actually went to the premiere of The Children of Men (love Alfonso Cuaron films) and did not realize it was based on a P.D. JAMES novel (1A). But I got PIETA (1D) right away, which helped. Not a lot of Michelangelo works that would fit. Again, I saw Eastern Promise, but can only remember Viggo Mortensen wrestling naked in the steam room; was he tattooed? (17A). I knew that the Clint Eastwood movie was The Outlaw JOSEY Wales (3D) but who knew Josey was spelled like that? One movie reference I can never get is all the Harry Potter characters (38A). They appear everywhere now and I think I have only seen one of the movies. Never read any of the books. So I might have to rectify that if only for my puzzle solving abilities. Other film references were GRIPS (43D) and BAIO (52D). I kept wanting the last one to be Adam, because I think hes funny. But I knew in my heart Matter of contention (52A) had to be BONE, hence the old crossword standby BAIO. There were a few too many crossword gimmes for me: EER, EELS, LAM, ACHE, APSE. Do people actually pray in an apse? Thank god for churches  what would we do without nave?

I did like the crossing of SURGEON GENERAL with POLICE SERGEANTS. Those are two words where I constantly have to think twice about their spelling. Which leads me to my final story: My name is a good one for crossword puzzles. As my mother reminds me, its not because Im famous, its because I have a lot of vowels. However, I am famous for being one of the few errors ever made in the New York Times crossword puzzle. They used me as the clue, but spelled my last name DELANEY instead of DELANY. [Deb says: Hat tip to Patrick Merrell for setting up this link.] Which, of course, threw the whole puzzle off. I happened to be doing the puzzle that day and quickly realized what the problem was, as I am used to people spelling my name wrong. DELANEY is much more prevalent. If the clue had been Star of NYPD BLUE it would have been correct. Kim Delaney is a lovely actor and a friend of mine, but no, we are not related. I felt kind of bad about the whole thing, but honored to have a place in the annals of the New York Times crossword puzzle.",[]

IF the gatekeepers at Davidson College had judged the teenager by her ACT score, she probably wouldnt have gotten in. It was 25 out of a possible 36, and more than three-quarters of the students at Davidson, a liberal-arts school in North Carolina with about 1,800 undergraduates and an acceptance rate of just over 20 percent, do better than that.









Her grades at a small charter school in the Boston area didnt carry the day. I was allowed to look at her application, with her name redacted, and what I saw was an impressive but unexceptional mix of As and B-pluses, along with an impressive but unexceptional array of extracurricular activities much like any ambitious high school seniors.

I had to read deeper, as the admissions officers at Davidson had done, to understand why they felt so strongly about her, and to feel that way myself. I had to notice details embedded in her letters of recommendation and mentioned fleetingly in bits of personal information that shed provided.

Shed been reared by a single mother. She had a 6-year-old brother. And for the last few years, shed spent three nights a week making his dinner and getting him to bed while her mom was at work, earning an income so modest that the teenager met the federal requirements for receiving free lunch at school.

Look at what shes juggling, Chris Gruber, Davidsons dean of admissions, said as we chatted about her last week. In the context of those stresses, her Advanced Placement classes shimmered brighter; so did her volunteer work.

And though her high school wasnt chockablock with counselors, shed had the good sense to read up on Davidson and, in her application, lay out a mix of cogent, sophisticated reasons that it was right for her.

She researched the place perfectly, Gruber marveled, and, in all likelihood, was doing it on her own. Everything about her suggested maturity, independence, determination. Forget that ACT. She was a wager that Davidson was willing to make, and she was granted early admission to the class of 2020, which will begin studies next fall.

There has been a crescendo lately in talk about how to conduct college admissions in a manner that brings greater socioeconomic diversity to campuses, making them richer places to learn and better engines of social mobility.

I had extensive conversations with administrators at three very different schools that have made such diversity a priority and were willing to discuss specific applicants whose mettle became evident only upon a closer consideration of circumstances. The administrators explained how such an examination is done.

One of those schools was the Air Force Academy, which has a 17 percent acceptance rate and an especially interesting vantage point. Because its free and funded by the government, it feels an extra obligation to be open to all. Its also legally compelled to look for, and at, applicants in all 50 states.

And because it is preparing its students to be military officers, character matters as much as  if not more than  test scores.

The academys administrators briefed me on several applicants from recent years who were admitted despite inferior scores, and who nonetheless performed superbly at the academy. One had an ACT of well under 20, and yet shed earned As in A.P. classes at her high school in inner-city Philadelphia.

Delving into her background, the administrators concluded that the low ACT was in part a function of a childhood in which shed bounced around in foster care and even lived with teachers. It wasnt a capacity issue for her, Col. Carolyn Benyshek, the director of admissions, told me. It wasnt a skill issue. It was about exposure.

That shed nonetheless challenged herself academically and maintained a high grade point average struck academy administrators as remarkable. They admitted her, and she went on to win a coveted award for her performance during basic training.

Phillip Prosseda, who works with Colonel Benyshek in admissions, stressed that what theyre trying to be sensitive to isnt simply a sad story or a sob story. Its about: What are the candidates life experiences, and how did they react?

For instance, a young woman with modest test scores and grades that werent dazzling had done something that showed remarkable gumption, ingenuity and civic concern: She had coordinated the chain of events that led to the government cleaning up an environmental hazard near her school in an Illinois suburb.

The academy admitted her.

An admissions operation with enough resources to ferret out accomplishments like the Illinois womans and to follow up with high schools and learn more about candidates is key.

The Air Force goes even further: It has a residential prep school where academically marginal students whom it wants to admit can do a year of remediation. Private schools with especially robust endowments could pursue more efforts along these lines than they do.

Admitting students with merit that isnt instantly clear in their transcripts is a purposeful effort, a commitment. Davidson and the third school I looked at, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, do extensive outreach to make sure that North Carolina kids from geographic areas and backgrounds that arent ready-made conduits to top colleges know about them and about aid that can make them affordable.

Davidson sends emissaries to speak with the leaders of community-based organizations and with guidance counselors in less affluent schools. U.N.C.-Chapel Hill is a vigorous partner in the College Advising Corps, which places recent graduates in schools to nurture kids who might not otherwise set their sights on higher education.

Chapel Hills admissions director, Stephen Farmer, told me about the follow-up that his office had done regarding a young man who recently applied for early admission.

HIS test scores placed him toward the bottom of the applicant pool. He had Ds from his freshman and sophomore years. But then there was a stunning improvement that suggested a commitment all the more noteworthy in light of significant adversity in his family.

Farmer and other admissions officers wavered, conscious that if you put students in an academic environment thats too tough for them, youre setting them up to fail. On the other hand, they sensed real grit in him. So they delayed a decision in order to see if his grades from the fall of senior year held up. They did  and he has just been admitted.

Farmer mentioned a similar case from a year ago: a young man from rural North Carolina with an ACT of 22. He was the son of immigrants who didnt speak fluent English and had relied on him, since the sixth grade, to translate for them and even deal with the bank. He devoted up to 30 hours a week to the family business.

He needs a bridge to his future, wrote one of his teachers in a letter of recommendation.

He started in Chapel Hill last fall. For that first semester, he had an A-minus average. And hes proof, Farmer said, that if were viewing everybody through a single lens, were not seeing most people clearly. So we need to get better at adjusting our vision, or were going to miss a lot of talent.

nytimes.com,2016-02-29 00:00:00,"Once Upon a Greek Island, Migrants and Tourists",['Rena Silverman'],"Its hard to imagine enjoying a holiday getaway in an area rife with suffering. But it happens all the time, and not just in the developing world where verdant, gated resorts exist not far from impoverished shantytowns. Consider the Greek island of Lesbos, where sunbathers laze by azure waters while not too far away boats arrive daily full of families fleeing violence in Syria and other hot spots.

Marieke van der Velden and her partner, Philip Brink, decided to bring together these two disparate groups  tourists and migrants  in The Island of All Together. Conceived in May, carried out in August and completed in December of last year, the project includes portraits, a documentary short and an interactive website. But the central interaction is the encounter between two people whose paths crossed unexpectedly.

Lesbos is an interesting place because there are tourists and refugees coming to the island and they are both there for a week or two, Mr. Brink said. So thats how we came up with the idea to ask refugees and tourists to sit down and talk to each other and make a film out of it.

Last summer, a few months after United Nations officials expressed concern about the record number of migrants arriving on Lesbos, Ms. van der Velden and Mr. Brink traveled from their home in Amsterdam to the island, where they found tourists at their hotel and migrants at a parking lot where many were waiting for the next bus to register for transit to Athens.

We knew that people had to wait there for hours, Ms. van der Velden said. We didnt ask them when they were coming off the boats.

Ms. van der Velden and Mr. Brink paired up migrants and tourists for interviews in spots throughout the island. They handed out cards with questions for participants to ask each other, although in the end some questions came naturally. Each participant spoke in his or her native language  usually Dutch, English or Arabic  and used a headset for translations, often made by a Lebanese member of the film crew.

Selma Pabst, a 24-year-old German medical student visiting Lesbos with her sister and mother, was paired with Husam (Ms. van der Velden and Mr. Brink did not feel comfortable revealing any last names of migrants). He was a 26-year-old lawyer from Damascus en route to Germany. Hours before they met, Husam and some 50 other migrants had been packed in a black rubber boat intended for only 30 passengers.

What was your life like five years ago? was among the first questions they posed to each other.

Five years ago I had dreams and ambitions, Husam told Ms. Pabst. I had already started realizing them and I had achieved my goals. But the situation changed and there was nothing more for me to do. Everything in my life stopped.

When Ms. Pabst asked him to name those dreams and ambitions, he told her that when the war in Syria started (around five years ago), he had just graduated from law school. I wanted to work as an attorney, he said. The war put an end to that.

The trip was relatively safe, because I was nearly killed three times in Syria.  Mohamad

Mohamad, a Kurdish, 50-year-old former restaurant manager from Aleppo who spent two years in Turkey before arriving on the island, was paired with Jan Winkel, 56, from the Netherlands. Mr. Winkel often looked surprised by Mohamads candor.

The trip was relatively safe, because I was nearly killed three times in Syria, Mohamad said, adding that his wife and son were still in Turkey and his daughter in Syria.

Its hard to hear this story from you, Mr. Winkel replied. Then you think everything is torn up and we are here with the entire family.

Then there were the two little boys, one from Damascus, the other from a Channel Island between England and France. They sat on swings, discussing soccer players. My favorite player is Cristiano, the 11-year-old Syrian boy, Alaa, said referring to Cristiano Ronaldo. Finn, the other boy, who is 9, agreed. Hes good.

At the end of each session, Ms. van der Velden took portraits of the pairs, which she let them stage. Mr. Brink and Ms. van der Velden also asked participants to take selfies with their partners, an idea that originated because they were trying to come up with a creative ending for the film.

At the end of the conversation, Mr. Brink said, people come close to each other to take the picture, so its really kind of an intimate moment.

On a block where subtlety has no role, they exhibit refined artistry, with color gradients that make it appear as if sheer, feathery muslin had been draped over 16 lines radiating from a compass rose. And as the city continues pell-mell into the 21st century, they are frozen in 1957.

For instance, the Metropolitan Opera House (No. 15 on the map) is shown in Midtown Manhattan, where it has not been since 1966. At Columbus Circle is the New York Coliseum (No. 6). Too bad it was razed in 2000.

Anachronisms aside, the maps are worth seeing and worth saving. And that is worth saying because the Police Department has begun to make plans for a $3.5 million rehabilitation and modernization of the substation.

Happily, City Hall seems to understand the maps importance.

Were looking closely at where and how the murals might be preserved, Austin Finan, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said last week.

The map murals are the work of Edward Meshekoff (1917-2010), an artist, illustrator and designer who was born in the Bronx and educated at the University of California, Los Angeles. His commissions included a childrens playroom aboard the ocean liner United States and the 1952 childrens book The Little Car That Wanted a Garage.

On the maps, childlike delight is evident in the metal icons Mr. Meshekoff embedded among mosaic tiles to pinpoint civic landmarks: an artists palette for the Metropolitan Museum of Art (No. 9), a polka-dot apatosaurus for the American Museum of Natural History (No. 10), a giraffe for the Bronx Zoo (No. 12), an open book for the New York Public Library (No. 17) and, for the opera house at Broadway and West 39th Street, a staff with a treble clef and a G quarter-note.

The map sweeps across the five boroughs and New Jersey, from the Long Island Sound to the Hudson River to the Narrows to the Atlantic Ocean.

Now, this does not look like a representation of police work. But the building was not constructed for the police.

It was originally the Times Square Information Center, which opened in 1957 and was dedicated in 1958, after 66,000 visitors had already come through, putting questions like these to employees of the citys Department of Commerce and Public Events:

My friend is sick in a hospital in New York. Where? Answer: New York Hospital  or so one of the information clerks, Art Tallman, guessed. His hunch located the inquirers friend immediately. Where can we find a good Chinese restaurant? Answer: Chinatown. Why do you folks allow Pepsi-Cola to waste all that water in that waterfall sign up there? Answer: The water in the huge billboard is constantly recycled. Where can I find some action? You know, a dice game. Answer: Not provided.

The police took over the center in 1993, when visitors questions might have run more along the lines of, How can I leave Times Square alive?

Mr. Meshekoffs murals did not survive the neighborhoods nadir totally unscathed. Statue of Liberty icons were pried off both maps. City Hall, the Brooklyn Bridge and a Staten Island ferry were stolen from the east map.

But over all, the murals seem to be in amazingly good shape.

Im assuming that this remarkable mosaic will be preserved and celebrated as part of the restoration and upgrade of the station, said Tim Tompkins, the president of the Times Square Alliance, which runs the business improvement district. (The alliance included the murals in a booklet on distinctive works of art, architecture and design.)

Obviously marveling at the notion, Mr. Tompkins said: Heres a mosaic above a subway, in the shadow of the New Years Eve ball and blazing digital ads, on the side of a police station that has a blinking neon sign  its your classic Times Square mash-up and juxtaposition of things that one doesnt expect to find together. This would be the equivalent of having a medieval chapel with an N.Y.P.D. cop as a gargoyle and a neon cross, planted down in the middle of the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

The Harvard Art Museums, which have been without a director since last July, announced Wednesday that they had chosen Martha Tedeschi, a longtime curator and administrator at the Art Institute of Chicago, to lead the institutions.

She will succeed Thomas W. Lentz, who directed the museums for more than a decade and shepherded them through a long and sometimes contentious $350 million renovation and expansion, designed by Renzo Piano, that was completed in 2014.

Ms. Tedeschi, 57, a specialist in British and American art with expertise in the history of printmaking, began her career at the Art Institute in 1982 as an intern and became a full curator in 1999. Since 2012, she has served as the deputy director for art and research, overseeing the institutes libraries and archives, publishing and imaging, academic programs and conservation departments, while also serving as its academic liaison to local universities and foundations.

In a statement, Harvards president, Drew Gilpin Faust, said that Ms. Tedeschis experience would serve the museums well as the university seeks to elevate our extraordinary collections and integrate them more fully into Harvards intellectual life.

Ms. Tedeschi, who will take over in July, said in a telephone interview that she was drawn to the job because of her deep interest in how the visual and the creative and intuitive can be meaningful to students regardless of the field in which theyre working and training, and that she believed that Harvard was a campus that is so clearly ready to collaborate with the museums.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,An Anti-Semitism of the Left,['Roger Cohen'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

LONDON  Last month, a co-chairman of the Oxford University Labour Club, Alex Chalmers, quit in protest at what he described as rampant anti-Semitism among members. A large proportion of the club and the student left in Oxford more generally have some kind of problem with Jews, he said in a statement.









Chalmers referred to members of the executive committee throwing around the term Zio  an insult used by the Ku Klux Klan; high-level expressions of solidarity with Hamas and explicit defense of their tactics of indiscriminately murdering civilians; and the dismissal of any concern about anti-Semitism as just the Zionists crying wolf.

The zeitgeist on campuses these days, on both sides of the Atlantic, is one of identity and liberation politics. Jews, of course, are a minority, but through a fashionable cultural prism they are seen as the minority that isnt  that is to say white, privileged and identified with an imperialist-colonialist state, Israel. They are the anti-victims in a prevalent culture of victimhood; Jews, it seems, are the sole historical victim whose claim is dubious.

A recent Oberlin alumna, Isabel Storch Sherrell, wrote in a Facebook post of the students shed heard dismissing the Holocaust as mere white on white crime. As reported by David Bernstein in The Washington Post, she wrote of Jewish students, Our struggle does not intersect with other forms of racism.

Noa Lessof-Gendler, a student at Cambridge University, complained last month in Varsity, a campus newspaper, that anti-Semitism was felt in the word Zio flung around in left-wing groups. She wrote, Im Jewish, but that doesnt mean I have Palestinian blood on my hands, or should feel nervous about conversations in Hall when an Israeli speaker visits.

The rise of the leftist Jeremy Corbyn to the leadership of Britains opposition Labour Party appears to have empowered a far left for whom support of the Palestinians is uncritical and for whom, in the words of Alan Johnson, a British political theorist, that which the demonological Jew once was, demonological Israel now is.

Corbyn is no anti-Semite. But he has called Hamas and Hezbollah agents of long-term peace and social justice and political justice in the whole region, and once invited to Parliament a Palestinian Islamist, Raed Salah, who has suggested Jews were absent from the World Trade Center on 9/11. Corbyn called him an honored citizen. The Corbynistas on British campuses extol their fight against the racist colonization of Palestine, as one Oxford student, James Elliott, put it. Elliott was narrowly defeated last month in a bid to become youth representative on Labours national executive committee.

What is striking about the anti-Zionism derangement syndrome that spills over into anti-Semitism is its ahistorical nature. It denies the long Jewish presence in, and bond with, the Holy Land. It disregards the fundamental link between murderous European anti-Semitism and the decision of surviving Jews to embrace Zionism in the conviction that only a Jewish homeland could keep them safe. It dismisses the legal basis for the modern Jewish state in United Nations Resolution 181 of 1947. This was not colonialism but the post-Holocaust will of the world: Arab armies went to war against it and lost.

As Simon Schama, the historian, put it last month in The Financial Times, the Israel of 1948 came into being as a result of the centuries-long dehumanization of the Jews.

The Jewish state was needed. History had demonstrated that. That is why I am a Zionist  now a dirty word in Europe.

Today, it is Palestinians in the West Bank who are dehumanized through Israeli dominion, settlement expansion and violence. The West Bank is the tomb of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. Palestinians, in turn, incite against Jews and resort to violence, including random stabbings.

The oppression of Palestinians should trouble every Jewish conscience. But nothing can justify the odious anti-Semitic anti-Zionism (Johnsons term) that caused Chalmers to quit and is seeping into British and American campuses.

I talked to Aaron Simons, an Oxford student who was president of the universitys Jewish society. Theres an odd mental noise, he said. In tone and attitude the way you are talked to as a Jew in these left political circles reeks of hostility. These people have an astonishingly high bar for what constitutes anti-Semitism.

Johnson, writing in Fathom Journal, outlined three components to left-wing anti-Semitic anti-Zionism. First, the abolition of the Jewish homeland; not Palestine alongside Israel, but Palestine instead of Israel. Second, a demonizing intellectual discourse that holds that Zionism is racism and pursues the systematic Nazification of Israel. Third, a global social movement to exclude one state  and only one state  from the economic, cultural and educational life of humanity.

Criticism of Israel is one thing; its needed in vigorous form. Demonization of Israel is another, a familiar scourge refashioned by the very politics  of identity and liberation  that should comprehend the millennial Jewish struggle against persecution.",[]

A father stops a flying baseball bat that was inches away from hitting his sons face. A photographer captures the moment. You can guess what happens next.









Its been crazy, said Shaun Cunningham, 37, the father from Ocala, Fla., who has been declared a hero in several headlines. The last 24 hours have been out of control.

The near-hit happened on Saturday while Cunningham and his 8-year-old son, Landon, were cheering on the Atlanta Braves in a spring training game in Orlando against the Pittsburgh Pirates.

Christopher Horner, a photographer for The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, took the photo that has ricocheted around the Internet. He was positioned on the third-base line, across from where Cunningham and his son were sitting, when he saw the bat come out of the hands of Danny Ortiz, a Pirates outfielder.

Although Horner knew instantly that he had captured the moment, it wasnt until later, when he saw the photo on his computer, that he realized how precarious that moment was.

Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox. Monday  Friday.

The only thing between the bat and the boy was his fathers arm, said Horner, a photographer for The Tribune-Review for 21 years.

He posted the photo on Twitter that night, but it didnt gain traction until the next morning.

Before I knew it, my phone was getting hot, he said. The notifications have been a steady drumbeat since then, keeping him awake Sunday night while he followed the photos journey in conversations abroad.

It was on Sunday night that the Cunninghams saw the photo for the first time, too.

It made me sick to my stomach, said Landons mother, Ashley Cunningham.

During the game, her husband told her that there was a little bit of an incident with a bat nearly hitting their son, but that everybody was O.K.

Cunningham had some bruises on his arm, but that was the worst of the injuries.

Much of the conversation on social media has focused on why the child was looking down at a phone when the bat came flying. Cunningham said Landon had borrowed the phone from him to take a photo of Ortiz, and was texting it to his mother.

So while he was looking at the picture, I made sure I was paying attention to everything, Cunningham added.

Indeed he was. The photographer said the series of shots leading up to the one most widely shared show the fathers instantaneous reaction, amid a wave of raised arms and panicked faces on other fans in the stands around him.

It was his instinct, Horner said. He was on the ball.

But is it really up to fans to be alert to safety hazards?

In June last year, a woman struck by a broken bat in Fenway Park sustained serious injuries. That was one of the cases that prompted Major League Baseball to recommend in December that all clubs erect protective netting that extends from the existing screen behind home plate to the closest edge of the dugout.

The netting at Champion Stadium did not extend to where the Cunninghams were sitting, a few rows up from the Braves dugout on the first-base side, but Horner described it as typical for a ballpark. A spokesman for the stadium could not be reached.

I made this photo of a guy being a hero, Horner said. But a split-second difference, and I would have had an image no one would have wanted to see.

Despite the close call, Landon, who plays baseball, said he had fun at the game. It was his first professional game  a treat for his birthday, which is next week.

Landon wasnt sure what to tell other fans about his experience, but his mother was.

Make sure you pay attention! she said.",[]

ALBANY  A state assemblywoman from suburban Buffalo was punished on Wednesday after an ethics investigation found that she had sexually harassed a staff member in her office.









The assemblywoman, Angela M. Wozniak, a first-term Republican from Cheektowaga, N.Y., who had promised to bring western New York values to Albany, was accused of having a weekslong sexual relationship with her director of legislation in June.

Speaker Carl E. Heastie, facing the first high-profile claim of sexual misconduct among his members since becoming speaker last year, ordered Assemblywoman Wozniak to stop speaking publicly about the investigation and to cease making disparaging statements about the aide, who was not identified by the Assembly.

Mr. Heastie, a Democrat, said the staff member would be given a new job with comparable pay and benefits, with his salary to be paid from Ms. Wozniaks staff budget in the meantime. Ms. Wozniak will be barred from having interns, and will also be required to receive instruction about sexual harassment and submit to checks of her office at least twice a year.

Though the relationship was consensual at first, the investigation found, Ms. Wozniak pursued the staff member even after he asked to break things off. Ms. Wozniak eventually told her husband about the affair and banned the staff member from working in her district office or attending community meetings where she would be, the committee reported.

When he filed a complaint about Ms. Wozniaks behavior, it said, she disparaged him to someone whom he had asked to serve as a job reference. The investigation also found that she had broken the Assemblys retaliation rules when her lawyer identified her accuser to the press.

Ms. Wozniaks lawyer, Stephen M. Cohen, did not respond to a message on Wednesday evening. The legislative director could not be reached for comment.

Ms. Wozniak joins an ignominious group of lawmakers who have been punished for sexual misadventures in recent years, including her predecessor, Dennis H. Gabryszak, a Democrat who resigned after several female staff members accused him of unwanted sexual propositions and other forms of harassment.

A cluster of similar cases in the last years under the former Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, threatened to undermine his authority, as Mr. Silvers handling of sexual harassment claims came under scrutiny. The most criticism came after the disclosure that he had approved secret settlements for women harassed by Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, a powerful Brooklyn Democrat accused of groping and harassing young staff members.

Mr. Silver, also a Democrat, who has since been convicted on corruption charges, would apologize for his handling of the settlements. (Mr. Lopez resigned in 2013 and died in November at 74.)

In 2013, Micah Z. Kellner, a Democratic assemblyman from Manhattan, was barred from leadership posts, stripped of his interns and forced to cut his staff after an Assembly ethics investigation found that he had sexually harassed aides.

Mr. Gabryszak, after leaving office, was fined $70,000 by the State Legislative Ethics Commission. His seat remained open until January 2015, when a promising young lawmaker arrived pledging to voters to work on issues most important to you, including jobs, taxes and cleaning up Albany. Her name was Angela Wozniak.

Sensitive to the criticism he had received in the Lopez case, Mr. Silver had the Assemblys sexual harassment policy reworked in 2013, removing the speakers office from any involvement with future investigations. Under the new policy, harassment claims are automatically forwarded to the chambers Ethics and Guidance Committee and investigated by an independent firm, Rossein Associates.

The allegations against Ms. Wozniak were referred to the committee in early July, soon after the affair ended. In a sign that the Assembly has broken, at least in part, with its close-to-the-vest habits in such matters, Mr. Heastie kept members of his chamber informed of the investigations progress before her punishment was made public.",[]

Negative advertising has been raining down on Donald J. Trump from his opponents, from super PACs, from issue groups. Now, through a digital ad campaign, the Democratic National Committee is joining the fray.

Were going to be shifting our focus more toward Donald Trump, said Eric Walker, the deputy communications director for the D.N.C. Were not going to be caught flat-footed like the Republican campaigns who made the mistake of not taking Donald Trump seriously.

The group is easing into it, beginning with an online-only ad that it will be targeting on Facebook to voters in Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, which all have primaries next Tuesday, with a sarcastic, trolling video playing off the lawsuits and reports surrounding Trump University.

Trump University, yes, we have run into some hiccups, a smug, faux official from Trump University says, before cutting to a negative ad from Our Principles PAC, an anti-Trump Republican super PAC. He then continues: But we are offering a new program: how to run for president like Donald Trump.

The ad also takes shots at Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, although it is mostly Mr. Trump who gets the brunt of the belittling.

It is the first of a three-part digital series with a Trump University theme, the D.N.C. said. The next video, to be released later this month, will feature a fake Trump University fraternity pledge, and the final installment will be the graduation.

With Mr. Trump continuing to win states, the D.N.C. thought it was time to strategize against him, although it said it would continue to pay attention to the other candidates still in the race.

The Republican National Committee, for its part, has been hammering Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, with negative online videos for months.

The worst-case situations are sounding dire.









Doctors sleeping on cots at their Manhattan hospitals because they cannot get home to New Jersey. A cost to New York Citys economy of nearly $6 million per hour of delays. Traffic jams in New Jersey up to 25 miles long.

But as a Sunday deadline approached for the first New Jersey Transit rail strike in 33 years, railroad and union officials tried to sound a positive note.

Im not a betting man, Dennis J. Martin, the agencys interim executive director, said on Wednesday when asked about the odds of averting a strike, but were going to remain talking until we can get this thing settled.

On Wednesday, New Jersey Transit ramped up warnings to riders, placing red-and-white fliers on train seats telling them what to expect in the event of a strike (delays) and what not to expect (any trains) and listing locations of park-and-ride bus stops.

A contingency mass transit plan would accommodate only 38 percent of the transportation agencys 105,000 daily rail commuters into New York City, leaving the rest to fend for themselves on already overcrowded roads, agency officials said.

There were no negotiations on Wednesday, but there was a New Jersey Transit board meeting in Newark. Stephen Burkert, a spokesman for the rail unions, asked board members to use their influence to help resolve the dispute.

I can only urge you from your side of the table in negotiating that we can get this done sooner rather than later, Mr. Burkert said. I dont think it helps anyone to roll this into a Saturday-night 12-hour negotiating session.

In New York, businesses that employed large numbers of New Jersey residents were busy setting up strike plans. The emergency management director of Mount Sinai Health System, which operates seven hospitals and counts 4,000 New Jersey and Pennsylvania residents among its 40,000 employees, said plans included making room for staff members to sleep if the logistics of going home and returning in time for their next shift became impractical.

We would use spaces that are not patient-care spaces but other spaces in our hospitals and at other campuses, the director, Kevin Chason, said. Cots could be set up and beds rolled into place.

Thats an extreme example, Dr. Chason said, but were prepared to do that, and weve done it.

Other employers were telling workers to telecommute if they could and car-pool or work off-peak hours if they could not. Some were suggesting that next week might be a good time to use vacation days.

Elina Kazan, a spokeswoman for Macys, said some of the companys employees who were normally based in New York could work at one of Macys New Jersey locations.

Were trying to be as accommodating as possible, Ms. Kazan said.

One estimate by the Partnership for New York City, a business advocacy group, said that each hour of delays caused by a strike could cost the citys businesses $5.9 million.

New Jersey Transit rail workers have been without a contract since 2011. The unions have proposed wage increases of about 17 percent over six and a half years, with workers contributing up to 2.5 percent of their pay toward health coverage.

Agency officials have said that the unions demands would cost $183 million and could prompt fare increases.

New Jersey Transit said that if there was a strike, additional road traffic and the need to travel to catch a bus could increase commutes by an hour or more.

Samuel Schwartz, a traffic expert who has been working as a consultant to New Jersey Transit, said last week that if many of the displaced rail commuters who could not be accommodated by extra buses drove to New York City in separate cars, the line getting into the Holland Tunnel could stretch for 25 miles.

Mr. Schwartz said that was why it was important for people to share rides. It cant be business as usual, he said.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Groups Scrutinize White House Plan to Cut Drug Costs in Medicare,['Robert Pear'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

WASHINGTON  The Obama administration touched off a tempest on Wednesday with its plan to test new ways of paying for prescription drugs under Medicare, widely seen as the administrations first serious attempt to rein in drug spending.









Groups representing Medicare beneficiaries welcomed some of the proposals but expressed concern about others. Drug manufacturers and some cancer doctors criticized the initiative, saying it placed too much emphasis on saving money and too little on ensuring patients access to treatment.

I deal every day with people fighting for their lives, and I am more sympathetic to them, their desire to live and to get the right treatment, said Ellen V. Sigal, the founder and chairwoman of Friends of Cancer Research, a public education and advocacy group, even as she noted her concern about rising drug costs.

Under the proposal, announced Tuesday, Medicare would try a half-dozen new ways of paying for prescription drugs in Part B of Medicare, under which $20 billion was spent last year on medications administered in doctors offices and hospital outpatient departments.

The announcement is only a proposal for a test, but it has huge implications for the pharmaceutical industry, especially for the big, fast-growing category of specialty drugs known as biologics. The proposal could, for the first time, link Medicare payments to the effectiveness of a drug and the cost of comparable medications  factors not normally considered in the current reimbursement formula, which is based on the average sales price of drugs, with an additional 6 percent allowance for storage and handling costs.

For decades, Congress has legislated Medicare payment rates in minute detail. But the Affordable Care Act authorized the secretary of health and human services to test new payment and service delivery models and adopt them nationwide if they save money without harming the quality of care.

Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the health secretary, has shown she is willing to make aggressive use of this power, with the blessing of President Obama.

The Republican chairmen of three powerful congressional committees denounced the administrations plan on Wednesday, describing it, in a joint statement, as another troubling example of unelected bureaucrats making decisions behind closed doors. The proposal could limit access to care for some of the sickest Medicare beneficiaries, said the statement, issued by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Representatives Fred Upton of Michigan, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.

The Obama administration said its proposal would not interfere in any way with the medical judgment of doctors or their ability to order reasonable and necessary Part B drugs as appropriate. It did say, We intend to achieve savings, though officials could not say how much. The administration said it expected to change the prescribing behavior of doctors by giving them financial incentives to choose less expensive drugs that are at least as effective as more costly medications.

Stacy J. Sanders, the federal policy director at the Medicare Rights Center, a consumer advocacy group, welcomed the proposal, saying it would reduce the incentive for doctors to prescribe drugs that are expensive and ultimately unaffordable for low- and middle-income people who have no supplemental insurance.

Other advocates were cautious in their initial reactions.

Leslie B. Fried, a health lawyer at the National Council on Aging, a service and advocacy group, said: If this is a way to take account of the value of treatments and control Part B costs, thats a good thing. But we also have to be concerned about access to care for beneficiaries. Its a balance.

In a notice to be published in the Federal Register on Friday, the administration says it wants to require mandatory participation for doctors and hospitals that provide Part B drugs to Medicare beneficiaries in geographic areas selected for the test, a large part of the country. In three-fourths of the nations 7,000 primary care service areas, Medicare would pay for Part B drugs using reimbursement formulas different from the ones in the Medicare law.

Congress has provided broad bipartisan support for Mr. Obamas plan to collect genetic data on one million volunteers so scientists can develop drugs and treatments tailored to the characteristics of individual patients. Some of the most enthusiastic supporters of this precision medicine initiative expressed concern about the new Medicare drug payment model.

We are moving into an era of personalized medicine, said Leslie Ritter, a vice president of the Society for Womens Health Research, a nonprofit advocacy group. The primary focus should be on the patient, not on costs. In many cases, we dont know what works best for patients because women and members of minority groups were not adequately represented in clinical trials.

Two influential lobbies, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, strenuously opposed the administrations plan, saying it could put Medicare patients at risk. Prices for new cancer drugs often exceed $100,000 a year, and it is not unusual to see television commercials and magazine advertisements promoting such treatments.

Dr. Allen S. Lichter, the chief executive of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which represents cancer doctors, said the administration had identified a real problem, the skyrocketing prices of drugs.

John H. Gutfreund, whose aggressive leadership of Salomon Brothers and extravagant lifestyle personified the meteoric rise and fall of Wall Street moguls in the heady 1980s, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 86.









His son J. P. Gutfreund confirmed the death, at New York Presbyterian-Cornell Hospital, saying the cause was pneumonia.

As chairman and chief executive of Salomon, the giant investment firm, Mr. Gutfreund (pronounced GOOD-friend) was called the king of Wall Street for having transformed his company into one of the worlds largest securities traders. He was hailed as one of Wall Streets most brilliant and innovative players.

Under his guidance, Salomon became the leading dealer in United States Treasury bonds, the predominant underwriter of corporate securities, and a pioneer in turning ordinary home mortgages into tradeable securities.

But his Wall Street career abruptly ended in 1991, when he was forced to resign after Salomon became embroiled in a major scandal involving illegal bids by the firm for Treasury bonds.

For much of the previous decade, his name had appeared as much in the society columns as it did on the financial pages. He and his second wife, Susan Gutfreund, drew breathless coverage for the lavish sums they spent to refurbish their Manhattan apartment and Paris townhouse, to rent a British castle and a French museum for parties, and to finance weekend trips to Europe on the supersonic Concorde for shopping sprees.

Womens Wear Daily regularly referred to the voluble Mrs. Gutfreund as Social Susie and to her dour-looking husband as Solemn John.

At work, Mr. Gutfreund, a short, stocky balding man, was known for a gruff demeanor, foul language and an ever-lit cigar  fitting the stereotypical image of securities traders who made their fortunes shouting orders and cursing each other across the trading floor. His advice to novice traders  to wake up each morning ready to bite the ass off a bear  became a Wall Street dictum.

Mr. Gutfreund liked to roam Salomon Brothers cavernous trading room firing questions at startled employees on their bond deals, especially those that were souring.

An eerie sixth sense guided him to wherever a crisis was unfolding, Michael Lewis wrote in Liars Poker, a 1989 best seller about the authors experience as a young bond trader at Salomon. Gutfreund seemed able to smell money being lost, he wrote, adding, He was the last person a nerve-racked trader wanted to see.

Once his 12-hour workday was over, though, Mr. Gutfreund shed the blunt, coarse manner. Wearing large, owlish eyeglasses, he was a smartly tailored dresser who affected a near-British accent as he spoke wistfully of his decision to forgo a career as a literature professor.

Invited to join numerous blue-blood charities, he opted for a lower-profile appointment to the board of the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, where he occasionally volunteered to prepare meals and wash dishes. He was content to show up regularly at black-tie charity fund-raisers.

The Gutfreunds social life received far more press coverage than their acts of social conscience. In one instance they were sued for hoisting a giant Christmas tree into their Manhattan apartment using a crane placed on the terrace of a penthouse without the tenants permission. In Britain they rented Blenheim Palace, the Churchill familys ancestral home outside Oxford, to host a party with several hundred guests.

For Mr. Gutfreunds 60th birthday, his wife threw a bash at the Musee Carnavalet in Paris and bought two seats on the Concorde so that the cake and its baker could be flown over from New York.

But only two years later, Mr. Gutfreunds business reputation and social standing were in tatters. He seemed powerless to control infighting at Salomon, which led to the departure of talented senior executives. Other Wall Street firms outdistanced Salomon after its profits declined and its costs spun out of control.

Mr. Gutfreund barely managed to ward off an attempt by a corporate raider to take over Salomon. And then he was driven from Wall Street by scandal, after he and other Salomon executives failed to report illegal bids in the Treasury securities market. He settled potential charges of fraud by paying a fine and agreeing never to manage another securities firm.

No apologies to anybody, he told Salomons stunned managing directors in announcing his resignation in August 1991. What happened, happened.

John Halle Gutfreund was born in Manhattan on Sept. 14, 1929, to Manuel and Mary Gutfreund. His father, originally a butcher, became a meat wholesaler and distributor and was able to move his family to affluent Scarsdale in Westchester County. John attended Lawrenceville, the boarding school in New Jersey, and then Oberlin College in Ohio, where he majored in English. Drafted into the Army, Mr. Gutfreund served in the Korean War.

Returning to civilian life, he briefly considered pursuing a scholars career in literature but in the end opted for finance and joined Salomon Brothers, recruited by William R. Salomon, a family acquaintance whose father had helped found the firm and who became a managing partner.

A New World of Finance

Mr. Gutfreund started in 1953 as a $45-a-week trainee on the municipal bond desk. In 1958, he married Joyce Low, daughter of a Wall Street financier, and they had three sons. By 1963, Mr. Gutfreund had become Salomons youngest nonfamily partner.

In those days, Salomon, despite its more than 50-year existence, was little known outside of Wall Street because its clients were in the wholesale trade  banks, insurance companies and pension funds for whom Salomon acted as a broker, buying and selling stocks and bonds. Investment firms at the time had none of the cachet they would later acquire. In the 1960s, more than half of Salomons partners did not have college degrees.

But by the time Mr. Gutfreund became managing partner in 1978 on the retirement of Mr. Salomon, investment firms were attracting the brightest university graduates with bountiful salaries.

The money earned by senior Wall Street managers could be astronomical for their day, as Mr. Gutfreund demonstrated in 1981, when he sold Salomon Brothers to Phibro Corporation, a $26-billion-a-year commodity merchant. The sale, for $483 million, brought Salomon partners an average of $7.8 million.

Mr. Gutfreund made more than $35 million and earned $3 million more in annual salary as chief executive of Salomon Brothers, which became the financial subsidiary of the new parent company, Phibro Salomon. At the time, that was a whopping compensation package for a Wall Street executive.

The Phibro deal was initially hailed as pathbreaking. I think the combined Phibro-Salomon operation may well develop new ways of financing and innovative financial instruments, said Felix G. Rohatyn, a partner of Lazard Freres & Company, in a 1981 interview with The New York Times. And Phibro was considered the dominant partner, with a greater capacity to generate profits.

But both views soon proved mistaken. The falling prices of world commodities cut into Phibros profits, while soaring stock prices and bond sales earned huge commissions for Salomon. Then in 1984, Mr. Gutfreund carried out a stunning executive suite coup by persuading the Phibro-Salomon board to name him chief executive of the company in place of David Tendler, who as chairman of Phibro had made the deal to buy Salomon. Phibro became a financial albatross, and Phibro-Salomon was renamed Salomon Inc. a few years later.

The King of Wall Street

By 1985, Mr. Gutfreund was at the top of the financial world. Business Week labeled him the king of Wall Street. American consumers, corporations and governments, from municipal to federal levels, were borrowing enormous quantities of money, causing an explosive growth in bonds. And no Wall Street firm knew more about the valuation, trading and sale of bonds than Salomon.

Salomons competitive advantage over rivals was demonstrated by its early dominance in mortgage securities. Mortgages had never been considered tradable securities until Mr. Gutfreund appointed a young Salomon executive, Lewis Ranieri, as head trader of a new mortgage security department  Wall Streets first  in 1978. Under Mr. Ranieri, Salomon began buying home loans and repackaging them as bonds backed with government guarantees.

Mr. Gutfreund, who lived in Manhattan, married Susan Kaposta in 1981; both of their first marriages had ended in divorce. She survives him. Besides his son J. P., from his second marriage, he is survived by three other sons, Nicholas, Owen and Joshua, from his first marriage to Joyce Low; and four grandchildren.

As Mr. Gutfreund rose on Wall Street, so did his profile in New York society. Susan Gutfreund was an inveterate party-giver, an enthusiastic antiques collector and a lover of high fashion. Friends quoted her as lamenting, Its so expensive being rich.

Mr. Gutfreunds reputation for extravagance soon fed rumors that her husband was uncharacteristically failing to rein in spending at Salomon Brothers.

When I made John heir-apparent, he was the most conservative person in the partnership, no question, William Salomon told James Sterngold of The Times in 1988. He added, If you turned in an expense account, and you had taken a client to Caravelle for dinner or something, John would ask you if it was really necessary. I thought that was a good example for the boys.

For some on Wall Street ballooning expense accounts were only a small symptom of a wider problem at Salomon. At times it was as if we had no management at all, Mr. Lewis wrote in Liars Poker. No one put a stop to the infighting; no one gave us a sense of direction.

Salomons top economic guru, Henry Kaufman, left the firm, and soon Mr. Ranieri, the master of mortgage bonds, did, too. Dozens of young, talented Salomon traders were being wooed away by Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other rival firms.

Salomon and Mr. Gutfreund seemed to have lost their knack for innovations. At Drexel Burnham, a brilliant young executive named Michael Milken pioneered and dominated the extremely profitable market in junk bonds  high-risk bonds issued by companies with low credit ratings. Salomon also fell behind Drexel Burnham and other firms brokering the lucrative boom in leveraged buyouts and hostile corporate takeovers. Then the bond market crash in the spring of 1987 left Salomon reeling and vulnerable.

That same year, Ronald O. Perelman, the chairman of the cosmetics company Revlon and a notorious corporate raider, purchased a large stake in Salomon and tried to buy enough additional shares to take over the investment firm. Desperately searching for a white knight to foil the Perelman bid, Mr. Gutfreund successfully enlisted Warren E. Buffett, Wall Streets most fabled investor, who had a reputation for holding on to shares for many years and for not interfering with the management of firms in which he invested.

The strategy worked, and Mr. Perelman beat a hasty retreat. But Mr. Buffett drove a hard bargain: His investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, bought $700 million of convertible preferred stock  equivalent to 9 percent of Salomons common shares if Mr. Buffett chose to convert his holdings  and was given two seats on Salomons board. At the time, the deal amounted to buying Salomon stock at a large discount.

For the next few years, Mr. Gutfreund seemed to steady Salomons keel. Though the firm failed to achieve the growth levels of the first half of the 1980s, it managed to bounce back from the bond and stock market crashes of 1987. But then, in 1991, an unforeseen and badly managed episode involving the purchase of Treasury bonds spelled doom for Mr. Gutfreund and almost sank Salomon.

The Reckoning

According to government regulations, no purchaser could bid more than 35 percent of the Treasury bonds up for sale at an auction. An investment firm, however, was allowed to exceed this percentage by acting as a broker for customers. Paul Mozer, Salomons chief government bond trader, far exceeded the 35 percent limit in a February 1991 auction of Treasury bonds, and compounded the illegality of this action by putting in bids in the name of customers who had never asked to purchase the bonds.

Although Mr. Gutfreund and other Salomon executives were told of Mr. Mozers transgression, they did not report it to the federal government for four months. When the government was finally informed, Salomon admitted that it had purchased substantially more than the 35 percent limit in several other Treasury auctions. Mr. Mozer was dismissed. No one was arrested or indicted.

Traders and analysts on Wall Street feared the scandal would discredit the American securities market worldwide and raise the governments cost of financing its debt.

The way our business operates is because everybody is completely honest, an unnamed senior Wall Street executive with a background in the Treasury securities market told The Times in 1991. You transfer billions of dollars on a phone call, my word to your word. And these people lied.

Mr. Gutfreund resigned as chairman and chief executive of Salomon, as did the firms president, Thomas W. Strauss, and the vice chairman, John W. Meriwether.

With fears rising that the government might shut down Salomon, the firms board invited Mr. Buffett, a man with a sterling reputation both in the financial community and among government regulators, to become chairman and chief executive on an interim basis. Mr. Buffett quickly agreed to cooperate with government investigators.

In May 1992, Salomon paid $290 million in fines to the government, acknowledged that it had on occasion submitted bogus bids to buy more Treasury securities than regulations allowed, and admitted that its senior executives, including Mr. Gutfreund, knew about the fraudent bids but failed to make them public or report them to government officials.

Mr. Gutfreunds troubles were not over. In settling government charges against him, he agreed to never again run a securities firm and to pay a $100,000 fine. For years he battled a $300 million suit filed by private lawyers on behalf of Salomon shareholders who felt that the bidding scandal had caused the value of their stock to decline. Mr. Gutfreund spent more than $5 million of his own money on legal fees trying to get Salomon to pay him more than $15 million, which he insisted the firm owed him in retirement and option plans.

No one understands why Salomon is continuing with this vendetta, Mr. Gutfreund said in a 1994 interview. Salomon has shown no caring for me in any way.

But an arbitration proceeding ruled entirely in Salomons favor, apparently heeding the firms contentions that it almost perished as a result of Mr. Gutfreunds actions, that he had deceived Salomons board and that he should have been fired for cause  thus making him ineligible for the compensation he was claiming.

Salomon Brothers was acquired in 1998 by Citigroup and five years later ceased to exist under its own name.

In a 1998 interview with The Times, Mr. Gutfreund seemed reconciled to his fall from grace. His legal problems  which he said had cost him more than $11 million  were behind him, and he was running his own small investment consulting firm.

What I have learned, or at least belatedly remembered, is that there is the possibility of a satisfying life that is broader than the Street, he said. I never thought of myself as a king. People really want you to be their deity. They forget the fact that you are a person who has feelings and doubts.",[]

An auction house official from Beverly Hills, Calif., pleaded guilty in a New York City court for his part in a scheme to traffic items made of rhinoceros horn, elephant ivory and coral worth at least $1 million, federal prosecutors said on Wednesday.

The official, Joseph Chait, faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for charges related to conspiring to smuggle wildlife products, according to a statement from the United States attorneys office for the Southern District of New York. He is expected to be sentenced in June.

Prosecutors said Mr. Chait, 38, falsely claimed on customs forms that items of rhinoceros horn or elephant ivory were made of bone, wood or plastic.

Among the allegations, prosecutors said that in 2011, in New York City, he and his partners agreed to sell a carving of a figure made of rhinoceros horn even though they knew it was not an antique. (Trade of such items is restricted unless they can be proved to be over 100 years old.)

When the piece sold for $230,000 at auction, he offered to make a fake invoice saying it was plastic and worth just $108.75.

Mr. Chait took full responsibility for his conduct, and is very sorry for his actions, his lawyer, Judith H. Germano, said.",[]

Since late January, the immigration authorities have arrested 336 migrants from Central America for deportation, part of a continuing operation to toughen border enforcement, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Wednesday.

Most of the people detained were youths who crossed the border in the last two years without their parents and who have turned 18, but did not win asylum or another legal status and were ordered deported by immigration courts. After migrants turn 18, they lose some protections given to minors who arrived without their parents.

The Obama administration is moving ahead with deportations of migrants fleeing from three violence-racked countries in Central America, despite a furor among refugee advocates, Latino groups and Democratic lawmakers after about 120 migrants were arrested and targeted for deportation in a roundup in early January.

Mr. Johnson has said, at times defiantly, that the deportations are necessary to maintain border security and curb illegal crossings. In a statement on Wednesday, he said he had ordered Operation Border Guardian, which began on Jan. 23, to continue the arrests and expulsions. Since Oct. 1, a total of 28,808 people apprehended at the border have been sent back to Central America on repatriation flights, officials said, and 128,000 Mexicans were returned to their country.

We must and will enforce the law in accordance with our enforcement priorities, Mr. Johnson said.

The deportations in January caused widespread alarm in immigrant communities. More than 100 senators and House representatives, almost all Democrats, wrote to President Obama demanding an end to the raids. The contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, also denounced the raids and pledged to end them if elected.

Most of the migrants arrested in early January were women and their children. Less than half of them, including young children, had been represented by lawyers in their asylum cases in court, records showed.",[]

KANSAS CITY, Kan.  A Mexican man who stands accused of murdering five people and was captured Wednesday was in the country illegally and should have been jailed or deported last year, federal immigration officials said, but three times in less than a year, he was arrested and allowed to go free because of procedural errors.









Pablo A. Serrano-Vitorino, 40, who was caught after a manhunt across two states, had a felony conviction on his record, had been deported once before and had returned to the United States illegally.

In November 2014, he was convicted of a misdemeanor drunken driving in Coffey County, Kan., but Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, which did not know he was in the country, has no record that the local authorities notified the agency, said Gillian Christensen, the press secretary for the agency. Some law enforcement agencies do not routinely notify the agency of possible undocumented immigrants unless they are charged with felonies.

Last June, Mr. Serrano-Vitorino was arrested here on a domestic battery charge, and the police notified the immigration agency but did not send his fingerprints, Ms. Christensen said. In that situation, she said, the agency first verifies peoples identities in person before asking the police to hold them for possible deportation. But Mr. Serrano-Vitorino was released before that could happen.

And in September, the agency received notice that Mr. Serrano-Vitorino was in court in Overland Park, Kan., after an arrest on a charge of driving without a license. In that case, the agency did ask that he be held, but conceded Wednesday that it had sent the request to the wrong agency  to the sheriffs office, which did not have him in custody, rather than to the court. Once again, he went free.

Jerome A. Gorman, the district attorney of Wyandotte County, which includes this city, said Wednesday that he would like to talk with the agency about what happened. We cant go on this way, he said, and something needs to be corrected so the system works properly.

Studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born people, and the Obama administration has increased deportations to record levels. But Donald J. Trump has made the threat posed by immigrants a theme of his presidential campaign, saying that many people coming from Mexico are rapists, murderers and drug dealers. He has promised to deport all undocumented immigrants and build a wall on the border with Mexico.

Some high-profile cases have fed the concerns over immigrants, particularly the killing last July of a young woman on a pier in San Francisco by a man who had been deported to Mexico multiple times.

In 2002, when Mr. Serrano-Vitorino was not in custody, a court ordered him deported. The next year, he was convicted in California of making a terrorist threat and sent to prison. He was sent back to Mexico in 2004 when he was released.

When he returned to the United States is unclear, but he had been living for some time in this area. Most recently, he lived in a small house on a cul-de-sac in a working-class, mostly white neighborhood. Officials said he lived with a woman and her three children, one of whom was also his.

Michael L. Capps, 41, had lived for several years in the house next door to Mr. Serrano-Vitorino.

Late Monday, the police responded to a report of gunshots at Mr. Cappss home. They found four men dead or dying: Mr. Capps; Jeremy D. Waters, 36; Clint E. Harter, 27; and Austin L. Harter, 29. All four had been shot with a rifle, and no other weapons were involved, Mr. Gorman said.

The hunt for Mr. Serrano-Vitorino included several agencies from Kansas and Missouri, and nearly 100 officers. On Tuesday morning, it shifted to rural Montgomery County, Mo., 170 miles east of here, when Mr. Serranos truck was spotted, abandoned on Interstate 70. Minutes later came a report of a shooting nearby: Randy J. Nordman, 49, had been killed at home by an intruder.

Later that day, a citizen had called in and notified us that while he was in that area, a subject approached him with a gun, said Sgt. Scott White of the Missouri Highway Patrol.

At 12:18 a.m. on Wednesday, they found Mr. Serrano-Vitorino in a ditch, with a rifle nearby, and he was arrested without incident, Sergeant White said.

He has been charged with the four killings in Kansas and the one in Missouri, and is being held in Montgomery County. Mr. Gorman said it had not yet been decided where he would be prosecuted first.",[]

BATON ROUGE, La.  Facing the threat of layoffs, cancellation of university classes and a suspension of health care services, state lawmakers avoided more than $900 million in budget cuts by passing a package of tax increases and spending reductions Wednesday in the closing moments of a special session.









But large shortfalls still plague the state and will continue to play out as a regular session convenes on Monday.

It was the first session called by Gov. John Bel Edwards, who last year became the first Democrat elected to statewide office in Louisiana since 2008. The Republican-led Legislature, particularly conservatives in the State House, initially resisted most of Mr. Edwardss tax agenda in favor of deeper spending cuts that never materialized. That led to a debate over who should be taxed.

In addition to a current shortfall of $954 million, lawmakers tried to eliminate a $2 billion budget gap for the fiscal year that begins July 1, but fell short by $800 million. The Senate president, John Alario, a Republican, said lawmakers may need to return in another special session this year.

As the Legislature has repeatedly done in recent decades during dire economic times, it altered the states sales tax structure, raising it a penny to 5 percent and removing most exemptions  but only temporarily. The House appropriations chairman, Cameron Henry, a Republican, said business and industry would share 50 percent of that burden and would see other changes in the corporate income and franchise tax systems.

But lawmakers were unable to close the entire shortfall of $954 million for the current fiscal year and left an estimated $30 million in needs unfunded. Mr. Edwards said the states Department of Health and Hospitals would probably face cuts. But it would not be alone.

We could have done better, Mr. Edwards said at a news conference Wednesday night. It is not a great day for the State of Louisiana.

At his urging, lawmakers also approved higher taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, car rentals, cellphones, landlines and short-term rooms booked through websites. They rolled back a tax credit benefiting the insurance industry, and they approved a framework for collecting sales taxes from online retailers.

Those revenue increases presented political challenges for House Republicans who ran anti-tax election campaigns last fall.

We have members who made tax votes and are struggling with that, said the House speaker, Taylor Barras, a Republican. I had a friend text me this morning and call me the tax man.

For all that the Legislature accomplished in its special session, some critics noted that the changes lawmakers passed were temporary and did not fundamentally alter the tax code and what Moodys Investors Service called a structural deficit.

They did the absolute bare minimum that was required of them, said Jan Moller, the director of the Louisiana Budget Project.

The shortened three-and-a-half-week time frame and other limits placed on Mr. Edwardss special session played a role in what the session produced. The House and Senate did create a task force to study budget and tax reforms and charged it with reporting its findings to the Legislature by Sept. 1.

The road to fiscal uncertainty has been a long one in Louisiana, reaching back to 2005 when Hurricane Katrina created a spike in tax collections as a result of recovery spending. Coupled with peak oil prices a few years later, Louisiana was so flush with cash that lawmakers cut income taxes and increased credits and exemptions for business.

With the Katrina money gone and the economy worsening, spending started to outstrip tax collections over the past eight years as structural budget problems surfaced under Gov. Bobby Jindal. Mr. Jindal refused to raise taxes, and his administration and the Legislature privatized government services, sold state assets, redirected money from various funds and used pockets of one-time money for recurring expenses.

As the 2015 governors race began, tax collections started to dip and oil prices plummeted, costing Louisiana $12 million for every $1 decrease in the annual average price of a barrel of oil.

For all practical purposes, Louisiana is entering its own recession, said Greg Albrecht, the Legislatures chief economist.",[]

In January, days after a third successive Giants season ended with another losing record, John Mara, the Giants co-owner, said his teams defensive roster lacked talent. Then Mara pointedly said it was General Manager Jerry Reeses responsibility to fix the disaster the defense had become.









Reeses job with the Giants might depend on it.

Wednesday, as the N.F.L.s off-season free-agency period opened, Reese went on a shopping spree unprecedented in team history. If Reese is going out as Giants general manager, he is doing it with fistfuls of dollars flung across the free agent market.

In a 24-hour period beginning with the signing of defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul on Tuesday, Reese committed about $204 million in contracts for defensive players, with $114 million of that sum guaranteed to be paid out. The new Giants are the former Miami defensive end Olivier Vernon, who is viewed as a rising edge-of-the-formation star; Damon Harrison, a bulky tackle and staple of the Jets highly effective run-stopping defense last year; and the Rams Janoris Jenkins, perhaps the top cornerback available this off-season. Jenkinss arrival will mean that the Giants will not re-sign Prince Amukamara, their first-round draft pick in 2011 who struggled to avoid major injuries in his five seasons with the Giants.

Reese and Mara, who signs off on major purchases, did not spend without forethought as each of the teams acquisitions were players the Giants had identified as priorities at their positions. And Reese has significantly upgraded the skill level on the defensive unit by adding three relatively young new players in addition to retaining Pierre-Paul.

The biggest, flashiest signing was Vernon, and the Giants had to outbid the Jacksonville Jaguars for him. The contract the Giants eventually agreed to give Vernon was the largest in the history of the league for a defensive end: five years and $85 million, with $52.5 million guaranteed.

Vernon, 25, never missed a game in four seasons with the Dolphins and was a disruptive presence in opposing backfields last season, when he frequently pressured the quarterback and had 7.5 sacks. Vernon has 29 career sacks, including 11.5 in 2013, his second year in the league.

Jenkins, 27, is an aggressive, confident, top-level cornerback who only missed four games in his four years with the Rams and had 10 career interceptions, plus five interception returns for touchdowns. Jenkins received a five-year deal worth $62.5 million that includes $29 million in guaranteed money, which is a big number for a cornerback who, at least initially, will be considered the teams No. 2 pass defender behind Giants cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie.

Jenkinss contract makes him the second-highest-paid cornerback in the league, behind the Jets Darrelle Revis.

Harrison, who is 6 feet 4 and 350 pounds, will team with the Giants sturdy and dependable defensive tackle Jonathan Hankins, who is 6-2 and 320 pounds. Harrison, whose nickname is Snacks, and Hankins could be a formidable duo up the middle for the Giants. The Giants have a sense of urgency when it comes to improving the defensive line over all, which explains why they gave Harrison a $46.5 million, five-year contract with $24 million guaranteed.

It was a contract that the Jets, who are more constrained by the salary cap and have other free agents to sign, could not be reasonably expected to match. Even though Harrison, 27, helped the Jets defense give up the second fewest rushing yards in the N.F.L. last season.

In the end, the Giants appear to have substantially overpaid for their three new players, and perhaps even for Pierre-Paul, who could still be severely limited if his damaged right hand is not significantly improved by off-season surgery. But the Giants had ample salary cap space, and they are a team that has been noticeably inferior to the rest of the league since at least 2013.

It was expected that the Giants would be assertive buyers in this winters free-agent market. Clearly, what they have done is identify three players they valued more than any others and then they let no other team outspend them for those players.

It could be a wise strategy or it could expose many other holes on the team that were left unaddressed.

The Giants have remaining salary cap space, and they will need it since they need a safety, another cornerback, a couple linebackers and at least one offensive lineman. They also need ample help at tight end, although Reese never  ever  seems to consider that position a priority.

But the Giants are not likely done acquiring new players, even on defense, which could still be the focus of the teams college draft selections this spring.

In January, when John Mara was talking about what ailed his team, Reese was obviously listening.",[]

The tennis star Maria Sharapova says she failed a drug test for meldonium at the Australian Open. The drug was only banned in January and there has been a string of failed tests by athletes in several sports since.

Here are some things to know about meldonium:

Who Has Tested Positive?

One of the worlds top ice dancers also said Monday that she tested positive.

The dancer, Ekaterina Bobrova, is a former European champion who was part of the Olympic gold medal-winning Russian team at the 2014 Winter Olympics. She told Russian media the positive test was a big shock. Another Russian case last month saw cyclist Eduard Vorganov test positive.

Besides notable Russians, Swedish media reported in February that former world champion 1,500-meter runner Abeba Aregawi had tested positive for meldonium. Two other cases involved Ukrainians competing in the winter sport of biathlon.

What Does It Do?

It is also marketed as mildronate. The website of the drugs Latvian manufacturer Grindeks says meldonium gives sufferers of heart and circulatory conditions more physical capacity and mental function  and a similar boost to healthy people. Meldonium was banned because it aids oxygen uptake and endurance.

Who Takes It?

Meldonium is most commonly used in Eastern European and ex-Soviet countries as a drug for people with heart conditions, but its also offered for sale online. There are also signs that a sizable minority of athletes were using before it was banned.

In October, the U.S.-based Partnership for Clean Competition, an anti-doping group, said meldonium was found in 182 of 8,300 urine samples from athletes as part of a study part-funded by the PCC.

How Was It Banned?

The World Anti-Doping Agency monitored the effects and use of meldonium before announcing in September that it would be declared a banned substance from Jan. 1, 2016.

WADA declared the decision on its website more than three months before the ban, and it was also announced by the Russian anti-doping agency.

Sharapova said she received an e-mail from WADA linking to information that meldonium would be banned ahead of the 2016 season but did not read the information at the time. Sharapova says she has been taking the drug for 10 years for numerous health issues.",[]

In a large safe at his apartment near the boardwalk in the Rockaways, Queens, the authorities said on Wednesday, Lee Bergman had amassed a stockpile of weapons.

Mr. Bergman, 43, had been under scrutiny by the Police Impersonations Unit at the New York Police Department after investigators discovered he had bought four forged department identification cards, officials said.

On Tuesday, the authorities said, a police search of his apartment on Shore Front Parkway uncovered a cache that included multiple revolvers, rifles and shotguns, a semiautomatic pistol, an AK-47 and an AR-15, the authorities said.

Mr. Bergman also had 18 high-capacity magazines and just under 17,000 rounds of ammunition, officials said. In addition to the forged Police Department cards, the authorities said, he had a fake Correction Department identification card and a fake New York police shield, as well as flare guns, a bulletproof vest from the Jersey City Police Department, metal knuckles, police scanners and $42,800 in cash.

The apartment had been turned into an arsenal of deadly weapons, Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said in a statement.

It is very disturbing to find the amount of guns and ammunition stockpiled in an apartment in a residential community, Mr. Brown added.

Mr. Bergman was charged with 32 counts of criminal possession of a weapon, as well as multiple counts related to possessing the fake law enforcement identification, the authorities said. He was also charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance, a bottle of Xanax.

After he was arrested on Tuesday, Mr. Bergman was hospitalized and later released, though the authorities did not explain why. He had not appeared in court as of Wednesday night; it was unclear if he had a lawyer.",[]

In time, the mismatch subsides, leaving them partners in a bigger way.

Of their sex life before the medication, Mr. Jaffe wrote: My wifes requirements were that her job had to be going well, the children didnt need her attention, the house had to be clean, the temperature had to be between 76 and 84 degrees, and the Democrats had to control at least one branch of government.

Of their sex life after: Now she merely had to have a job, the children had to be alive, the house had to be standing, the temperature had to be between 0 and 104 degrees and the Democrats had to control at least one branch of government.

Martha Wright, who played well over 1,200 performances in leading musical roles on Broadway, nearly all of them as a replacement for Mary Martin, died on March 1 in Newburyport, Mass. She was 92.









Her death was confirmed by her daughter Maria Manuche.

Ms. Wrights was an unusual resume. Not exactly a household name, maybe not even in the households of musical theater aficionados, she was nonetheless by some standards a genuine star.

A coloratura soprano who personified the pert appeal of a 1950s ingenue, she appeared on Broadway in only a handful of shows, but twice she followed Miss Martin in a Tony-winning musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein.

In June 1951, she took over as the Navy nurse Ensign Nellie Forbush in South Pacific, singing Im Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair and Im in Love With a Wonderful Guy. She eventually performed the role more than 1,000 times on Broadway, exceeding the 868 played by Ms. Martin (who played 400 more in London), and closing the show in January 1954.

Seven years later, after Ms. Martin bowed out of the role of Maria Rainer, the rebellious postulant turned stellar governess in The Sound of Music, Ms. Wright filled the role from the fall of 1961 into the summer of 1962, singing, among other numbers, the title song as well as My Favorite Things and Do-Re-Mi.

In all, she spent more than three years as the leading female performer in two of theater historys most beloved musicals.

Martha Lucile Wiederrecht was born in Seattle on March 23, 1923, to Lucile Wright (whose name she would seize on for professional use) and Frederick Wiederrecht, a plumber, electrician and general handyman who was also a well-trained tenor. His mother had been a concert pianist.

The family moved to a farm in Duvall, Wash., where Martha spent much of her childhood, studying voice and piano, but returned to Seattle in time for her to graduate from Franklin High School. She attended the University of Washington for two years and began performing on the radio.

In 1947 she won a slot in the chorus in a visiting musical, Up in Central Park, which returned to New York and closed almost immediately. (Its uncertain whether she appeared on Broadway in the show, though some published reports suggest she did.)

Ms. Wright sang on radio and television in New York, and she played the role of Desiree Artot, the Belgian soprano who was Tchaikovskys love object (unrequited), in the Broadway operetta Music in My Heart. She also appeared in a musical ghost story, Great to Be Alive!, which closed after 52 performances in 1950.

Playing at supper clubs in New York and elsewhere, she came to the attention of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. She was performing at the Palmer House in Chicago when she auditioned for South Pacific and chose to replace Ms. Martin as Nellie Forbush rather than take another role shed been offered, that of the determined wife and mother Katie Nolan in the musical adaptation of Betty Smiths turn-of-the-century novel A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.

The choice, Ms. Wright said at the time, was enough to give me ulcers, but in the end Nellie Forbush was more the kind of part I want to do.

Katie in Tree is a much more sober sort of person, she said.

She was concerned about being measured against Ms. Martin, and she was, but she came off probably as well as she could have hoped.

Miss Wright is a pretty young lady from Seattle who has a pleasant voice and a charming personality, Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times. She does very well by the part. If Miss Martin had never been in it, everyone would probably be very happy abut Miss Wrights cheerful singing and sunny performing.

In 1954, Ms. Wright starred on television in her own 15-minute musical show, The Martha Wright Show on Sunday nights on ABC. Later, for several years she had a daily radio show on WCBS.

Her first marriage, to T.W. Baumfeld, known as Teddy, who had helped manage her career, ended in divorce. In 1955 she married Mike Manuche, a restaurateur, and by the time she left The Sound of Music, she was more focused on family life than on her career. An album she recorded for RCA Victor in 1960 was titled Love, Honor and All That Jazz: Songs for After the Honeymoon Is Over.

Mr. Manuche (pronounced muh-NOO-chee) died in 2013. In addition to their daughter Maria, Ms. Wright is survived by two other daughters, Jayvie Anderson and Jenny Vellante; a son, Michael Manuche, and 10 grandchildren.",[]

A new study suggests that women with asthma exposed to air pollution, even before conception, significantly increase their risk of delivering a premature baby.

Researchers studied 223,502 pregnancies among 204,175 women in 19 hospitals across the United States, gathering data on air quality in each region.

The study, in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, found that all women with asthma were more likely than those without to deliver preterm. But there were significant increases in preterm birth in asthmatic women exposed to air pollution, including traffic-related pollutants.

Air pollution also appeared to take a toll even before conception. Asthmatic women exposed to pollutants in the three months before conception were at a 28 percent higher risk for preterm birth than women without asthma exposed at the same time in the same conditions.

Thats a window that hasnt been studied before, said the lead author, Pauline Mendola, an epidemiologist with the National Institutes of Health. We saw the increase for both groups, but it was much higher for women with asthma.

Air pollution may be unavoidable, but Dr. Mendola said that pregnant women should avoid outdoor activity when pollution levels rise.

The Environmental Protection Agency issues air pollution advisories when conditions are bad, she said. Theyre not specifically for pregnant women, but pregnant women with asthma should be particularly aware of them.

WASHINGTON  Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, is to meet with President Obama on Thursday for the first state visit by a Canadian leader in 19 years, a diplomatic honor made possible in part by new pledges of cooperation on combating climate change.









Mr. Obama and Mr. Trudeau are expected to announce new commitments to reduce planet-warming emissions of methane, a chemical contained in natural gas that is about 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide, and which can leak from drilling wells and pipelines.

That announcement will come during a day of ceremony that will conclude with a state dinner in the East Room of the White House. On the menu is Alaskan halibut casseroles, roasted apricot galette, baby lamb chops with Yukon Gold potato dauphinoise and a maple pecan cake with cocoa nib wafer and butterscotch swirl ice cream.

The arrival of Mr. Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, has prompted comparisons to a similar visit in 1977 by Pierre Trudeau, a former prime minister and the current leaders father. That visit made headlines when Margaret Trudeau, the prime ministers wife, wore an above-the-knee dress to the White House state dinner.

While Canada and the United States have long been close allies, Mr. Obamas efforts to confront global warming had become a major point of contention with Mr. Trudeaus predecessor, Stephen Harper, who sought to aggressively expand Canadas oil industry.

As Mr. Obama became more determined to leave behind a lasting environmental legacy, he delayed and eventually rejected construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have transported nearly a million barrels a day of heavily polluting oil from Alberta to refineries on the Gulf Coast.

Mr. Obamas rejection of the pipeline severely strained relations with Mr. Harper.

But Mr. Trudeaus election last year marked a shift in policy that was welcomed by the White House. Mr. Trudeau did not criticize Mr. Obamas rejection of the pipeline, and has pledged to pursue an ambitious environmental agenda intended to coordinate with Mr. Obamas policies.

In December, Canadian officials helped to push through a historic global climate agreement in Paris.

The climate relationship with Canada really just ramped up dramatically quickly, Todd Stern, Mr. Obamas special envoy for climate change, told reporters ahead of Mr. Trudeaus arrival.

Mr. Obama and Mr. Trudeau will meet privately on Thursday to discuss military cooperation, efforts to combat terrorism, improvements in trade and environmental concerns.

Among the issues the two leaders will seek to resolve is a dispute over several decades about softwood lumber. American officials say lumber from Canada is unfairly subsidized by the government there, an assertion that Canadian officials reject.

Thats a longstanding and complicated issue, but we do welcome the Trudeaus government interest in discussing a new arrangement for softwood lumber, and were open to exploring all options with Canada to address this important trade issue, said Mark Feierstein, the senior director for the Western Hemisphere at the National Security Council.

But the most anticipated topic is the environment.

Prime Minister Trudeau is already showing serious, concrete commitment to accelerating progress on climate, Mr. Stern said. The commitment of both leaders to addressing this global challenge is clear. And I suspect under their leadership, North America will make significant progress this year and next.

The Obama administration wants to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 percent to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The Interior Department has proposed a number of regulations on methane leaks, but has yet to write a regulation governing such leaks from current oil and gas drilling on public land.",[]

Life, among other things, is accumulation  of objects, papers, photographs, paintings, tax returns, love letters and assorted things in the backs of drawers, the bottoms of closets and the recesses of cellars. Stuff gathers. It piles up through the acquisitive instinct, nostalgia and inertia. Some of it may be useful, a lot of it not.









Possessions can be uplifting if they are beautiful or merely comforting, signposts to a life, recalling the places they were acquired and with whom. On the other hand, they can feel imprisoning. Who has not had the urge just to be rid of everything and roam free? Humanity may broadly be divided into hoarders and disposers. They tend to have disagreements, especially when bound in a couple.

These thoughts crossed my mind as I picked my way through a bedroom I have used for several months for storage, mostly of books without shelves to place them on, but also of boxes I felt disinclined to open. Making a home is not a steady process but comes about in bursts, interspersed with inactivity.

In the midst of my clutter-clearing push, I stumbled on my maps  hundreds of maps, produced by companies like Michelin or Rand McNally or the British Ordnance Survey, charting the roads, tracks and railroads of the Marseille region through Jerusalem to Paraguay by way of the Cheddar Gorge. Bearing witness  what journalists must do  involves moving around; for a long time there was only one way to get oriented. A good map in a bad place was a lifesaver.

The maps looked otherworldly, like old sewing machines or outsize transistor radios from another era. I fingered them, unsure what to do. Google Maps and GPS have taken over. A disembodied voice guides you to a destination whose geographic context is irrelevant. Technology siphons people into furrows. When the GPS breaks down, there is panic.

I thought of throwing all the maps away. Why keep them if I would no longer need them? Because I love maps  the way they render contour and scale, invite exploration. But that hardly seemed reason to hoard.

Then my eye fell on two maps of a country that no longer exists  Yugoslavia  and another map of the countries born from its death  Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia etc.  and I was back in the wars of Yugoslavias destruction in the 1990s. The smash of a shell in Sarajevo, the contraction in my stomach, the tapering valley and the death-spewing mountains, sweet coffee in the old city, a sign on the road south of Split pointing left to Sarajevo and straight to Dubrovnik. I always turned left, away from the sea, toward the besieged Bosnian capital. That was the road where, in 1995, I flipped over, crashed into a field, ended upside-down with Bosnian peasants trying to extricate me from the wreck.

I was alive, somehow. My son was born a few days later in Paris.

Life pivots on very little. It has its roads and byways. Italy was well represented  maps of Lake Como, Campania, Sicily. Covering Italy in the 1980s was a joy. Now I was back in Rome: that interview with then Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, who exuded an animal force and ended badly in Tunisia. The call, its menace unmistakable, in the midst of a Palermo night when I was investigating a four-part series on the Mafia for The Wall Street Journal. The umbrella pines in the Villa Borghese, the clay courts playable through winter, the talkative Umbrian agro-scientist convinced he could cultivate truffles, the beans at Nino on the Via Borgognona, that shattering Velazquez portrait in Rome of Pope Innocent X.

These maps, it occurred to me, mapped my life more or less. I was transported. The Old City in Jerusalem near the Damascus Gate, market stalls piled with dates and pomegranates, Palestinians emerging from the Al Aqsa Mosque on the El-Wad Road, Orthodox Jews bumping into them as they head toward the Western Wall, a crowd of Philippine Christians emerging from the Via Dolorosa carrying a crucifix they try to maneuver through these Arabs and Jews.

I was back there, too. Life is mingling and coupling despite the effort of every Middle Eastern fanatic to draw division. Yugoslavia died bloodily because it took such force to unmingle it.

I could not dispose of my redundant maps. My own borders were written into them. I do not want to live without them.

A confession then: I tend toward hoarding, perhaps through trauma. A vivid memory is of my father standing in the garden in the London house where I spent most of my childhood piling objects onto a fire. Into the flames went old toys, files, papers, and the Don Bradman cricket bat I had used as a child and he had used before me. That was after my mothers first suicide attempt, in preparation for a disastrous move.

Irving Villegas, a freelance photographer from Mexico City, had spotted them toiling in the fields of Weiterstadt, Germany  about 20 miles south of Frankfurt  in the summer of 2007, when he happened to be living nearby. He approached them, curious.

All hailed from other countries; Poland and Romania, mostly. In classic migrant-worker tradition, after the picking season they would go home or move on to the next country. Also traditional: the lousy pay, 27 to 57 cents per kilogram of asparagus. As Mr. Villegas chatted with the workers, taking photos with no particular end in mind, one scene, one image, marked him.

The photo captures a group of workers in an asparagus field, bare-chested in the blistering heat, with one in the foreground stripped down to his briefs. It demonstrates the grit and determination of these laborers, who put in 10-hour days, seven days a week, no matter what, all season long. The photo also touches the viewer and raises questions.

Since that photo, Mr. Villegas said, a concern for those people started, a wanting to know more about them.

Photo

Six years later, Mr. Villegas used that image to begin Working Far Away, which documents the public and private lives of seasonal workers in several countries and continents. He has followed asparagus workers in several towns in Germany and found their families in towns and cities in Romania. He has also documented Polish sheep shearers and olive workers from Morocco, Senegal and other countries working in several towns in Spain. Next on his list: France and Finland.

It took six years to start the project, said Mr. Villegas, who lives where he studied photography, in Hannover, to establish himself. I needed to start a life in Germany, he said. So I set aside that topic but always with that photo in my mind, knowing one day I would pick up the subject.

Photographers have been documenting the plight of seasonal workers for decades. Yet any attention the workers receive tends to be quickly forgotten. Immigrant workers, especially, who leave their countries for backbreaking work that few in the host countries is willing to do, remain in societys peripheral vision. At best, theyre ignored. At worst, theyre vilified as criminals. Working Far Away aims to dispel the stereotypes.

I think that mainly I aim to shatter that idea of We dont need immigrants in our country, they steal our job opportunities,  Mr. Villegas said. For instance, in Germany, there are few locals that apply for the asparagus season. For them it represents a big physical effort that is not worth the payment. Thats why there are only immigrants in the fields.

Photo

The seasonal workers in Spain are having a harder time. The countrys recession has led desperate local residents to take farm jobs they once shunned. A striking image of a Senegalese worker, drenched in sweat, as he hauls nets used for olives in Jaen reminds us that luck is relative. This worker, the father of three girls, has managed to secure a contract during the harvest for eight years.

The unluckiest brave the long and dangerous journey to Spain only to find the work no longer exists. One man sits at a train terminal, saddled with bags and luggage and weariness as he waits for uncertainty in the next town.

Working Far Away, Mr. Villegas expects, will take years to complete.

Seasonal workers are everywhere, he said, and my original purpose was to document as many countries as I could in different continents. But one thing at a time. This is a very difficult project to carry out, financially speaking.

He plans spend to finish the European part of the project by the end of this year. Then, ideally, he said, I would like to continue in America.

BEVERLY HILLS, CALIF.  In February 2015, Gwen Stefani joined Maroon 5 onstage at the Grammys to perform the ballad My Heart Is Open. After the awards, she got Mexican food with the bands singer, Adam Levine, a fellow coach on the NBC reality-singing competition The Voice. For a pop superstar of two decades, it was a relatively normal night. But when she woke up the next morning, My life was literally blown up into my face, she said.









For 10 weeks, those closest to her had known the secret that ultimately ended her 13-year marriage to Gavin Rossdale, the singer of the band Bush. Ms. Stefani wont discuss the details, partly to protect her children, but said: If I could, I would just tell you everything, and you would just be in shock. Its a really good, juicy story. (The tabloids say Mr. Rossdale was having a several-years-long affair with a nanny caring for the couples three sons.)

Ms. Stefani, 46, was reeling. Im gonna die, she said, recalling her emotional state. I am dead, actually. How do I save myself? What am I going to do? How do I not go down like this?

Photo

Sitting at the long marble table in an office in her sprawling home here, dressed in a sheer white blouse and shiny red stilettos, Ms. Stefani laid out the answer: She plunged herself into her first love, songwriting. I have to make music out of this. Thats what God wants for me, she remembers thinking.

The result is This Is What the Truth Feels Like (Interscope), her first solo album in a decade, which will be released on Friday, March 18.

The albums 12 tracks are more direct and less whimsical than her previous two pop records. There are fiery songs about secrets and infidelity (the swaggering Red Flag and Naughty, delivered in Ms. Stefanis speak-sung pseudo-rap) and ballads that capture the rawness of a long relationships premature end (Used to Love You). And thanks to Ms. Stefanis budding romance with her Voice co-star, the country singer Blake Shelton  which began after news of her split with Mr. Rossdale broke last August  more than half of the tracks are about discovering the spark of a new love. The songs arent as dancey as much current pop; they retain the bouncy, synth-driven sound of Ms. Stefanis earlier work. In a field dominated by young starlets, shes made a grown-up pop album, confessional and sleek, without the oddball B-A-N-A-N-A-S flourishes of her past hits.

As Ms. Stefani began writing, she said she didnt worry about potential sales, what it means to be a 46-year-old pop singer in a youth-dominated field, or pleasing her record company.

She talked to a new contact at her label, Aaron Bay-Schuck, and felt a glimmer of hope. (I was like, wow, this guy, I think he might actually get me.) And then she started sessions with the team that became her Truth squad, including the songwriter Justin Tranter and later his frequent partner Julia Michaels, who together had written high-profile tracks for Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber.

Ms. Stefanis directions were clear: She wanted to capture her history  if it didnt happen in real life, it wasnt going on the album. And the floodgates opened.

Photo

Being in that room and being creative, it was the only place that felt good  I was like, I love the smell of this room, she recalled. (Ms. Michaels said there were a lot of laughter and tears during the sessions, which Ms. Stefani attended in her signature look: The red lip and big nails and the jewelry.) Songwriting had saved her before, Ms. Stefani said. She described herself as having been a passive girl, an unremarkable teenager, until she uncovered her talent. Its almost like one of those movies where they discover they have magic, she said. When I was able to first write a song, thats when I found my whole self.

Ms. Stefanis label, however, had reservations about the highly personal music she was churning out. On a phone call that felt like five people punching me in the stomach, she said she was told: We support you, you should put out an artistic record, and dont go for radio. Its over for you, basically.

John Janick, the chairman and chief executive of Interscope Geffen A&M, said he absolutely remembers the uncomfortable call  because he was the one who had to make it. I said, Im not sure you have the song thats going to really connect with people, he recalled. And two days later, she sent us Used to Love You.

The label immediately got in touch to say, You have a hit, Ms. Stefani said, noting with some glee that it was the most personal song shed attempted to write. Thats never happened in my entire career. (The song wound up peaking at No. 52 on the Billboard Hot 100. A second single, Make Me Like You, for which Ms. Stefani created an intricately choreographed live video during a commercial break on this years Grammys in a multi-million-dollar partnership with Target, is at No. 54 and climbing.)

After a few weeks in the studio, Ms. Stefani returned to her other job on The Voice, burdened with knowing her marital issues had not yet become public. Im not a secret girl, she explained. I tell everybody when my period is coming.

But she soon learned that Mr. Shelton, whom she refers to as one of my co-workers, was also in the throes of a personal crisis. He had been going through literally the exact same thing in literally the exact same time frame, she said. Her friendship with him blossomed.

Photo

Her collaborators noticed a change instantly. We had anger, we had sadness, we had flirtation, we had sexy, and now were madly in love, Mr. Tranter said. Ms. Stefani described the shift with one of her frequently used terms  crazy!  and added, Never in my wildest, craziest dreams would I ever have seen this coming.

Ms. Stefani, unguarded and reflective, spoke quickly in torrents of words, pausing only to sip tea from a cup that, like most of her decor, was black and white. She thought back to her childhood in Anaheim, Calif., where she presumed shed one day lead a happy family like the one her parents had built. I literally was so sheltered and naive, and thats a lot why I think I got myself into so much trouble, in a way, she said. She lamented that because of her split from Mr. Rossdale, she now has her sons 50 percent of the time. Its like, the most unjust, unbelievable system, she said, adding that the blessing in it was she had time to heal and write.

No Doubt, the band she co-founded in 1987, had already sold more than 20 million albums worldwide when it took its first break following its 2001 LP, Rock Steady. Her first thought: dance record. The result was Love. Angel. Music. Baby., a 2004 album of wacky, hip-hop-inflected songs that blended her fascination with Japanese fashion and 80s synth pop. Pharrell Williams, now a longtime friend, collaborated on its signature hit, Hollaback Girl.

Gwen is a true heroine, whose creativity represents all the young female rebels at heart, Mr. Williams said in an email.

She got pregnant with her first son, Kingston, before embarking on her first solo tour and returned to the studio to make a follow-up album, The Sweet Escape, when he was just eight weeks old. The cycle almost immediately repeated itself: a worldwide tour and a pregnancy, with her second child, Zuma. Her growing empire now included fashion and fragrances.

And she wasnt done yet. No Doubt had been awaiting her return, so she hit the road with a toddler and a nursing baby and completely exhausted herself. I felt quite trapped on so many levels, because when you have that much success you feel like you owe everybody, she said. Everybody depends on you.

Sessions for the bands first album in 11 years, Push and Shove, followed, and Ms. Stefani wasnt brimming with ideas. The LP failed to take off commercially, and when the band returned to the studio  this time with collaborators including Sia, Greg Kurstin and Mr. Williams  Ms. Stefani got pregnant for a third time. Thats when I started to really find my faith again, she said. Its like a miracle, at my age.

Weeks after giving birth to Apollo, the offer to become a coach on The Voice arrived, and Ms. Stefani found herself relishing her new role as mentor. I needed so badly to do something different, and I needed so badly to be in a different role, a giving role. Freshly inspired, she felt the urge to make music and mulled a solo album. I started to think, well, Ill just curate a record, and Ill do it like every other pop girl does.

This was the first time Ms. Stefani had dipped a toe into the new pop economy, where ace songwriters for hire shop tracks from artist to artist. Every song that people would write for me felt like me 12 years ago, me 10 years ago. And lyrically they could never touch my heart, ever. She recorded a full album, but decided to shelve it once sessions for Truth took off.

Considering how much the pop landscape has changed in a decade, Ms. Stefani is incredulous about her ability to continue recording. I dont even understand how I could possibly have had this long a career, or a career at all, she said. And that anyone cares, and that Im relevant or anything, it just blows my mind.

Mr. Tranter said Ms. Stefanis sweetness and humility arent put-on. At first I thought she was just being polite, he said. And then I was like, oh, she actually doesnt realize the lives that shes changed. She has no clue. Describing Ms. Stefanis appeal as that amazing combination of extreme fabulousness and extreme honesty, he noted the 1995 No Doubt album Tragic Kingdom defined one whole era of music, and then she did it again as a solo artist, which is very rare.

Mr. Janick said the longevity of Ms. Stefanis career is one reason the label is confident in her new albums viability. Obviously theres a lot of people that have grown up with Gwen over the years. Her being on The Voice, what she does in fashion, shes all over all the magazines. You can say its a grown-up pop record, but I feel like it touches on all different things that people can relate to of all different ages and sexes.

Ms. Stefani, who sometimes reminds herself Wow, I did do that! I wrote those songs! to boost her own confidence, said singing about being happy is so fresh to her. I needed something new to happen. And not just in my career, in my life. Something had to change.

Im not going to say Im not still picking up the pieces and every day isnt a challenge, she said. Im still in shock. But its an awesome time.",[]

ECONOMIC alarm bells are ringing: Financial markets have wilted. Forecasters have been slicing their projections for future growth. And some leading wise men  including the megabillionaire George Soros  are predicting a return to disastrous 2008 conditions. Thats almost certainly an overly pessimistic view. But without a doubt, the leading global economies are in a major slowdown.









Not evident is whether another recession looms. While current data suggests that modest growth continues in the United States, economists are notoriously bad at forecasting downturns. As The Economist noted, between 1999 and 2014, the International Monetary Fund, in its April forecasts, failed to predict every one of the 220 instances in which one of its members suffered negative annual growth in the next year. Even the Federal Reserve uncharacteristically recently described the outlook as unclear.

Whats unusual about todays raft of challenges is the extent to which governments around the world have added to the problems, rather than ameliorating them. Poor policy choices, like misguided spending priorities and too much austerity, have added to the drag on growth. Notably, failing to act at all has cut deeply into business and investor confidence, an important support mechanism for markets and consumers alike.

Governments alone are not to blame; the reasons for the sagging economies are multifarious and jumbled, more de Kooning than Mondrian.

For a start, global competition and weak productivity growth have held down wages in developed countries. That has depressed consumer spending, as have increased saving and growing income inequality, which has pushed more money into the hands of the rich, who are less likely to spend it.

All that said, governments havent done enough to help the situation  and have done a lot to exacerbate it. Closest to home, of course, is gridlock in Washington. Anti-deficit fervor has led to a meat-ax approach to spending cuts, under which nondefense discretionary outlays (which include key pro-growth areas like research and development and infrastructure) have fallen in real terms by nearly 20 percent over the past five years, at a time when they should be growing substantially.

Meanwhile, Congress has not passed a comprehensive tax reform package in three decades, which has given clever experts room to develop loophole after loophole, particularly for multinational companies eager to cut their tax bills by sequestering profits overseas.

Then theres China. Unlike their counterparts in developed countries, Chinese leaders arent afraid to act; their problem is that they often dont seem to know what to do, particularly when it comes to managing financial markets.

When Chinese stocks sagged, the authorities exhorted the citizenry to buy them up. As shares soared, they curtailed the ability to purchase shares on margin, causing prices to plummet. Similarly, beginning last August, China made a muddle of its effort to unpeg its currency from the strong dollar, leading to huge capital flight from the country ($159 billion in December alone).

Most scary to China watchers is the countrys fast rising debt. All these worries are exacerbated by the countrys opacity; for example, almost no expert believes that China is growing at the nearly 7 percent rate that it claims.

The past two recessions were caused largely by private actors: the risky lending of the mid-2000s and the dot-com bubble at the turn of the century.

Of all the reasons it once seemed unthinkable that Donald J. Trump might be the Republican nominee, one of the strongest was the G.O.P.s reputation as the party of religious conservatives.









True, the Republicans had recently nominated Mitt Romney, whose Mormonism made many evangelical Christians anxious, and before him John McCain, a man of little obvious religiosity. But Trump was a different kind of figure: Not merely lukewarm or unorthodox, but a proud flouter of the entire Judeo-Christian code  a boastful adulterer and a habitual liar, a materialist and a sensualist, a greedy camel without even the slightest interest in squeezing through the needles eye.

And yet: Despite his transparent irreligiosity, Trump has won easily across the South, one of the most religious portions of the country. Among both self-identified evangelicals and Catholics, hes consistently polled as well as the evangelical Ted Cruz and the Roman Catholic Marco Rubio.

For conservative Christians who oppose Trump, these patterns have provoked a great deal of anguish. My fellow columnist Pete Wehner recently declared himself stunned that my fellow evangelicals can rally behind a man whose words and actions are so at odds with the central teachings of our faith. The prominent Southern Baptist spokesman Russell Moore has condemned evangelical leaders for being scared silent as evangelicalism is associated with everything from authoritarianism and bigotry to violations of religious freedom. This week two influential conservative Catholic scholars, Robert George and George Weigel, put out an open letter to their co-believers, urging them to reject Trump as manifestly unfit to be president of the United States.

Such angst and soul-searching is warranted, as it is for just about everyone in the age of Trump. But some clarity is also needed about what it means, exactly, that Trump is winning religious voters.

First, the good news for despairing anti-Trump believers: Despite those polls showing him doing well with evangelicals and Catholics, Trump is not the first choice of most active churchgoers. Indeed, active religiosity is (relatively speaking) one of the bulwarks against Trumpism, and his coalition is strongest among the most secular Republicans, not the most religious.

That said, its not as if Trump is being shut out among the devout. When The Wall Street Journal recently profiled the Trump coalition, they found that despite his supporters secular tilt, 38 percent still described themselves as weekly churchgoers.

What Trump is doing, then, isnt so much co-opting conservative Christianity as exploiting its weaknesses and divisions. As with the wider conservative coalition, Trump is heightening conservative religions internal contradictions and fracturing it along pre-existing fault lines.

The first fault line is the one suggested by the data on churchgoing: Trump is losing the most active believers, but hes winning in what Ive previously termed the Christian penumbra  the areas of American society (parts of the South very much included) where active religiosity has weakened, but a Christian-ish residue remains.

The inhabitants of this penumbra still identify with Christianity, but they lack the communities, habits and support structures that make the religious path (somewhat) easier to walk. As a result, this Christian-ish landscape seems to produce more social dysfunction, more professional disappointment and more personal disarray than either a thoroughgoing secularism or a fully practiced faith  which makes it ripe territory for Trumps populist appeal. And his occasional nods to religious faith  like, say, his promise to make store clerks say Merry Christmas instead of Happy Holidays  are well tailored for voters for whom Christian identity is still a talisman even when an active faith is all but gone.

Then among Americans who do still have an active faith, Trump has exploited the widening gap between what many conservative Christians assumed about the relationship between their country and their faith, and what the last 10 years or more of social and political change have revealed about the nations drift. Heres how Ben Domenech recently described this psychology of disillusionment:

Evangelicals have for decades believed that the country was more conservative than not, more Christian than not. The bipartisanship on religious liberty and the civic faith of the country was conducive to that. Now theyve woken up to a reality in the Obama years that this was a polite fiction. They worry that coaches getting fired over praying at schools, fire chiefs getting fired for citing Scripture, bakers getting bankrupted over their refusal to bake a cake  their entire perspective on Christian faith as a key element of what made America great has been swept away.

Faced with these shifts, many religious conservatives have contemplated a partial retreat from political activism, a quest for internal cohesion and cultural resilience that Rod Dreher of The American Conservative has called the Benedict Option, after the founder of Western monasticism.

But others clearly look at things a little differently. If this is really a post-Christian society, they seem to be thinking, then Christians need to make sure the meanest, toughest heathen on the block is on their side. So it makes sense to join an alliance of convenience with a strongman, placing themselves under his benevolent protection, because their own leaders have delivered them only to defeat.

And the lure of the strongman is particularly powerful for those believers whose theology was somewhat Trumpian already  nationalistic, prosperity-worshiping, by turns apocalyptic and success-obsessed.

With the steady post-1960s weakening of traditional Christian confessions, the preachers of this kind of gospel  this distinctively American heresy, really  have assumed a new prominence in the religious landscape. Trump, with his canny instinct for where to drive the wedge, has courted exactly these figures. While more orthodox Christians have kept him at arms length or condemned him, hes wooed televangelists and prosperity preachers, and pitched himself to believers already primed to believe that a meretricious huckster with unusual hair might be a vessel of the divine will.

Which he is not, save perhaps in this sense: In the light of Trumpism, many hard truths about American Christianity  its divisions, its failures, its follies, its heresies  stand ruthlessly exposed.

A judge in Connecticut has asked the rapper 50 Cent, who filed for bankruptcy protection last year, to explain Instagram photos showing him posing next to or near large piles of cash, including one picture in which bills are arranged into letters spelling out the word Broke.

The rapper, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, filed in July, days after a jury ordered him to pay $5 million to a woman who accused him of posting a sex tape of her online. (He was eventually ordered to pay her an additional $2 million.)

In a February hearing in bankruptcy court, the judge, Ann Nevins, said that the photos caused her to be concerned about allegations of nondisclosure and a lack of transparency.

But Mr. Jackson claimed in a court filing that the cash in his Instagram pictures was prop money.

Just because I am photographed in or next to a certain vehicle, wearing an article of clothing, holding a product, sitting next to what appears to be large sums of money or modeling expensive pieces of jewelry does not meant that I own everything in those photos, he wrote.

The Instagram posts were brought to the courts attention by Mr. Jacksons creditors, who said in a court document that the pictures were, at a minimum, openly contemptuous of the bankruptcy process.

The case represents a clash between the opulent lifestyle that many hip-hop artists promote in their music, videos and public personas, and the staid reality of Chapter 11 court proceedings.

Social media has become a notable tool of hip-hop culture and often functions as an extension of an artists public image, an extra-musical companion meant to lend credence to the boasts of wealth and masculinity promoted in the songs.

Rap feuds, which used to be carried out in song, now often migrate to platforms such as Twitter and Instagram. Mr. Jackson has used his Instagram account to taunt the Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill, in between posting pictures that appeared to show off his assets, like one of his refrigerator filled with cash.

Mr. Jackson, who enjoyed enormous commercial success with his music when he first emerged on the scene, appeared to strike gold with various product and merchandising deals over the years. Notably, after he endorsed Glaceaus grape-flavored line of vitamin water, he became a shareholder of the Queens manufacturer. His investment turned into a windfall after Coca-Cola bought Glaceau in 2007 for $4.1 billion.

But more recently, failed business ventures and several lawsuits that resulted in penalties of more than $25 million against Mr. Jackson caused him to re-evaluate his financial situation and file for bankruptcy.

Mr. Jackson gestured in his own court filings at the thin line between persona and reality, stating that the separation between 50 Cent and Curtis Jackson is virtually impossible to maintain.

Since the explosion of social media, I have maintained a strong social media presence that is consistent with the public persona of 50 Cent,  he added.

On Wednesday, Mr. Jacksons lawyers disclosed in court that they and the creditors who hold the vast majority of Mr. Jacksons debt have come to an agreement.

If the hearing left Mr. Jackson feeling chastened, he certainly did not show it on social media. Late in the afternoon, he posted a new picture of himself with stacks of cash in his waistband to Twitter and Instagram.",[]

Seeking to increase the number of black and Hispanic students at New York Citys elite public high schools, a group of Democratic state legislators has proposed a $5 million package of initiatives aimed at preparing those students for the eighth-grade admissions test.









Admission to what are known as the specialized high schools is by test only. The number of black and Hispanic students admitted in recent years has been small  and is declining. This year, only 4.1 percent of the students admitted were black and 6.3 percent were Hispanic, down from 4.9 percent and 6.8 percent last year. Black students represent 28 percent of eighth graders in the citys schools, and Hispanics 41 percent.

The total number of black and Hispanic students admitted to the specialized schools was 530 this year, compared with 595 last year. Only nine black students and 14 Hispanic students were admitted to Stuyvesant High School, which requires the highest score. The number of students identified as black and Hispanic who sat for the test declined by more than 500.

Previous proposals have focused on changing the entrance criteria. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed a complaint in 2012 with the United States Education Department arguing that the admissions process was racially biased. Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose son, Dante, attended Brooklyn Technical High School, one of the specialized group, said as a candidate that he would push to have the schools consider a variety of factors, including grades, in admissions.

But any change would require an act of the State Legislature, which mandated in a 1971 law that the Specialized High School Admissions Test be the only measure that can be used to admit students to Stuyvesant, the Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Tech. Five other schools also use the test for admissions. A ninth school, Fiorello H. LaGuardia, uses auditions.

Jeffrey D. Klein, the head of the Independent Democratic Conference in the State Senate, has opposed past efforts to change the admissions process and is proposing instead to focus on better preparation for black and Hispanic students. Senator Klein would hire outreach coordinators at each high school responsible for recruiting students from underrepresented middle schools to take the test; increase the number of elementary and middle school gifted-and-talented programs in low-income neighborhoods; and replicate a science enrichment and test preparation program that has shown promise in getting black and Hispanic students into Brooklyn Tech. The proposal was reported on Wednesday by The Daily News.

Most of the people you talk to dont think the answer is changing the test, Mr. Klein said. Its enhancing the ability of young people to take the test and be prepared for the test.

A group of legislators in 2014 sought to change the admissions process, but their effort drew little support. In any case, a report by the Research Alliance for New York City Schools found that using multiple factors in admissions would do little to solve the schools diversity problems and could even make them worse.

A spokeswoman for the citys Education Department said on Wednesday that it supported Mr. Kleins proposals.

The program that Mr. Klein wants to replicate recruits students from middle schools that have not sent many students to Brooklyn Tech. Each year, sixth graders are selected for the two-year program, based on their scores on standardized tests, interviews and recommendations from principals or guidance counselors. During the summers before seventh and eighth grades, the students spend five and a half weeks taking science and math classes from Brooklyn Tech teachers. During the school year, they attend classes on Saturdays that combine science enrichment and test preparation.

Of the first 55 students who completed the program, 41 were admitted to specialized high schools, Larry Cary, the president of the Brooklyn Tech Alumni Foundation, said. The foundation funds the program, along with National Grid, the utility company. Of the 27 of those students who were admitted to Brooklyn Tech, roughly half were black or Latino, according to Mr. Cary.

As a percentage its a good percentage, Mr. Cary said of the results. We think that this is a model for addressing part of the problem.",[]

TE ATATU, New Zealand  New Zealand is as beautiful as it is isolated. We live a long way from anyone and anything, and we like it that way. We have almost four and a half million people and more than five million dairy cows. We have snow-capped mountains and deep dark woods where hobbits roam, as directed by Peter Jackson in his interminable Lord of the Rings movies. We sing (Lorde) and act (Russell Crowe) and throw stuff (rugby balls).









The rest of the world rarely notices our country, but this month everyone  well, some people  seems to be taking note. Our green and pleasant archipelago is heading to the polls for a national referendum on whether or not to do away with our current flag and replace it with something that kind of looks like a beach towel.

The redesigned flag  a white fern leaf laid over a black-and-blue background  looks happy and foolish, not unlike our prime minister, John Key. The head of New Zealands government likewise has a floppy, casual charm. This is the guy whose biggest scandal came after a waitress told the world about his strange, compulsive habit of pulling her by the ponytail every time he visited her cafe.

Unlike the flag, the prime minister resonates with voters: Hes won the last three elections. Mr. Key has driven the flag-change proposal. Its his passion, his grand project. But many people here loathe the prospect  hes been in office almost eight years, and all we got was this lousy flag?  and wish the whole thing would just go away. It will soon. The referendum, which began March 3, ends March 24.

New Zealands current flag was adopted in 1902. Our Olympic athletes compete under it; it flies atop our Parliament. It has served us in two world wars and is carried at somber dawn parades up and down the country when we commemorate those who died in combat in a moving ceremony that concludes with the line: We will remember them. These are the kinds of connections that New Zealanders want to keep.

But a corner of the flag features the Union Jack, a reference to our former status as a British colony. Critics  and Mr. Key is hardly alone on this, although neither is he surrounded  point out that this is an anachronism. Its the silver fern that really is our national symbol, an emblem from nature, proudly displayed on the jersey of our Godlike national rugby team, the All Blacks.

Its not an entirely terrible idea to have a new flag, or even to put a silver fern on it. But the way Mr. Key and the flag consideration panel  the flag consideration panel!  have gone about it has been pretty much entirely terrible.

First, the public was invited to design a new flag. The panel received 10,292 designs and then drew up a list of 40 contenders before unveiling a shortlist of five. Mr. Key had spoken at length about wanting a silver fern. Three of the five featured  golly!  a silver fern, and two were by the same person, Kyle Lockwood, whose designs looked pretty much exactly like each other. One nation under two beach towels.

Since he was elected prime minister in 2008, Mr. Key has generally enjoyed remarkably high levels of public support. He can do no wrong. Pull a ponytail, and the public just says, So what? But the tide never came in on the flag-change proposal. Polls have always heavily favored keeping the existing flag.

The cost of the exercise might have been a factor. The government spent an estimated 25.7 million New Zealand dollars on asking the public to change a flag it doesnt want changed. Mailing ballot papers took up the greatest chunk of cash, with 17.3 million New Zealand dollars. The splendidly specific figure of 208,500 New Zealand dollars was spent on sending the flag consideration panel  the flag consideration panel!  around the country to hold public workshops without the publics being all that keen on attending.

There were 25 public meetings. The average crowd was 30. Ten people came to the meeting in Christchurch and eight attended in New Plymouth. In fairness, there were other things on in both cities those nights, for instance staying indoors and staring at the wall. As for the panel members, they received 640 New Zealand dollars per day. The chairman, John Burrows, a law professor, must be a superior human. He earned 850 New Zealand dollars per day.

One of the two silver fern beach towels designed by Kyle Lockwood won the public vote to go head to head with our old flag. Which looks set to win in the referendum? It would be lame to say the answer is blowing in the wind, because the answer appears to be fairly obvious. In a recent opinion poll, 63 percent wanted to keep the current flag. Mr. Key must be tearing his hair out  or someone elses.",[]

SAN ANTONIO  When Chris Doyle learned that his health insurance deductible would climb to $10,000 last year, he and his wife, both evangelical Christians, spent a couple weeks just praying, he said.









Then they opted out of insurance altogether, joining something called a health care sharing ministry, which requires members to help cover one anothers major medical costs as they come up.

While such nonprofit ministries have been around for decades, interest in them has grown since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, largely because the law exempts members from the requirement to have health insurance or pay a yearly fine.

Samaritan Ministries International, which Mr. Doyle and his wife, Sarah, joined last winter, plays matchmaker, assigning member families to help pay the medical bills of other members. The money is mailed directly to the families in need, often with handwritten prayers or notes of support  or in the case of one family here, strawberry stickers and a drawing of an elephant for their 5-year-old as she recovered from ear tube surgery.

Because they are not insurance companies, sharing ministries provide no guarantee that members medical debts will be paid; members are advised to trust that God will provide. The ministries say the payment system is helping Christians fulfill a biblical mandate to share one anothers burdens.

Our only assets are the good will and continued participation of our members, said James Lansberry, executive vice president of Samaritan, which is based in Peoria, Ill.

Some ministries operate differently, requiring members to pay monthly into accounts from which funds are disbursed to those with eligible medical bills. Pre-existing medical conditions are often not covered, nor are preventive care, mental health and injuries resulting from behavior the ministry considers immoral or reckless. Members who acquire a sexually transmitted disease from an extramarital affair are out of luck, for instance, as are those injured while driving drunk or during a melee.

Still, membership in sharing ministries has more than doubled over the last six years, to 535,000 from about 200,000, according to the Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries. More participants live in Texas than in any other state, according to Samaritan and the two other largest ministries, Medi-Share, based in Florida, and Christian Healthcare Ministries, based in Ohio. Under the terms of the federal health law, only members of ministries that have operated continuously since December 1999 are exempt from the requirement to have health insurance.

The growth seems to have come largely through word of mouth, at churches, schools and workplaces. Mr. Doyle, a machinist, heard about Samaritan Ministries at Grace Point Church in San Antonio, whose pastors and employees are members and whose congregants post about it on Facebook.

He and Sarah, who stays home with their two toddlers, mail a flat $405 payment to a fellow member every month, the standard rate for families of three or more. Had they stuck with the insurance he was offered through work, the Doyles said, their share of the premium would have been about $600 a month, and they would have had to pay the first $5,000 in annual medical costs outside of preventive care.

Under the ministry, they also have to pay the first $300 of any medical expense they incur. They have not yet had a doctors bill exceed that amount, though they are waiting somewhat nervously for that day to come. Samaritan limits spending on each injury or illness to $250,000, with exceptions for people who agree to pay extra each year toward others bills above that amount.

Theres a little bit of fear going into it, said Mrs. Doyle, 33, adding that she suspected she had a hernia that would need to be repaired soon. What if people dont pay their share and what if the money doesnt come in? But thats where the faith-based part comes in  Im really going to rely on God.

Once a year, members send their monthly share to the ministrys headquarters to help cover administrative costs, and new members pay a $200 fee upon joining that also goes to administration.

Mr. Lansberry said Samaritan members eligible medical bills average, cumulatively, over $16 million a month. Its membership has grown by about 50,000 over the last year, to nearly 200,000 people in 58,000 paying households.

Acknowledging that many families can qualify for subsidized insurance policies with free preventive care through the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Lansberry said that most new members were not joining primarily on price; they are joining primarily on principle.

Before members can be reimbursed, they sometimes must pay upfront for their medical care  potentially a sizable outlay, since hospitals increasingly require at least partial prepayment. It then takes at least two months for Samaritan to process their requests for help and for checks from other members to arrive in the mail.

The most harrowing part of health care sharing so far for Kyle Burkholder, the teaching pastor at Grace Point, and his wife, Stefani, was paying $6,500 upfront for their daughters ear tube surgery, they said. They waited for what seemed like forever for other members checks to come.

About 90 days after her surgery, sure enough, the money did start showing up, Mrs. Burkholder said. And it was with handwritten notes  every day it was one, two, three notes, and she was reading them aloud, and I found myself just crying.

Members with special prayer needs  conditions that are not eligible under the ministrys rules  can also ask for financial help. Last month, for example, Samaritans newsletter highlighted the case of a woman with uterine cancer diagnosed before she became a member, and a teenager who tore a knee ligament in a dirt bike race.

On one hand you think, Well, thats not grace, is it?  Mr. Burkholder said. But on the other hand, thats what makes this thing work.

Upon joining, members waive their right to sue, and in the case of Samaritan, appeals panels of randomly selected members are supposed to settle disputes. Mr. Lansberry said such panels had been convened only four times since Samaritans founding in 1994, and that the organization had never been the subject of complaints to state attorneys general or insurance commissioners.

The insurance commissioner in Washington State did try to stop Samaritan from operating there in 2011, saying it was selling unauthorized insurance, but the State Legislature then passed a law explicitly exempting health care sharing ministries from regulations.

Insurance commissioners in Kentucky and Oklahoma had tried to block Medi-Share, the Florida-based ministry, but were thwarted when their legislatures also passed protection laws.

In 2001, Ohios attorney general sued one ministry  known then as the Christian Brotherhood Newsletter, and now as Christian Healthcare Ministries  ultimately forcing its leaders to repay $15 million they had spent on homes, vehicles and excessive salaries out of the central fund where members had sent payments.

Members have filed a handful of lawsuits against Medi-Share after bills they had expected to be covered were not. The cases were settled out of court. While the health law requires the ministries to submit to annual independent audits, critics question whether that safeguard is sufficient.

Our message has consistently been that this is not a health insurance product that we regulate, so buyer beware, said Nick Gerhart, the insurance commissioner in Iowa. A premature baby could cost $1 million pretty easily, so it wouldnt take very many of those to put a significant strain on any group, let alone an unregulated group like this.

Lee and Amy Jebson of Chesapeake, Va., were not expecting any major medical costs when they signed up for Medi-Share in 2014 after being priced out of the plans available through HealthCare.gov, the federally run insurance marketplace. Then their 8-year-old son was found to have acute lymphoblastic leukemia, leading to several hundred thousand dollars worth of medical bills in just the first few months of his treatment.

One single fever is a $10,000-a-night hospital cost, said Mrs. Jebson, adding that her family pays a $500 monthly share toward other members medical costs, plus $2,500 a year toward their own. But so far, she added, their bills are being covered, with the exception of a few thousand dollars.

In social media posts, some members and former members of sharing ministries have complained about the many medical needs that are not covered, the wait for other members checks to arrive, and the legwork they have to do as self-pay patients.

But others say the ministries allow them to live by their religious beliefs rather than following a government mandate to buy insurance that may cover things they do not want to pay for, like abortion (though half the states do not allow plans sold through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, at least, to pay for abortions) or birth control.

Its really a model of wanting to take care of someone else  not being told, You have to, or Im forcing you to do this,  Mr. Jebson said.

The Doyles said that their impression might change if they incur big medical bills, but for now they appreciate the personal nature of their monthly transactions.

Theres something different about writing my check to someone who needs it, Mrs. Doyle said. I feel like Im loving on somebody instead of just paying my premiums.",[]

Strategically skipping bread, pasta and other carbohydrates at dinner might improve subsequent athletic performance, provided those low-carb meals are combined with the right types of workouts, according to a new sports nutrition study. Its findings undercut some entrenched ideas about how athletes should eat in preparation for spring marathons and other endurance races.

As those of us who are athletes or spend time around them know, diets are a topic of consuming interest for the group, since an athletes diet affects how well he or she can train, recover, progress, chisel a physique and compete.

But the ideal sports diet remains elusive. Many dietitians and coaches advocate for heaps of carbohydrates at the training table. Carbohydrates, which break down during digestion into sugar, are the bodys first choice as fuel during exercise. But the bodys reservoir of stored carbohydrates is small, and even if athletes supplement their supply during exercise with sugary drinks or food, prolonged or intense exertion generally incinerates much of the bodys available carbohydrates.

Consequently, some experts suggest that athletic success may depend in part on making the body better able to use fat as a fuel. Even the leanest athletes body is girded with the stuff, theoretically providing enough energy for even the longest, hardest workouts. Low-carbohydrate diets will force the body to turn to fat. But working muscles must become used to burning fat, a process that can make exercising on a low-carb diet difficult in the short term. Indeed, athletes on extremely low-carbohydrate diets tend to struggle to finish hard workouts.

So researchers at the French National Institute of Sport, Expertise and Performance in Paris and other institutions began to wonder about the possibilities of modified forms of low-carb diets, and specifically about what they and other scientists call sleeping low.

With a sleep-low sports diet, an athlete skips carbohydrates at dinner. In the morning, his or her body should have low reserves of the macronutrient, and any ensuing workouts would force the body to turn to fat, its most abundant fuel. In past studies of the technique, however, it has produced mixed results in terms of whether it improves competitive performance.

The authors of the new study, which was published in January in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, suspected that the sleep-low diet needed to be integrated into a broader training plan in order to show desirable results.

To test that possibility, they recruited 21 experienced, competitive triathletes who bravely agreed to have their diets manipulated. The scientists ran their volunteers through a simulated triathlon and other tests of their current fitness and pace.

Half of the athletes were then randomly assigned to eat a standard sports diet, with large helpings of carbohydrates at every meal and after workouts.

The others were put on a sleep-low regimen. With this program, the athletes consumed the same amount of carbohydrates over the course of the day as the other group, but in a different sequence. Virtually all of their carbohydrates were consumed at breakfast and lunch, with none at dinner.

At the same time, all of the athletes also began a new training program. In the afternoon, both groups completed a draining, intense interval-training session, designed to increase fitness and deplete the bodys carbohydrate stores. The members of the control group then replenished their carbohydrates at dinner; the sleep-low group did not.

Next morning, before breakfast, the volunteers pedaled for an hour at a moderate pace on stationary bicycles. By this time, the sleep-low group was running on carbohydrate fumes and body fat.

Afterward, all of the athletes sat down to large, carb-rich breakfasts and lunches, meaning that both groups were flush with carbohydrates for the afternoon interval training.

This program continued for four days per week for three weeks. (On the remaining days, the athletes ran, cycled or swam at an easy pace and ate as they chose.)

After three weeks, the athletes in the sleep-low group were grumbling about evening hunger.

But when the researchers now repeated the simulated triathlon, those athletes in the sleep-low group showed notable improvement. Their times on the 10-kilometer running leg at the end of the race were faster by about 75 seconds, or 3 percent, than at the start of the study. The control group had not improved.

The sleep-low volunteers also had lost body fat, while the other athletes had not.

These findings suggest, said Laurie-Anne Marquet, a graduate student at the French National Institute of Sport who led the study, that exercising strenuously in the afternoon, depriving yourself of carbohydrates afterward, training gently the next morning and then swallowing a mound of pancakes might be a useful way to improve endurance and performance. The regimen seemed to have increased the athletes ability to access fat as muscle fuel, she said, allowing them to exercise harder during the workouts than the control group and gain additional fitness and speed.

Such a rigorous routine is not for everyone, of course. Those of us not training for a marathon, triathlon or similar event probably would not enjoy or benefit from sleeping low. Even serious athletes should thread the approach into their training cautiously, Ms. Marquet said, beginning a few weeks before a race and easing off in the days just before the event, when they should down carbohydrates at will.

Encouragingly for those tempted by the diet, though, most of the athletes in the study, Ms. Marquet said, have now integrated this strategy into their training.

Lets give a hand to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. After all weve been through with the Republicans, its nice to hear presidential candidates go at each others throat while theyre talking about where they stood on immigration issues in 2007.









This was Wednesdays Democratic debate  the second one in a week, not counting the back-to-back town halls in between. People, do you remember when we used to complain that there werent going to be enough debates? Ah yes, long ago. Dinosaurs roamed the earth and Marco Rubio was a hot ticket.

Clinton held up well, given that her first three questions involved why she lost the Michigan primary, her emails and whether shed drop out if she was indicted. (Oh, for goodness  that is not going to happen. Im not even answering that question.) It was a tough evening. Sanders accused Clinton of cruelty to Honduran children. She claimed he had sided with the Minutemen.

Since the debate was on Univision, there was a strong emphasis on immigration, which provided a kind of mirror image of the Republican debates. Clinton and Sanders bickered long and hard about who had been less in favor of deportation, going back more than a decade. (Madam Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week!)

In truth, immigration is not an issue that actually separates these two people. The real gulf is between the grand vision and the practical plan. Sanders thinks he can provide free public college tuition and Medicare-like health coverage for all. My dad used to say, If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is, Clinton rejoined.

And then theres the auto industry bailout. One of the biggest moments in the Democrats Week of Endless Debates came Sunday when Clinton caught Sanders off guard by accusing him  in Michigan!  of refusing to support Detroit during the economic crisis.

He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry, Clinton claimed while Sanders looked stunned.

What followed was the most quoted moment of the encounter:

Sanders: If you are talking about the Wall Street bailout, where some of your friends destroyed this economy 

Clinton: You know 

Sanders: Excuse me, Im talking.

Audience: Oooooh

Its certainly a tribute to the general decorum with which the Democrats have conducted themselves that this was enough to draw a gasp from the crowd. The bar is so high on the Republican side that to get a real response one of the candidates would have had to hit the other with a hammer.

But lets look at the bailout issue for a minute. Sanders did vote for a bill to lend money to the auto industry. But it got blocked in the Senate. Then during the stupendously complex end-of-the-Bush-administration negotiations, the bailout got mooshed into a huge, messy bill that did indeed involve helping Wall Street. When the only choices were nothing or a big, unappetizing legislative stew, he refused to bite.

That pretty much sums up his career in Congress. Sanders stood up for his principles, but he didnt play any real role. At one point he offered an amendment to raise taxes on high-income individuals, which was basically ignored. He was marvelous, but symbolically marvelous.

He was in no way like Ted Cruz, who just tries to get attention by stopping things. Nobody hates Bernie Sanders. But hes a maverick legislator, a man without a party. Thats a way, way different kind of life than being the person who has to run the country.

You have to make hard choices when youre in positions of responsibility, Clinton said.

Clinton is a stupendous debater, and shes developed smooth and sensible-sounding answers to sticky matters like the State Department emails and Benghazi. But she still hasnt been able to handle Sanderss attacks on her $225,000 speeches to finance industry insiders. She shrugs and says shell release the transcripts when everybody else does, which generally involves mentioning that President Obama took a lot of money from Wall Street.

I dont have any comment, she said when she was questioned earlier in the week about campaign donations. I dont know that. I dont believe that there is any reason to be concerned about it.

This is the stuff that makes Democrats want to send a message. Hillary Clinton is by far the best qualified candidate for president. But at this point in the campaign, you can understand why some people feel that voting for her against Bernie Sanders is like rewarding Washington for its worst behavior.

In the end, Clinton is the one who knows how to make the system work. But shes just got to be clearer on how she can work against the system.",[]

The New York City police have charged the driver of a vehicle that crashed into a police car during a drug investigation in Brooklyn on Tuesday, a confrontation in which a plainclothes detective was shot in the shoulder by another officer.

The driver, Oscar Vera, 45, was charged with assaulting a police officer, reckless endangerment and resisting arrest, in addition to two drug charges, the police said.

Mr. Vera was selling drugs in a car near Wilson Avenue and Troutman Street in Bushwick, according to the police. There was a second man in the vehicle, the authorities said.

After the men were approached by the detective and a sergeant around 6:15 p.m., the car reversed, striking the police car, and accelerated with the detective partly inside, the police said.

Both officers fired. The detective, an 11-year veteran of the Police Department, was struck by gunfire from the sergeant, said a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing. Mr. Vera was shot in the leg and wrist and was taken to a hospital.

Mr. Veras passenger was taken into custody, the official said, but had not been charged.

The police were still looking for a third person in connection with the drug sale.",[]

Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday will get a prime opportunity to air their grievances over the handling of the Supreme Court vacancy when the panel gathers for its first business meeting since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last month.

Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the panel bitterly divided over whether to take up President Obamas coming nominee, said on Wednesday that he expected a full-blown debate at the session. Democrats will no doubt be happy to oblige him.

Democratic members of the panel, which would be the first stop for a nominee, have expressed their displeasure with Mr. Grassley, taking him to task for announcing that the committee would not take up any nomination. Mr. Grassley and his Republican colleagues have fought back with examples of how in past presidential election years top Democrats threatened to block high court nominees by Republican presidents.

On Thursday, the combatants will be at close quarters for the discussion. An earlier business meeting scheduled for last week was canceled when Democrats objected to Mr. Grassleys proposal to hold it in a room off the Senate floor, which would have limited attendance from the news media and the public.

It is very doubtful that anything will be settled at the session, but it will give both sides a chance to sharpen their arguments for what Mr. Grassley suggested will be a drawn-out dispute.

Whether it is today or tomorrow or whether it is over the next seven or eight months, this is a very important debate we ought to have about the Constitution, he said.",[]

The migrant is the defining figure of the 20th century, Salman Rushdie wrote 20 years ago in the literary magazine Granta. In this century of wandering, of refugees and writers in exile carrying cities in their bedrolls, migrants taught us what it was to be human, he said, because theyd lost those very things that gave shape to their humanity  roots, culture, social knowledge  and were forced to devise new ways of being. And the migrant writer hatched a new language along the way. To conquer English may be to complete the process of making ourselves free, Rushdie wrote in his 1991 essay collection, Imaginary Homelands. Shoals of people still move across the world today, but the idea of a literature of migration seems to have fallen out of fashion  not with readers but with writers, some of whom chafe at being narrowly categorized, consigned to an ethnic beat, their work treated as sociology instead of art.









I dont know what to make of the term immigrant fiction,  Jhumpa Lahiri said in a 2013 interview in the Book Review. If certain books are to be termed immigrant fiction, what do we call the rest? Native fiction? Puritan fiction? Theres a feeling that the designation edges writers to the margins  they are forever hyphenated and their work sapped of its universality. Im not an immigrant writer, the poet Richard Blanco told The Los Angeles Review of Books. I am the son of immigrants, and Im an immigrant myself who is a writer. You always worry if youre writing in the context of your story, its not mainstream.

This is all very reasonable. Arent the themes of immigrant literature  estrangement, homelessness, fractured identities  the stuff of all modern literature, if not life? Can it be that were all exiles? Roberto Bolano asked. Is it possible that all of us are wandering strange lands? Alienation is alienation, after all. Kafka spoke to everyone when he wrote in a (possibly apocryphal) diary entry: Enclosed in my own four walls, I found myself as an immigrant imprisoned in a foreign country; . . . I saw my family as strange aliens whose foreign customs, rites and very language defied comprehension; . . . though I did not want it, they forced me to participate in their bizarre rituals.

The trouble is that the migrant is not a metaphor, or not always. Two novels published this month make this plain, rendering the trauma of migration with harsh clarity. A LIFE APART (Norton, paper, $16.95), by Neel Mukherjee, and THE YEAR OF THE RUNAWAYS (Knopf, $27.95), by Sunjeev Sahota, which was shortlisted for this years Man Booker Prize, recount the stories of Indians making a miserable transition to life in England  from the costs of the journey (much dignity, one kidney) to the caste politics at either end to the first beating, the first sight of snow. Bolano may be right, we may all be strangers in strange lands  but for some of us, these authors point out, this terrain is not merely internal, and it must be navigated without language or aid (to say nothing about that kidney).

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Both books are elegies of sorts for the many characters who dont survive the journey, who are broken or just turn sour or strange. But they couldnt be more different. Sahota writes about the lowest castes and the tribes of the unlucky  lonely men lacking even nourishing fantasies, who suffer at home, angle to enter England by any means necessary only to be greeted by violence and dangerous, low-paying work. His sentences are crowded with incident, but hes fundamentally an aloof, emotionally reticent writer. Mukherjee, who has inveighed against this very kind of prose in his criticism (the dominant and unquestioned orthodoxy of contemporary Anglophone fiction), is fussier.He is partial to elaborately upholstered sentences, sometimes unhappily so, and a contrapuntal structure  theres a novel within this novel. He follows just one character: a young Bengali writer studying at Oxford on scholarship. But in both books, the favored and unfavored quickly lose their footing. They run out of money and overstay their visas. Theyre forced into the twilight life of sex work and hard labor.

A Life Apart and The Year of the Runaways are part of a wave of recent books that cast a more critical eye on migration than usual. The immigrant novel has tended to be optimistic by nature  stories of upward mobility tinged with nostalgia for the motherland and animated by the characters struggle to balance individual desires and the demands of the family or community.

Authors like NoViolet Bulawayo, Laila Lalami, Teju Cole, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Zia Haider Rahman, however, bring more skepticism and a wider angle to the topic. As Pankaj Mishra pointed out in his 2013 essay on the global novel, many of these writers are likely to be as leery of nationalism and global capitalism as they are of arranged marriage. Assimilation is regarded as impossible; ambitions are swiftly aborted. When we got to America we took our dreams, looked at them tenderly as if they were newly born children and put them away, NoViolet Bulawayo writes in We Need New Names, her novel about a young girl who escapes from Zimbabwe to America only to be disappointed by the lack of opportunity. We would never be the things we had wanted to be: doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers. There are no fantasies of acceptance, let alone belonging. In Zia Haider Rahmans In the Light of What We Know, a British-Bangladeshi character thinks, If an immigration officer at Heathrow had ever said Welcome home to me, I would have given my life for England, for my country, there and then.

Sahota takes it further in The Year of the Runaways: What decadence this belonging rubbish was, what time the rich must have if they could sit around and weave great worries out of such threadbare things. Strikingly, British people play scant roles in both Sahotas and Mukherjees books. The central drama is internal, less the adaptation of oneself to a country  so resolutely hostile  than to ones own evolving self.

There is a beautiful pitilessness at the heart of both books. The characters suffer and suffer. They dont yearn for their lost lives; they dont adjust particularly well to their new ones. The passing consolations are in friendships that are nearly always strategic and temporary, more cautious mutual-disarmament agreements than intimacy: Mukherjees writer finds a kind of fraternity among the men he meets cruising for sex, and the runaways in Sahotas book  three immigrants from India and a British-Indian woman who enters into a sham marriage with one of them  form a loose, very combustible family unit for a time.

Rushdie wrote that the migrant had to discover new ways to be human. These books recognize what a task that is; they recognize that migration can be, for some, an almost posthumous existence, that it awakens not only the desire to succeed but also, sometimes, the drive to extinguish what little remains of the self. One wants to praise these novels as immigrant fiction not in order to marginalize them but to pinpoint how deeply and clearly they see across borders and into character and history (vision and visitor share a Latin root; the visitor is she who has come to see, she who notices). This is the bitter paradox regarding the grousing about immigrant fiction: that a genre with such a wide sweep, with such a vantage point on the contingencies of human and cultural behavior, can be derided for, of all things, narrowness.",[]

FRANKFURT  The European Central Bank took a series of unexpected and radical steps on Thursday to stimulate the sluggish eurozone economy, including effectively paying banks to lend money.









While increasing the penalty it charges banks to store funds in its virtual vaults, as expected, the central bank surprised analysts and investors by saying it would also offer four-year loans to commercial banks under an arrangement that would pay the banks interest on money they lend to businesses and consumers.

The negative interest rate on central bank loans would be granted only under special conditions, and it is not clear how many banks would qualify. Still, the step represented a significant escalation of the central banks efforts to give the eurozone economy a decisive shove and to head off the threat of a destructive decline in prices known as deflation.

But the moves are not without risks, taking the central bank further into the relatively uncharted territory of so-called negative interest rates.

The central bank also said it would expand its purchases of government bonds and other assets to 80 billion euros, or about $88 billion, a month from 60 billion. In another unprecedented step for the eurozone, the central bank will also begin buying corporate bonds as part of the asset purchases.

But the unexpectedly forceful action could also be interpreted as a sign that the European Central Bank is more worried than analysts thought about the risk of deflation.

This has all the hallmarks of the E.C.B. having thrown the kitchen sink at the problem, Patrick ODonnell, an investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said in a statement.

In a news conference, Mario Draghi, the central banks president, said, We are not in deflation. But he indicated that the risks of deflation have increased.

Mr. Draghi called the measures a comprehensive package meant to spur inflation and the eurozone economy.

We have shown that we are not short of ammunition, Mr. Draghi said.

In normal times, commercial banks earn interest on money parked at the central bank. But beginning in June 2014, the European Central Bank began effectively penalizing banks for doing so, charging a negative interest rate on deposits.

In its first step on Thursday, the European Central Bank said it would further cut the deposit rate  the interest on commercial banks holdings at the central bank  to minus 0.4 percent. That was down from minus 0.3 percent. Some analysts had expected a bigger cut, to minus 0.5 percent.

The moves signal the central banks sense of urgency about the eurozone economy. Mr. Draghi said on Thursday that the central banks outlook for economic growth had been revised slightly down because of the slowing global economy and broader geopolitical risks.

Despite the banks stimulus measures to date, inflation in the 19 countries of the eurozone has been stuck near or below zero for more than a year. The inflation rate, which had been slightly positive, was minus 0.2 percent in February, according to official figures. Falling prices are a symptom of slow growth, while a broad, sustained decline in prices can undercut corporate profits and lead to job losses.

Deflation occurs when consumers delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices, creating a circle of falling prices and demand. Because retail sales have been growing slightly in the eurozone, deflation has technically not begun. But policy makers fear that it could set in, knowing that deflation is a debilitating condition that is hard to cure.

Mr. Draghi said that the central bank expected inflation to remain at negative levels in the coming months, before moving back into a positive range this year.

As recently as December, the central bank had forecast an inflation rate of 1 percent for 2016. On Thursday, Mr. Draghi said the forecast was now for 0.1 percent for this year.

The banks forecast calls for inflation to revive, to 1.3 percent next year and 1.6 percent for 2018.

Rekindling inflation is one of the central banks main policy objectives.

Mr. Draghi and his colleagues on the central banks Governing Council have had to explore new frontiers of monetary policy as they try to push inflation back to the official target of close to, but below, 2 percent. It is a goal the central bank has not been able to meet since 2013.

Negative interest rates, which have been adopted in some countries outside the eurozone, including Denmark and Switzerland, have upended many assumptions about how the financial system works. In the eurozone, the trend has led to negative rates on other assets such as German government bonds and recently even some bonds by commercial borrowers. Investors who buy such bonds have in effect been willing to pay to store their money in a place they consider safe.

On Tuesday, Berlin Hyp, a German bank, issued 500 million in bonds with a negative interest rate of 0.162 percent. The bank said that demand for the bonds, mostly from other banks, was three times the supply.

There has been considerable debate among economists about whether the central bank measures have done any good. There are also risks. For example, negative interest rates could hurt bank profits even as many banks are struggling with bad loans or other troubled assets.

Perhaps to help counter that negative effect, the European Central Bank said on Thursday that it would begin rewarding banks that lend money. The move technically involves its own form of negative interest rates, in that the central bank will offer loans to the lenders at a rate as low as minus 0.4 percent for four years.

In other words, while the European Central Banks negative deposit will be forcing commercial lenders to pay to park their money at the central bank, the negative rate on its loans to banks will result in the commercial banks making extra money when they put those funds to work in the economy.

It was almost exactly a year ago that the European Central Bank set eurozone precedent by buying government bonds and other assets. The program has essentially been one of printing money in hopes of stimulating the eurozone economy, which has yet to recover fully from the global financial crisis of 2008.

The money-printing program, known as quantitative easing, has helped keep the euro weak against the dollar, which is good for European exporters. And Mr. Draghi has argued that it has made it easier for banks to lend.

But on Thursday, he called on eurozone governments, as he has often done, to do their part to stimulate the economy by taking measures to raise productivity and making changes to improve the business environment. Those steps, he said, should include more spending on infrastructure.

All countries, he said, should strive for a more growth-friendly combination of fiscal policies.

The European Central Banks Governing Council has reportedly been at odds in recent years over how aggressively the bank should move to stimulate the economy.

Asked at the news conference if Thursdays decision by the council had been unanimous, Mr. Draghi said, The majority in favor has been overwhelming.",[]

Updated, 10:34 a.m.









Good morning on this exceptionally warm Thursday.

Today will be another glorious one for the books.

Weather forecasters are expecting near-record highs: low 60s when your alarm goes off; low 70s and mostly cloudy by lunchtime.

So claim a patch of grass or concrete slab, take your sweet time eating that B.L.T. and let your afternoon meetings wait.

Wednesday delivered record highs of 77 degrees in Central Park, 75 at La Guardia Airport and 81 in Newark, where March 9 is the earliest the temperature has ever topped 80, the National Weather Service said.

The record in Central Park for March 10 was set in 2006, when the temperature reached 74 degrees, and theres a chance well match that record today. And this evenings weather may really make it feel like spring, with a chance of a light shower.

But before that, there is reason enough to get outside: Were in that springy sweet spot when the temperatures are wonderful, but the pollen hasnt yet sent us running for Kleenex.

(That will start in a few weeks.)

So put down your smartphone, tuck away your tablet, close that laptop and celebrate spring in New York City.

While we cannot be absolutely certain, we safely assume that swimming was not their ultimate goal.

Water temperatures in the Hudson River, for example, typically range from 30 degrees to the low 40s in March, according to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.

Even with the warm weather: brrr.

Those who do choose to swim  and if you do, please wear a wet suit  can expect to encounter many creatures beneath the surface.

(APPLAUSE)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

SALINAS (through translator): Thank you for being with us. The Washington Post and Facebook, these are the results of this debate that the candidates have accepted. They will have 90 seconds to answer each question. When their rival mentions them in an answer, they will have 30 seconds to answer and another 30 seconds to answer questions, follow-up questions that we ask.

RAMOS (through translator): We will make our questions in English and they will be translated simultaneously into Spanish for our viewers. And right now, each one of them has one minute for your initial words. We begin with Secretary Clinton.

CLINTON: Thank you very much. Ive been looking forward to this debate, and I want to thank Univision, the Washington Post, Facebook and Miami-Dade College, the largest college in North America for hosting us here this evening.

(APPLAUSE)

And tonight I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how we knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead, starting with the economic ones. My focus is on more good paying jobs with rising incomes for families and how we prevent corporations from taking jobs out of our country by imposing an exit tax, making them pay back any tax breaks theyve gotten.

But we also need to be having a positive agenda for manufacturing. for small businesses and entrepreneurs, for more clean energy jobs. And I also look forward to discussing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship that will be one of my priorities in my first 100 days as president. And I will also be talking about education, every child deserves a good teacher and a good school.

SALINAS: Thank you, Secretary.

CLINTON: And so thank you for having us, and I look forward to the debate.

(APPLAUSE) SALINAS: Thank you. Senator Sanders, your opening remarks.

SANDERS: Thank you  thank you all very much. Im running for president of the United States because given the crises facing our country, it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.

Together were going to have to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision. (APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Billionaires and Wall Street should not be buying elections. Weve got to end this rigged economy where people are working longer hours for low wages, almost all new income and wealth going to the top 1 percent, and of course, we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.

And here in Miami...

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: ... here in Miami as much as any city in America, we know that we have got to combat climate change, transform our energy system, and leave this planet in a way that is healthy and habitable for our kids and our grandchildren.

SALINAS: Thank you, Senator.

First question, Secretary, you have been starting to sound like the nominee lately, but many voters are saying, not so fast. Where did you fail last night in Michigan?

CLINTON: Well, look, I won one of the contests and lost another close one. I am continuing to work hard for every single vote across our country. I was pleased that I got 100,000 more votes last night than my opponent and more delegates.

So this is a marathon, and its a marathon that can only be carried out by the kind of inclusive campaign that Im running, a campaign that reaches out to everybody, a campaign that offers real positive solutions to the problems that we face, a campaign that is based on how together we can make progress, because I am a progressive who likes to get things done.

So Im excited about the upcoming contests, including right here in Florida. And well continue to work as hard as I can to earn the vote of every single voter.

SALINAS: What went wrong in Michigan?

(APPLAUSE)

SALINAS: What went wrong in Michigan? What went wrong in Michigan? What failed in Michigan specifically? CLINTON: It was a very close race. Weve had some of those. Ive won some. Ive lost some. But, you know, I was very pleased by the overall outcome last night. And now were on to the states for next Tuesday and Im looking forward to campaigning hard in all of them.

SALINAS: Senator, aside from your astounding upset last night in Michigan, you are still far behind Secretary Clinton in delegate count. She has 1,221 delegates, including superdelegates, and you have 571. What is your pathway to make up the deficit, and can you realistically catch up?

SANDERS: Well, you know, when we began this campaign, I was 3% in the polls. I was probably 60 or 70 points behind the Secretary. We have come a long way in 10 months. We have won...

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: ... including Michigan last night, which some people,considered one of the major political upsets in modern American history. We have won nine state primaries and caucuses. And I believe that our message of the need for people to stand up and tell corporate America and Wall Street that they cannot have it all is resonating across this country.

And I think in the coming weeks and months, we are going to continue to do extremely well, win a number of these primaries, and convince superdelegates that Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Secretary Clinton, I want to disclose once again that my daughter Paula works for your campaign. And now I have a question about your emails. Your Republican opponents say that those emails have endangered our national security. When you were secretary of state, you wrote 104 emails in your private server that the government now says contain classified information according to The Washington Post analysis.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

That goes against a memo that you personally sent to your employees in 2011 directing all of them to use official email, precisely because of security concerns. So it seems that you issued one set of rules for yourself and a different set of rules for the rest of the State Department.

So who specifically gave you permission to operate your email system as you did? Was it President Barack Obama? And would you drop out of the race if you get indicted?

CLINTON: Well, Jorge, theres a lot of questions in there. And Im going to give the same answer Ive been giving for many months. It wasnt the best choice. I made a mistake. It was not prohibited. It was not in any way disallowed. And as I have said and as now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing and many other people in the government. But heres the cut to the chase facts. I did not send or receive any emails marked classified at the time. What you are talking about is retroactive classification. And the reason that happens is when somebody asks or when you are asked to make information public, I asked all my emails to be made public. Then all the rest of the government gets to weigh in.

And some other parts of the government, were not exactly sure who, has concluded that some of the emails should be now retroactively classified. Theyve just said the same thing to former Secretary Colin Powell. They have said, were going to retroactively classify emails you sent personally.CLINTON: Now I think he was right when he said this is an absurdity. And I think that what we have got here is a case of overclassification.

RAMOS: If we get your permission...

CLINTON: I am not concerned about it. I am not worried about it and no Democrat or American should be either.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Secretary Clinton, the questions were, who gave you permission to cooperate? Was it President Obama?

CLINTON: There was no permission to be asked. It had been done by my predecessors. It was permitted.

RAMOS: If you get indicted would you going to drop out?

CLINTON: Oh, for goodness  thats not going to happen. Im not even answering that question.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Senator Sanders, you have gone from saying the following, the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e- mails, to claiming that it is a very serious issue. Which is it?

SANDERS: There is a process under way, and that process will take its course. Today in America, the middle class is disappearing. We have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, climate change threatens the whole planet, 47 million people live in poverty. Im going to focus on the issues facing the working families of this country. That process specifically.

TUMULTY: Secretary Clinton, you have known Donald Trump a long time. You have seen what kind of campaign hes running. Secretary Clinton, is Donald Trump a racist?

CLINTON: Karen, Im going to follow my friend Senator Sanders model here. If Im so fortunate enough to be the Democratic nominee, there will be a lot of time to talk about him. I was the first one to call him out. I called him out when he was calling Mexicans rapists.

When he was engaging in rhetoric that I found deeply offensive. I said basta (ph), and I am pleased that others... (APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Others are also joining in making clear that his rhetoric, his demagoguery, his trafficking in prejudice and paranoia has no place in our political system. Especially from somebody running for president who couldnt decide whether or not to disavow the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke. So people can draw their own conclusions about him. I will just end by saying this. You dont make America great by getting rid of everything that made America great.

(APPLAUSE)

TUMULTY: Secretary Clinton, my question was about his character. And that is one of the primary things that Americans think about when they choose their next president. How would you describe the character of a person who has said the sorts of things he has about Mexican immigrants, about women, and who would ban people from entering this country based on their religion?

CLINTON: I think its un-American. I think what he has promoted is not at all in keeping with American values, Karen. And I am going to take every opportunity to criticize him, to raise those issues.

Im not going to engage in the kind of language that he uses. I think we can make the case against him if he is the nominee, by pointing out what he has said. What he claims to believe in The values hes promoting and I think thats a better way for the American people to draw their conclusions.

TUMULTY: Senator Sanders, do you think its fair to call Donald Trump a racist?

SANDERS: This is what I think. I think that the American people are never going to elect a president who insults Mexicans, who insults Muslims, who insults women, who insults African-Americans. And let us not forget that several years ago, Trump was in the middle of the so- called birther movement, trying to delegitimize the president of the United States of America.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: You know, I find it very interesting, Karen, my dad was born in Poland. I know a little bit about the immigrant experience. Nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate. Maybe it has something to do with the color of my skin.

(APPLAUSE)

TUMULTY: So what does that tell you about his character? SANDERS: And I am very pleased  I am very pleased that I think in the last national poll that I saw, we were running 18 points ahead of Donald Trump.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: On (inaudible), people are talking about immigration, and this map shows where in the country they are talking about it the most.

Maria Elena?

SALINAS: So Secretary, I have a question for you. In 2003, you said on a radio show, specifically it was John Gamblings radio show in New York, that you were adamantly against illegal immigrants and that people have to stop employing illegal immigrants. Your new immigration plan is that you would expand President Obamas executive actions and that you would push for legislation that would include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

So, are you flip-flopping on this issue? Or are you pandering to Latinos, what some would call Hispandering?

(LAUGHTER)

CLINTON: In 2003, I sponsored the DREAMER (sic) Act. I sponsored I think in every Congress after that. I have been consistent and committed to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.

I think our best chance was in 2007, when Ted Kennedy led the charge on comprehensive immigration reform. We have Republican support. We had a president willing to sign it. I voted for that bill. Senator Sanders voted against it.

Just think, imagine where we would be today is we had achieved comprehensive immigration reform nine years ago. Imagine how much more secure families would be in our country, no longer fearing the deportation of a loved one; no longer fearing that they would be found out.

So I am staunchly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform and have been so over the course of my public career.

(APPLAUSE) SALINAS: Now, Senator Sanders, in 2007, you voted against immigration reform. You now say that it was because the bill had guestworker provisions which seemed semi-slavery. But back then, this is what you said to CNNs Lou Dobbs. Lets listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SANDERS: Poverty is increasing. And if wages are going down, I dont know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guestworkers who will work for lower wages than American workers and drive wages down even lower than they are right now.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

(CROSSTALK)

SALINAS: So, Senator, were you concerned with working conditions for guestworkers, or really because you think immigrants drive down wages and take jobs from Americans?

SANDERS: Well, you have guestworker programs that have been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center, one of the important institutions in this country who studies these issues, as guestworkers programs akin to slavery, where people came in. They were cheated. They were abused. They were humiliated. And if they stood up for their rights, they would be thrown out of the country.

Of course, that type of (inaudible) leads to a race to the bottom for all of our people. And I worked very hard on that issue. And of course, I supported the 2013 immigration reform bill. And what I believe right now is not only that we need comprehensive immigration reform, if the Congress does not do its job, as president of the United States I will use the executive powers of that office to do what has to be done, to do what President Obama did, and expand on that.

SALINAS: But if youre saying that you would...

(APPLAUSE)

... if youre saying that you would expand on the executive actions, how do you that theyre not going to end up in a legal battle just like Obamas executive actions?

SANDERS: Well, we do the best  we dont know. And I should also say with regard to that 2007 immigration bill, as you may know, LULAC, the major Hispanic organization in his country, also opposed that bill as did many other Latino organizations.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But to your point, we have to do the best we can. I applaud President Obama for his efforts on DAPA and DACA. And I think we have got to expand those efforts.

CLINTON: If I could...

(APPLAUSE) You know, I think its very hard to make the case that Ted Kennedy, Barack Obama, me, La Raza, United Farmworkers, Dolores Huerta, leaders of the Latino community, would have supported a bill that actually promoted modern slavery. That was one of the many excuses used not to vote for the 2007 bill.

And I will go back to what I said. If we had been able to get that passed, we would be so much further along now. Im committed to defending DAPA and DACA. Im committed to going even further to get more people deferred action, to go as far as I can under the law. And I am committed to introducing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship in the first 100 days of my presidency.SALINAS: Secretary Sanders (sic). Senator, would you like to respond?

SANDERS: Well, when we talk about efforts to assist immigrants, Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Elliot Spitzer, who wanted to do the right thing and provide drivers license to these who were undocumented, she said dont do it, and New York State still does not do it. In Vermont, by the way, I worked with officials and undocumented people in Vermont do have the ability to get drivers license.

(APPLAUSE)

When we talk about immigration, the secretary will remember that one of the great tragedies, human tragedies of recent years is children came from Honduras where theres probably more violence than almost any place in this country, and they came into this country. And I said welcome those children into this country, Secretary Clinton said send them back. Thats a difference.

CLINTON: Let me  let me respond again because the misrepresentation cant go unanswered here.

First of all, that is something that is not fair about what I said. I did say we needed to be very concerned about little children coming to this country  on their own, very often  many of them not making it. And when they got here, they needed, as I have argued for, legal counsel, due process, to make a decision. We need to end private detention, we need to end family detention.

And in 2006, when Senator Sanders was running for the Senate from Vermont, he voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minute Men who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants.

So I think when you were running for the Senate, you made it clear by your vote, Senator, that you were going to stand with the Republicans. When you got to the Senate in 2007, one of the first things you did was vote against Ted Kennedys immigration reform which hed been working on for years before you ever arrived.

SALINAS: One last response.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Let me respond  let me respond to that.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

SALINAS: Go ahead.

SANDERS: You know, Ted Kennedy was a very close friend of mine, and I served on the committee he chaired, the Health, Education, Labor Committee. And Ted Kennedy was kind enough to allow me to hold a hearing in 2008, I believe, in Congress, dealing with the plight of undocumented tomato pickers in Immokalee, Florida.

(APPLAUSE)

And I went there on my own. Wasnt an issue really for the state of Vermont to expose the horrendous working conditions and the semi slavery, if you like, that those workers lived under. And the result of that hearing and the work that many, many people did was to significantly improve the wages and working conditions of those workers.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Senator, Secretary, were going to take a break and well continue talking about immigration when we come back.

CLINTON: Great. Thank you.

RAMOS (through translator): So this is the moment of talking about deportations. Were going to immigrants.

SALINAS (through translator): (inaudible) Facebook page (inaudible). Tell us what you think of the debate in the comment section. We will come back after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

RAMOS (through translator): Were back to the Democratic debate.

Secretary Clinton, the last time we talked in January, in Iowa, I asked you if you could be the next deporting chief. And you told me, no, that you wouldnt be the next deporter in chief. However, you refused two times to say you would not deport children. This is what you said.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

RAMOS: And can you promise that you wont deport immigrants who dont have a criminal record?

CLINTON: Heres what I can promise Jorge, I can promise that I will do everything possible to provide due process.

RAMOS: But will you deport children?

CLINTON: Let me say this. I would give every person, but particularly children, due process to have their story told. And a lot of children will, of course, have very legitimate stories under our law to be able to stay.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

RAMOS: So secretary, you seem to be defending President Obamas deportation policy. And as you know, so far he has deported more than 2.5 million immigrants. So if you really dont want to be the next deporter in chief, can you promise tonight that you wont deport children and that you wont deport immigrants who dont have a criminal record and this time, could I get a yes or no answer?

CLINTON: Yes, you can because the question you were asking me were about children seeking asylum. And we have laws. That was the most critical thing I said. Under our laws. I would like to see those laws changed. I would like see added to them, a guaranteed counsel and other support for children. CLINTON: But if you are asking about everyone who is already here, undocumented immigrants, the 11-12 million who are living here, my priorities are to deport violent criminals, terrorists, and anyone who threatens our safety. So I do not have the same policy as the current administration does. I think its important that we move to our comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, stop the raids, stop the round-ups, stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives, doing their jobs, and thats my priority.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: But again, yes or no, can you promise tonight that you wont deport children, children who are already here?

CLINTON: I will not deport children. I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family members either, Jorge. I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. Thats a relatively small universe.

RAMOS: OK. So I want to be very specific. So you are telling us tonight that if you become president you wont deport children who are already here?

CLINTON: I will not.

RAMOS: And that you wont deport immigrants who dont have a criminal record?

CLINTON: Thats what Im telling you. Now I dont want  because Im not contradicting what I told you in the interview. Asylum is a particular legal process. Id like to see it changed. Id like to see us give more support to people who come fleeing the terrible violence that they do. But under our law, we have a process we have to go through which is different.

RAMOS: So you will stop those deportations.

CLINTON: I would stop...

RAMOS: The deportations for children...

CLINTON: Yes.

RAMOS: ... and those who dont have a criminal record. CLINTON: Of the people, the undocumented people living in our country, I do not want to see them deported. I want to see them on a path to citizenship. That is exactly what I will do.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Senator Sanders, would you  can you promise us tonight that you wont deport children?

SANDERS: Let me just say this. I dont think that the secretary fully answered your question, and I think the proof may be in the pudding. Honduras and that region of the world may be the most violent region in our hemisphere. Gang lords, vicious people torturing people, doing horrible things to families. Children fled that part of the world to try, try, try, try, maybe, to meet up with their family members in this country, taking a route that was horrific, trying to start a new life.

Secretary Clinton did not support those children coming into this country. I did.

Now I happen to agree with President Obama on many, many issues. I think he has done a great job as president of the United States. He is wrong on this issue of deportation. I disagree with him on that.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: So to answer your question, no, I will not deport children from the United States of America.

RAMOS: And can you promise not to deport immigrants who dont have a criminal record?

SANDERS: I can make that promise.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: This is why I go back to that 2007 vote because if we had been successful then, a lot of the issues we are still discussing today would be in the rear-view mirror. I want us to be able to achieve comprehensive immigration reform if Im so fortunate enough to be president. And we do have to take a look at asylum laws.

When I was secretary of state, I worked to try to support many different approaches to ending the violence in Central America. I was there meeting with leaders, security leaders, and others. And I think the Congress should support the presidents request to fund programs that would protect people and change the culture of criminality and violence in Central America, helping people be able to stay safely in their homes and countries.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERFS: Let me just answer, I want to get back to this 2007 immigration bill. Its true, Ted Kennedy, a good friend of mine, and I think of the secretarys, did work very hard on that bill. But does anyone really believe that if that bill was all so good, as the secretary is touting, that LULAC and other major Latino organizations, the largest Latino organizations in this country said no to that bill.

And I worked very hard in improving the guest worker provisions so that in 2013 a bill I strongly supported, people who were in the guest worker program in America would not be treated like slaves. (APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Let me just conclude by saying that United Farm Workers considered that bill in their words the last best hope for farm workers and immigrants.

They have proven to be right in the succeeding years. I only hope that we can put together a coalition to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the next Congress. And as I said earlier, in 2006, Senator Sanders supported indefinite detention for people facing deportation...

SANDERS: Its...

CLINTON: ...and stood with the Minutemen vigilantes in their ridiculous, absurd efforts to, quote, hunt down immigrants.

So look, I think the goal here is to elect a Democratic Senate, elect a Democratic president and get to work immediately to get comprehensive immigration reform.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Did you support the Minutemen, Senator? Did you support the Minutemen?

SANDERS: Im sorry?

RAMOS: Did you support the Minutemen, as Secretary Clinton has said?

SANDERS: Of course not. There was a piece of legislation supported by dozens and dozens of members of the House which codified existing legislation. What the secretary is doing tonight and has done very often is take large pieces of legislation and take pieces out of it.

No, I did not oppose the bailout or the support of the automobile industry. No, I do not support vigilantes, and that is a horrific statement, an unfair statement to make.

(APPLAUSE)

I will stand (inaudible) of my career, political career fighting for workers, fighting for the poorest people in this country. Madame Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week. (APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Well, lets do that. Lets talk about that. Lets talk about that.

RAMOS: Secretary, you said this morning...

CLINTON: Lets talk about the auto bailout because I think its important for people to understand what happened. In December of 2008, we were both in the Senate, there was a vote on a free-standing bill to rescue the auto industry. We both voted for it. was the right vote. Unfortunately, it did not succeed. The Republicans marshalled the votes against it.

A month later, in January, a new piece of legislation was offered that contained the money that would be used for the auto rescue. Then President-elect Obama  before hed even been sworn in  sent word to all of us that he really hoped we would support it. He was still in the Senate, I was still in the Senate.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

And I voted for it. It was a hard vote. Ill tell you, it was a hard vote. A lot of the votes you make are hard votes. But the fact is the money that rescued the auto industry was in that bill.

SALINAS: Secretary...

CLINTON: Now, Senator Sanders voted against it. Thats his perfect right to vote against it. But if everyone had voted as he voted...

RAMOS: OK, Senator.

SANDERS: Yeah, let me...

CLINTON: ... we would not have rescued the auto industry.

RAMOS: You have 30 seconds and then well pass to another. Thirty more seconds and then well move to another...

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Let me  lets  so that everybody knows, the bill that Secretary Clinton is talking about, that is  that was the bailout of the recklessness, irresponsibility and illegal behavior of Wall Street. It was the Wall Street bailout.

(APPLAUSE)

And I find it interesting that when Secretary Clinton, who was the former senator of New York, of course, when she defended her vote, she said, well, its going to help the big banks in New York. Those are my constituents. And then you go to Detroit and suddenly this legislation helps the automobile workers. There was an article just yesterday...

SALINAS: Your time is up, Senator. SANDERS: ... where people like Senator Bayh and Ron Wyden, Byron Dorgan...

SALINAS: Senator  your time is up, Senator.

SANDERS: ...former senators said, no, this wasnt the automobile bailout. It was the bailout of Wall Street.

RAMOS: Thank you.

SALINAS: We have to move on. Senator, the time is up. We have to move on.

(APPLAUSE)

Next question. Secretary Clinton, you recently said instead of building walls we need to tear down barriers. However, last November in New Hampshire, you openly said that as senator you voted numerous times to build the wall with Mexico. Whats the difference between what you did, voting to build the wall, and what Donald Trump wants to do now?

CLINTON: Well, I think both of us, both Senator Sanders and I, voted numerous times to enhance border security along our border. We increased the number of border security agents. We did vote for money to build a fence, a pedestrian fence in some place, a vehicle fence in other places. And the result is that we have the most secure border weve ever had.

Apprehensions coming across the border are the lowest theyve been in 40 years, which just strengthens my argument that now its time to do comprehensive immigration reform. CLINTON: The Republicans, the opponents no longer have an argument. And certainly, we hear a lot coming from the Republican side that is absolutely out of touch with reality. We raised money through the congressional appropriations process. We enhanced the border security. That part of the work is done.

Everybody that I know has looked at it said, okay, we have a secure border. Theres no need for this rhetoric and demagoguery thats still is carried out on the Republican side. Youve run out of excuses. Lets move to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. And I think that makes a very strong argument in favor of doing it.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

SALINAS: But the question is, what is the difference between the wall that you voted for and Donald Trumps wall?

CLINTON: Its a big difference. First of all, as I understand him, hes talking about a very tall wall.

(LAUGHTER)

Right? A beautiful tall wall. The most beautiful tall wall, better than the Great Wall of China, that would run the entire border. That he would somehow magically get the Mexican government to pay for. And, you know, its just fantasy. And in fact, if he cared to know anything about what members of Congress, like the senator and I have done, where it was necessary, we did support some fencing.

Where it was necessary, we did add border patrol agents. We have done what by any fair estimate would have to conclude is a good job, quote, securing the border. So lets get about the business of comprehensive immigration reform.

SANDERS: Let me just say...

SALINAS: Senator...

SANDERS: I think the secretary and I mostly, I think, agree on this issue. Look, in this country, immigration reform is a very hot debate. Its divided the country. But I would hope very much, that as we have that debate, we do not, as Donald Trump and others have done, resort to racism and xenophobia and bigotry.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: This idea of suddenly, one day or maybe a night, rounding up 11 million people and taking them outside of this country is a vulgar, absurd idea that I would hope very few people in America support.

TUMULTY: Your time is up, senator. Thank you.

SALINAS: Now we have a question from the audience for both of you.

QUESTION (through translator): We have a question from the public. I want to go to Lucia Aquiette (ph). Shes an immigrant from Guatemala, shes here with her five children who have not seen their father since he was deported three years ago. She has a question for both of you.

QUESTION (through translator): I would like to ask  me and my children  hardworking men in the field  (inaudible).

QUESTION: Senator Sanders, as you can see, these are a very painful and personal issue for Lucia and her family. She wants to know what you would do to stop deportations, but most importantly, to reunite families like hers.

SANDERS: Well, I absolutely support that. At the heart of my immigration policy and I should say that the New York times editorial board called my immigration policy the most progressive and the strongest of any candidate running.

But to answer your question, the essence of what we are trying to do is to unite families, not to divide families.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: The idea that a mother is living here and her children are on the other side of the border is wrong and immoral. A number of months ago, I talked to a young man who was serving in the United States military and while he was serving in the military, his wife was deported.

That is beyond comprehension and policies that should not be allowed to exist. So, maam, I will do everything that I can to unite your family. Your children deserve to be with their mother.(APPLAUSE)

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

RAMOS: Thank you Senator Sanders.

QUESTION (through translator): Secretary Clinton, youve also said you want to stop deportations. But whats your plan to reunite families and thousands of children, U.S. citizens, with their parents?

CLINTON: First of all, please know how brave I think you are, coming here with your children to tell your story. This is an incredible act of courage that Im not sure many people really understand. And I want you to know that in the work that Ive done and the many families that Ive met, I have heard similar stories like yours, where your husband is deported. Your childrens father is gone.

You are doing your very best to support your children. But it is time to bring families together. And I dont think theres any doubt that we must do more to let stories like yours be heard more widely so that more Americans know what the human cost of these policies are.

And I will do everything I can to prevent other families from facing what you are facing. And I will do everything I can to pass laws that would bring families back together. And I hope that your children are all either citizens born in this country or eligible for the programs that President Obama has put into place, DACA and DAPA, because I will defend those and I will absolutely protect your children, yourself, and try to bring your family back together.

(APPLAUSE)

QUESTION: Secretary Clinton, thank you.

Secretary Clinton, they are U.S. citizens (inaudible).

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you.

Now lets go back to Karen.

TUMULTY: Thank you, Enrique.

Secretary Clinton, a Washington Post poll just yesterday found that only 37 percent of Americans consider you honest and trustworthy. Now, when youve been asked about this in the past, you have said that this is the result of many, many years of Republican attacks upon you. But Americans have also had 25  more than that  years to get to know you for themselves.

Is there anything in your own actions and the decisions that you yourself have made that would foster this kind of mistrust?

CLINTON: Well, first Karen, obviously its painful for me to hear that. And I do take responsibility. When youre in public life, even if you believe that its not an opinion that you think is fair or founded, you do have to take responsibility. And I do.

And I also have, you know, very much committed to the best of my ability my energies and efforts to helping people. Thats something that I care deeply about. And I will continue to do that, to demonstrate by my past actions and my present levels of commitment and plans that people can count on me.

That is certainly what happened to me in New York, where people got to know me. They saw me in action. And they did.

Look, I have said before and it wont surprise anybody to hear me say it, this is not easy for me. Its not easy to do what I think is right, to help people, to even the odds, to hear a story like the womans story we just heard. And to know that I can make a difference and I want to in every way possible.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

I am not a natural politician, in case you havent noticed, like my husband or President Obama. So I have a view that I just have to do the best I can, get the results I can, make a difference in peoples lives, and hope that people see that Im fighting for them and that I can improve conditions economically and other ways that will benefit them and their families.

TUMULTY: Thank you. Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

Senator Sanders, you have demanded that Secretary Clinton release the transcripts of her paid Wall Street speeches. Why is this important? Do you have reason to believe that she says one thing in private and another in public?SANDERS: Well, what I have said is that when you get I believe it is $225,000 for giving a speech, and she gave several speeches to Goldman Sachs, one of the Wall Street financial institutions whose greed and illegal behavior helped destroy our economy a number of years ago, when you get paid $225,000, that means that that speech must have been an extraordinarily wonderful speech.

(APPLAUSE)

TUMULTY: So does this mean that you would not think she should have to disclose...

SANDERS: I would think that a speech so great that you got paid so much money for, you would like to share it with the American people. So I think she should release the transcript.

(LAUGHTER)

(APPLAUSE)

(CROSSTALK)

SANDERS: As the secretary said, well, she will do it if other people do it. I will do it. I didnt give any speeches, there is no transcript.

(APPLAUSE)

TUMULTY: But my question was, do you think she saying one thing in the speeches and another in public?

SANDERS: That is exactly what releasing the transcripts will tell us. This I do know. This I do know. There is a reason why Wall Street has provided $15 million just in the last reporting period to the secretarys super PAC.

Now, the secretary says it doesnt influence her. Well, thats what every politician says who gets money from special interests.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: The question that the American people have to determine - you know, can you say that Wall Street is greedy, theyre fraudulent, but theyre not dumb. Why are they making those kind of large contributions?

TUMULTY: Thank you, your time is up.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Well, let me respond, as I have numerous times during this campaign. You know, I have a public record and you can go look it up. I went to Wall Street before the Great Recession and basically called them out, said that their behavior was putting our economy at risk, called for a moratorium on foreclosures.

I went to the Orlando area during the 08 campaign to make the same case, visiting with families who had been defrauded by mortgages, these subprime mortgages that put them and their homes at risk.

TUMULTY: Thank you, Secretary Clinton.

CLINTON: I called for those changes. I have been on the record and now I do have the toughest, most comprehensive plan to go after Wall Street. And not just the big banks, all the other financial interests that pose a threat to our economy. And I have said no bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jail, and I will use the powers that have now been passed by the Congress, by President Obama, who, incidentally, took a lot of money from Wall Street, which didnt stop him from signing into law the toughest regulations on the financial industry since the Great Depression.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Look, clearly, clearly, the secretarys words to Wall Street has really intimidated them, and that is why they have given her $15 million in campaign contributions.

TUMULTY: Thank you, Senator.

SANDERS: Now, what I believe is in fact that we have a corrupt campaign finance system. And its not just Wall Street, its the drug companies, (INAUDIBLE) received millions of dollars from the fossil fuel industry. Weve got to overturn Citizens United and end that.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Wait a minute. I just think its worth pointing out that the leaders of the fossil fuel industry, the Koch brothers, have just paid to put up an ad praising Senator Sanders. There are a lot of different powerful interests in Washington. Ive taken them on. I took on the drug companies. I took on the insurance companies. Before there was something called Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare, and I worked really hard...

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: ... to get comprehensive health care reform, and they beat me. So I have a long record of standing up to special interests. And I will continue to do so.

RAMOS: Were going to move on to the next question.

(BOOING)

(CROSSTALK)

(LAUGHTER)

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: You have 30 seconds, Senator.

SANDERS: There is nobody in the United States Congress who has taken on the Koch brothers, who want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and virtually every federal program passed since the 1930s more that Bernie Sanders.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: And I am proud that the gentleman who is head of Goldman Sachs, now, he didnt give me $225,000 for speaking fees, he said I was dangerous and hes right. I am dangerous for Wall Street.(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Well, if I can say...

RAMOS: Were going to move on to the secretary.

CLINTON: ... you know though, I guess Senator Sanders, that the Koch brothers, as you said, are sensible with how they use their money. And I agree with you. They stand for things that I find abhorrent, that would be bad for our country, bad for our future.

But they did just put up a little video praising you for being the only Democrat who stood with the Republicans to try to eliminate the Export/Import Bank, which has helped hundreds and hundreds of companies here in Florida be able to export their goods and employ more Floridians. So from my perspective, you sided with the Koch brothers.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Let me respond.

RAMOS: Yes. Just a few seconds.

SANDERS: The Export/Import Bank is often called the bank of Boeing, because Boeing corporation gets 40 percent of the revenue.

RAMOS: OK. Were going to move on.

SANDERS: It is corporate welfare and yes, I oppose corporate welfare.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: OK, next question. I want to continue with the issue of trust. Secretary Clinton, on the night of the attacks in Benghazi, you sent an e-mail to your daughter Chelsea...

(BOOING)

RAMOS: ... saying, that Al Qaida was responsible for the killing of the Americans.

(BOOING)

RAMOS: However, some of the families claim that you lied to them. To that speed, the mother of the information officer, Chaznea (ph). Lets listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SMITH: Hillary and Obama and Panetta and Biden and all of  and Susan Rice, all told me it was a video, when they knew it was not the video. And they said that they would call me and let me know what the outcome was.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

RAMOS: Secretary Clinton, did you lie to them?

CLINTON: You know, look. I feel a great deal of sympathy for the families of the four brave Americans that we lost at Benghazi. And I certainly cant even imagine the grief that she has for losing her son, but shes wrong. Shes absolutely wrong.

I and everybody in the administration, all the people she named, the president, the vice president, Susan Rice, we were scrambling to get information that was changing, literally by the hour. And when we had information, we made it public. But then sometimes we had to go back and say we have new information that contradicts it.

So I testified for 11 hours.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Anybody who watched that and listened to it knows that I answered every question that I was asked and when it was over the Republicans had to admit they didnt learn anything. Why? Because there had already been one independent investigation. There had been seven or eight congressional investigations, mostly led by Republicans who all reached the same conclusions, that there were lessons to be learned.

And this is not the first time we lost Americans in a terrorist attack. We lost 3,000 people on 9/11. We lost Americans serving in embassies in Tanzania and Kenya when my husband was president. We lost 250 Americans, both military and civilian, when Ronald Reagan was president in Beirut.

And at no other time were those tragedies were they politicized

(APPLAUSE).

CLINTON: Instead people said, lets learn the lessons and save lives. And thats when I did.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: But Secretary Clinton, what theyre saying is that  what the families are saying is that you told your daughter Chelsea one thing and a different thing to them.

CLINTON: Jorge, that makes my point. At the time I e-mailed with my daughter, a terrorist group had taken credit for the attacks on our facility in Benghazi. Within 16, 18 hours, they rescinded taking credit. They did it all on social media. And the video did play a role.

We have captured one of the lead terrorists and he admits it was both a terrorist attack and it was influenced by the video. This was fog of war. This was complicated. The most effective, comprehensive reports and studies demonstrate that.

Look, as I said in the beginning, I deeply regret that we lost four Americans.

RAMOS: Thank you senator.CLINTON: And I of course sympathize with members of the families who are still, you know, very much grieving.

And I wish that there could be an easy answer at the time, but we learned a lot, and the intelligence kept...

RAMOS: Thank you.

CLINTON: ... improving, and we learned enough to say what we think happened at Benghazi.

RAMOS: You have 30 seconds, Senator.

SANDERS: Well, Im not going to comment on the Benghazi tragedy, but I will say this. A series of articles in the New York Times talked about Secretary Clintons role in urging the administration to go forward with regime change, getting rid of Gadhafi in Libya.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Gadhafi was a brutal dictator, theres no question. But one of the differences between the secretary and I is Im not quite so aggressive with regard to regime change. I voted against the war in Iraq because I had a fear of what would happen the day after.

(APPLAUSE)

And Secretary Clinton talks about Henry Kissinger...

RAMOS: Thank you, Senator.

SANDERS: ... winning the praise of Henry Kissinger, I dont want Henry Kissingers praise at all.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Were going to  were going to take a break.

SALINAS: Were taking a break.

Were taking a break. (through translator) Well continue with topics that are of interest to Spanish (inaudible) education, what to do with student debt. Two topics that we will deal in a moment in the Democratic debate.RAMOS (through translator): We remind you that you can download (inaudible) and well come back with the Democratic presidential debate.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(UNKNOWN) (through translator): And we continue now, connected with Univision for you to send us (inaudible) first Democratic debate focusing in Hispanic topics. I have (inaudible) that supported (inaudible).

Good evening, good evening.

We heard a lot about immigration, about the deportations and race. In your opinion, who (inaudible) better and who presented the immigration proposal?

QUESTION (through translator): The two candidates did a good action of talking, explaining, but what concerned me a bit is that we  we havent seen the plan of Senator Bernie Sanders, and we have not seen a plan in writing from Secretary Hillary Clinton. So we want to see what she says. That is important,

The six months  that we have seen as immigration is concerned, and we see that theyre moving towards. The community needs to not only immigration reform, but the raids have to stop. Families that we have seen that are suffering, they have to be reunited.

(UNKNOWN) (through translator): We heard very emotional testimony of a mother that was brave enough to come here with her five children. How did you feel when you heard her story? And do you think that the candidates had empathy with the story?

QUESTION (through translator): I believe that this was the saddest moment that we had here at the debate, a mother with her children, separated from her husband. And those children suffering because they do not have their father.

And this is what we see that is happening, that Republicans are doing not  by not approving a migratory reform, but also President Obama. So we need  we need not only words, but plans as well. And we need as a community to both stand up and support women as her.

(UNKNOWN) (through translator): Thank you, Gabby (ph), and now the debate  the Democratic debate continues with Jorge Ramos and Maria Elena Salinas. Thank you.

SALINAS: Thank you, (inaudible).

Well continue with the debate now.

Senator Sanders, you call your opponent Hillary Clinton an establishment politician. You yourself are a career politician. Why should voters prefer a career politicians over an establishment politician?

SANDERS: Well, youve got to look at what the career is about. And this is a career that has stood up to every special interest in this country. I dont take money from Wall Street. I demand that we break up the large financial institutions.

I dont take money from the pharmaceutical industry because I believe they are ripping off the American people and charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.

(APPLAUSE)

I dont take money from the fossil fuel industry because they are destroying  they are destroying this planet through their emissions of carbon and creating the terrible climate change that we are seeing.

So I think it is true that I have served in Congress for many years. But if you check my record, it is a record of strength for the environment, for workers, for seniors. Unlike the secretary, I believe we should expand Social Security benefits. It is a record of achievement for veterans, working with Republicans, helping to craft the most significant veterans healthcare bill passed in many decades.

So I think the point is look at the record, and its a record that I am proud of.

(APPLAUSE)

SALINAS: Secretary, (inaudible) Latinos, according to the Univision-Washington Post poll, the number one issue is jobs and the economy. Latino unemployment rate is higher than the national average. Their net worth has gone down 42 percent during the Obama years, and 60 percent of Latinos make less than $15 an hour.

So, last week you tweeted that for the GOP, the economy is an after thought. Well, many Latinos feel that they are an after thought. Do you understand what the specific needs of Latinos are to improve their living conditions?

CLINTON: Well, I certainly know what all Americans need, and that is more jobs, with rising incomes. Its something that I have worked on for many years. Its why Ive laid down the only really comprehensive plan about how to create more good jobs.

And there are several things that need to be addressed. We do have to do more infrastructure spending. That will put many Americans to work. Its a good job that gets you on the ladder to the middle class. We need to improve the conditions for manufacturing in our country and punish those companies that want to export jobs. We need them to be incentivized to create jobs right here in America.

We also do have to combat climate change, and no state has more at stake in that than Florida. And the best way to do that is not only enforcing the laws we have, but also the clean power plan that President Obama has put forth that I support, and the Paris agreement that I think was a huge step forward in the world, that Senator Sanders said was too weak, but I helped to lay the groundwork for that.CLINTON: But we need more clean energy jobs and we have to do more to help small businesses. You know, the fastest-growing segment of small businesses are minority and women-owned small business, and we need to help businesses get started.

The very distinguished congresswoman from New York whos been on the Small Business Committee, Congresswoman Velasquez, knows exactly what we need to be doing to create more small businesses. We do need to raise the minimum wage and we have to guarantee equal pay for women.

SALINAS: Secretary, what would you do...

CLINTON: That will help Latinos as well as every other working person in our country.

(APPLAUSE)

SALINAS: Secretary, you talked in general terms, but you havent really said what you would specifically do to improve the living conditions of Latinos.

CLINTON: Everything I just said will improve the living conditions, and Ive spent a lot of time and effort talking to and mostly listening to Latinos. Jobs are the number one issue, with rising incomes. Close behind is education.

Every child deserves a good teacher in a good school, regardless of the zip code that they live in. Following behind that is health care and how important it is to continue to build on the Affordable Care Act and provide access to health care. And then there are a number of other issues  comprehensive immigration reform certainly at the top.

SALINAS: Your time is up, Secretary  sorry, your time is up.

SANDERS: OK, let me answer that question because its a huge question. And one of the  huge, I know.

(LAUGHTER)

One of the points that Ive been making, and media does not seem to pick up on it, is that we have a real crisis not only with real unemployment in America being close to 10 percent, but youth unemployment in this country.

If you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed...

SALINAS: Your time is up.

SANDERS: Oh wait a minute. Can I have...

RAMOS: Go ahead.

SANDERS: ... a little bit of time here please? African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent. Thats why I co-sponsored legislation to put $5 billion into a jobs program to put our kids to work because I would rather invest in education and jobs than jails and incarceration.

(APPLAUSE)

We have got to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The United States has got to join the rest of the industrialized world in guaranteeing health care to all people as a right.

(APPLAUSE)

We need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. And when we do that, under my plan, we create 13 million decent-paying jobs.

SALINAS: Thank you, Senator.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: We have a question on education. Senator, Ill continue with you. You propose free college tuition.

SANDERS: No, I do not propose free college tuition, I proposed free tuition at public colleges and universities. Yes I did.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: So under your plan, potentially, millions of students who can not truly afford college would be getting federal subsidies. Is that right?

SANDERS: No. What they would  look, this is what I believe, Jorge. This is the year 2016. Fifty years ago a high school degree got you a good job in the economy. Today, in many respects, a college degree is the equivalent of a high school degree.

We have got to go beyond first grade to 12th grade when we talk about public education.

(APPLAUSE)

So I do believe we should make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and I dont believe we should punish millions of young and not-so-young people with outrageous levels of student debt.

RAMOS: Because my question was if you think, for instance, if Donald Trumps grandchildren or  Im sorry  Hillary Clintons grandchildren, should they be able to go for free?

SANDERS: Absolutely.

RAMOS: For free.

SANDERS: Absolutely. They can go  I dont think they will, but Donald Trumps kids  Donald Trumps kids can go to public school right now, I think Secretary Clinton is talking about making community colleges free, they can go to those things.

The point is we are going to get to Donald Trump by raising the taxes on the top 1 percent and our millionaires and billionaires. But all of our people, in my view, regardless of income, should have a right to get a higher education. I want children in the third grade to know that if they study hard, no matter what the income of their families, my family didnt have any income, my parents didnt go to college, they didnt have good income. I want every kid to know if you do your school work, study hard, yes, you will be able to get a college education. (APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Well continue this  well continue talking about education. For that, we go Enrique Cevedo (ph) has a question. Enrique Cevido (ph).

QUESTION (through translator): We just heard about free tuition from Senator Sanders, but right now there are millions of students who cant afford to pay their loans. Maria Martinez is 20 years old and shes a major of political science at Miami-Dade College.

(UNKNOWN): Secretary Clinton, she said she wants to go to grad school and get a PhD. What are you going to do to help her achieve that goal and pay off her student debt?

CLINTON: Well, congratulations on your education. And also on your plans for the future. And heres what I will do. Were going to refinance everyones existing student debt, 40 million Americans have student debt.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: And right now, I go around asking people at my events if they know what their interest rate is and the interest rates literally go from like 8 percent to 14 percent. Its outrageous that at a time when interest rates have been historically low, people borrowing money to invest in their education are paying some of the highest interest rates around.

And you can refinance your house to get a lower interest rate. You can refinance your car. Corporations can refinance their debt. Under my plan, you will be able to also lower your debt, move into a program to pay it back as a percentage of your income and more than that, my plan for debt-free tuition at public colleges and universities will eventually eliminate any student debt.

But for people who have it, Im going to put a date certain that after a certain number of years, you no longer have to pay anything. The government has to quit making money off of lending money to young people to get their education.

(APPLAUSE) (UNKNOWN): Karen, lets go back to you.

SANDERS: I think what Secretary Clinton just said is absolutely right. I think I said it many months before she said it, but thanks for copying a very good idea.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Now the question though, you know, I have been criticized a lot for thinking big. You know, thats for believing that we can do great things as a nation. One of the things we should not be doing obviously, is punishing people for doing what we want them to do and that is to get an education.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: But here is the point. My program, making public colleges and universities tuition free, allowing people with debt to refinance at the lowest possible interest rates is a fairly expensive proposal, about $70 billion a year.

You know how Im going to pay for it? Im going to pay for it by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: We bailed out  Secretary Clinton was one of those who voted to bail out Wall Street. Now I think its time for Wall Street to help the working families of this country.

RAMOS: Thank you senator. Thank you very much.

CLINTON: Well, Im going to respond to that, because I think its a very important issue. And by the way, everybody, who, quote, got money in the quote, bailout, that also included money for the auto rescue has paid it back.

So, the Treasury was out nothing. Now that will no longer happen because we have Dodd-Frank and we will break up banks that pose a systemic threat to our economy.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: But let me say this. Senator Sanders has talked about free college for everybody. Hes talked about universal, single payer health care for everybody. And yet, when you ask questions, as many of us have and more importantly, independent experts, its very hard to get answers.

And a lot of the answers say that this is going to be much more expensive than anything Senator Sanders is admitting to. This is going to increase the federal government dramatically. And, you know, my dad used to say, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

SANDERS: All right. Let me respond to this.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: And we deserve answers about how these programs will actually work and how they would be paid for. SANDERS: I want you all to think. What Secretary Clinton is saying is that the United States should continue to be the only major country on earth that doesnt guarantee health care to all of our people.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: I think if the rest of the world can do it, we can. And by the way, not only are we being ripped off by the drug companies, we are spending far, far more per capita on health care than any other major country on earth.

You may not think the American people are prepared to stand up to the insurance companies or the drug companies. I think they are. And I think we can pass...

RAMOS: Thank you senator.(CROSSTALK)

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: This is a very important point in this debate, because I do believe in universal coverage. Remember, I fought for it 25 years ago. I believe in it. And I know that thanks the Affordable Care Act, we are now 90 percent of universal coverage. I will build on the Affordable Care Act. I will take it further. I will reduce the cost. \

But I just respectfully disagree. Between the Republicans trying to repeal the first chance weve ever had to get to universal health care, and Senator Sanders wanting to throw us into a contentious debate over single-payer, I think the smart approach is build on and protect the Affordable Care Act. Make it work. Reduce the cost.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Im on the committee, I know a little bit about this, Im on the committee, Health, Education, Labor Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act. And it has done a number of good things. But when Secretary Clinton says, well, 90 percent of the people have insurance, yes, not really.

Many of you may have insurance, but you have outrageously high deductibles and co-payments. One out of five Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe. Elderly people are cutting their pills in half.

I do believe that we should do what every other major country on earth does, and I think when the American people stand up and fight back, yes, we can have it, a Medicare for all health care system.

(APPLAUSE)

TUMULTY: Im going to call time here because I want to move on to a subject that more than two dozen Florida mayors have asked to raise with you. They have asked us to share with you their concern over the effects of rising sea levels and climate change in their communities.

(APPLAUSE)

TUMULTY: Just take a look at this map. You can see that no state has more at stake than Florida does. And no city has more at stake than Miami, the city in which we are sitting. But many Republicans argue that this is not a man-made problem.

Senator Sanders, is it possible to move forward on this issue if you do not get a bipartisan consensus, and what would you do?

SANDERS: Well, first of all, Karen, when you have Republican candidates for president and in Congress telling you that climate change is a hoax, which is Donald Trump and other candidates position, what they are really saying is, we dont have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: What candidates are saying is if we stand up to the fossil fuel industry, and transform our energy system away from coal and oil and gas to energy efficiency and wind and solar and geothermal and other sustainable technologies, you know what happens to that Republican who listens to the scientists? On that day, that Republican loses his campaign funding from the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry.

TUMULTY: So youve just described the problem, but how would you move forward given that this is the situation?

SANDERS: The way I would move forward in every other area. And what we are doing in this campaign is fighting not only to become president, but Im the only candidate who says no president, not Bernie Sanders, can do it all. You know what we need, Karen? We need a political revolution in this country.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: And when millions of people stand up and tell the fossil fuel industry that their profits, their short-term profits are less significant than the long-term health of this planet, we will win. That is the way change always takes place.

(APPLAUSE)

TUMULTY: Secretary Clinton, can we do this without a bipartisan consensus? No major environmental legislation has ever passed without bipartisan votes.

CLINTON: Well, Karen, first of all, I was proud a number of mayors from Florida campaign for me in South Carolina. I had a chance to talk to some of them about this issue. It is a really serious one. And there isnt much time left to do several things that I will move quickly to do.

You can see already whats happening in Miami, particularly in Miami Beach with tides rising. So we do have to invest in resilience and mitigation while we are trying to cut emissions and make up for the fact that this is clearly man-made and man-aggravated. CLINTON: And there are certain things that the president has done through executive action that I will absolutely support. All the Republican say they will, if theyre elected, heaven forbid, repeal all of those executive actions. I will maintain them and act on them.

The clean power plan is something that Senator Sanders has said he would delay implementing, which makes absolutely no sense. We need to implement all of the presidents executive actions and quickly move to make a bridge from coal to natural gas to clean energy.

That is the way we will keep the lights on while we are transitioning to a clean energy future. And when I talk about resilience, I think that is an area we can get Republican support on.

(CROSSTALK)

SANDERS: Let me be very clear...

(CROSSTALK)

CLINTON: Because  because after all  excuse me.

SANDERS: I have introduced...

CLINTON: Excuse me, excuse me.

SANDERS: Did you ask me to speak?

CLINTON: After all, there are...

(APPLAUSE)

(CROSSTALK)

SANDERS: Madam Secretary, when he asked me to speak...

CLINTON: You know, you dont  you know, you dont have to do much more than look at rising insurance rates.

RAMOS: Secretary, thank you very much.

CLINTON: You know, most of the property in Florida will be at risk in the next 50 years. I think I can get a bipartisan consensus on resilience and then implementing the presidents orders until we frankly win back enough seats, take back the Senate, and get back to bipartisan... (CROSSTALK)

RAMOS: Senator Sanders?

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: (inaudible) have as much time as she just had.

RAMOS: Absolutely. This is your debate.

SANDERS: Thank you.

Lets be clear. Youre looking at the senator who introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the United States Senate.

(APPLAUSE)

Now, I hope that Secretary Clinton would join me if we are serious about climate change, about imposing a tax on carbon on the fossil fuel industry and making massive investments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy. And by the way, while we are on the subject of energy, I hope youll join me in ending fracking in the United States of America.

(APPLAUSE)

(CROSSTALK)

TUMULTY: Secretary Clinton, Senator Elizabeth Warren  Senator Elizabeth Warren says personnel is policy. And she says that there is a revolving door between Wall Street and the highest levels of economic policy-making and regulation in Washington.

Three of the last four Treasury secretaries appointed by Democratic presidents had ties to Citigroup. Do you agree with Elizabeth Warrens criticism that both your husbands administration and President Obamas have relied too heavily on advisers who represent the world view of the big banks?

CLINTON: Well, Karen, I do agree that we have to end the revolving door. I strongly support a piece of legislation from Senator Tammy Baldwin that would do just that. And I will be looking for people who will put the interests of consumers first, who will do more to try to make sure Main Street flourishes. And I will very much reach out and ask for advice as to who should be appointed, including to Senator Warren and many of my other former colleagues in the Senate.

But I think its important also to look at what we want to accomplish. You know, in the debates weve had  maybe this is the seventh or so  Senator Sanders is always criticizing the two recent Democratic presidents  President Clinton and President Obama. And thats fine, but I wish he would criticize and join me in criticizing George W. Bush, who I think wrecked the economy and created the conditions for the great recession. You know, at the end of the 90s, we had 23 million new jobs. Incomes went up for everybody. We were talking earlier about what needs to be done for Latinos and African Americans. Well, we were doing it by the end of the 90s. Median family income went up 17 percent. For minorities, it went up even more.

Along came the Republicans, trickle-down economics  one of the worst ideas since snake oil  was put back into place. And we ended up with the great recession. President Obama had to rescue the economy. And I dont think he gets the credit he deserves for doing that.

TUMULTY: Senator Sanders, your name was mentioned.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Now, let me say this. I gather Secretary Clinton hasnt listened to too many of my speeches.

(LAUGHTER)

Or followed my work in the Congress as very few people stood up to George W. Bush whether it was the war in Iraq or any other of his policies.

(LAUGHTER)

Now, when we talk about the policies of the 1990s, I worked closely and supported President Clinton. And obviously, I have worked very closely in supporting President Obama, who has taken our economy a very long way from where Bush left us.SANDERS: But when you go back to the 1990s, lets remember, thats when Wall Street deregulation took place.

SALINAS: Thank you senator.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Thats when disastrous trade policies took place.

SALINAS: Were going to break now.

SANDERS: Yes, good things happened, but some dangerous mistakes were made that laid the groundwork for some of the problems were having with a disappearing middle class today.

SALINAS: Thank you senator.

TUMULTY: Time is up. Thank you.

RAMOS: Were going to take a break. And when we come back, well talk about Latin America. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

(UNKNOWN): When we come back, well talk about Latin America. Dont leave.

(UNKNOWN): Of course you can follow us on Facebook live. Dont forget.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(UNKNOWN) (through translator): We continue with the Democratic debate.

RAMOS: Lets talk about Latin America.

Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, it will be my welcome to Miami question. So it goes as follows. President Barack Obama is going to Cuba in two weeks. Forty percent of Cuban Americans supporting to uphold  oppose a new White House policy towards Cuba.

If you were president, would you meet with the dissidents in Cuba? Would you meet with Fidel Castro? And would you consider Raul Castro a president or a dictator? Welcome to Miami.

CLINTON: Well, first of all, I supported the presidents moves. I helped to implement some of them leading up to the announcements when I was secretary of state, expanding travel opportunities, remittances. And I certainly told the president toward the end of my time that I hoped he would be able to move toward diplomatic relations and to make more of an impact by building up the relationship. CLINTON: And there are no better ambassadors for freedom, democracy and economic opportunity than Cuban Americans.

So the more that we can have that kind of movement back and forth, the more likely we are to be able to move Cuba toward greater freedom, greater respect for rights.

You know, Im looking forward to following the presidents trip. I do think meeting with dissidents, meeting with people who have been voices, tribunes of freedom and opportunity is important.

The Cuban people deserve to have their human rights respected and upheld, they deserve to be able to move towards democracy where they pick their own leads. And I think both Castros have to be considered authoritarian and dictatorial because they are not freely chosen by the people that are in Cuba.

(APPLAUSE)

I hope someday there will be leaders who are chosen by the Cuban people, and I hope that democracy will be deeply rooted in Cuban soil and that the people of Cuba will have every opportunity to fulfill their own dreams in their own country. That is my hope.

SALINAS: Senator Sanders...

RAMOS: On Facebook, by the way, this is the conversation that everybody is having, talking about Cuba. Senator Sanders.

SANDERS: Look, I understand that not everybody in Florida or in the United States will agree with me, but I think we have got to end the embargo.

(APPLAUSE)

I believe that we should move towards full and normalized political relations with Cuba. I think at the end of the day, it will be a good thing for the Cuban people. It will enable them, I think when they see people coming into their country from the United States, move in a more democratic direction, which is what I want to see. So right  Im sorry.

SALINAS: Lets continue with another question, Senator, if you dont mind.

SANDERS: Sure. SALINAS: In 1985, you praised the Sandinista government and you said that Daniel Ortega was an impressive guy. This is what you said about Fidel Castro. Lets listen.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

SANDERS: You may recall way back in, when was it, 1961, they invaded Cuba, and everybody was totally convinced that Castro was the worst guy in the world. All the Cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against Fidel Castro. They forgot that he educated their kids, gave them health care, totally transformed their society.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

SALINAS: In South Florida there are still open wounds among some exiles regarding socialism and communism. So please explain what is the difference between the socialism that you profess and the socialism in Nicaragua, Cuba and Venezuela.

SANDERS: Well, let me just answer that. What that was about was saying that the United States was wrong to try to invade Cuba, that the United States was wrong trying to support people to overthrow the Nicaraguan government, that the United States was wrong trying to overthrow in 1954, the government  democratically elected government of Guatemala.

Throughout the history of our relationship with Latin America weve operated under the so-called Monroe Doctrine, and that said the United States had the right do anything that they wanted to do in Latin America. So I actually went to Nicaragua and I very shortly opposed the Reagan administrations efforts to overthrow that government. And I strongly opposed earlier Henry Kissinger and the  to overthrow the government of Salvador Aliende (ph) in Chile.

I think the United States should be working with governments around the world, not get involved in regime change. And all of these actions, by the way, in Latin America, brought forth a lot of very strong anti-American sentiments. Thats what that was about.

SALINAS: Senator, in retrospect, have you ever regretted the characterizations that you made of Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro that way?

SANDERS: Im sorry. Please say that...

SALINAS: In retrospect, have you ever regretted the characterizations of Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro that you made in 1985?

SANDERS: The key issue here was whether the United States should go around overthrowing small Latin American countries. I think that that was a mistake...

SALINAS: You didnt answer the question.

SANDERS: ...both in Nicaragua and Cuba. Look, lets look at the facts here. Cuba is, of course, an authoritarian undemocratic country, and I hope very much as soon as possible it becomes a democratic country. But on the other hand...

(APPLAUSE)

...on the other hands, it would be wrong not to state that in Cuba they have made some good advances in health care. They are sending doctors all over the world. They have made some progress in education. I think by restoring full diplomatic relations with Cuba, it will result in significant improvements to the lives of Cubans and it will help the United States and our business community invest.

SALINAS: Thank you, Senator. Your time is up on that. (APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Secretary, I have a question on Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is bankrupt. It owes more than $70 billion it cannot pay and we have a question from Facebook. Lian Purvea (ph) is asking you the following; I would like to know if during the first 100 days of your presidency, you will help Puerto Rico restructure its public debt and help its economy. The first 100 days, secretary.

CLINTON: Absolutely, although it happens before I am president if I am so fortunate to be. I have been calling for months that the Congress must give authority to Puerto Rico to restructure its debts.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: Just like it has enabled states and cities to restructure their debt. And its a grave injustice for the Congress, led by the Republicans to be refusing to enact that opportunity within the bankruptcy law.

And what we see in Puerto Rico now is a lot of suffering. We see schools being closed, we see health care being denied and we see a thousand Puerto Rican families a month moving to the United States, mostly to Florida.

Puerto Ricans are citizen of America.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: They deserve to be treated as citizens and to be given the opportunity to get back on their feet economically. And I just want to add one thing to the question you were asking Senator Sanders. I think in that same interview, he praised what he called the revolution of values in Cuba and talked about how people were working for the common good, not for themselves.

I just couldnt disagree more. You know, if the values are that you oppress people, you disappear people, you imprison people or even kill people for expressing their opinions, for expressing freedom of speech, that is not the kind of revolution of values that I ever want to see anywhere.

(APPLAUSE)

SANDERS: Well, as I said earlier, I dont believe it is the business of the United States government to be overthrowing small countries around the world. And number two, when you get to Puerto Rico, theres an issue that we have not talked about. That little island is $73 billion in debt and the government now is paying interest rates of up to 11 percent.

And many of the bonds that they are paying off were purchased by vulture capitalists for 30 cents on the dollar. And what I have said in talking to the leaders of Puerto Rico, weve got to bring people together. And its not the people of Puerto Rico, or the children or the schools.

TUMULTY: Senator, OK

SANDERS: But maybe some of these vulture capitalists who are going to have to lose a little bit of money in this process.

TUMULTY: We need to move on to another topic.

Secretary Clinton, there is a vacancy on the supreme court at a very crucial moment. Among other things, the court is considering the most significant abortion restrictions in a generation.

So I would like to share with you a question that we got from Facebook from Joshua Dansby, a law student in Washington, D.C. who wants to know what specific forms of qualifications you would look for in a Supreme Court justice?

CLINTON: Well, I think this is one of the most important issues facing our country right now. And I fully support President Obamas intention under the constitution to nominate a successor to Justice Scalia. And I believe...

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: I believe no state probably understands this better than Florida. Because lets remember three words: Bush versus Gore.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: A court took away a presidency. Now weve got the Republican Congress trying to take away the constitution. And we should not tolerate that.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: And so from my perspective, it is imperative that we put enormous pressure on the Republicans in the Senate to do their constitutional duty. Now, obviously you look for people who are not only qualified on paper, but have a heart, have life experience, understand what these decisions mean in the lives of Americans.

And understand the balance of power that their decisions can disrupt one way or the other. So clearly, I would look for people who believe that Roe v. Wade is settled law and that Citizens United needs to be overturned as quickly as possible. (APPLAUSE)

TUMULTY: Its time to go to commercial. Were going to commercial. Well be right back. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

(CROSSTALK)

SALINAS (through translator): We go to a commercial. And when we come back, conclusions (inaudible).

RAMOS (through translator): (inaudible) which has heads of space and its the candidates to the presidents (inaudible) that are the (inaudible).

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

SALINAS (through translator): We come back with the Democratic debate, sponsored by Univision, Washington Post and Facebook. We are reaching the end, asking the candidates to give their last words.

SALINAS: Were coming to the end of this wonderful debate, and its time for your closing remarks.

Secretary Clinton, youre first.

CLINTON: Well, thank you very much for a lively debate. And I appreciate greatly all the questions, especially the questions in person from the people here and those coming at us from Facebook. It just reinforces my strong commitment to do everything I can to break down all the barriers that stand in the way of people living up to their own potential, and of our country doing the same.

So I am going to take on those economic barriers. I have a plan to create jobs and raise incomes. Im going to take on the education barriers that often leave too many children behind even after they have completed schooling. Im going to take on the healthcare barriers.

Im going to do everything I can to make sure that we unite our country. I will find common ground, just as I have as first lady, as senator and secretary of state. I will also stand my ground wherever matters of principles are at stake.CLINTON: I would be honored to have your support in the upcoming primary on Tuesday, and hope to have the great honor of serving you as your president.

(APPLAUSE)

RAMOS: Senator Sanders, your closing remarks.

SANDERS: This has been a wonderful debate, but time being limited, some of the most important issues facing our country have not been asked. And that is, is it acceptable that in America the top 0.1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Is it acceptable that while the average American works longer hours for lower wages, 58 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent.

Is it acceptable that Wall Street and billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy elections? Is that democracy or this that oligarchy? Which is why I believe weve got to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.

Is it right that in the greatest, wealthiest country in the history of the world, so many of our young people cant even afford to go to college or leave school deeply in debt, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world? If we stand up, fight back, we can do a lot better. Thats why Im running for president.

(APPLAUSE)

SALINAS: Secretary and Senator, we want to thank both of you for being here, for joining us tonight. And, of course, we also want to thank also the wonderful crowd that was here today. Our audience has been wonderful, and thank you for being here.

(APPLAUSE)

TUMULTY: And on behalf of The Washington Post and Univision and Facebook, wed like to thank you again for joining us in this debate and also to remind people to get out and vote.

RAMOS (through translator): We want to use these last moments, its very important to go out and vote, remember next Tuesday, March 15th is elections in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, all these states  in all these states the Hispanic vote is crucial (INAUDIBLE). Talk about the importance of Hispanic votes, how in very close races it is the Hispanic vote that can choose the next president of the United States. This is Hispanic power, but the only way that this can happen is if we all go out and vote.

So you know it perfectly, who does not vote doesnt count.

SALINAS (through translator): And as you know, nobody can reach the White House without the Hispanic vote. Remember, dont let others decide for you. The power is in your hands, you have to participate, you have to vote. Thank you for being with us this evening and thank you for trusting in Univision. Good evening.

RAMOS: Good evening.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"In the Democratic Debate, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Clash on Immigration","['Patrick Healy', 'Amy Chozick']","Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders clashed vividly over immigration reform, health care and Cuba during a contentious debate Wednesday as the two Democrats appealed to Hispanic voters and tried to outdo each other in assailing Donald J. Trump.









Mrs. Clinton, bruised by her surprise loss in the Michigan primary a day earlier, was on the attack throughout the debate as she sought to undercut Mr. Sanderss momentum before the next round of primaries.

Aiming her remarks at viewers watching on Univision, a Spanish-language sponsor of the debate, Mrs. Clinton threw his past support for Fidel Castro and President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua in Mr. Sanderss face and repeatedly criticized him for opposing a 2007 bill that would have created a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants in the country illegally.

We had Republican support, Mrs. Clinton said. We had a president willing to sign it. I voted for that bill. Senator Sanders voted against it.

She refused to let up when Mr. Sanders explained that he thought the guest worker provisions in the bill were akin to slavery. Mrs. Clinton argued that she, Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Hispanic groups would never have supported such a bill. Her broadsides finally became too much for Mr. Sanders when she accused him of supporting vigilantes known as Minutemen on the border.

Photo

No, I do not support vigilantes  that is a horrific statement, an unfair statement to make, Mr. Sanders said. Madam Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week.

In their final debate before primaries in Florida, Ohio and other states on Tuesday, the two Democrats were a study in contrasts as they made stark appeals to the demographic groups they have come to prize.

Mrs. Clinton repeatedly aligned herself with the needs and concerns of immigrant families and stuck to her promise to knock down barriers in employment and housing, hoping these priorities would inspire Hispanics and African-Americans and deliver her landslide victories in Florida and North Carolina.

Mr. Sanderss rallying cries against the rigged economy and establishment politics were aimed at liberals, young people, working-class white voters and independents who could be decisive for him in Ohio, Illinois and Missouri, his top targets next week.

He appeared confident to the point of cocky at times, claiming at one point that Mrs. Clinton had borrowed from his proposals to make public colleges free. Thank you for copying a very good idea, he said. He chortled when Mrs. Clinton accused him of not supporting clean energy ideas, and he muttered, Come on, when Mrs. Clinton refused to stop speaking.

He also showed he could throw a punch, such as when Mrs. Clinton questioned the cost of his Medicare-for-all plan, saying, If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

What Secretary Clinton is saying is that the United States should continue to be the only major country on earth that doesnt guarantee health care to all of our people, Mr. Sanders said, drawing a stern look from his opponent.

I do believe in universal coverage, she fired back. Remember, I fought for it 25 years ago.

The debate in Miami came just three days after the candidates last face-off in Flint, Mich., and one day after Mr. Sanders was declared the winner of that states primary. His unexpected victory infused his campaign with excitement and fund-raising momentum: He was on track to raise $5 million in online donations in the ensuing 24 hours.

Mr. Sanderss success in Michigan seemed to energize him Wednesday in countering Mrs. Clintons attacks on immigration.

Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, who wanted to do the right thing and provide drivers licenses to those who were undocumented, Mr. Sanders said. She said, Dont do it, and New York State still does not do it. He also noted that he had supported allowing children from war-torn Central American countries to enter the United States and asserted that Mrs. Clintons view was send them back.

That is something that is not fair about what I said, Mrs. Clinton said. I did say we needed to be very concerned about little children coming to this country on their own, very often, many of them not making it, and when they got here, they needed, as I have argued for, legal counsel, due process, to make a decision.

Both candidates, who consistently praise President Obama on most issues, vowed to end the mass deportations of his administration. They both flatly promised not to deport children.

Mrs. Clinton projected steeliness throughout the debate and did not seem fazed by her loss in Michigan, taking comfort in her accumulation of more of the delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. She has a steadily growing delegate lead over Mr. Sanders in spite of his successes, because her margins of victory have been greater.

Yet she was careful to show that she was not taking the nomination for granted, even pushing back against a question about whether she had gotten ahead of herself in assuming she had all but beaten Mr. Sanders.

Im continuing to work hard for every single vote across our country, Mrs. Clinton said. I was pleased that I got 100,000 more votes last night than my opponent, and more delegates.

Each candidate sought to be perceived as the more formidable challenger to Mr. Trump, the Republican front-runner.

Mrs. Clinton argued that Mr. Trump was promoting un-American views and promised to take every opportunity to criticize him. Later, she mocked his centerpiece proposal to build a very tall wall, right, a beautiful, tall wall.

Mr. Sanders argued that he could convince Democratic Party leaders and elected officials that Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump.

But Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders both sidestepped a direct question about whether they thought Mr. Trump was a racist, given his hostile comments about Mexicans and Muslims and his initial reluctance to disavow the support of the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.

Mr. Sanders said he was confident that Americans would not elect Mr. Trump, and pointed out that Mr. Trump had been a leading skeptic of whether Mr. Obama was born in the United States and eligible to be president. Mr. Sanders noted that no one had challenged him over the fact that his own father was born in Poland.

Nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate, Mr. Sanders said. Maybe that has to do with the color of my skin.

Both Democrats saw the debate as an opportunity to reach Latino voters not only in Florida, but also in Arizona, California, Illinois and other states with large Hispanic populations.

Asked whether he stood by his positive statements in the past about Mr. Castro and Mr. Ortega, Mr. Sanders sought to put the remarks in context but did not disavow them. Mrs. Clinton pounced.

I just couldnt disagree more, she said. If the values are that you oppress people, you disappear people, you imprison people, even kill people for expressing their opinions, for expressing freedom of speech, that is not the kind of revolution of values that I ever want to see anywhere.

Mrs. Clinton was introspective when asked why many Americans do not trust her. Obviously, its painful for me to hear that, she said. I am not a natural politician, in case you havent noticed, like my husband or President Obama, she added. I just have to do the best I can and hope that people see that I am fighting for them.

Many of the questions to Mrs. Clinton were provocatively worded, especially those from Jorge Ramos of Univision. After playing a video in which the mother of an American killed in Benghazi, Libya, questioned whether Mrs. Clinton had told the truth about the attacks there, Mr. Ramos bluntly asked: Did you lie to them?

Mrs. Clinton was taken aback. Shes wrong. Shes absolutely wrong, she said. When we had information we made it public, but then sometimes we had to go back and say, we have new information that contradicts it.

Mr. Ramos also pressed Mrs. Clinton on whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted on charges related to her use of a private email server as secretary of state. At first she ignored the question, but when the moderators followed up, she dismissed it curtly.

Oh, for goodness  that is not going to happen, she said. I am not even answering that question.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Ask Well: Is It Safe to Exercise During Pregnancy?,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Reference Timestopics People R Roni_caryn_rabin Index Html', 'Reader Question', 'Roni Caryn Rabin']","What is the science behind telling pregnant women to keep their heart rate no higher than 140 beats per minute when exercising? Shouldnt the acceptable heart rate vary with age, fitness level and length of intensity of the exercise?

A

The recommendation to limit heart rate to 140 during pregnancy was made in 1985, at a time when the scientific data on strenuous exercise in pregnancy was very scarce, said Dr. Raul Artal, the obstetrician and exercise physiologist who developed the guideline for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). But the recommendation was later withdrawn. It has no scientific value, Dr. Artal said

At the time, though, the recommendation marked a sea change in medical advice, because it condoned physical activity during pregnancy for the first time, Dr. Artal said. Until then, women were treated as though they had an illness when they were pregnant, and they were advised to relax, avoid strenuous exertion and even bending or stretching, for fear they would strangle or squash the baby.

Textbooks, until the late 1960s and early '70s, said pregnancy is not a good time to exercise, Dr. Artal said. They said, Its O.K. to walk. 

Attitudes have since changed significantly. ACOG now encourages pregnant women to engage in moderate-intensity exercise for at least 20 to 30 minutes a day most days of the week, as long as there are no medical or obstetric complications.

Research has shown that physical activity during pregnancy has benefits beyond maintaining or improving physical fitness, including helping with weight management, reducing the risk of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia, making it easier to cope with labor pain and easing recovery from childbirth, said Dr. Artal, the main author of updated guidelines issued late in 2015.

Although an upper level of safe exercise intensity has not been established, the new recommendation says that women who exercised regularly before pregnancy and have no pregnancy-related complications should be able to engage in high-intensity exercise programs, such as jogging and aerobics, with no adverse effects.

Some modification of exercise routines may be necessary to accommodate physiologic and anatomic changes that occur during pregnancy, such as changes in the center of gravity, laxity of joints and ligaments and respiratory changes. Activities that involve a high risk of falling, such as downhill skiing and horseback riding, should be avoided, as should contact sports, scuba diving, skydiving and hot yoga.",[]

She tried to do too much, too fast.









That is Merryl H. Tischs appraisal of her tenure as chancellor of the Board of Regents, the top education post in New York State, as she prepares to step down at the end of the month.

Her critics say the same thing.

A champion of the Common Core learning standards, Dr. Tisch, 60, pushed for the creation of new, harder tests based on those standards and for teacher evaluations tied to students performance on the exams.

That set off a backlash in which a fifth of the eligible students sat out the states third- through eighth-grade reading and math tests last spring. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, once her ally on using test scores in teacher evaluations, did an about-face.

Now the Regents are expected to elect a chancellor endorsed by leaders of the opt-out revolt. Already, the board has put in place a four-year moratorium on the use of test scores in teacher evaluations. Following a critical report from a task force convened by the governor, the State Education Department is gathering comment from teachers and parents on how the standards should be changed.

If she could take one thing back, Dr. Tisch said, it would be having rolled out the standards and the teacher evaluation system at the same time, because I think the debate over how to evaluate a teacher contaminated the more important work.

But, speaking over the course of two interviews in recent weeks, she also justified her sense of urgency, saying thousands of kids were being failed by a system in which they graduated from high school with only low-level skills.

If anything, I fault myself for being ambitious for every child, she said.

Dr. Tisch said she still firmly believed that test scores should be a factor in teacher evaluations. But she expressed frustration with how much energy that debate had taken up, particularly after Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, pushed last year to increase the weight of test scores to 50 percent in some teachers ratings, a position he has since abandoned.

The vitriol, she said, drowned out all the work we were doing in other areas.

Dr. Tisch was appointed to the Board of Regents in 1996 and was elected chancellor, an unpaid position, in 2009. The Regents are appointed by the Legislature, and they in turn appoint the state education commissioner.

A former teacher with a doctorate in education from Columbia University Teachers College, and a member by marriage of the wealthy Tisch family, she was the first woman to serve as chancellor.

In one of her first acts, Dr. Tisch and David M. Steiner, then the education commissioner, engineered New Yorks winning application in the Obama administrations Race to the Top competition, bringing the state $700 million. The state committed to adopting the Common Core standards, tying teacher evaluations to test scores, turning around or closing low-performing schools and increasing the number of charter schools, among other things.

Dr. Tisch and the commissioner who succeeded Dr. Steiner, John B. King Jr., who is now the acting federal education secretary, became lightning rods for Common Core opponents. But they have also been criticized by supporters of the standards, who think they botched the process of putting them in place. Many teachers complained that they had not been adequately trained on the standards. Test scores dropped precipitously, and parents and teachers were alarmed and upset.

Under her watch, it was rolled out in a way that virtually guaranteed failure, said Eric Nadelstern, a former New York City deputy schools chancellor and a professor at Columbia University Teachers College.

But Joel I. Klein, a former city schools chancellor, said he did not think Dr. Tisch was to be blamed for the backlash.

I think net-net the process moved forward in a very positive way, meaning that I think we now have better standards and better aligned curriculum, Mr. Klein said.

Dr. Tisch said she believed that the anger about the standards was stoked by the state teachers union, which fought the evaluation system.

Carl Korn, a spokesman for New York State United Teachers, said the union had been against what he called the states test-and-punish philosophy because its the wrong way to evaluate teachers and its harmful to our students and the joy of teaching and learning.

Dr. Tisch described visiting a school on Long Island that was successfully putting the Common Core math standards into effect, including for special education students. Later that day, she and Dr. King went to a town-hall-style meeting in the same community.

Up gets the principal from this school, and he attacks John in ways that were just unheard-of, Dr. Tisch said. At the end of the meeting he comes over to John, and Im standing there, and he said, You know, I had to do it. He said, But, you know, its going well.

Dr. Tisch said it was a common experience. Never once behind closed doors did anyone say to me, Back away from the standards, she said. Never once did anyone say to me anything other than, We have to think about the evaluation system.

After Dr. King left for Washington, the Regents replaced him last year with MaryEllen Elia, a former superintendent of schools in Hillsborough County, Fla. Ms. Elia supports the Common Core standards and the use of test scores in teacher evaluations, but since taking office she has emphasized the need to restore trust among parents and educators.

By two objective measures, New Yorks schools are doing better now than when Dr. Tisch took office.

Even as the Regents raised the standards for high school graduation, the four-year graduation rate rose, to 78.1 percent last year from 71.8 percent in 2009. Students performance on the Common Core-aligned, third- through eighth-grade math tests has also improved since the exams were introduced in 2013. Last year, 38 percent of students passed math tests, compared with 31 percent in 2013. The share of students passing the new reading tests, however, has remained flat, at 31 percent.

Dr. Tisch said that among the things she was proudest of was creating alternative pathways to graduation for students who wanted to focus on the arts or a career-related skill, advocating for undocumented students to receive tuition assistance at city and state colleges, and pushing for state oversight over the troubled East Ramapo school district in Rockland County.

Dr. Tischs influence over the board began to wane last year with the election of several new Regents who were skeptical of the state tests. Now the balance is likely to shift further. Two of her allies are also departing: The vice chancellor, Anthony Bottar, is stepping down when his term ends at the end of the month, and Charles Bendit, who represented Manhattan, resigned last month, a year before his term was set to end.

The State Assembly on Tuesday elected three new Regents to replace the departing board members. One of them, Luis O. Reyes, a research associate at the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College, was endorsed by the opt-out leaders.

When the Regents meet on March 21 and 22, they are likely to elect Betty A. Rosa, a former superintendent in the Bronx, as the next chancellor. In a phone interview, Dr. Rosa, 64, said she believed there was too much emphasis on standardized tests as measures of students and schools performance. She said she wanted to see teacher evaluations permanently unlinked from test scores, because she was skeptical of the methodology used to calculate a teachers impact on a students scores.

She also expressed concern about the new, more difficult licensing exams the state introduced under Dr. Tisch, in an effort to raise the bar for new teachers.

What weve been doing to children, were doing it now to teachers, Dr. Rosa said.

Dr. Tisch said she was worried that backtracking on teacher certification requirements would allow the least prepared teachers to continue to populate the highest-needs school districts.

As for her future, Dr. Tisch said she hoped to continue to be involved in education. Asked if she might run for political office  she was reported to have considered running for mayor in 2013  she said: My response to that is always, I never say never to anything. When I was called to put myself up for a seat on the Board of Regents, I didnt say never. So I never say never. Who knows?",[]

Good morning.

Heres what you need to know:

 White House hopefuls converge on Florida.

Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton argued Wednesday night at the final scheduled debate in Miami over who would better represent Hispanic voters interests, with the crucial state of Florida voting on Tuesday.

Our reporter offers key takeaways from the debate. Who won? Pundits gave higher marks to Mr. Sanders. And here are video highlights. Both will campaign in Florida today.

Tonight in Miami, its the Republicans turn to spar (8:30 p.m. Eastern, CNN and CNN.com). Ted Cruz is playing up his Cuban heritage in his bid for Marco Rubios home state, but both candidates chances of overtaking Donald J. Trump appear remote, according to the delegate count.

 Parties look ahead to November.

The Republican National Committee filed two lawsuits against the State Department to gain access to emails related to Mrs. Clintons tenure as secretary of state.

The Democratic National Committee is using digital ads to troll Mr. Trump over the lawsuits surrounding Trump University.

 Mass shooting near Pittsburgh.

Five people were killed and three were wounded in a shooting at a house party in Wilkinsburg, Pa., on Wednesday night, and the police are looking for two gunmen.

 On Capitol Hill.

Oratorical fireworks are expected today as the Senate Judiciary Committee convenes amid growing animosity over Republicans refusal to consider any Supreme Court nominee put forward by President Obama. It might be worth watching live (10 a.m. Eastern).

The Senate is also expected to overwhelmingly pass a bipartisan, comprehensive drug treatment and prevention law.

 ISIS chemical arsenal is confirmed.

U.S. officials say that an Islamic State operative captured in Iraq is a specialist in chemical weapons who has been explaining how the group weaponized mustard gas by loading a powdered form into artillery shells. That validates suspicions that the group used sulfur mustard, a banned substance, in Iraq and Syria.

Separately, in New York, a federal jury has found a U.S. veteran guilty of attempting to join ISIS. Its the governments first trial victory against the groups sympathizers.

 Obama calls out allies.

President Obama, in an interview published today, says some allies in the Persian Gulf  as well as in Europe  are free riders, eager to drag the U.S. into conflicts that sometimes have little to do with American interests.

 Right-wingers rising in Germany.

A far-right party called the Alternative for Germany is riding a wave of discontent over Chancellor Angela Merkels embrace of more than one million refugees to their strongest poll ratings ever.

 A must-have? Our tech columnist is impressed by the $180 Amazon Echo, a screenless household computer with a superfast, highly intuitive voice-recognition interface.

 U.S. markets are flat today. Heres a snapshot of global markets.

Noteworthy

 New fiction.

Among this weeks releases: Helen Oyeyemis short-story collection, What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours; Dana Spiottas Innocents and Others; and Elizabeth Brundages All Things Cease to Appear.

 Campus accusations.

The dean of the law school of the University of California, Berkeley, sexually harassed his executive assistant, and then was allowed to stay on the job, according to a lawsuit.

At Yale, the captain of the mens basketball team has left the school amid a sexual misconduct case. The team is on a historic run this season.

 Medical advance, and setback.

A new study shows that altering patients immune systems can allow them to accept kidneys from incompatible donors, potentially saving many lives.

The first uterus transplant in the U.S. has failed. It was part of an experimental program meant to allow women without a uterus to become pregnant.

 Advantage, computers.

A Google program has stunned one of the worlds top players in a round of Go, which is believed to be the most complex board game ever created.

 Pressure on art galleries.

Galleries have always provided scholarly support for museums exhibiting their artists work, but now theyre expected to provide money as well.

 In case you missed it...

Among our best-read articles this week: Our obituary of Cornells first female president; and the dangers of being a female sportscaster on the road.

Plus, a column about Ryan Hoffman, a former college football player who was homeless. A post-mortem shows evidence of C.T.E., the degenerative brain disease believed to be caused by repeated hits to the head.

 Whats to eat.

Make a stir-fried chicken with ketchup tonight. Trust us.

We also look ahead to weekend breakfasts with recipes for roasted grapefruit, egg-in-a-hole and steel-cut oatmeal (tip: soak the oats overnight).

Back Story

President Obama and his wife, Michelle, will host a glittering state dinner tonight for Canadas first couple.

These soirees for foreign leaders began in 1874 and are fairly standard. But one stands out.

Photo

Fifty-five years ago, President Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline, had perhaps the most majestic of all state dinners at Mount Vernon, George Washingtons Virginia home.

A fleet departed the Navy Yard and headed down the Potomac River, led by Kennedys yacht, to the 18th-century colonial, which sits on a bluff overlooking the river.

The Fife and Drum Corps put on a parade before the 138 guests, including President Ayub Khan of Pakistan, took a tour.

Dinner was served under a candlelit tent with a spectacular view. The food was prepared at the White House and brought over in military vehicles; Mount Vernon did not have a modern kitchen or much electricity.

The next year, Mr. Khan gave Mrs. Kennedy a black gelding. Later known as Black Jack, it was the riderless horse in President Kennedys funeral procession.

In their eighth debate on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders aggressively hashed out their differences on immigration, health care and college affordability. They often spoke over each other, and there were few light moments as the two faced off during what could be the most important week of the Democratic presidential nomination contest. While they both parried effectively, many commentators and critics thought Mr. Sanders delivered his most confident performance of the campaign, even as Mrs. Clinton had her moments.

Bernie Sanders: Consistently more precise and energetic than in the most recent debate. Less negative, more natural, more earnest and more on message than his opponent. Clintons delegate lead looms large, but he showed why he is inspiring tens of millions of liberals across the country.  Mark Halperin, managing editor of Bloomberg Politics

Clinton had two shining moments. In one, she made people laugh. In the other, she offered an unusually reflective glimpse into herself.  Patricia Mazzei, reporter for The Miami Herald

On balance, I think it was a draw. That normally means its a win for the front-runner, which Clinton still very much is.  Josh Marshall, editor of Talking Points Memo

I think the campaigns have been, at least up to now, trying not to damage each other too much for the general.  Joy-Ann Reid, author of Fracture: Barack Obama, the Clintons and the Racial Divide

Hmmm. No mention of the poisoned water in Flint tonight. Surely that wasnt just an issue because we had a primary and now it is over?  Michael Moore, liberal filmmaker from Flint, Mich.

 Im not a natural politician is an interesting moment of vulnerability for Hillary, but annoying that we need women to say that.  Elizabeth Plank, senior producer at Vox

Hillary Clinton would sound more authentic if she answered questions directly.  Jonathan Allen, head of content at Sidewire

Mrs. Clinton got the tougher questions during the debate, on such issues as her emails, honesty and trustworthiness, and Benghazi.  Jerry Seib, Washington bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal

Democratic debate shows Republicans have tremendous opportunity to win White House. So naturally the plan is to nominate a guy who gets his steaks fact checked.  Stuart Stevens, Republican strategist

Tom Sullivan and Jim Dotson met two dozen years ago when they worked in different offices of the same freight company. They lived for a few years in San Francisco and then moved to New York, settling into a rented one-bedroom fourth-floor walk-up in Yorkville on the Upper East Side.









When Mr. Dotson, now 52, received a small inheritance from his grandparents, the couple decided to buy a home, but felt they couldnt afford the city. They discovered the large houses and reasonable property taxes in Milford, Conn., and bought a centuries-old farmhouse there.

All we had to do was deal with the commute, said Mr. Sullivan, who is 55. The train ride on Metro-North to Grand Central Terminal was around an hour and a half. Being early risers, however, both found the commute doable, at least for a while.

At first, youve got rose-colored glasses, Mr. Dotson said. You tell each other you can read or nap  it will be great. After a few years, though, I was so sick of the commute I was looking for a piedaterre in Manhattan, he said. I plugged a ZIP code into realtor.com.

Photo

Up popped not a penthouse in Midtown but a house in central Vermont, surrounded by nearly 40 acres, mistakenly categorized.

I was so intrigued that for $129,000, you could get all this, Mr. Dotson said. I knew this was really stupid. But it was like a magnet.

The couple drove north, bought the property, acquired a heavy-duty pickup truck that could traverse dirt roads, and used the house as a weekend getaway. I didnt even know what off the grid meant, Mr. Dotson said. We were at least half a mile from an electric pole.

And then, after two years, it was again time to shake up our lives, Mr. Dotson said. I talked Tom into moving to Vermont. That was a decade ago. Having quit their jobs, they needed a way to make money. They sold both the Connecticut house and the Vermont property and bought a vacant restaurant in Waterbury, Vt., a few miles from the popular tourist attraction Ben & Jerrys, with its factory tour and ice cream shop. The two men opened a barbecue place, the Cider House, and lived in the residence attached to the restaurant. They now had no commute, and no free time, either.

The restaurant turned out to require far more work than they had anticipated. There is definitely a fantasy aspect in the beginning, and then the reality sets in, Mr. Sullivan said. In 2011, Hurricane Irene flooded the premises. They rebuilt, even though they wanted out.

As we were getting into our 50s, this was way too many hours, Mr. Sullivan said. The winters were harsh. We both missed the city terribly.

They sold the restaurant last fall.

Mr. Sullivan contacted a former colleague at the bank where he used to work, and within a few weeks had a job in the field of supply chain finance. I consider myself very lucky that I got a job at 55 years old, he said.

With a start date in hand but no place to live, the couple contacted Klara Madlin, the president of Klara Madlin Real Estate, who was recommended by some New York friends. She arranged to take Mr. Sullivan for a day of apartment hunting. Mr. Dotson, who is now job-hunting in the field of export logistics, remained in Vermont with their dog, Hubble.

The couple wanted at least two bedrooms, easy access to a subway for Mr. Sullivans commute to the financial district, and a backyard for Hubble. Their budget was up to $4,000 a month.

For that price, I told them we might have to give up the outdoor space, Ms. Madlin said. But they could still be fairly close to a park for dog-walking.

They began the hunt in their old Yorkville neighborhood. At a 40-story condominium high-rise on East 85th Street, a one-bedroom converted to two was renting for $3,750 a month. It was on the 35th floor.

The views were striking, but the idea of Hubble having to wait for an elevator to go 35 floors was a little scary, Mr. Sullivan said. He was a Vermont dog. I could open the door and he could go outside.

A little farther uptown, on East 95th Street, a nicely renovated two-bedroom, one-bathroom garden duplex was available for $3,900 a month. It had a large fenced backyard. The floors were connected by a narrow spiral staircase.

A lot of people have a problem with a tight spiral staircase if the bathroom is on another floor, as was the case here, Ms. Madlin said.

On the Upper West Side, a three-bedroom on 105th Street, for $4,200 a month, was on the second floor. It would be easy to run downstairs with the dog. Mr. Sullivan considered it. But the place was over budget and he had one more candidate on his list.

That place, a newly renovated ground-floor duplex in South Harlem, for $4,000 a month, had three bedrooms and three bathrooms plus a big backyard and a normal staircase. Mr. Sullivan didnt hesitate. The couple signed on immediately, paid a broker fee of 15 percent of a years rent, or $7,200, and arrived late last fall.

Their new city home is just what they wanted and more. They turned one of the three bedrooms into an office and reserve another for guests. They also have a storage room and a full-size washer and dryer. It is nice being on the ground floor at our age, Mr. Dotson said.

With weekends off for the first time in years, they have time to enjoy the city. Men and dog get plenty of exercise daily in Central Park, just a block away, and on weekends in Morningside Park, a bit farther. The avenues are wide in Harlem, Mr. Dotson said, with plenty of sidewalk space for a dog.

It has always been an adventure, Mr. Sullivan said. Weve always taken loads of chances, and people told us we were crazy, but it always worked out in the end.",[]

RE: THE WORK ISSUE









Our special issue focused on how the office is being rethought for an always-on economy, anchored by Charles Duhiggs article about Googles quest to build the perfect team and what the rest of us can learn from it.

With more people working in collaborations solving increasingly complex challenges, Googles internal research on what makes teams most effective is a welcome addition to 30 years of teamwork literature. The conclusion that group norms, specifically conversational turn-taking and social sensitivity, correlate to team effectiveness overturns the long-held assumptions that smarts, skills and style trump interpersonal capability.

Parents can now be assured: Regular dinner-table conversation is worthwhile family time that also prepares our children for career success. Forging meaningful connections and developing empathy at a young age turn out to be necessary ingredients for achieving future business results, too. Meanwhile, companies must rethink the meaning of high-performance cultures. Its time to value and promote workers who cultivate quality collaborations, not only those who produce individual results. Collaborative leaders build teams that withstand the confusion and conflict that often surface during rapid change. Erin OToole Murphy, Boulder, Colo.

Googles study of why workplace teams are effective revealed that psychological safety may be the most crucial variable in whether a group of people works together effectively.

My response is a big duh. This gets to the very heart of why women are not attracted to male-dominated professions. For a woman, many professions repeatedly present situations that are harmful, hurtful and emotionally exhausting. Women have long known that they cannot expect psychological safety in their workplaces.

I am in my 60s and have worked in several professions. The array of behaviors, both blatantly and subtly meant to undermine psychological safety for female workers, that I have encountered has made it obvious why women often opt to work in female-dominated professions.

We have a long way to go in getting to the heart of why we believe making people feel psychologically unsafe increases productivity and team effectiveness. I applaud the attempt in this study to understand how human beings can up their game simply by being kinder, more perceptive and more respectful. Barbara Schwarz-Woodaman, Portland, Ore.

I take issue with the notion that my work is my life . . . if I cant be open and honest at work, then Im not really living, as mentioned in Charles Duhiggs article. With all due respect to millennials and younger generations, who appear to want to share everything with everyone, some of us can be open and honest on relevant matters at work without sharing our entire lives. Work has always been very important to my life, but my friends are not necessarily friends from work, and I prize my life away from work as well. I see no need to assume that you must reveal all in work groups to be effective at work or in life. Rosalie J. Wolf, New York

How can Charles Duhigg write an entire article on effective meetings without once referencing gender? In 1990, Deborah Tannen, a professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, wrote the seminal treatise on men-women talk, You Just Dont Understand: Women and Men in Conversation. Every sine qua non quality that Googles Project Aristotle found underlying effective meetings has to do with female characteristics and values: good communication, empathy, taking time for airing personal issues, equal time to talk. Why not fire half the men and replace them with women at all levels if high-tech companies truly want effective meetings, rather than waste money and time on redundant studies like this one? Ann Grogan, San Francisco

College students recent calls for campuses to be safe spaces where they can thrive intellectually have been greeted with derision and even ridicule. How interesting, then, to read about new research that suggests that for workplace teams to thrive, their members must feel psychologically safe. While Googles remarkable research into the value of safe working environments is presented as innovative new knowledge for organizations looking to increase productivity, students are told that their feelings matter less than the free marketplace of ideas.

Has anyone crunched the numbers on student calls for psychological safety? Perhaps we would find that learning is indeed facilitated and enhanced, for the good of all, when empathy and sensitivity become core values of our educational institutions as well as our workplaces.

nytimes.com,2016-03-11 00:00:00,Loyalist of Aung San Suu Kyi in Line for Myanmar Presidency,"['Richard C', 'Wai Moe']","Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

NAYPYIDAW, Myanmar  The party of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Myanmars pro-democracy movement, named a longtime party loyalist on Thursday as the countrys likely next president, and a party official reiterated that he would answer to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi while in office.









U Htin Kyaw, 69, was nominated by the National League for Democracy, which controls both houses of Myanmars new Parliament after its sweeping victory in November elections. The party nominated two candidates, one of whom is expected to become vice president; U Tun Tun Hein, a member of the partys central executive committee, said Mr. Htin Kyaw was the partys choice for the presidency, and he confirmed Ms. Aung San Suu Kyis earlier assertion that the president would essentially be her subordinate.

She will hold the post handling three institutions: the government, the Parliament and the party, Mr. Tun Tun Hein said. Alluding to the military dictatorships of Myanmars recent past, he added, If there was once the senior general in the country, she will be the senior president.

Under Myanmars indirect presidential election system, the Parliament is expected to choose a president and two vice presidents from among five candidates over the next week, about two weeks before the winners are to take office. The National League for Democracys majority of about 60 percent in both houses means that its two candidates are certain to be elected president and vice president; the other vice president will be a candidate chosen by the military, which guaranteed itself a significant role in government when it created Myanmars current Constitution.

In a speech to members of Parliament after the nominations, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi acknowledged that the next president would be Mr. Htin Kyaw, referring to his work for the Daw Khin Kyi Foundation, a charity she established in 2012 to improve health, education and living standards in underdeveloped parts of the country.

I believe people will like todays candidates, she said. The speech was closed to journalists, but her comments could be heard outside the meeting room.

The new president will replace U Thein Sein, a former general who oversaw a gradual reduction in military control and the increasing democratization of Myanmar, also known as Burma, after decades of outright military rule.

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace laureate who spent 15 of 21 years under house arrest, is by far the countrys most popular politician, but she is barred by the Constitution from serving as president because her two sons have foreign citizenship, as did her late husband.

Before the parliamentary session, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi released an open letter calling on people to support the election process and to be patient even though they might be disappointed that she would not be president. This is a very important time for the country, she said.

During the election campaign last year, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi dismissed concern over her role in the new government, saying that she would be above the president. After her partys landslide victory, she negotiated unsuccessfully with the military to set aside the constitutional ban so she could assume the office. The militarys parliamentary delegation has the votes to block any changes to the Constitution.

It is unclear whether Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who is a member of Parliament, will take on a different role or title when the new government takes over.

Mr. Htin Kyaw, a former director in the Ministry of Trade, went to school with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. His late father was a famous writer and poet, Min Thu Wun, who was also a prominent figure in the National League for Democracy. Mr. Htin Kyaws late father-in-law, U Lwin, was a co-founder of the party, and his wife, Daw Su Su Lwin, is a member of Parliament.

Two candidates were nominated Thursday by the minority Union Solidarity Development Party. A candidate from the military faction  a constitutionally guaranteed 25 percent of Parliament  has yet to be named.

The National League for Democracys other nominee Thursday was U Henry Van Thio, 58, an ethnic Chin member of Parliament, who is expected to become vice president. He is something of an anomaly as a Christian in a largely Buddhist nation and a former army major in a political party that has sought to wrest power from the military.

Mr. Henry Van Thios presence in high office could help the new government settle continuing armed conflicts with various ethnic groups. Party leaders have said they expect to encounter numerous difficulties as they seek to form a new administration and exert civilian control over the executive branch after a half-century of military leadership.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,25 Songs That Tell Us Where Music Is Going,"['Amanda Petrusich', 'Wesley Morris', 'Jace Clayton', 'Jenna Wortham', 'Will Hermes', 'Marlon James', 'Carlo Rotella', 'Mac Mcclelland', 'Jeff Himmelman', 'Miriam Markowitz']","Late-night-television tapings attract a certain type of crowd: tourists in the mood for an uncomplicated thrill after a day at Universal Studios and Madame Tussauds. On a rainy January night in Los Angeles, the turnout at Jimmy Kimmel Live! was no exception. The overlap between the audience and the fan base for the musical guest  the Internet, a six-piece band of black alt-kids playing retro-futuristic R.&B.  seemed to be vanishingly narrow. If anything, the crowd looked as if theyd be right at home seeing Jimmy Buffett. But as the Internet cannonballed into its first song, Get Away, a thumping anthem about mollifying an unhappy girlfriend, the audience members threw up their hands and bounced along to the beat.

The women in attendance seemed especially mesmerized by Sydney Bennett  better known as Syd tha Kyd  the frontwoman, whose Tiger Beat sex appeal gave her performance a depth charge. Bennett, 23, brown-skinned with a blond-tinged Mohawk, has the swayback stance of an adolescent skater and dresses like one too: On the Kimmel set, she wore black vans, a black T-shirt and black jeans low on her hips. As she sang, she roamed across each quadrant of the small stage, staring deep into the throng, as if to find out whether her crush had bothered to make an appearance at the show. To create her stage presence, Bennett studied the R.&B. singer DAngelo, whose 2000 video for Untitled (How Does It Feel) features nothing but his extremely defined and extremely nude upper body dripping with sweat for four and a half minutes. It showed. Bennett flirted with the crowd, peeking at them through her heavily lashed eyes, shooting sly smiles at fans and gently lifting her chin to acknowledge those she knew  among them, her mom, Janel, and her godmother, Sheryl.

The TV appearance was a rarity for the members of the Internet, who, as their name suggests, live online and work from home. Two of the bands three albums were created and recorded almost entirely at the house where Bennett lives with her parents in L.A.s Mid-City neighborhood. But their most recent record, last years Ego Death, caught the attention of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and it was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Urban Contemporary Album category. (Past nominees in the category include Frank Ocean, Rihanna and Beyonce.) The Kimmel performance was a dip into mainstream media that the Internet has largely succeeded without.

The bands name itself hints at an irreversible and inevitable shift in the way music works. For decades, the music industry fancied itself an apparatus for tastemaking, but as technology has made labels role less relevant, that has ceased to be the case. Listeners decide whats popular now, and record labels have to find a way to attach themselves to it. Aside from a few big-name acts, most artists are doomed to languish in relative obscurity with middling profits. This is usually seen as a tragedy  the death of a musical middle class  but it has also presented an opportunity for artists to avoid the suffocating effects of the label machine. And so the Internet has carved out an entirely new corner of R.&B., thanks mostly to Bennett: an androgyne who sings seductive incantations about falling in and out of love with women.

After the performance, a small constellation of cousins, little sisters and girlfriends milled about, snacking on doughnuts in the greenroom and helping the band pack up. After the equipment was loaded into a caravan of modest sedans and S.U.V.s, the band stood in a circle behind the studio, and someone produced a celebratory blunt. As the smoke drifted overhead, the conversation turned to the next day.

The group needed to practice for the first stop on their upcoming tour, which would start a few days later in Japan. Jameel Bruner, who plays the keyboard, wouldnt be able to come until he was done with his shift at Amoeba Music, where he works as a clerk. There was drama to discuss, too. The 17-year-old guitar player, Steve Lacy, had been photographed smoking weed, and someone had texted the picture to his mother, who was not happy. Despite the chilly El Nino air, the band lingered, seeming reluctant to leave and break the spell of the evening. They eventually agreed to regroup at their home base, Bennetts house, to make sandwiches, catch their performance on Kimmel, smoke again and, eventually, crash.

NYTVR Smile More: the Journey of a Song The new virtual-reality film from NYT VR takes you inside Sydney Bennetts home studio as the Internet prepares for a world tour. Youll experience the rehearsal process as Bennett teaches her band a new song, then get onstage with the band as they perform it for the first time.

The bands name started out as a joke, while Bennett was still a member of Odd Future, the unruly hip-hop collective that caused a frenzy in the music industry when they broke out six years ago. In 2011, a journalist interviewing the crew asked one member, Vyron Turner (who goes by Left Brain), where he was from. He was like: I hate when people ask me that, Bennett recalls. Im going to start saying Im from the Internet. The idea cracked her up and eventually inspired the name of the side project she would chip away at in her off hours.

Turner may have been reacting to the banality of the question, but his answer also illuminated a changing dynamic for rap, which has historically been categorized by regional sounds. People Turner and Bennetts age are defined by a completely different geography, the social networks and websites they spend their time on. Odd Future was the epitome of this new statelessness: They were neither engineered by a label nor hometown heroes, but something wildly different.

Odd Future dominated many conversations about pop culture and the future of music by the end of 2010. They had released all of their early work  a barrage of clever mixtapes, striking artwork and bizarro music videos  for free on Tumblr and YouTube. Their sound was prodigious. And not only was their music different but they also looked different too, a bunch of black weirdos who skated in their free time and moshed onstage.

The frenzy surrounding Odd Future reached its peak in 2011: Cartoon Network gave the group their own television show; plans for an Odd Future retail shop were in the works. Labels were desperate to sign deals with the group, and Sony Music Entertainment succeeded. The crew had the upper hand and persuaded the label to give them their own imprint, and to award each member a cushy solo record deal. Bennett, the D.J., got one, too.

Music came naturally to Bennett. Though her parents are 9-to-5 people  Janel is a city clerk and her father, Howard, owns a manufacturing company based in China  her uncle, Mikey Bennett, is a producer in Jamaica. (He co-wrote Shabba Rankss 1993 hit Mr. Loverman.) When she was young, the family took vacations to the island, and Bennett hung out in the studio and watched her uncle work. At some point, I started listening to music a little differently, Bennett said. Rather than being like, Yo, this is dope  who made this? it started being like, I wish I made this.

When she was 16, her parents let her transform their guesthouse into a studio, where she worked on her own songs and recorded local musicians. In high school, she took music-technology classes and piano lessons; at night, she devoured beat-making tutorials and messed around with music software. She downloaded tracks from LimeWire (a file-sharing network like Napster) and remixed them using Pro Tools and GarageBand. She didnt need much capital to be a producer, just good Google skills and a wealth of persistence and patience.

Bennett gravitated toward artists who had pioneered brand-new sounds: The sonic spaciness of Missy Elliott, the stanky soul of Erykah Badu and the acid jazz of Jamiroquai. Pharrell Williams, the original black skater weirdo, is her patron saint. And like most kids interested in music and living in Los Angeles in the mid-2000s, Bennett knew about a teenager named Tyler Okonma who called himself Tyler, the Creator. He had a sizable following on MySpace, where he released his music. His production drew me in, she told me. It didnt sound like what everyone was making  it was different and hot. Bennett noticed that one of the people at the top of his friend list was a kid named Matt Martin (who goes by Matt Martians). She browsed through his page, listening to the songs he posted, too. She admired his ability to create deeply complex soundscapes, and she eventually messaged him, seeking advice on ways to advance her own style.

The two became friends, trading feedback on songs, which put her into Okonmas orbit. And when Okonma needed a place to record the early Odd Future mixtapes, Bennett offered up her home studio. She produced some of their early tracks and eventually became the groups D.J. In old footage of early Odd Future shows, Bennett plays songs from a laptop on a table at the back of the stage. Tomboyish, in a muscle tee and a short haircut, she crackles with the manic energy that Odd Future shows were famous for. She was generally indistinguishable from the boys in the group.

From the beginning, Odd Future was meant to be a galaxy of loosely knit projects; the whole point was for the members to collaborate and spin off solo efforts. Christian Clancy, one of the groups managers, had also been a marketing executive at Interscope Records, and around 2011 he took notice of Bennett and Martins tight friendship and encouraged them to start recording together. After all, they liked the same sounds: jazz, old-school slow jams, neo-soul. So they began experimenting, and these experiments would eventually lead to the formation of the Internet.

Odd Future was a rare example of a viral sensation with lasting power; the music industry is rife with the ghosts of web talents who couldnt be repackaged as megastars. The terms of the Internets deal with Sony allowed us to shape ourselves, Bennett says. The band is artistically cocooned, trying to create, as she sees it, an entirely new style of R.&B., one that includes all types of desire. It wasnt a conscious thing, she emphasizes. I just like women.

It was always an open secret that Bennett was a lesbian, and the indirect directness of her sexuality added to Odd Futures wellspring of contradictions. It wasnt a big deal because, well, it wasnt a big deal. But Bennett frequently found herself having to defend her inclusion in the group because Okonmas lyrics were laced with homophobic slurs and rape jokes, and her presence was interpreted as tacit approval. Bennett thought this was a bit unfair given that, as the D.J., she had the least to do with the lyrical content. When I first heard his lyrics, I was as shocked as everyone else, she told me. I kept listening. I looked up to him. He was a very artistic guy, and I saw past the few words that he chose to use, and I never really felt any kind of way about it.

In a sense, she says, Odd Futures lack of sensitivity helped prepare her for a life in the public eye  even if it made her a controversial figure. The gay community hated me for being part of Odd Future, Bennett says. They thought Odd Future was homophobic because they tend to use homophobic slang, and they were like: How can you work for and support homophobes? But they arent homophobic; they just dont really care whether youre offended or not.

Bennett personally related to the themes that lent Okonmas music its emotional gravity: alienation, isolation, loneliness. She felt they shared a connection, one born of not being a typical black kid or even a popular kid. But eventually the hypermasculinity and caustic sense of humor wore on Bennett, who is naturally low-key. She made tearful calls to her mother from the road, wondering aloud whether she should quit. Bennett also struggled with depression, worsened by the stress of touring and feeling disconnected from her family and her girlfriend at the time. She says that no one in the group  other than Martin  seemed to care. I couldnt talk to any of them about it, she says. We werent all that close, and they never seemed to want to hear it.

Not long after, Bennett began training her little brother, Travis  who goes by Taco  to take her place as Odd Futures D.J. Her musical experiments with Martin had begun to congeal into the core of their first album, Purple Naked Ladies, an amorphous but promising collection of experimental jam sessions and fuzzed-out, vibey tracks. One morning while Odd Future was on tour, when the group was watching the sun crest over a beach in Australia, Bennett broke the news that she was leaving. She says it was not well received. It felt like a divorce, like a family  however dysfunctional  falling apart.

They werent happy about it, she says. I was their get-out-of-jail-free card. Its easy to say they arent homophobic because Syd is there.

She felt ostracized by the band for a while, but a few years after the fallout, any lingering resentment or hurt feelings appear to have faded. She went with her gut, and it worked out, Okonma says. Okonma compared the space Bennett occupies now to Lauryn Hill at her peak. During that time, if you were a female rapper, you were either wearing boy boxers or you had your [expletive] out on stage, he says. With Hill, you had a girl who wasnt doing either, smart, could rap and was musically inclined. Syds more like that. Shes just being her. After the Grammy nomination for Ego Death was announced, Okonma was among the first people to text Bennett his congratulations.

Bennetts exit came at a time when gender norms were blurring. Artists now feel more emboldened to hint at sexual fluidity; its edgy, if not outright trendy. Musicians like Wiz Khalifa and Jaden Smith have been photographed wearing skirts and dresses. Angel Haze and Shamir have said theyre genderqueer. But being openly gay can still feel especially difficult in the world of hip-hop and R.&B., where artists who are suspected of being closeted can face harsher scrutiny. Lesbianism is often fetishized, made into a hypersexualized performance. While Young Thug can get away with wearing nail polish, female artists who give off an even slightly masculine air, like the rapper Dej Loaf, are hounded about their orientation.

Minya Oh, the hip-hop journalist who goes by Miss Info, thinks Bennett has benefited from upheaval in the industry. Im sure that on some level of the major-label and old-establishment industry, there are execs and agents who think homosexuality is a liability, she says. On the other hand, she adds, there are more and more handlers and mentors and facilitators who will see a new artist who is gay as either an opportunity to tap into a new market or, at worst, just a talking point. But even more important than all that, Oh says, is that artists like Bennett may not even have to pander to the mainstream anymore: As fragmented as music audiences are these days, it would be difficult to alienate fans who are already bunched into nomad tribes.

If anything, Bennett seems to have attracted an audience that appreciates the way her onstage presence transcends any particular gender. If you think Im a young boy singing these songs, dope, she says. Run with that. As Martin put it: Id rather try it and fail than have Syd singing about dudes or something. At that, Bennett giggled and sang out: Hell, no!

During the handful of times we met, I repeatedly tried to talk to Bennett about the importance of her visibility as a gay singer. And every time, she seemed uneasy with the idea that she was a symbol. But she cant avoid it  there is virtually no one else like her in the public eye. The last time I saw her, we were having breakfast at the Hotel Hacienda Cocoyoc in Cocoyoc, Mexico, a few hours before the Internet was scheduled to play a local festival in a forest, and I picked at the topic again. Did she see herself as symbolic of something larger than herself?

Bennetts outward manner is so nonchalant and mellow it can start to seem like an affectation, but as soon as the words left my mouth, Bennett put down her forkful of pancake and slid me a sideways look, the kind you give someone when your patience is wearing thin but you still feel obligated to be polite.

Maybe I just look at things differently, she said to me, speaking slowly, as one might to a child who is having trouble absorbing a set of simple instructions. I never really thought it was a thing. You know? Like I didnt think it would be this big of a deal. I agreed that it wasnt and said I was simply in awe of how openly she lives her life at such a young age, when many women I know  including me  came to terms with their sexuality much later in life. The cloud lifted. Now we saw each other clearly.

The Internet  the network  has a way of normalizing fringe ideas, marginalized identities and emerging artists that old media tends to ignore. It has done such a good job, you could argue, that people like Bennett  black, queer and weird  can exist without the burden of having to represent something larger. Bennett will never be something shes not. Shes not looking for validation from record labels, or even really from audiences. Later that night, as thousands of Mexican teenagers rushed the stage, singing along in English and screaming her name, Bennett looked completely at home, and completely herself.

nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Who Gets the Blame for the Slowing Economy?,['Steven Rattner'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

ECONOMIC alarm bells are ringing: Financial markets have wilted. Forecasters have been slicing their projections for future growth. And some leading wise men  including the megabillionaire George Soros  are predicting a return to disastrous 2008 conditions. Thats almost certainly an overly pessimistic view. But without a doubt, the leading global economies are in a major slowdown.









Not evident is whether another recession looms. While current data suggests that modest growth continues in the United States, economists are notoriously bad at forecasting downturns. As The Economist noted, between 1999 and 2014, the International Monetary Fund, in its April forecasts, failed to predict every one of the 220 instances in which one of its members suffered negative annual growth in the next year. Even the Federal Reserve uncharacteristically recently described the outlook as unclear.

Whats unusual about todays raft of challenges is the extent to which governments around the world have added to the problems, rather than ameliorating them. Poor policy choices, like misguided spending priorities and too much austerity, have added to the drag on growth. Notably, failing to act at all has cut deeply into business and investor confidence, an important support mechanism for markets and consumers alike.

Governments alone are not to blame; the reasons for the sagging economies are multifarious and jumbled, more de Kooning than Mondrian.

For a start, global competition and weak productivity growth have held down wages in developed countries. That has depressed consumer spending, as have increased saving and growing income inequality, which has pushed more money into the hands of the rich, who are less likely to spend it.

Lacking confidence and seeing weak demand, many businesses have held back on investing, and in the challenged energy sector, cuts are rampant. Meanwhile, the rise of capital-efficient businesses  from Amazon to Uber  means less spending on machinery and buildings.

Well-intentioned efforts to avoid another financial crisis have put the banking system in a straitjacket, discouraging lending and reducing liquidity on trading desks, which has contributed mightily to market gyrations.

All that said, governments havent done enough to help the situation  and have done a lot to exacerbate it. Closest to home, of course, is gridlock in Washington. Anti-deficit fervor has led to a meat-ax approach to spending cuts, under which nondefense discretionary outlays (which include key pro-growth areas like research and development and infrastructure) have fallen in real terms by nearly 20 percent over the past five years, at a time when they should be growing substantially.

Meanwhile, Congress has not passed a comprehensive tax reform package in three decades, which has given clever experts room to develop loophole after loophole, particularly for multinational companies eager to cut their tax bills by sequestering profits overseas.

And while reforming our regulatory apparatus would be a welcome economic positive, that should be urgent business for Europe. Sclerotic labor laws in countries like France result in unyielding double-digit unemployment. In many European countries, regulatory red tape impedes new business start-ups. Germanys aggressive tilt toward renewable energy has raised costs enormously for its industrial sector.

Meanwhile, key private sector actors are particularly fearful that central banks, which have kept growth alive by keeping interest rates near zero, have run out of ammunition, making the need for more robust fiscal policy even more urgent.

Then theres China. Unlike their counterparts in developed countries, Chinese leaders arent afraid to act; their problem is that they often dont seem to know what to do, particularly when it comes to managing financial markets.

When Chinese stocks sagged, the authorities exhorted the citizenry to buy them up. As shares soared, they curtailed the ability to purchase shares on margin, causing prices to plummet. Similarly, beginning last August, China made a muddle of its effort to unpeg its currency from the strong dollar, leading to huge capital flight from the country ($159 billion in December alone).

Most scary to China watchers is the countrys fast rising debt. All these worries are exacerbated by the countrys opacity; for example, almost no expert believes that China is growing at the nearly 7 percent rate that it claims.

The past two recessions were caused largely by private actors: the risky lending of the mid-2000s and the dot-com bubble at the turn of the century.

This time, if we fail to break out of the current stagnation  or worse, fall into global recession  the fault will lie with our leaders.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Obama Criticizes the Free Riders Among Americas Allies,['Mark Landler'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

WASHINGTON  President Obama believes that Saudi Arabia, one of Americas most important allies in the Middle East, needs to learn how to share the region with its archenemy, Iran, and that both countries are guilty of fueling proxy wars in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.









In a series of interviews with The Atlantic magazine published Thursday, Mr. Obama said a number of American allies in the Persian Gulf  as well as in Europe  were free riders, eager to drag the United States into grinding sectarian conflicts that sometimes had little to do with American interests. He showed little sympathy for the Saudis, who have been threatened by the nuclear deal Mr. Obama reached with Iran.

The Saudis, Mr. Obama told Jeffrey Goldberg, the magazines national correspondent, need to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace. Reflexively backing them against Iran, the president said, would mean that we have to start coming in and using our military power to settle scores. And that would be in the interest neither of the United States nor of the Middle East.

Mr. Obamas frustration with much of the Arab world is not new, but rarely has he been so blunt about it. He placed his comments in the context of his broader struggle to extract the United States from the bloody morass of the Middle East so that the nation can focus on more promising, faster-growing parts of the world, like Asia and Latin America.

If were not talking to them, he said, referring to young people in those places, because the only thing were doing is figuring out how to destroy or cordon off or control the malicious, nihilistic, violent parts of humanity, then were missing the boat.

Mr. Obama also said his support of the NATO military intervention in Libya had been a mistake, driven in part by his erroneous belief that Britain and France would bear more of the burden of the operation. He stoutly defended his refusal not to enforce his own red line against Syrias president, Bashar al-Assad, even though Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. argued internally, the magazine reported, that big nations dont bluff.

The president disputed criticism that he should have done more to resist the aggression of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Ukraine. As a neighbor of Russia, Mr. Obama said, Ukraine was always going to matter more to Mr. Putin than to the United States. This meant that in any military confrontation between Moscow and the West, Russia was going to maintain escalatory dominance over its former satellite state.

The fact is that Ukraine, which is a non-NATO country, is going to be vulnerable to military domination by Russia no matter what we do, he said. This is an example of where we have to be very clear about what our core interests are and what we are willing to go to war for.

Mr. Obama, who has spoken regularly to Mr. Goldberg about Israel and Iran, granted him extraordinary access. The portrait that emerges from the interviews is of a president openly contemptuous of Washingtons foreign-policy establishment, which he said was obsessed with preserving presidential credibility, even at the cost of blundering into ill-advised military adventures.

Theres a playbook in Washington that presidents are supposed to follow, Mr. Obama said. And the playbook prescribes responses to different events, and these responses tend to be militarized responses. This consensus, the president continued, can lead to bad decisions. In the midst of an international challenge like Syria, he said, you are judged harshly if you dont follow the playbook, even if there are good reasons.

Although Mr. Obamas tone was introspective, he engaged in little second-guessing. He dismissed the argument that his failure to enforce the red line in Syria, or his broader reticence about using military force, had emboldened Russia. Mr. Putin, he noted, invaded Georgia in 2008 during the presidency of George W. Bush, even though the United States had more than 100,000 troops deployed in Iraq.

Similarly, the president pushed back on the suggestion that he had not been firm enough in challenging Chinas aggression in the South China Sea, where it is building military installations on reefs and islands, some of which are claimed by the Philippines and other neighbors. Ive been very explicit in saying that we have more to fear from a weakened, threatened China than a successful, rising China, Mr. Obama said.

The president refused to box himself in as a foreign-policy thinker. I suppose you could call me a realist in believing we cant, at any given moment, relieve all the worlds misery, he said. But he went on to describe himself as an internationalist and an idealist. Above all, Mr. Obama appeared weary of the constant demands and expectations placed on the United States. Free riders aggravate me, he said.

He put France and Britain in that category, at least as far as the Libya operation was concerned. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, he said, became distracted by other issues, while President Nicolas Sarkozy of France wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defenses.

Only on the threat posed by the Islamic State did Mr. Obama express some misgivings. He likened ISIS to the Joker in The Dark Knight, the 2008 Batman movie. The Middle East, Mr. Obama said, was like Gotham, a corrupt metropolis controlled by a cartel of thugs. Then the Joker comes in and lights the whole city on fire, Mr. Obama said. ISIL is the Joker, he added, using the governments preferred acronym for the Islamic State.

Still, Mr. Obama acknowledged that immediately after the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., he did not adequately reassure Americans that he understood the threat, and was confronting it.

Every president has his strengths and weaknesses, he said. And there is no doubt that there are times where I have not been attentive enough to feelings and emotions and politics in communicating what were doing and how were doing it.",[]

Irving Villegas, a freelance photographer from Mexico City, had spotted them toiling in the fields of Weiterstadt, Germany  about 20 miles south of Frankfurt  in the summer of 2007, when he happened to be living nearby. He approached them, curious.

All hailed from other countries; Poland and Romania, mostly. In classic migrant-worker tradition, after the picking season they would go home or move on to the next country. Also traditional: the lousy pay, 27 to 57 cents per kilogram of asparagus. As Mr. Villegas chatted with the workers, taking photos with no particular end in mind, one scene, one image, marked him.

The photo captures a group of workers in an asparagus field, bare-chested in the blistering heat, with one in the foreground stripped down to his briefs. It demonstrates the grit and determination of these laborers, who put in 10-hour days, seven days a week, no matter what, all season long. The photo also touches the viewer and raises questions.

Since that photo, Mr. Villegas said, a concern for those people started, a wanting to know more about them.

Photo

Six years later, Mr. Villegas used that image to begin Working Far Away, which documents the public and private lives of seasonal workers in several countries and continents. He has followed asparagus workers in several towns in Germany and found their families in towns and cities in Romania. He has also documented Polish sheep shearers and olive workers from Morocco, Senegal and other countries working in several towns in Spain. Next on his list: France and Finland.

It took six years to start the project, said Mr. Villegas, who lives where he studied photography, in Hannover, to establish himself. I needed to start a life in Germany, he said. So I set aside that topic but always with that photo in my mind, knowing one day I would pick up the subject.

Photographers have been documenting the plight of seasonal workers for decades. Yet any attention the workers receive tends to be quickly forgotten. Immigrant workers, especially, who leave their countries for backbreaking work that few in the host countries is willing to do, remain in societys peripheral vision. At best, theyre ignored. At worst, theyre vilified as criminals. Working Far Away aims to dispel the stereotypes.

I think that mainly I aim to shatter that idea of We dont need immigrants in our country, they steal our job opportunities,  Mr. Villegas said. For instance, in Germany, there are few locals that apply for the asparagus season. For them it represents a big physical effort that is not worth the payment. Thats why there are only immigrants in the fields.

Photo

The seasonal workers in Spain are having a harder time. The countrys recession has led desperate local residents to take farm jobs they once shunned. A striking image of a Senegalese worker, drenched in sweat, as he hauls nets used for olives in Jaen reminds us that luck is relative. This worker, the father of three girls, has managed to secure a contract during the harvest for eight years.

The unluckiest brave the long and dangerous journey to Spain only to find the work no longer exists. One man sits at a train terminal, saddled with bags and luggage and weariness as he waits for uncertainty in the next town.

Working Far Away, Mr. Villegas expects, will take years to complete.

Seasonal workers are everywhere, he said, and my original purpose was to document as many countries as I could in different continents. But one thing at a time. This is a very difficult project to carry out, financially speaking.

He plans spend to finish the European part of the project by the end of this year. Then, ideally, he said, I would like to continue in America.

Most European stock markets rose after the European Central Bank unveiled a bigger-than-anticipated stimulus for the 19-country eurozone economy.

KEEPING SCORE The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.51 percent, and the Standard & Poors 500-stock index was up 0.54 percent. The Nasdaq composite index gained 0.7 percent.

EARLY MOVERS Shares of the discount store operator Dollar General rose more than 7 percent after the company reported earnings that were higher than analysts were expecting. Shares of the mobile payments company Square and the cloud storage company Box both rose after they reported results that beat estimates.

EUROPEAN MARKETS In Germany, the DAX rose 1 percent, and in France, the CAC 40 gained 1.4 percent. The FTSE 100 was down slightly in Britain.

BOLD E.C.B. The central bank that governs the euro currency surprised financial markets with a bolder-than-anticipated stimulus package. Notably, it cut the main refinancing rate to zero from 0.05 percent. It also reduced the interest rate on deposits held by banks at the central bank to minus 0.4 percent from minus 0.3 percent. And it expanded its monthly bond-buying program to 80 billion euros ($85 billion) a month from the previous 60 billion.

ANALYSTS TAKE The central bank came out all guns blazing, said Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at OANDA. The decision to ease monetary policy across a broad range of tools sent a strong message to the markets that it is not willing to sit by while they repeatedly fall well short of their 2 percent inflation target.

EURO DOWN One of the biggest impacts from the central banks package of measures was on the euro, which slid 1.2 percent to $1.0857. The lower returns on euro holdings and the prospect of more euros in circulation weighed hard on Europes single currency.

NEW ZEALAND CUT New Zealands central bank also lowered its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 2.25 percent Thursday, saying the rate could go lower yet as the country grapples with weak international growth and lower prices for its crucial dairy exports. That pushed New Zealands S&P/NZX 50 INDEX up 0.8 percent to 6,505.28. But some Asian markets fell back after an early burst of buying following the news.

WILKINSBURG, Pa.  Police searched Thursday for at least two gunmen who opened fire during a backyard party in suburban Pittsburgh, killing five people and wounding three others.

Four women and one man were killed late Wednesday during the party in Wilkinsburg. Allegheny County police said people scrambled toward the house as bullets began flying. Four of the victims were found dead on the back porch. The fifth died at a hospital.

Two men were in critical condition, and one woman was in stable condition, police said.

Lt. Andrew Schurman of the Allegheny County homicide unit said the gunmen barged into the party just before 11 p.m. and opened fire in an ambush-style attack. He said gunshots came from two distinct locations, but police don't believe anyone at the party fired back.

""It looks like right now they were all fleeing toward the backdoor of the residence when the second gunman fired from the side of the yard,"" he said. ""They all seemed to get caught on the back porch.""

The suspects fled on foot.

Wilkinsburg is a poorer, largely blighted suburb just east of Pittsburgh that is known for drug trafficking and gun violence. But neighbors described the street on which the shooting occurred as generally quiet and expressed shock.

Resident Kayla Alexander told WPXI-TV that she heard a barrage of gunshots  more than 20.

After the shooting, groups of residents gathered on the street, some of them sobbing and saying they lost family members.

James Boyd, 70, has lived for 24 years in a home three doors from the shooting. He told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that the gunfire ""went on for almost a minute.""

""I thought it was maybe the pipes bursting. But then we realized it was gunshots. We've had trouble in this neighborhood before but never this close to home,"" Boyd said. ""I've never seen anything like this before.""",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-11 00:00:00,Monmouth and Other Midmajor Champions Find Themselves on the N.C.A.A. Bubble,['Tim Casey'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Monmouths mens basketball team won at U.C.L.A. and Georgetown this season, and it beat Notre Dame and Southern California on a neutral court in Florida. But now its dream of ending its memorable season in the N.C.A.A. tournament, a prospect close enough to touch just a few days ago, is in jeopardy because of a loss much closer to home.









When the Hawks (27-7) lost to Iona on Monday night in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference championship game, they failed to secure the leagues automatic berth in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Instead of packing their bags and waiting to learn their destination when the field is announced on Sunday, the Hawks must wait to find out if they will play in the tournament at all.

It is a common predicament. Of the 12 postseason tournaments completed so far, only one top seed (Chattanooga in the Southern Conference) has claimed its conferences automatic N.C.A.A. bid. The upsets come after a regular season in which six teams were ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press poll, and days before the final conference tournaments could make a crowded N.C.A.A. tournament bubble even tougher to break through.

Why should we have expected anything else? said Jerry Palm, a former computer programmer who projects the N.C.A.A. tournament field for CBS. Its been a crazy year at the top of the rankings. Why should it not be a crazy year with the nonmajors, as well?

Monmouth, Wichita State (24-8), St. Marys (27-5) and Valparaiso (26-6) are the midmajor conference regular-season champions that have the best cases of making the field despite losing in their postseason tournaments. But as of Wednesday afternoon, Palm did not have any of those four teams in his brackets.

Another so-called bracketologist, ESPNs Joe Lunardi, said he had Wichita State as a No. 8 seed and Monmouth and St. Marys as No. 10s. But his analysis left Valparaiso out of the field.

I think theyre all sweating it out, Lunardi said. The committees history is not real positive with teams like this. Generally speaking, we see more bubble teams from the major conferences getting the last few spots.

Joe Castiglione, Oklahomas athletic director and the chairman of the Division I mens basketball committee that will choose the field for the N.C.A.A. tournament, said on a conference call this week that the committee puts regular-season champions on its under consideration board.

Castiglione noted that Monmouth won 13 of its 17 road games and 4 of 6 neutral-court games. Still, the Hawks also lost to Army (216th among 351 Division I teams in the Rating Percentage Index, another important criteria), Canisius (222nd) and Manhattan (227th).

Their resume is filled with road and neutral-court wins, which are important factors, Castiglione said. Those wins are over teams that will or perhaps will be part of the field. Plus, I think if you watch them, you can tell theyre a quality team. We certainly have watched them throughout the season. I cant imagine a scenario where they wont be discussed throughout the week.

The case of Wichita State, which has made four consecutive N.C.A.A. tournament appearances, is another that the committee probably will spend time debating. The Shockers won the Missouri Valley Conference regular-season title before losing to Northern Iowa in overtime in the semifinals of the league tournament. Wichita State is 11th in the KenPom.com advanced analysis ratings and 48th in the R.P.I. But it has only one victory over a team ranked in the top 50 of the R.P.I. and only four against teams in the top 100.

The Shockers resume also includes three losses in November when the senior guard Fred VanVleet, a two-time conference player of the year, was out with a hamstring injury. Notable absences like that, and others like the early-season suspension of Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim, whose Orange went 4-5 without him in a 19-13 season, could play a role in the committees decisions, Castiglione said.

Generally speaking, player and coach availability is definitely a consideration for us when were evaluating a teams performance throughout the season, Castiglione said.

He added that the games all count, but also said that it was important to note injuries and suspensions.

The selection committee began meeting in New York on Wednesday and will spend the weekend watching games, discussing teams and analyzing data. The N.C.A.A. has become more transparent by making public the R.P.I. ratings, strength of schedules and the team sheets that the committee uses to assess its selection and seeding decisions.

Theres no shortage of information, which is why ultimately its pretty hard to quibble at the end of the line, Lunardi said. Its not like 10 guys going into a room, lighting up cigars and making backroom deals like maybe it was 20 or 30 years ago. Theres too much scrutiny of the process, too much open-source data thats available.",[]

WASHINGTON  Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, met with President Obama on Thursday for the first state visit by a Canadian leader in 19 years, a diplomatic honor made possible in part by new pledges of cooperation on combating climate change.









Mr. Obama and Mr. Trudeau announced Thursday morning new commitments to reduce planet-warming emissions of methane, a chemical contained in natural gas that is about 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide and that can leak from drilling wells and pipelines.

In a joint statement, the leaders promised that their two countries will play a leadership role internationally in the low carbon global economy over the coming decades. As part of the announcement, United States officials said they would immediately begin a new push to regulate methane emissions from existing oil and gas facilities, though finishing that process before the end of Mr. Obamas tenure is unlikely.

Methane is upwards of 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide in warming the planet, said Gina McCarthy, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. It has become clear that it is time for the E.P.A. to take additional action to regulate existing sources in the oil and gas sector.

Mr. Obama and Mr. Trudeau also pledged new cooperation in preserving the Arctic and focusing on biodiversity, science-based decision-making, indigenous people and building a sustainable Arctic economy. The two nations also promised to accelerate the carrying out of agreements made in climate talks in Paris last year.

Both nations know we must care for the one planet we share, said Sally Jewell, the secretary of the interior in the United States. I appreciate Canadas strong leadership.

The climate announcements came before a day of ceremony that will conclude with a state dinner in the East Room of the White House. On the menu is Alaskan halibut casseroles, roasted apricot galette, baby lamb chops with Yukon Gold potato dauphinoise and a maple pecan cake with cocoa nib wafer and butterscotch swirl ice cream.

The arrival of Mr. Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau, has prompted comparisons to a similar visit in 1977 by Pierre Trudeau, a former prime minister and the current leaders father. That visit made headlines when Margaret Trudeau, the prime ministers wife, wore an above-the-knee dress to the White House state dinner.

While Canada and the United States have long been close allies, Mr. Obamas efforts to confront global warming had become a major point of contention with Mr. Trudeaus predecessor, Stephen Harper, who sought to aggressively expand Canadas oil industry.

As Mr. Obama became more determined to leave behind a lasting environmental legacy, he delayed and eventually rejected construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have transported nearly a million barrels a day of heavily polluting oil from Alberta to refineries on the Gulf Coast.

Mr. Obamas rejection of the pipeline severely strained relations with Mr. Harper.

But Mr. Trudeaus election last year marked a shift in policy that was welcomed by the White House. Mr. Trudeau did not criticize Mr. Obamas rejection of the pipeline, and Mr. Trudeau has pledged to pursue an ambitious environmental agenda to coincide with Mr. Obamas policies.

In December, Canadian officials helped to push through a historic global climate agreement in Paris.

The climate relationship with Canada really just ramped up dramatically quickly, Todd Stern, Mr. Obamas special envoy for climate change, told reporters before Mr. Trudeaus arrival.

The two leaders will meet privately on Thursday to discuss military cooperation, efforts to combat terrorism, improvements in trade and environmental concerns.

Among the issues the two leaders will seek to resolve is a decades-old dispute over softwood lumber. American officials say lumber from Canada is unfairly subsidized by the government there, an assertion that Canadian officials reject.

Thats a longstanding and complicated issue, but we do welcome the Trudeaus government interest in discussing a new arrangement for softwood lumber, and were open to exploring all options with Canada to address this important trade issue, said Mark Feierstein, the senior director for the Western Hemisphere at the National Security Council.

But the most anticipated topic is the environment.

Prime Minister Trudeau is already showing serious, concrete commitment to accelerating progress on climate, Mr. Stern said. The commitment of both leaders to addressing this global challenge is clear. And I suspect under their leadership, North America will make significant progress this year and next.

The Obama administration wants to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 percent to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025.

The Democrats saved their most raucous debate for what could be their last. For two hours, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont traded sharp attacks in Florida, a crucial battleground state that votes next week, over immigration policy, the government bailout of the automobile industry and, inevitably, the Republican front-runner, Donald J. Trump.









The immigration divide is deep

Immigration policy has been among the biggest substantive differences between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton, and the two attacked each other on the issue while also struggling to explain their past positions. Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Sanders for opposing the 2007 immigration overhaul, and she pointed to his inconsistent explanations for doing so.

After being prodded by a moderator, Mrs. Clinton appeared to promise to end the White House policy of deporting undocumented immigrant children, a change from her position in 2014, when she said those children should be sent back to their countries and reunited with their families. Mr. Sanders also brought up how Mrs. Clinton waffled on drivers licenses for illegal immigrants at a debate in 2007.

But what was most striking was the Democrats contrast on the issue with the leading Republican candidates, including Mr. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who have endorsed mass deportations, which will most likely be a focal point of the general election campaign.

The Midwest matters

Though the debate took place in Miami, both candidates devoted much of their time to the Midwest and the working-class voters who make up large sections of two of the states that will vote on Tuesday: Illinois and Ohio. Free trade is not popular with many voters in that industrial region, and Mr. Sanderss populist message is resonating there, demonstrated most forcefully by his upset win over Mrs. Clinton in Michigan on Tuesday. If his claim that the immigration legislation would drive wages down hurts him with Hispanic voters in Florida, it could help him with workers in the Midwest.

Mrs. Clinton repeatedly attacked Mr. Sanders  as she did in Sundays debate in Flint, Mich.  by claiming he had voted against the auto bailout that was seen as saving the industry after the financial crisis of 2008. That attack has been described as partly true at best: Mrs. Clinton picked out a specific vote that Mr. Sanders cast because much of the money in question would go to help Wall Street. But the issue has resonance in places like Michigan and Ohio, and Mrs. Clinton, unbowed, indicated she would continue to use it against him going forward.

The Democratic race is getting testy

Both candidates came prepared for a slash-and-burn debate, fully briefed on their rivals records with attack lines at the ready. Mrs. Clinton came at Mr. Sanders with kitchen-sink-style charges from the left but only occasionally mentioned one of her core criticisms: that he makes pie-in-the-sky promises without any way to get them done.

Mr. Sanders, looking to capitalize on his win in Michigan, was ready to fight, denouncing her criticisms of his votes related to the auto bailout, insisting she was misrepresenting his record. He attacked her repeatedly over her speeches to Wall Street firms for large sums of money, even suggesting that she might be hiding something by not releasing the transcripts. Mr. Sanders is effective at wielding the political blade, which he reinforced by tartly saying, Madame Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week.

Clinton is still trying to connect

For most of her life in the public eye, Mrs. Clinton has been criticized as too stiff or too closed off, too dull or too reserved, too inauthentic or too canned as a politician. She began road-testing a line a few weeks ago about her deficiencies as a politician. When she delivered it in the debate, saying that people know she is not a natural at this like her husband or like President Obama, it came across as authentic and rang true.

It was also something of a breakthrough for a candidate who has, over time, been loath to admit to making a mistake, and who does not like letting down her guard. With voters still, after decades, trying to get to know her, it could be a turning point.

Things could get uncomfortable

The toughest lines of the night were not all from the candidates: Many came from the moderators. One after the other came questions, most of them aimed at Mrs. Clinton, that cut to the bone. A few were downright uncomfortable.

Mrs. Clinton was asked about how she responds to continuing questions from voters about her trustworthiness. She was asked about the 2012 attacks on the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, which left four Americans dead while she was the secretary of state, prompting boos from the crowd. She was asked about the investigation into her use of a private email server as secretary of state, and whether she would drop out if she was indicted.

That last question left her exasperated, and she said she would not dignify it with an answer. But the questions were a glimpse at the lines of attack she will face in the fall if she is the Democratic nominee.

Clinton does not want to attack Trump

This is not to say that Mrs. Clinton does not want to criticize Mr. Trump on policy: She is all for that. She made mocking reference to the big, beautiful wall that Mr. Trump has pledged to build along the United States border with Mexico and called his comments about Muslims and other groups un-American.

But Mr. Trump savaged Mrs. Clinton and her husband late last year when she used the Republican front-runner as a foil in her stump speeches. Both Clintons dropped their references to Mr. Trump shortly after that. When pressed at the debate about Mr. Trumps character and whether he is a racist, Mrs. Clinton replied: Im not going to engage in the kind of language that he uses. I think we can make the case against him if he is the nominee, by pointing out what he has said.

What to make of Mrs. Clintons failure to swing at a pitch right over the plate? She seemed to be signaling to Mr. Trump that she was not going to denounce him in personal terms  and to be hoping that he would respond in kind.",[]

Lets give a hand to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. After all weve been through with the Republicans, its nice to hear presidential candidates go at each others throat while theyre talking about where they stood on immigration issues in 2007.









This was Wednesdays Democratic debate  the second one in a week, not counting the back-to-back town halls in between. People, do you remember when we used to complain that there werent going to be enough debates? Ah yes, long ago. Dinosaurs roamed the earth and Marco Rubio was a hot ticket.

Clinton held up well, given that her first three questions involved why she lost the Michigan primary, her emails and whether shed drop out if she was indicted. (Oh, for goodness  that is not going to happen. Im not even answering that question.) It was a tough evening. Sanders accused Clinton of cruelty to Honduran children. She claimed he had sided with the Minutemen.

Since the debate was on Univision, there was a strong emphasis on immigration, which provided a kind of mirror image of the Republican debates. Clinton and Sanders bickered long and hard about who had been less in favor of deportation, going back more than a decade. (Madam Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week!)

In truth, immigration is not an issue that actually separates these two people. The real gulf is between the grand vision and the practical plan. Sanders thinks he can provide free public college tuition and Medicare-like health coverage for all. My dad used to say, If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is, Clinton rejoined.

And then theres the auto industry bailout. One of the biggest moments in the Democrats Week of Endless Debates came Sunday when Clinton caught Sanders off guard by accusing him  in Michigan!  of refusing to support Detroit during the economic crisis.

He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry, Clinton claimed while Sanders looked stunned.

What followed was the most quoted moment of the encounter:

Sanders: If you are talking about the Wall Street bailout, where some of your friends destroyed this economy 

Clinton: You know 

Sanders: Excuse me, Im talking.

Audience: Oooooh

Its certainly a tribute to the general decorum with which the Democrats have conducted themselves that this was enough to draw a gasp from the crowd. The bar is so high on the Republican side that to get a real response one of the candidates would have had to hit the other with a hammer.

But lets look at the bailout issue for a minute. Sanders did vote for a bill to lend money to the auto industry. But it got blocked in the Senate. Then during the stupendously complex end-of-the-Bush-administration negotiations, the bailout got mooshed into a huge, messy bill that did indeed involve helping Wall Street. When the only choices were nothing or a big, unappetizing legislative stew, he refused to bite.

That pretty much sums up his career in Congress. Sanders stood up for his principles, but he didnt play any real role. At one point he offered an amendment to raise taxes on high-income individuals, which was basically ignored. He was marvelous, but symbolically marvelous.

He was in no way like Ted Cruz, who just tries to get attention by stopping things. Nobody hates Bernie Sanders. But hes a maverick legislator, a man without a party. Thats a way, way different kind of life than being the person who has to run the country.

You have to make hard choices when youre in positions of responsibility, Clinton said.

Clinton is a stupendous debater, and shes developed smooth and sensible-sounding answers to sticky matters like the State Department emails and Benghazi. But she still hasnt been able to handle Sanderss attacks on her $225,000 speeches to finance industry insiders. She shrugs and says shell release the transcripts when everybody else does, which generally involves mentioning that President Obama took a lot of money from Wall Street.

I dont have any comment, she said when she was questioned earlier in the week about campaign donations. I dont know that. I dont believe that there is any reason to be concerned about it.

This is the stuff that makes Democrats want to send a message. Hillary Clinton is by far the best qualified candidate for president. But at this point in the campaign, you can understand why some people feel that voting for her against Bernie Sanders is like rewarding Washington for its worst behavior.

In the end, Clinton is the one who knows how to make the system work. But shes just got to be clearer on how she can work against the system.",[]

WHEN Apple released the iPad Pro last November, Timothy D. Cook, the companys chief executive, predicted that people would start using the jumbo tablet and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones.









So three months after the big tablets debut, we decided to test that hypothesis with a panel of creative professionals who have integrated the tablet into their work lives. We found that all were still clinging to their personal computers.

Were on PCs for the day-to-day work, said Larry Anderson, chief engineer of Teecom, an architectural engineering firm that bought iPad Pros last year to present drawings to clients and carry digitized blueprints to construction sites. But when I go to a meeting, I dont grab my laptop  I grab my iPad.

The iPad Pro, which starts at $799, stands out from other tablets because of its especially large screen, which measures 12.9 diagonal inches. It also supports the Apple Pencil, a digital stylus with pressure sensitivity and angle detection.

The iPad Pro is an important prong of Apples iPad lineup, a product category where sales have declined for eight consecutive quarters. Apple executives have told investors they are bullish about iPad sales returning to growth, and the company continues to market the device as the future of personal computing.

Apple also plans to introduce another new iPad model alongside a smaller iPhone in an event this month, according to a person briefed on the devices, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans were confidential. The news site 9to5Mac earlier reported details of the products. Apple declined to comment on the event.

To assess whether there may be a jump in iPad sales anytime soon, we waited a few months after the iPad Pros release to gather feedback from some professionals who use it. Our panel of reviewers was Mr. Anderson of Teecom; Stephen Gates, a design director for the global bank Citigroup; and Jennifer Daniel, a graphic designer for The New York Times. They unanimously agreed that while the iPad Pros big screen and stylus were helpful for crucial tasks, like mocking up illustrations or giving presentations, they still had to turn to a computer for more powerful apps.

Michael Tchao, a vice president for product marketing at Apple, said in an interview that such early reactions to the iPad Pro were not unexpected.

It doesnt surprise us that in these early days of iPad Pro, people are gravitating to things they cant do with a laptop, like sketching with Apple Pencil, he said. What weve seen since the beginning is that as people spend more time with iPad, more and more of their workflows live there.

Stephen Gates of Citigroup At Citigroups Citibank, about 30 of 80 designers are using iPad Pros and the company plans to order more, said Mr. Gates, the head of design for Citis Global Consumer Bank in New York. He said he bought an iPad Pro on the day it was released because he had been waiting for a device that supported a capable stylus like the Apple Pencil.

Mr. Gates said Citi designers had used the iPad Pro to work on a new design for a Citi mobile app. Designers used the big iPads to sketch out and present mock-ups of the app and discuss where they wanted images or buttons, for example.

The iPad Pros big screen and stylus also came in handy in meetings for communicating with clients. A designer can easily use the Apple Pencil to illustrate ideas on the screen for the client and vice versa, he said.

Mr. Gates says the Apple Pencil also lets him digitize his whole creative process, from sketching to production  though a big part of his workflow still involves a computer. Before he bought an iPad Pro, he had tried 20 styluses for sketching illustrations or jotting down ideas, he added.

Nonetheless, the iPad Pro primarily helps Citi designers conceive ideas, not create final products, he said. When it comes to production, Mr. Gates said, he moves his initial ideas to a computer to use desktop apps like Adobe Photoshop to refine and polish the designs.

He said he thought the iPad Pro could eventually replace his computer, but not yet because of the limitations of the current apps. Many creative apps designed for the iPad Pro focus on the start of the design process, like sketches and rough compositions, while desktop apps have the ability to do more complex image manipulations, animations and other functions.

A lot of the app makers need to look at this as a pro platform and be able to deliver more desktop-class apps, Mr. Gates said.

Jennifer Daniel of The New York Times Jennifer Daniel, a graphics editor for The Times, recently tried to do her job on an iPad Pro but was unsuccessful. Her work generally involves talking to reporters about how to tell their stories visually, researching topics on the Internet, interviewing experts, sketching out concepts with Adobe Illustrator, and writing and publishing code from her computer, often all at once.

Such multitasking is difficult on an iPad Pro. While Adobe offers a suite of mobile apps for Photoshop and Illustrator that Ms. Daniel can use on a tablet, the apps do not replicate a full-size computers ability to multitask easily on projects, and they arent compatible with colleagues desktop apps, she said.

And while Ms. Daniel found the iPad Pros screen to be big and beautiful and said the Apple Pencil felt like an upgrade compared with drawing on her laptops trackpad, the tablet can run only two apps at the same time side by side. Ms. Daniel said she preferred having many apps open in multiple windows to juggle more tasks simultaneously.

It forces me to focus on one thing at a time, which is just not how my brain works, she said.

It doesnt help that few others at The Times are using the iPad Pro to produce articles, Ms. Daniel added, because she needs to use tools that are directly compatible with other staff members computer apps. She cant make a full leap to the iPad without the rest of the organization adopting it.

As an illustrator, can the iPad Pro replace a part of my process? she said. Maybe for the initial research and writing phase, but it stops when I have to conform to other peoples workflows. Adobe software is a prison, and my work, its prisoners.

She said the iPad Pro still felt like an object to consume things with, not to make things on.

Which is fine, I like looking at art as much as I like making it, she said. Maybe Ill put it on the wall and make some cool screen savers for it  on my MacBook.

Larry Anderson of Teecom Engineers at Mr. Andersons company, Teecom, an engineering firm based in Oakland, Calif., that designs technology systems like data centers for corporations and hospitals, rely heavily on a mix of computers and iPads.

The engineers use extremely powerful Windows laptops to use 3-D modeling software like Autodesk Revit to design the technology systems for buildings, Mr. Anderson said. Then Teecom moves those drawings to PlanGrid, an iPad app that displays and edits blueprints. From there, the engineers use the iPad to show the construction projects to clients or to take notes on blueprints while at construction sites.

Engineers at the firm use iPad Minis and began buying iPad Pros last year for the larger screen and stylus. Mr. Anderson said he enjoyed the ability to see more drawings on the screen and mark up blueprints with the Apple Pencil while on job sites. One complaint: He constantly worries he will lose the Apple Pencil, because there is no compartment to hold it in the iPad.

Fewer than a quarter of Teecoms engineers have iPad Pros, but a year from now the company will probably order more, Mr. Anderson said. Still, he doesnt see the firm phasing out computers.

For what we do, its not there yet, he said about the iPad Pro. Engineers still need that high-powered laptop for the mouse and the ability to have a big screen connected to it.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-11 00:00:00,Benfica Heats Up Late in Cold of St. Petersburg,['Rob Hughes'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

LONDON  If there were an award for fan base of the year, the followers of Benfica would have to be candidates.









Before Wednesday, Benfica had not won on Russian soil for 20 years, and it traveled to St. Petersburg, Russia, without its first-string goalkeeper and with three members of its back line out because of either injuries or suspension.

That did not discourage 445 hardy Benfica fans from making the 4,500-mile round trip  made longer because there are no direct flights  to cheer on their team in the Champions League in the freezing cold.

The players kept them waiting. For 70 minutes, the action in the Petrovsky Stadium was as frigid as the weather, before things got red-hot at the finish, when two late goals by Benfica allowed it to take the lead and win the game.

It was the second time in the series that Benfica had broken through Zenits overly cautious tactical game. The first leg in Lisbon had been goalless until a header in injury time from Jonas, from Brazil, gave Benfica a 1-0 lead to defend in Russia.

The second game was goalless until the 69th minute, when Hulk, another Brazilian player, scored for St. Petersburg, tying the series on aggregate, 1-1.

Extra time, and possibly the dreaded penalty shootout, loomed until Nicolas Gaitan stole a late goal for Benfica. Six minutes into injury time, yet another Brazilian, Talisca, wrapped up Benficas win, sending the Portuguese club to the quarterfinals.

The final score in St. Petersburg was 2-1. The aggregate score of 3-1 made it look as if Benfica had this series comfortably under control. Nothing could be further from the truth.

We showed in the field how much we wanted to get past Zenit, said Andreas Samaris of Benfica. All of us players were ready to serve the team in any position the coach asked.

Samaris, normally a midfielder, could be called a success as an emergency center-back on Wednesday. He stood up to 96 minutes of battery from Zenit striker Artem Dzyuba, who was assisted by Hulk.

Hulk  also known by his given name, Givanildo Vieira de Souza  is well known to the Portuguese club because he played in their league for Benficas great rival, Porto, before heading to Russia.

But it was Dzyuba  big, powerful, awkward and physical  who tested the strange lineup in defense and the second-string Benfica goalkeeper, Ederson. Tested is perhaps a misleading term because Zenit did not press the weakened Benfica defense nearly enough, perhaps because the Russian club is just emerging from its two-month winter break.

No, I had not played in defense before now, Samaris responded on television when asked if he had ever played central defense before. I practiced, of course, but it was something like a test for me tonight.

Zenit had never lost at home before to a Portuguese opponent, so while we might have expected it to attack the makeshift rear-guard of Benfica, the opposite happened.

Zenits coach, Andre Villa-Boas, is Portuguese and right out of the mode of Jose Mourinho. Villa-Boass preferred method of play is to counterattack, and his catchword is caution. When Villas-Boas spoke on the field before kickoff, he seemed obsessed with a fear of allowing Benfica to score.

Against an opponent wounded at the back and reliant upon a gifted 18-year-old, Renato Sanches, in midfield, this was surely the wrong approach. Villa-Boas will leave St Petersburg after this season and most likely return to Portugal, possibly back to his former club, Porto.

After Wednesdays game, Zenits owners may be pleased to see him leave.

While it is true that no Russian team has overcome the rust from the winter layoff to reach the Champions League quarterfinals in any of the past six seasons, negativity got what it deserved on Wednesday.

When Hulk broke his recent barren streak and headed in an immaculate cross from Yuri Zhirkov, it did seem that the home team was coming out of a deep sleep.

Benfica determined otherwise. It tied the score after 85 minutes when Raul Jimenez, a substitute with energy to spare, suddenly turned and tried a long shot. Zenits goalkeeper, Yuri Lodygin, misjudged it and turned the ball against his own crossbar, and Gaitan pounced on the bounce to knock in the goal. And then, just as it did three weeks before in the first leg, Benfica summoned the greater will to strike with the last kick of the match. Another winner by another Brazilian substitute, this time the tall and slender Talisca.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Stalling on Fuel Efficiency,"['James Gerstenzang', 'Daniel F', 'Becker James Gerstenzang']","Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

THE Obama administrations stringent fuel efficiency standards are intended to reduce auto pollution and drive up gas mileage. They are the biggest single step any nation has taken to fight global warming. The rules worked well, at first. They no longer do. They can be fixed.









The repairs are all the more important since the Supreme Court last month put a hold on the administrations plan to limit pollution from coal-fired power plants.

The fuel-economy standards are designed to deliver a new-car fleet averaging 54.5 m.p.g. in 2025. But this goal is in jeopardy as automakers increase the production of gas-guzzling light trucks, minivans and most S.U.V.s, which are subject to less stringent standards than other cars. These vehicles are driving up oil consumption and pollution and putting at risk American compliance with the Paris climate accord.

Two recent government reports provide ample evidence that to cut carbon dioxide emissions, the administration must strengthen the fuel-efficiency standards for those vehicles. It should also close loopholes that allow automakers to thwart the intent of the fuel standards while following the letter of the regulations.

Under the rules, fuel efficiency rose five miles per gallon from 2007 to 2013. But reports from the Environmental Protection Agency show no overall improvement in 2014 models, the most recent year for which data is available. And with the production of S.U.V.s, pickups and minivans continuing to rise, fuel efficiency and emissions for 2015 vehicles most likely grew worse, though we wont be able to confirm that until December.

This news comes as the government begins an evaluation of the rules that could result in changes for 2021 through 2025. Our concern is that the auto industry will use the review, which it sought when the standards were first set, to delay or weaken the rules.

The fuel efficiency standards do not set overall pollution or mileage targets. Instead, they provide a sliding scale that allows for weaker mileage and emissions rules for company fleets as the automakers increase their truck production.

As a result, although the fuel economy for light trucks increased by .6 miles per gallon in 2014, the increased production of these vehicles, which rose by 5 percent, offset the overall, fleetwide benefit of other, more efficient vehicles.

In the end, the 2014 fleet of cars and trucks averaged 30.7 m.p.g., just as it did in 2013. By stalling improvements in efficiency, the auto industry continues to put the climate at risk. From well to wheels, burning a gallon of gasoline spews 25 pounds of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Of all the major automakers, American companies delivered the worst fleetwide mileage. Fords fuel efficiency was 9.2 m.p.g. worse than the industry leader, Mazda, which achieved 37.9 m.p.g. G.M. and Fiat Chrysler were worse than Ford. Only Honda and Hyundai were in full compliance with the standards without resorting to loopholes. One of these loopholes allows automakers to get credit for higher fuel efficiency for flexible fuel vehicles, even though those vehicles generally dont achieve that improved efficiency.

This is auto mechanics, not rocket science. To make more efficient vehicles, carmakers can deploy existing technologies, including better engines and transmissions, and improved aerodynamics and materials. High-strength, lightweight metals have shaved 150 pounds from the average vehicle. Automakers can cut at least twice that with no impact on safety, says Clarence M. Ditlow III, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety. (Our organization is affiliated with his group.)

Although automakers increased their use of fuel efficiency technology in 2014, they deployed it in only a few models, while outfitting their S.U.V.s and other light trucks with cheaper, outdated equipment. More than three-quarters of Subarus and Nissans use highly efficient continuously variable transmissions, but Ford, G.M. and Chrysler use them in only a small fraction of their fleet. BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz use turbochargers, which maximize engine efficiency, in a majority of their vehicles. Ford employs turbochargers in nearly 50 percent of its fleet, but G.M. and Chrysler have left them largely on the shelf.

And for every piece of efficient technology they ignore, automakers install another cup holder or electronic gizmo, jack up the price and increase profits by saddling buyers with a 20th-century product in 21st-century wrapping.

The Obama administrations mileage-and-emissions program can do more than any current measure to keep greenhouse gas pollution out of the atmosphere.

One way to fix the problems that have slowed progress would be to establish a so-called backstop during the midterm review, which is just getting underway. Under it, automakers would be required to produce a fleet that cuts carbon dioxide emissions by six billion tons, achieving the administrations original antipollution target.

The auto industry owes taxpayers that much, after the $85 billion government bailout that saved General Motors and Chrysler from bankruptcy.

If the rules achieve their goal, they will cut our payments at the pump, saving consumers as much as $8,000 even after they pay for the technology that delivers better mileage; ease our oil addiction; and keep six billion tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. We cant afford to let automakers stop this progress.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Reading My Patients' Obituaries,['Allison Bond'],"Photo

He could have been striking, with blue eyes and a mop of dark curls, but years of addiction to cocaine, heroin and pain pills had taken a toll on his body, making him look a decade older than his 25 years. He was frequently in and out of the hospital, and this time it was bacteria in his blood and on the valves of his heart that had landed him under my care on the medicine ward. His hand was also infected, and it would likely need to be amputated.

In the hospital, he berated and physically abused the staff, and his unreasonable demands required a level of attention that detracted from the care of other patients.

One afternoon we found him on the floor of his bathroom, barely coherent, after he had injected drugs one of his visitors had snuck into his room. It was not the first time he had broken our hospital and team rules.

That night he threatened to leave. Given his potentially deadly infections, it was a terrible idea, and I tried for an hour to convince him to stay. In the end he chose to go, even though he didnt have a place to sleep in the midst of the snowiest winter on record.

As a security guard wheeled him through the doors of the medical floor, I stuffed prescriptions for two antibiotics into his knapsack. He needed stronger medicines, the kind he could only get through an IV, along with close monitoring, but antibiotics to take by mouth would have to do.

Please dont forget to fill these prescriptions, I pleaded with him as the heavy metal doors clanged shut behind him. Your life depends on it.

Several months later, when the snow had just begun to melt, a colleague who had also cared for him sent me an email. I was wondering why we hadnt seen him around the hospital lately, it read. So sad.

Below the message was a link to the patients obituary, which had appeared in his hometown newspaper. I read with interest of his sense of humor and fascination with music. He had been in the armed forces, I learned. The accompanying photo showed him with bright eyes and a wry smile.

That was how family and friends would remember him  not desperate in a hospital gown, behaving in a way that surely would have been out of character before his life spun out of control. I wondered what his loved ones saw toward the end of his life. His relentless downward spiral must have been wrenching to watch.

Ive since read the obituaries of many of my patients. Sometimes I feel like Im intruding, like glimpsing a strangers family having dinner through the kitchen curtains. But I think I read them to know a side of my patients I could never see on the wards: the way they were before they got sick. The obituaries reinforce that the patient in the hospital bed has a past and dreams for the future, with experiences, interests and talents impossible to fully appreciate during morning rounds.

There was the 20-something student who fell ill with brain inflammation that left her unconscious and sent her heart into an abnormal rhythm, requiring chest compressions for nearly an hour before she flatlined. When she died, her father wailed in the doorway, hands in the air, as the hospital workers who had tried to save her stood stunned and frozen amidst a sea of discarded gloves and gauze on the floor.

When I read her obituary, I learned she had been an athlete and a leader among her peers. Her photo showed her with a wide smile, neatly parted hair, and pink lip gloss, looking very different from how Id remembered her.

Then there was the 40-year-old mother I cared for as she lay in pain from the breast cancer that peppered her brain and bones. Despite her tremendous suffering, a glimmer of her hopeful and resilient personality remained. But her treatment options had long since been exhausted, and she had at most weeks to live; a stream of visitors came day and night. After a number of difficult conversations with my patient and her partner, we managed to get her home for her final days.

I learned from her obituary that she had died peacefully at home, surrounded by loved ones. The article extolled her extraordinary positivity and ability to find the good in everyone. There was an address listed, and I sent a card. I hoped her partner would find comfort in the impact shed had on her caregivers.

In the stream of lives and deaths we witness in the hospital, its easy to forget that we usually are privy to only a brief snapshot of our patients lives. Of course, as a doctor, I hope all of my patients survive, and I try to get to know them when theyre under my care. But time is tight in the hospital, and there are always more patients to see and more tasks to finish. So when patients do pass away, their obituaries are a gentle reminder that behind the illness lies a story and a unique human being. Thats something that is easy to forget, but vital to remember.

The poet, novelist and environmentalist does not want his biography written. As the only person who ever has lived my life, I know that most of it can never be documented, is beyond writing and beyond words.









What books are currently on your night stand?

My fathers much-marked Bible (King James Version), which I keep there for companionship and to read; Volume 1 of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which I enjoy partly for the luxury of reading in no hurry, for I probably will never finish it; also Venerable Trees, by Tom Kimmerer, about the surviving trees of the original savannas or woodland pastures of Kentucky and Tennessee.

What was the last great book you read?

Out of Africa, by Isak Dinesen, no doubt a great book, also a good book. The book I recently read that I most needed to read was Art and Scholasticism, by Jacques Maritain.

Tell us about your favorite short story.

I keep in mind several stories that I think about when I need to. Picking one would slight the others and waste time.

And about your favorite poem.

Same as above, but I have done more rereading of poems and passages of poems than of stories. My need to do so has been greater. Of the ones I need, I need all.

Whats the best book about Kentucky? Any Kentucky writers you think deserve a wider readership?

Night Comes to the Cumberlands, by Harry M. Caudill, and Harry himself, showed me a way to be a Kentucky writer when I needed to be shown. James Still, author of River of Earth and many short stories and poems, befriended me when I was young, and his work set a fine example for us all. As contemporaries and friends, James Baker Hall, Mary Ann Taylor-Hall, Bobbie Ann Mason, Ed McClanahan and Gurney Norman have been necessary to me. And I am grateful that the younger writers, Silas House, Maurice Manning and Erik Reece, are now settled in the state. Before I would name a best among these, I would move to Indiana.

What genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?

A good book in any genre is a good book.

What moves you most in a work of literature? Do you find yourself returning to certain themes as a reader?

This supposes that there is a kind of event or experience that is most moving. I dont think so. Because I am a writer who has had mainly one place to write about, I can say with reason that I have been especially dependent on the examples of other writers who have written mainly about one place. My good fortune has been that there have been many such writers who also were good writers.

What kind of reader were you as a child? What childhood books and authors stick with you most?

From my earliest life, my mother and other grown-ups in my family read to me and encouraged me to love books. After I learned to read, I read intensely but intermittently. Often I would be too much outdoors, playing or working, to read. As a reader, I was inclined to find a book I liked and read it over and over again. When I was about 12, I could fairly recite The Yearling. The Swiss Family Robinson I read many times, also the novels of Mary OHara: My Friend Flicka and Thunderhead. I read, and believed, Tarzan of the Apes, other books by Edgar Rice Burroughs and several novels by Zane Grey. I read also (illegally) many comic books.

What book read for school had the greatest impact on you?

I never liked school until I went to the University of Kentucky, where I liked some of my classes very much. About all of the books that affected me until after high school, I read on my own. What affected me most as a university student was not so much a book or books as the delight, never-ending, of learning to read, for example, Chaucer and Milton. And I had a history professor who taught me that history could be read as local history in old documents and letters.

If you had to name one book that made you who you are today, what would it be?

As the product of at least two parents, I hesitate to see myself as derived from one book. I am sure that I descend from many books of several kinds, some that I have prized because of their high merit, some that I have prized because of my need for them.

If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?

This reminds me that I am never going to be in a position to require a president to do anything. If we should have a president who needs to read one book, I would advise him or her to read none, but instead to find some smart people who disagree with her or him and listen to them carefully.

What author living or dead would you most like to meet, and what would you like to know?

I am grateful to have known several authors living and dead, and am not greedy.

Of the books youve written, which is your favorite or the most personally meaningful?

Because I am still a living author, still at work, I think of what I am writing, very little of what I have written.

Whom would you want to write your life story?

A horrible thought. Nobody. As the only person who ever has lived my life, I know that most of it can never be documented, is beyond writing and beyond words.

What do you plan to read next?

I am 81 years old. By now, I know better than to make plans. Like the foxhounds and other true Christians, Ill follow my nose.",[]

Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders clashed vividly over immigration reform, health care and Cuba during a contentious debate Wednesday as the two Democrats appealed to Hispanic voters and tried to outdo each other in assailing Donald J. Trump.









Mrs. Clinton, bruised by her surprise loss in the Michigan primary a day earlier, was on the attack throughout the debate as she sought to undercut Mr. Sanderss momentum before the next round of primaries.

Aiming her remarks at viewers watching on Univision, a Spanish-language sponsor of the debate, Mrs. Clinton threw his past support for Fidel Castro and President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua in Mr. Sanderss face and repeatedly criticized him for opposing a 2007 bill that would have created a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants in the country illegally.

We had Republican support, Mrs. Clinton said. We had a president willing to sign it. I voted for that bill. Senator Sanders voted against it.

She refused to let up when Mr. Sanders explained that he thought the guest worker provisions in the bill were akin to slavery. Mrs. Clinton argued that she, Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Hispanic groups would never have supported such a bill. Her broadsides finally became too much for Mr. Sanders when she accused him of supporting vigilantes known as Minutemen on the border.

Photo

No, I do not support vigilantes  that is a horrific statement, an unfair statement to make, Mr. Sanders said. Madam Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week.

In their final debate before primaries in Florida, Ohio and other states on Tuesday, the two Democrats were a study in contrasts as they made stark appeals to the demographic groups they have come to prize.

Mrs. Clinton repeatedly aligned herself with the needs and concerns of immigrant families and stuck to her promise to knock down barriers in employment and housing, hoping these priorities would inspire Hispanics and African-Americans and deliver her landslide victories in Florida and North Carolina.

Mr. Sanderss rallying cries against the rigged economy and establishment politics were aimed at liberals, young people, working-class white voters and independents who could be decisive for him in Ohio, Illinois and Missouri, his top targets next week.

He appeared confident to the point of cocky at times, claiming at one point that Mrs. Clinton had borrowed from his proposals to make public colleges free. Thank you for copying a very good idea, he said. He chortled when Mrs. Clinton accused him of not supporting clean energy ideas, and he muttered, Come on, when Mrs. Clinton refused to stop speaking.

He also showed he could throw a punch, such as when Mrs. Clinton questioned the cost of his Medicare-for-all plan, saying, If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

What Secretary Clinton is saying is that the United States should continue to be the only major country on earth that doesnt guarantee health care to all of our people, Mr. Sanders said, drawing a stern look from his opponent.

I do believe in universal coverage, she fired back. Remember, I fought for it 25 years ago.

The debate in Miami came just three days after the candidates last face-off in Flint, Mich., and one day after Mr. Sanders was declared the winner of that states primary. His unexpected victory infused his campaign with excitement and fund-raising momentum: He was on track to raise $5 million in online donations in the ensuing 24 hours.

Mr. Sanderss success in Michigan seemed to energize him Wednesday in countering Mrs. Clintons attacks on immigration.

Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, who wanted to do the right thing and provide drivers licenses to those who were undocumented, Mr. Sanders said. She said, Dont do it, and New York State still does not do it. He also noted that he had supported allowing children from war-torn Central American countries to enter the United States and asserted that Mrs. Clintons view was send them back.

That is something that is not fair about what I said, Mrs. Clinton said. I did say we needed to be very concerned about little children coming to this country on their own, very often, many of them not making it, and when they got here, they needed, as I have argued for, legal counsel, due process, to make a decision.

Both candidates, who consistently praise President Obama on most issues, vowed to end the mass deportations of his administration. They both flatly promised not to deport children.

Mrs. Clinton projected steeliness throughout the debate and did not seem fazed by her loss in Michigan, taking comfort in her accumulation of more of the delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. She has a steadily growing delegate lead over Mr. Sanders in spite of his successes, because her margins of victory have been greater.

Yet she was careful to show that she was not taking the nomination for granted, even pushing back against a question about whether she had gotten ahead of herself in assuming she had all but beaten Mr. Sanders.

Im continuing to work hard for every single vote across our country, Mrs. Clinton said. I was pleased that I got 100,000 more votes last night than my opponent, and more delegates.

Each candidate sought to be perceived as the more formidable challenger to Mr. Trump, the Republican front-runner.

Mrs. Clinton argued that Mr. Trump was promoting un-American views and promised to take every opportunity to criticize him. Later, she mocked his centerpiece proposal to build a very tall wall, right, a beautiful, tall wall.

Mr. Sanders argued that he could convince Democratic Party leaders and elected officials that Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump.

But Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders both sidestepped a direct question about whether they thought Mr. Trump was a racist, given his hostile comments about Mexicans and Muslims and his initial reluctance to disavow the support of the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.

Mr. Sanders said he was confident that Americans would not elect Mr. Trump, and pointed out that Mr. Trump had been a leading skeptic of whether Mr. Obama was born in the United States and eligible to be president. Mr. Sanders noted that no one had challenged him over the fact that his own father was born in Poland.

Nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate, Mr. Sanders said. Maybe that has to do with the color of my skin.

Both Democrats saw the debate as an opportunity to reach Latino voters not only in Florida, but also in Arizona, California, Illinois and other states with large Hispanic populations.

Asked whether he stood by his positive statements in the past about Mr. Castro and Mr. Ortega, Mr. Sanders sought to put the remarks in context but did not disavow them. Mrs. Clinton pounced.

I just couldnt disagree more, she said. If the values are that you oppress people, you disappear people, you imprison people, even kill people for expressing their opinions, for expressing freedom of speech, that is not the kind of revolution of values that I ever want to see anywhere.

Mrs. Clinton was introspective when asked why many Americans do not trust her. Obviously, its painful for me to hear that, she said. I am not a natural politician, in case you havent noticed, like my husband or President Obama, she added. I just have to do the best I can and hope that people see that I am fighting for them.

Many of the questions to Mrs. Clinton were provocatively worded, especially those from Jorge Ramos of Univision. After playing a video in which the mother of an American killed in Benghazi, Libya, questioned whether Mrs. Clinton had told the truth about the attacks there, Mr. Ramos bluntly asked: Did you lie to them?

Mrs. Clinton was taken aback. Shes wrong. Shes absolutely wrong, she said. When we had information we made it public, but then sometimes we had to go back and say, we have new information that contradicts it.

Mr. Ramos also pressed Mrs. Clinton on whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted on charges related to her use of a private email server as secretary of state. At first she ignored the question, but when the moderators followed up, she dismissed it curtly.

Oh, for goodness  that is not going to happen, she said. I am not even answering that question.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-03-11 00:00:00,Christians Flock to Groups That Help Members Pay Medical Bills,[],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

SAN ANTONIO  When Chris Doyle learned that his health insurance deductible would climb to $10,000 last year, he and his wife, both evangelical Christians, spent a couple weeks just praying, he said.









Then they opted out of insurance altogether, joining something called a health care sharing ministry, which requires members to help cover one anothers major medical costs as they come up.

While such nonprofit ministries have been around for decades, interest in them has grown since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, largely because the law exempts members from the requirement to have health insurance or pay a yearly fine.

Samaritan Ministries International, which Mr. Doyle and his wife, Sarah, joined last winter, plays matchmaker, assigning member families to help pay the medical bills of other members. The money is mailed directly to the families in need, often with handwritten prayers or notes of support  or in the case of one family here, strawberry stickers and a drawing of an elephant for their 5-year-old as she recovered from ear tube surgery.

Because they are not insurance companies, sharing ministries provide no guarantee that members medical debts will be paid; members are advised to trust that God will provide. The ministries say the payment system is helping Christians fulfill a biblical mandate to share one anothers burdens.

Our only assets are the good will and continued participation of our members, said James Lansberry, executive vice president of Samaritan, which is based in Peoria, Ill.

Some ministries operate differently, requiring members to pay monthly into accounts from which funds are disbursed to those with eligible medical bills. Pre-existing medical conditions are often not covered, nor are preventive care, mental health and injuries resulting from behavior the ministry considers immoral or reckless. Members who acquire a sexually transmitted disease from an extramarital affair are out of luck, for instance, as are those injured while driving drunk or during a melee.

Still, membership in sharing ministries has more than doubled over the last six years, to 535,000 from about 200,000, according to the Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries. More participants live in Texas than in any other state, according to Samaritan and the two other largest ministries, Medi-Share, based in Florida, and Christian Healthcare Ministries, based in Ohio. Under the terms of the federal health law, only members of ministries that have operated continuously since December 1999 are exempt from the requirement to have health insurance.

The growth seems to have come largely through word of mouth, at churches, schools and workplaces. Mr. Doyle, a machinist, heard about Samaritan Ministries at Grace Point Church in San Antonio, whose pastors and employees are members and whose congregants post about it on Facebook.

He and Sarah, who stays home with their two toddlers, mail a flat $405 payment to a fellow member every month, the standard rate for families of three or more. Had they stuck with the insurance he was offered through work, the Doyles said, their share of the premium would have been about $600 a month, and they would have had to pay the first $5,000 in annual medical costs outside of preventive care.

Under the ministry, they also have to pay the first $300 of any medical expense they incur. They have not yet had a doctors bill exceed that amount, though they are waiting somewhat nervously for that day to come. Samaritan limits spending on each injury or illness to $250,000, with exceptions for people who agree to pay extra each year toward others bills above that amount.

Theres a little bit of fear going into it, said Mrs. Doyle, 33, adding that she suspected she had a hernia that would need to be repaired soon. What if people dont pay their share and what if the money doesnt come in? But thats where the faith-based part comes in  Im really going to rely on God.

Once a year, members send their monthly share to the ministrys headquarters to help cover administrative costs, and new members pay a $200 fee upon joining that also goes to administration.

Mr. Lansberry said Samaritan members eligible medical bills average, cumulatively, over $16 million a month. Its membership has grown by about 50,000 over the last year, to nearly 200,000 people in 58,000 paying households.

Acknowledging that many families can qualify for subsidized insurance policies with free preventive care through the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Lansberry said that most new members were not joining primarily on price; they are joining primarily on principle.

Before members can be reimbursed, they sometimes must pay upfront for their medical care  potentially a sizable outlay, since hospitals increasingly require at least partial prepayment. It then takes at least two months for Samaritan to process their requests for help and for checks from other members to arrive in the mail.

The most harrowing part of health care sharing so far for Kyle Burkholder, the teaching pastor at Grace Point, and his wife, Stefani, was paying $6,500 upfront for their daughters ear tube surgery, they said. They waited for what seemed like forever for other members checks to come.

About 90 days after her surgery, sure enough, the money did start showing up, Mrs. Burkholder said. And it was with handwritten notes  every day it was one, two, three notes, and she was reading them aloud, and I found myself just crying.

Photo

Members with special prayer needs  conditions that are not eligible under the ministrys rules  can also ask for financial help. Last month, for example, Samaritans newsletter highlighted the case of a woman with uterine cancer diagnosed before she became a member, and a teenager who tore a knee ligament in a dirt bike race.

On one hand you think, Well, thats not grace, is it?  Mr. Burkholder said. But on the other hand, thats what makes this thing work.

Upon joining, members waive their right to sue, and in the case of Samaritan, appeals panels of randomly selected members are supposed to settle disputes. Mr. Lansberry said such panels had been convened only four times since Samaritans founding in 1994, and that the organization had never been the subject of complaints to state attorneys general or insurance commissioners.

The insurance commissioner in Washington State did try to stop Samaritan from operating there in 2011, saying it was selling unauthorized insurance, but the State Legislature then passed a law explicitly exempting health care sharing ministries from regulations.

Insurance commissioners in Kentucky and Oklahoma had tried to block Medi-Share, the Florida-based ministry, but were thwarted when their legislatures also passed protection laws.

In 2001, Ohios attorney general sued one ministry  known then as the Christian Brotherhood Newsletter, and now as Christian Healthcare Ministries  ultimately forcing its leaders to repay $15 million they had spent on homes, vehicles and excessive salaries out of the central fund where members had sent payments.

Members have filed a handful of lawsuits against Medi-Share after bills they had expected to be covered were not. The cases were settled out of court. While the health law requires the ministries to submit to annual independent audits, critics question whether that safeguard is sufficient.

Our message has consistently been that this is not a health insurance product that we regulate, so buyer beware, said Nick Gerhart, the insurance commissioner in Iowa. A premature baby could cost $1 million pretty easily, so it wouldnt take very many of those to put a significant strain on any group, let alone an unregulated group like this.

Lee and Amy Jebson of Chesapeake, Va., were not expecting any major medical costs when they signed up for Medi-Share in 2014 after being priced out of the plans available through HealthCare.gov, the federally run insurance marketplace. Then their 8-year-old son was found to have acute lymphoblastic leukemia, leading to several hundred thousand dollars worth of medical bills in just the first few months of his treatment.

One single fever is a $10,000-a-night hospital cost, said Mrs. Jebson, adding that her family pays a $500 monthly share toward other members medical costs, plus $2,500 a year toward their own. But so far, she added, their bills are being covered, with the exception of a few thousand dollars.

In social media posts, some members and former members of sharing ministries have complained about the many medical needs that are not covered, the wait for other members checks to arrive, and the legwork they have to do as self-pay patients.

But others say the ministries allow them to live by their religious beliefs rather than following a government mandate to buy insurance that may cover things they do not want to pay for, like abortion (though half the states do not allow plans sold through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, at least, to pay for abortions) or birth control.

Its really a model of wanting to take care of someone else  not being told, You have to, or Im forcing you to do this,  Mr. Jebson said.

The Doyles said that their impression might change if they incur big medical bills, but for now they appreciate the personal nature of their monthly transactions.

Theres something different about writing my check to someone who needs it, Mrs. Doyle said. I feel like Im loving on somebody instead of just paying my premiums.",[]

The final scheduled Democratic debate, held in Miami, was raucous, lively and, at times, ugly.

Hillary Clinton fought to keep Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont from scoring additional wins next week in Florida and other contests after his surprise victory in Michigan on Tuesday. Mr. Sanders tried to capitalize on his win, dispensing with the pleasantries and the desire he once professed to avoid negative attacks.

Mrs. Clinton seemed well prepared to critique Mr. Sanderss record on immigration-related votes, pressing him as a sympathizer of militiamen who wanted to round up people in the country illegally. Mr. Sanders sounded uncomfortable as he described his opposition to a comprehensive immigration bill in 2007, when he said that it would lead to more depression of wages for American workers, the same position that organized labor held at the time.

Mr. Sanders tried to say he took that position because he found the guest-worker program to be akin to slavery, as critics of it have said. But that was a bit of a pretzel twist, and in reality, Mr. Sanderss 2007 position will not hurt him in the Midwest, particularly in Illinois and Ohio, which also vote on Tuesday.

Mrs. Clinton faced some of the toughest questions of the night, in what seemed like a lopsided effort by the moderators as they approached the two candidates. She flashed some annoyance, but held it in check for the most part. And she struck a poignant note when she acknowledged that she was not a gifted politician. Yet she seemed uncertain of exactly how to attack Mr. Sanders, hitting him from the left at times and making an imprecise case against him over his votes related to the government bailout of the automobile industry after the fiscal collapse of 2008.

Thursday night, the pendulum swings back to the Republican side, where the four remaining candidates will gather for a debate, also in Miami.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Hungarian Leaders Edifice Complex Has Some in Budapest Rattled,['Rick Lyman'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

BUDAPEST  Augustus boasted of finding Rome a city of brick and leaving it a city of marble. Hungarys prime minister, Viktor Orban, seems to be trying for something similar.









With two huge building projects, Mr. Orban intends to change the face of Budapest  partly for economic reasons, to lure more tourists, and partly for political reasons, to restore key national edifices to their pre-World War II glory.

The idea, besides removing as many vestiges of Communist rule as possible, is to create a concrete expression of the nationalism his governing party espouses.

On the Buda side of the Danube River, the former royal palace squats grandly atop Castle Hill, blandly remade by the Communists after the destruction of World War II into the current home of the National Gallery of Art and the citys history museum.

Mr. Orban intends to kick out the National Gallery, restore the palace to its earlier grandeur and install himself in new offices nearby.

On the Pest side, at the far end of Budapests grand but financially struggling Andrassy Avenue, the government intends to spend more than $780 million to transform the citys 250-acre main park into a kind of Berlin-style Museum Island.

Photo

It will include a half-dozen new institutions, some designed by major international architects, and other tourist-friendly projects scattered around one of the citys last major green spaces.

These projects, when lumped together, probably constitute the biggest such concentrated architectural project in Budapest in 100 years, said Samu Szemerey, an architect and founder of the KEK Hungarian Contemporary Architecture Center.

Laszlo Baan, general director of Budapests Museum of Fine Arts, said it was the largest architectural project in Europe and a transformative event in the citys history.

Critics speak of Mr. Orbans edifice complex, and his eagerness to leave a concrete imprint on the capital.

It can only be understood from a political perspective, said Gergely Karacsony, the mayor of Budapests 14th district, which includes the park, known simply as Liget, the Hungarian word for park.

Orban is trying to take the existing city and put it back to the shape it had before 1944, he said. The park is a victim of this whole political machinery.

Other environmental groups also oppose the park idea, arguing that the city should develop its existing empty acres before taking away precious green space.

And critics see the castle restoration as expensive and impractical  perhaps even impossible.

Photo

Nobody can do this, said Peter Gyorgy, a museum historian at Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest. The castle is totally different from before the war. It is a modern structure with a facade and a different interior configuration.

The projects have unfolded like a game of dominoes.

If Mr. Orban wanted to relocate his offices to Castle Hill, the former home of Hungarian royalty, and to transform the castle into a Versailles-style palace museum whose ornate spaces he could use for state occasions, he had to get the existing museum out.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

And if he also wished to return Hungarys highest court to its former stunning headquarters across from Parliament  and he does  Mr. Orban has to move out the Museum of Ethnography, now somewhat improbably housed there.

At the same time, Mr. Baan proposed merging the evicted National Gallery with his Museum of Fine Arts, in separate but jointly managed buildings in the park. The Museum of Ethnography will also land there, in new digs that Zaha Hadid and Rem Koolhaus, among other celebrated architects, are currently designing bids to build.

An agriculture museum in a tottering old castle in the parks center will get a face-lift, as will several other buildings around the park. Remaining green spaces will be upgraded. A former art nouveau theater, largely for childrens productions, will be reconstructed. There will be a new Center for Hungarian Music, a beer garden and a huge bio-dome covering one end of the adjacent Budapest Zoo.

Many of the new buildings will replicate structures from the 1896 Millennium Exhibition, seen as a high point for Hungary. The restored transportation museum, for instance, will be dominated by a 220-foot dome simply because such a dome once rose there.

The new National Gallery  designed by Sanaa, a Tokyo firm headed by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa  will be a glass-and-steel edifice at the parks center. It will give Mr. Baan a chance to reconfigure the museums collections in a more logical way.

Under the new plan, Mr. Baan said, all works up to the late 18th century will go in the Museum of Fine Arts on Heroes Square. The square will get its own major face-lift, including restoration of its imposing Romanesque Hall, which was bombed in the war. All later works will go in the new National Gallery.

Professor Gyorgy, who is skeptical of the castle project, has different feelings about the museums.

Liget is different, he said, adding: Budapest is not known as a museum city, but this could change that, and museum tourists tend to be richer and stay longer.

Working from a sun-filled office in a starkly modern building overlooking one of Pests central squares, Laszlo L. Simon is overseeing the castle project as the prime ministers state secretary for cultural heritage and prominent cultural projects.

The castle was always in a special position, Mr. Simon said. It was the actual place of the rulers until the Habsburg years. So this is an attempt to bring the castle into this era of national renewal.

And the only way to do that, he said, is to remove all the Communist-era restorations and return the palace to its prewar glory. It could take as long as 20 years to finish every facet of the project, he said.

We have everything we need to restore the castle, Mr. Simon said. It is only a question of money.

At the far end of Andrassy Avenue, in modern offices overlooking the park, the officers of Liget Budapest  as the museums project is known  say the plan will not only draw hundreds of thousands of new tourists, but also improve the park for residents.

Official estimates indicate that the number of nights foreign tourists stay in the city would rise by 20 percent after the project is completed in 2019.

In the competition for tourists, Budapest gets about 3 million foreign visitors per year, Mr. Baan said. Prague gets 4.5 million; Vienna, Barcelona and Milan get over 6 million.

We have unrealized potential, he said.

Mayor Karacsony is not persuaded.

What is important to the government is that the National Gallery on Castle Hill must go, he said. That is the real reason this is happening. Everything else is just ideology and excuses.

The government has also declared that both projects are a prominent investment under Hungarian law. This means that groups opposed to the projects cannot take the issue to court, said Andras Lukacs, president of the Clean Air Action Group, which also opposes the park plan.

He also wonders whether the promised crowds will actually come to what some proponents call the New Budapest.

We have no Mona Lisa to put on display, Mr. Lukacs said.

Mr. Baan gazed down at the white-flecked Danube from his corner office inside the royal palace.

True, we dont have a Mona Lisa, he said, adding that is why the projects are necessary. The goal is to become the No. 1 city-break destination for families in Europe.",[]

BEIJING  A Tibetan entrepreneur who is a vocal but moderate advocate for bilingual education in schools across Chinese-ruled Tibetan regions has been illegally detained by the police for one and a half months, his family said.









The man, Tashi Wangchuk, 30, who lives with his parents in the western town of Yushu, has written about language policy on his microblog. He has highlighted the dearth of meaningful Tibetan language education and expressed concern that many Tibetan children are unable to become fluent in their native language, a widespread worry in the ethnic group.

Mr. Tashi was detained on Jan. 27 and has been held for 44 days. According to Chinese law, the police can generally detain a person for 30 days before officers must ask prosecutors to bring charges or release the person. Prosecutors then have seven days to announce a charge.

Mr. Tashis family has tried contacting the Yushu police and the towns main detention center, where relatives say they believe he is, but officers have not given them a reason for the detention and have not let them see Mr. Tashi.

Reached by telephone, a senior police officer in Yushu, Chief Zhang, who gave only his surname, said that his unit, the guobao, was handling the case. Asked for more details, he said he needed to verify whether the case his unit was handling was indeed the same one.

Until his detention, Mr. Tashi was posting about Tibet to his Sina Weibo account. Many messages expressed anxieties about the gradual extinction of Tibetan culture. On Jan. 20, for example, Mr. Tashi reshared an item in which an online commentator had asked Khampa Television, the local official Tibetan Khampa-dialect channel, to stop broadcasting, saying the Tibetan culture you talk about is for commercial and exhibition use.

Mr. Tashis last item, on Jan. 24, was a repost of a comment that urged the legislature and legislative advisory committee of Qinghai Province, where Yushu is, to enhance bilingual education and hire more bilingual civil servants.

Mr. Tashis views were published in an article in The New York Times in November. He was the subject of a nine-minute documentary that The Times produced about his efforts to use legal means to bolster Tibetan language education. He was again quoted in an article in December that looked at how Chinese officials in Tibetan areas use horse festivals for propaganda purposes.

In an interview last year, Mr. Tashi said that he was not advocating Tibetan independence and that he was mainly concerned about cultural preservation. He traveled to Beijing that year to seek legal help in filing a lawsuit against local officials, but he has yet to make the filing.

He said he sought to use the law to press officials to have true bilingual education in schools. In most schools in Tibetan regions, the native language is taught in a single class, similar to foreign-language education in the United States. Mandarin is the main teaching language.

My goal is to change things a little bit, to push to preserve some of our nations culture, he said. The entire Tibetan ethnic nationality and culture is at risk of disappearing.

Mr. Tashi also said that he was thankful to all the Chinese people who truly protect minorities and praised President Xi Jinping for having promoted a democratic and law-abiding country these last few years.

Mr. Tashi was detained briefly twice before, he and his family members said. More than a decade ago, he was arrested after he was caught trying to travel illegally to India. (Many Tibetans make illegal pilgrimages to India to try to see the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of the Tibetans, who lives in exile.)

In 2012, Mr. Tashi was detained for posting online comments that criticized local officials over land seizures, a common complaint of citizens across China.

As well as managing a shop, Mr. Tashi uses Taobao, an Alibaba platform, to sell goods from his native region to buyers across China. His merchandise included caterpillar fungus, harvested on the Tibetan Plateau, which is popular in Chinese medicine. In 2014, Alibaba featured Mr. Tashi in a video for its investor roadshow before a prominent initial public offering.

Chinese officials consider the winter and early spring to be sensitive periods in Tibet. They watch for protests during Losar, the Tibetan New Year, and around March 10, the anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule. Detentions and security clampdowns increased after March 2008, when a Tibetan revolt that began in Lhasa spread across the plateau. Since 2009, more than 140 Tibetans have set themselves on fire in protest.

During the annual conclave of the National Peoples Congress in Beijing this month, the Chinese government has been eager to promote an image of ethnic harmony. Tibetan delegates there have been spotted wearing pins featuring pictures of President Xi Jinping. On Wednesday, Xinhua, the state news agency, said the government planned to spend $75 million to repair and preserve 156 traditional sky burial sites on the Tibetan Plateau.

On Tuesday, KFC, the American fast food chain, opened a branch in downtown Lhasa, its first in Tibet. Tibet advocacy groups have condemned the arrival. In 2004, the Dalai Lama wrote a letter to Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC, urging it not to bring the chain to Tibet, saying that the companys treatment of chickens violates Tibetan values and that a branch in Tibet would perpetuate the suffering of huge numbers of chickens. At the time, KFC abandoned its plans there.",[]

We as a society derided the Roman Catholic Church as an accessory to child sexual abuse, and we lambasted Penn State for similar offenses.









Yet we as a society are complicit or passive in a similar way, by allowing a popular website called Backpage.com to be used to arrange child rape. Consider what happened to a girl Ill call Natalie, who was trafficked into the sex industry in Seattle at age 15.

It was every parents nightmare, Natalies mother, Nacole, told me. It can happen to any parent. Fifteen-year-olds dont make the best choices. I dropped her off at school in the morning, I was expecting to pick her up after track practice in the afternoon, and then I didnt see her for 108 days. The girl ran off to a bus station, was found by a pimp, and within days was being sold for sex on Backpage.

Backpage has classified ads for everything from antiques to boats, but it makes its money on escort ads. It has about 80 percent of the U.S. market for online sex ads in America, mostly for consenting adults but many also for women who are forcibly trafficked or for underage girls. Children in at least 47 states have been sold on Backpage, by one aid groups count.

We were an everyday, average family, Nacole said. Our children were involved in sports. She played the violin. She was on the soccer team. And she made a stupid decision one day that forever changed her life. And Backpage facilitated it.

The girl was eventually rescued by the police, but by then she had been beaten and threatened by her pimp and endured innumerable rapes. Shes forever changed, her mom said. Her siblings are forever changed. Today she struggles with life.

If there were a major American website openly selling heroin or anthrax, there would be an outcry. Yet we Americans tolerate a site like Backpage.com that is regularly used to peddle children. We avert our eyes, and the topic tends not to come up in polite society.

I had no idea how much juvenile trafficking goes on until my family became a victim of it, Nacole said.

Thousands of children are trafficked for sex each year in the United States, but there are no solid numbers. What is clear is only that its a big problem that gets minimal attention; its essentially never mentioned in the current political campaign.

Yet a few forces are coming together to put pressure on Backpage. One is a lawsuit in Washington State against Backpage by Natalie and two other girls who at age 13 were also sold on the website; one of the 13-year-olds said that she was raped 20 times a day.",[]

Four years ago, when I began working on a book about the secrets of productivity, I had a hidden motivation: I wanted to figure out how to eat dinner with my kids.

Both my wife and I had demanding jobs. We have two sons  now 7 and 4  and knew it was important to eat dinner together. But it proved consistently impossible for us all to sit down at the same time. Every morning, we would announce our intentions of leaving work early enough to dine as a family. But one thing would lead to another, we would get delayed at the office, and then the babysitter would call to say that the children were starving and so we would tell her to appease them with snacks. Most parents know where this leads: Kids all hopped up on Pirates Booty, parents guiltily sipping wine while re-heating leftovers, full of self-recriminations and promises that next week, things will be different. Until, that is, next week rolls around and the same thing happens again.

Talk to Us Do you have a family problem that the Five Whys strategy could help solve? Please send them to us. Well choose some to highlight in the coming weeks.

So, when I began interviewing exceptionally productive companies and people for my book, Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business, I often asked them to help me solve our familys woes. I eventually found a solution in the most unlikely of places  an old car factory  and a method known as the Five Whys.

In the 1980s, the Japanese car manufacturer Toyota opened its first American plant in Freemont, Calif. The factory was guided by a management philosophy known as the Toyota Production System, which at its core holds that even the most complex problems have simple causes  if you know how to look for them.

For us, the Five Whys worked in a fairly straightforward manner. We began by identifying a problem: We never managed to have family dinner. Then we explored, at the most surface level, why that was true: Because my wife and I always got home later than we expected.

Then came another question: Why were we getting home so late? The answer was that, although we intended to leave the office by 5, we often found it impossible to walk away from our desks because there were so many miscellaneous tasks we had ignored during the day.

That prompted the third question: Why had we ignored all those tasks? Well, inevitably, we arrived at work each morning just as our first meetings were starting, and so rather than deal with unread memos and emails, we put them aside until later in the day  and then, when we finally got to them, there were new memos and emails that demanded our attention.

The fourth question: Why were we arriving at work right before our first meetings, rather than earlier in the day? Because although we always intended to leave the house at 8 and get the kids to school, we usually ran late, and didnt get out the door until 8:20 or so.

And, finally, why were we leaving the house later than we planned? Because it took so long to get the kids dressed in the morning that we always left later than we expected.

We had started by identifying a problem  we never managed to have family dinner  and by using the Five Whys found a root cause: Our kids were taking too long to get dressed in the morning. Before conducting this exercise, I had never suspected that there was a connection between our morning routines and our evening mealtimes. But once we forced ourselves to ask why after why, it was clear what needed to change. If we could convince our kids to get dressed earlier, we could make it out the door faster, and in turn would have time at our desks to deal with emails and memos before the day started getting crazy, and then we would be able to leave work earlier, and make it home in time to have dinner together. So we instituted a new family rule: Now, each night before going to bed, our kids lay out their clothes for the next day, and then they get dressed as soon as they wake up.

Researchers have found that this method of looking for root causes works in dozens of settings. The Toyota Production System is arguably the most important invention in operations since Henry Fords Model T began rolling off the production line, the Harvard Business Review observed in 2011. The Five Whys is a process of continually asking questions until you get to the root cause, and getting closer and closer to a problem until you understand whats really going on. The Five Whys method has helped managers eliminate waste, aided executives in figuring out what projects to pursue and which to discard, helped children understand how to analyze problems and find solutions and assisted teachers in creating environments where even underperforming students can succeed.

At the center of the Five Whys  and the reason its so effective  is a basic insight: Productivity means different things to different people, but at its core, its about thinking a little more deeply about the choices we make every day. For my book, I interviewed neurologists and executives, as well as the filmmakers behind Frozen and teachers who transformed the Cincinnati school system, and found each of them echoing this idea. Productivity isnt about running faster or pushing yourself harder, but rather, about working smarter and paying a bit more attention to what is really going on.

Nowadays, our kids are dressed every morning by 7:30. They choose their outfits the night before, and weve made a game of laying out their clothes before they fall asleep. Its a small shift in how we get things done, but the impact has been profound: Mornings are calmer, were out the door more promptly, we get home from work earlier and we usually have dinner as a family at least three times a week. Applying business strategies cant solve every problem in every family, and productivity isnt every familys goal, but understanding how to analyze problems by drilling down to their roots can go a long way toward making life easier.

And in my house, learning to make small adjustments in our routines is delivering big returns. Parenting will never be considered a purely productive activity  but its getting easier, and better, every day.

Do you have a family problem that the Five Whys strategy could help solve? Please send them to us. KJ DellAntonia and Charles Duhigg will highlight some of these problems, and solutions, in the weeks ahead.

When I look out into my classroom, and take the emotional temperature of my students, Im usually checking for engagement. I want to make sure they feel supported, are interested in the lesson at hand, and that the lesson is relevant to each student.

But happiness? I stopped looking for happiness long ago. I see it periodically, when the conditions are perfect, and the stars align just so. When happiness strikes in my classroom, I relish it as I would any other rare anomaly, like thundersnow or a two-faced calf. Regular sightings, however, seem too much to hope for given the inhospitable climate in many American classrooms.

Emma Seppala, however, the author of The Happiness Track, and science director of Stanford Universitys Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education, has not lost hope. Dr. Seppala admits that yes, happiness can be a rare beast in our classrooms, but we can create and protect learning conditions in which happiness can flourish.

Happiness, Dr. Seppala explained in an email, is not something we can afford to lose at home or in our classrooms, as it forms the very foundation of deep, meaningful learning. Happy kids show up at school more able to learn because they tend to sleep better and may have healthier immune systems. Happy kids learn faster and think more creatively. Happy kids tend to be more resilient in the face of failures. Happy kids have stronger relationships and make new friends more easily.

Unfortunately, we put our childrens happiness at risk when we model what Dr. Seppala calls the myths of success: the belief that success is inextricably tied to stress and anxiety, perseverance at all costs, avoidance of personal weakness, and a myopic focus on cultivating expertise in a specialized niche.

We may tell kids that we want them to be happy, and that we care about their learning more than we care about their grades, but when we model the myths of success in our own lives, they know the truth. Perpetuating these myths, whether through our words or actions, undermines the very happiness and learning we claim to value.

If we truly want to cultivate happiness in our homes and schools, we cant just pay it lip service. We must model behaviors that, according to Dr. Seppala, make us happier, healthier and more productive.

Live in the moment. Rather than encouraging children to live from one to-do item to the next, help them focus and enjoy whatever activity they are engaged in now. Research shows our minds wander off task 50 percent of the time. Yet when our mind wanders, we have more negative emotions. While a little bit of stress about the next to-do can serve as a motivator, long-term chronic stress impairs both physical health and intellectual faculties such as attention and memory, Dr. Seppala said in an email.

Model resilience. While we cant often change the work and life demands our children face in their lives, we can help them train their nervous systems to be resilient, and to thrive in the face of difficulties and challenges, Dr. Seppala said. Talk about how you have overcome challenges, model healthy resilience, and help kids find respite from the pressures of achievement. Techniques such as meditation, yoga and breathing exercises help your children rest their minds and bodies, and allow them to recover from the physical and emotional damage stress can impart.

Manage your energy. While negative emotions can be damaging to kids mental and physical health, our societys penchant for constant, high-intensity positive emotions takes a toll as well. Western societies value excitement and other high-intensity positive emotions over low-intensity positive emotions such as calm. While theres nothing wrong with excitement and fun, children need to know how to balance excitement with the ability to calm down and function from a centered, peaceful place, saving precious mental energy for tasks that need it most, Dr. Seppala said.

Do nothing. Taking time off to disconnect and relax focus helps promote kids creativity and insights, Dr. Seppala wrote. Children need time for idleness, fun and irrelevant interests, and as research shows C.E.O.s currently value creativity higher than any other trait in the incoming workforce, it behooves you to let your kids relax and access their inner inventor.

Be kind to yourself. While its good to strive for improvement, excessive self-criticism can backfire, and become self-sabotage. Self-criticism maintains focus on the negative, leaving kids anxious, afraid of failure and less likely to learn from mistakes. Self-compassion, however, improves childrens ability to excel in the face of challenges, to develop new skills and to learn from their mistakes.

Be kind to others. Research shows that people who are supportive and compassionate toward others are more successful. Fortunately, Dr. Seppala said, Children are naturally compassionate and kind; we simply need to protect these traits.

Children should not be surprised by joy. If they are, the responsibility for its absence lies at the feet of parents, teachers and administrators who have pushed happiness out of its native habitat to make room for the toxic, invasive species of anxiety, stress and fear.

nytimes.com,2016-03-11 00:00:00,Crime Stories: Photography and Foul Play Is a Rogues Gallery,['Ken Johnson'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Theres not a single uninteresting picture in Crime Stories: Photography and Foul Play at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but as a whole exhibition its confused and confusing. Drawn from the museums collections, it includes scores of 19th- and 20th-century mug shots; pictures of crime scenes by photojournalists; photographs by modern artists like Walker Evans, Diane Arbus, William Klein and Larry Clark; and a variety of old publications and ephemera.









Works are displayed in no clearly discernible order in the small Gilman Gallery, from Alexander Gardners Execution of the Conspirators (1865), a long-distance shot of the hanging of the people who conspired to assassinate President Lincoln, to Ms. Arbuss Onscreen woman with hoop earrings and a gun (1958), which depicts a television showing the titular image.

Other pieces include an unknown photographers 1892 portrait of the five-member Wild Bunch gang jauntily posing in bowler hats; a bare-feet-first picture of John Dillingers body in a Chicago morgue taken by another unknown photographer in 1934; Human Head Cake Box Murder (circa 1940) by Weegee, a nocturnal image of people gazing at a severed head on the ground near the box it was found in; and the 1974 image of a gun-toting newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst from a bank surveillance camera. Thats too many different rabbits for one dog to chase.

All this and more makes for an entertaining if not very coherent experience  kind of like web surfing. Then you come upon the image of Robert F. Kennedy lying evidently in great pain on the floor of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles just moments after being shot by Sirhan Bishara Sirhan in 1968, a picture by the photojournalist Boris Yaro. This is sobering, and it makes the rest of the show seem inappropriately blithe by comparison.

There is a particular thread running through the show that might have provided more substance and a sharper focus: that is the use of photography for identifying lawbreakers, which began soon after the invention of photography itself.

In the 19th century, some people thought that the supposedly typical physical characteristics of criminals could be scientifically determined. That would be a boon for law enforcement  just lock up anyone who fit the profile. In this spirit, around 1860, working for, or in, cooperation with the police, Samuel G. Szabo produced Rogues, a Study of Characters, an album displayed here of more than 200 portraits, each labeled by the subjects name and his or her violation: shoplifter, wife poisoner, forger, pickpocket, murderer and counterfeiter, as if each were the archetypal personification of his or her crime.

Later in the century, the French criminologist Alphonse Bertillon laid the groundwork for todays police identification system. Bertillon instituted a method focused on measurements of certain body parts, precise descriptions and mug shots. Repeat offenders who had been previously entered into the files were thereby more readily identified, captured and convicted.

The exhibition includes a set of about 60 wallet-size mug shots of suspected anarchists from French police files of 1891-95 made by Bertillon or by technicians trained in his methods. One of these images led to the 1892 arrest of Ravachol, an anarchist bomber and career criminal. Another portrays the writer and art critic Felix Feneon, who was an ardent supporter of anarchist causes.

Scanning these today you may wonder how many of these were dangerous criminals; how many idealistic extremists; and how many innocents caught up in a widespread dragnet? Its impossible to say. Photographs, after all, tell you little about a persons inner nature. And yet its easy to think that they reveal much.

Consider Richard Avedons 1960 portrait of Richard Hickock, one of the perpetrators of the killings described in Truman Capotes In Cold Blood. A museum label observes, The mug shot-like portrait captures Hickocks sullen, lopsided face with mesmerizing clarity, as if searching for physiognomic clues to his criminal pathology. But what if the picture had been mistaken for a portrait of, say, a young Beat-era writer? Would he not then appear thoughtful rather than sullen? As for lopsided, arent most peoples faces slightly asymmetrical? Criminals, after all, generally dont look any different from law-abiders, which is one reason photographs of them are so arrestingly mysterious.

Especially disconcerting are those of young murderers. A 1934 picture by an unknown photographer portrays a 12-year-old farm boy named Freddy Scheiderer,who according to writing on the back of the print, shot two of his sisters August 13, one fatally, apparently as deliberate acts. The text further notes: He had never before shown any signs of dislike for the girls, or lack of mental balance. He is alert and friendly. With his all-American-boy visage, you could almost imagine him growing up to be a famous baseball player.

In Minority Report, the story by Philip K. Dick and the movie based on the novel, beings called precogs can foresee people committing murders, enabling police to arrest killers before they kill. As far as we know, such a system doesnt yet exist, but computerized biometric identification technologies like facial and gait recognition software have significantly advanced the Bertillon approach. An exhibition tracking the uses of technical images by crime stoppers from the early days of photography to now and into imaginary futures could be eminently illuminating.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-11 00:00:00,"Review: Mischa Berlinskis Peacekeeping, a Portrait of Haiti",['Dwight Garner'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Theres a Creole proverb, quoted in Peacekeeping, Mischa Berlinskis powerfully intelligent new novel, that declares, Theres no such thing as a natural death in Haiti.









Its an idea Mr. Berlinski picks up and with which he runs quite far. On the one hand, it underscores how rural Haitians often consider misfortune a variant on the same theme: grievance led to hatred, hatred to magic, magic to death.

On the other hand, and more important, the author suggests, the proverbs connotations are political. Theres nothing natural about Haitis bitter poverty and steep infant mortality rate. Cupidity and corruption perform, year after year, their reverse magic. The fiercest voodoo is economic.

Peacekeeping is a politically sophisticated novel that plants, like pushpins, a handful of memorable characters into Haitis arid soil. The most notable is Terry White (what a name), a middle-aged American who takes a job with the United Nations and who is indeed white. Hes sent to train Haitian police in Jeremie, a remote and impoverished town. Jeremie is only about 125 miles from Port-au-Prince, Haitis capital, but it feels like the end of the world. There are no real roads between the two places.

Terry is a former deputy sheriff in northern Florida, and a failed politician. With his wife, a perky real estate agent (Leave Kay alone on a desert island and shed make friends with a coconut, Terry says), he lost everything in the 2008 financial meltdown. Hes a complicated man and mostly a moral one.

Not everyone likes him: Hes vain and politically conservative and sometimes seems to practice competitive glowering. But hes a good person to have around when the shadows begin to move outside your compound, and he develops an abiding and often moving interest in justice of every human variety. We watch his mind bloom in something like real time.

Terry befriends a Haitian judge, Johel Celestin, a plump man with a little goatee. Johel is an American-educated reformer, seemingly the last honest man in Haitian politics. When Johel runs for office against a corrupt senator, his safety is far from assured. Terry looks after him. Terry also falls in love with Johels beautiful, younger wife. Shes a singer and a more disquieting figure than anyone is yet aware.

Plot matters in this book. As the election season moves along, the pages sometimes hurtle past like palm trees outside the window of a moving Humvee. But this books depths reside in Mr. Berlinskis rich portrait of a society, and his cool, probing writing about topics like sex, politics, journalism, race, class, agriculture, language and fear.

Photo

Theres some Graham Greene in the shifting moral ambiguities in Peacekeeping. Theres a bit of Joseph ONeills Netherland in its lonely sense of cultural dislocation. But the crisp, almost dispassionate tone is Mr. Berlinskis own.

The author became a student of Haitian society when he lived in that country from 2007 to 2011 with his wife, who worked for the United Nations peacekeeping mission there. A similar dynamic plays out in the novel. Some of this story is told from the perspective of a young writer in Haiti with his wife, a civilian United Nations employee.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Berlinskis first novel, Fieldwork (2007), had a similar expatriate milieu. It was about a young man who follows his girlfriend to the hill country of northern Thailand, where she takes a job. He begins to investigate the suicide of a brilliant American anthropologist. Fieldwork was a finalist, deservedly, for the National Book Awards.

Peacekeeping is animated by an interest in wealth and poverty. If you are a rich man in a poor country, Mr. Berlinski writes, you are a fat sheep in a land of wolves.

You are always alert, always watchful; the worst is always yet to come. You live on a small island where uncertain winds are blowing. A wealthy man arrives at middle age in Haiti stripped down to a tough, resilient, unsentimental core. The countrys next leader may wish to place a burning tire around your neck.

Rich and poor dispute, in this novel, the necessity of building a road to Port-au-Prince. Its the No. 1 campaign issue. The road wouldnt merely increase trade; it would be a path out; it would clear a lot of ghosts from the air.

Mr. Berlinski has a knack for writing short, sharp, surreal scenes. One unforgettable moment, impossible to explain here, involves a bowel movement left in the toilet of a political rival. Another moment, similarly impossible to distill, details the political significance of a widely shared joke about a lost goat.

This is close-up work. Peacekeeper also contains sweeping scenes of political revolt. One involves the body of a young martyr, forcibly taken from a morgue by an angry crowd. The multitudes soon sweep the body away to a rival politicians barbecue, however, because no funeral being evident, a lot of folks were thinking theyd like some pig.

A handful of love affairs oil this novels mechanisms. Mr. Berlinski writes as well about relationships as he does about everything else.

nytimes.com,2015-09-25 00:00:00,France Makes Bid to Buy Rembrandt Portrait,['Nina Siegal'],"AMSTERDAM  The French Culture Ministry has made a bid to purchase one of a highly coveted pair of Rembrandt portraits from Eric de Rothschild, offering 80 million euros, or about $90 million, for one of them.

The bid comes only three days after the Dutch government on Monday officially pledged 80 million to the effort to acquire both portraits from the French businessman for the Rijksmuseum here, for a total price of 160 million, tasking the museum with raising the other half.

In a statement released on Thursday, Fleur Pellerin, the French culture minister, described the move as part of joint efforts by France and the Netherlands to acquire the two works, one for the Louvre in Paris and one for the Rijksmuseum. She said funds would come from the exceptional patronage of the Bank of France, the countrys central bank.

Alexander Pechtold, who has led the effort to secure the paintings here and is a Dutch parliamentary leader with D66, one of the countrys progressive political parties, said that the Rijksmuseum already has an initial sales contract with Mr. de Rothschild for both portraits.

Im still confident that were heading in the right direction, Mr. Pechtold said in a phone interview. The seller wants to keep them together and made an arrangement with the Rijksmuseum, so thats the phase were in now.

The rare set of full-length portraits depict the newlyweds Marten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit. In the Netherlands, they are often referred to as the brother and sister of The Night Watch, Rembrandts 1642 large-scale masterpiece, which is a Dutch national icon.

We are following the developments with interest, said Taco Dibbits, director of collections for the Rijksmuseum, in a text message.

The pledges from the two governments could lead to a situation in which the portraits are sold separately, one going to the Rijksmuseum and the other most likely ending up in the Louvre. However, it is unclear whether Mr. de Rothschild is willing to separate the pair. His assistant, reached in Paris, said the owner would not comment at this time.

Mr. Pechtold said he hoped neither of the works would remain in France. Its Dutch heritage, he said. Its nice to see Rembrandts all over the world, but I prefer them in the Netherlands.",[]

WASHINGTON  Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, met with President Obama on Thursday for the first state visit by a Canadian leader in 19 years, a diplomatic honor made possible in part by new pledges of cooperation on combating climate change.









Mr. Obama and Mr. Trudeau announced Thursday morning new commitments to reduce planet-warming emissions of methane, a chemical contained in natural gas that is about 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide and that can leak from drilling wells and pipelines.

In a joint statement, the leaders promised that their two countries would  play a leadership role internationally in the low carbon global economy over the coming decades. As part of the announcement, United States officials said they would immediately begin a new push to regulate methane emissions from existing oil and gas facilities, though finishing that process before the end of Mr. Obamas tenure is unlikely.

Methane is upwards of 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide in warming the planet, said Gina McCarthy, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. It has become clear that it is time for the E.P.A. to take additional action to regulate existing sources in the oil and gas sector.

Mr. Obama and Mr. Trudeau also pledged new cooperation in preserving the Arctic and focusing on biodiversity, science-based decision-making, indigenous people and building a sustainable Arctic economy. The two nations also promised to accelerate the carrying out of agreements made in climate talks in Paris last year.

Both nations know we must care for the one planet we share, said Sally Jewell, the secretary of the interior in the United States. I appreciate Canadas strong leadership.

The climate announcements came before a day of ceremony that will conclude with a state dinner in the East Room of the White House. On the menu is Alaskan halibut casseroles, roasted apricot galette, baby lamb chops with Yukon Gold potato dauphinoise and a maple pecan cake with cocoa nib wafer and butterscotch swirl ice cream.

The arrival of Mr. Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau, has prompted comparisons to a similar visit in 1977 by Pierre Trudeau, a former prime minister and the current leaders father. That visit made headlines when Margaret Trudeau, the prime ministers wife, wore an above-the-knee dress to the White House state dinner.

While Canada and the United States have long been close allies, Mr. Obamas efforts to confront global warming had become a major point of contention with Mr. Trudeaus predecessor, Stephen Harper, who sought to aggressively expand Canadas oil industry.

As Mr. Obama became more determined to leave behind a lasting environmental legacy, he delayed and eventually rejected construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have transported nearly a million barrels a day of heavily polluting oil from Alberta to refineries on the Gulf Coast.

Mr. Obamas rejection of the pipeline severely strained relations with Mr. Harper.

But Mr. Trudeaus election last year signaled a shift in policy that was welcomed by the White House. Mr. Trudeau did not criticize Mr. Obamas rejection of the pipeline, and Mr. Trudeau has pledged to pursue an ambitious environmental agenda to coincide with Mr. Obamas policies.

In December, Canadian officials helped to push through a historic global climate agreement in Paris.

The climate relationship with Canada really just ramped up dramatically quickly, Todd Stern, Mr. Obamas special envoy for climate change, told reporters before Mr. Trudeaus arrival.

The two leaders will meet privately on Thursday to discuss military cooperation, efforts to combat terrorism, improvements in trade and environmental concerns.

Among the issues the two leaders will seek to resolve is a decades-old dispute over softwood lumber. American officials say lumber from Canada is unfairly subsidized by the government there, an assertion that Canadian officials reject.

Thats a longstanding and complicated issue, but we do welcome the Trudeaus government interest in discussing a new arrangement for softwood lumber, and were open to exploring all options with Canada to address this important trade issue, said Mark Feierstein, the senior director for the Western Hemisphere at the National Security Council.

But the most anticipated topic is the environment.

Prime Minister Trudeau is already showing serious, concrete commitment to accelerating progress on climate, Mr. Stern said. The commitment of both leaders to addressing this global challenge is clear. And I suspect under their leadership, North America will make significant progress this year and next.

The Obama administration wants to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 percent to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The Interior Department has proposed a number of regulations on methane leaks, but it has yet to write a regulation governing such leaks from current oil and gas drilling on public land.",[]

France and the Netherlands have agreed to jointly buy two Rembrandt portraits from the French executive Eric de Rothschild for 160 million euros, or $179 million, the culture ministries of both countries said on Wednesday.

Fleur Pellerin, the French minister and Jet Bussemaker, the Dutch minister, said the purchase was to designed to guarantee that both paintings stay on European soil, in the Netherlands and France. The paintings, dating from 1634, are wedding portraits of Marten Soolmans and his wife, Oopjen Coppit. They will go on public display for the first time after being in private collections for 400 years, officials said.

As part of an agreement between the governments, the works will go to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam first, probably before Christmas, said Job Slok, a spokesman for Ms. Bussemaker, and then to the Louvre in Paris.

The deal prevents a potential bidding war between the museums. Both countries last week had announced plans to pursue the portraits. It also marked the first time two European countries have joined forces to buy and share artworks, according to Taco Dibbits, the director of collections for the Rijksmuseum. The museums are splitting the purchase price.

A condition of the sale by Mr. de Rothschild was that the works should remain a couple, Mr. Dibbits said. They were painted together and have been in a happy marriage for 400 years, so were pleased to be able to keep them together, he added.",[]

The 17th-century paintings, which belong to the Rothschild banking family and have rarely been seen in public, will alternate between the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and the Louvre in Paris, Jet Bussemaker said in a letter to the Dutch parliament.

We believe these two rare portraits should always be allowed to be admired together, alternately between the Rijksmuseum and the Louvre, so they are accessible to the broader public, both young and old, she said, adding that the deal was cemented by Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, and the French president, Francois Hollande, at the United Nations this week.

The two full-length portraits of a young couple  Portrait of Marten Soolmans and Portrait of Oopjen Coppit  were painted by the Dutch master to mark their wedding in 1634. Wrangling over the future of the paintings had threatened to sour relations between the two European allies.

Bussemaker on Friday said the Dutch government was willing to stump up half the 160m price tag, with the remaining 80m to be found by the Rijksmuseum.

But her French counterpart, Fleur Pellerin, had said the day before that Paris had submitted an offer to acquire one of the portraits for the Louvre, and that the paintings would alternate between the two museums.

After intensive discussions with Paris over the last few days, the Dutch cabinet decided to agree with France to share the costs given our combined interests, Bussemaker said.

The sales finer details  including insurance, responsibility for restoration and how the portraits are to be exhibited  still need to be worked out, Bussemaker said.

The marital portraits of Maerten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit are believed to be in the collection of French banker Eric de Rothschild.

The affluent Dutch couple had themselves individually painted in fine detail by Rembrandt in Amsterdam and through the years the two paintings have always been treated as a single unit, media reports said.

Dressed in black, which was highly fashionable at the time, Soolmans is depicted holding a glove in his left hand, while Coppit holds an ostrich feather fan and wears a four-row pearl necklace among other expensive jewellery.

The artnet website said the paintings have been viewed publicly only once in the past 150 years, and Bussemaker has already stressed the importance of finally putting them on public display.

According to the Dutch daily paper NRC, the paintings were reportedly sold to the Rothschilds in 1877 for 1.5m guilders, despite attempts by the Dutch government at the time to keep them in the Netherlands. The Rothschild family in 2013 first indicated it wanted to sell the paintings, NRC added.

The director of the Rijksmuseum, Wim Pijbes, told Dutch Radio 1 he was satisfied with the deal to share the portraits with the Louvre.

A few months ago it still seemed unthinkable. But now two beautiful portraits will be together in the public domain, in two museums of world fame, Pijbes said.

He added it was a new concept in the museum world for two countries to work together to obtain works from a private collection.

Pijbes said each country would own half of each of the two paintings, which were like a pair of shoes, never to be separated.",[]

PARIS  Two rarely seen Rembrandt wedding portraits made their public debut in Paris on Thursday at the Louvre, the start of a permanent rotation of the works between the Netherlands and France, which jointly purchased them last year for 160 million euros, or about $179 million.

Among the first to view the works were President Francois Hollande of France and King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, who studied the two enormous paintings at a presentation ceremony, along with the directors of the Louvre and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

The works, full-length portraits of Marten Soolmans and his wife, Oopjen Coppit, dating from 1634, have only been displayed once in public, in Amsterdam in 1956. Since 1877, they have been part of the private collection of the Rothschild family, which kept them in their Paris mansion, according to Sebastien Allard, the director of the Louvres department of paintings.

According to the agreement between the two governments, the works will remain in the Louvre for three months, until June 13, and will then shift to Amsterdam for three months before an undetermined period of restoration to smooth their varnish. The two portraits will then move for five-year rotations between Amsterdam and Paris, followed by eight-year rotations.

The accord prevented a bidding war between the two countries, with France drawing on financial support from the national Banque de France to make the costliest acquisition in the history of the Louvre. The two countries have set up a commission of eight experts to act as consultants during the restoration.

Here you see the power of Rembrandt, Wim Pijbes, the director of the Rijksmuseum, said during the presentation, noting that the melancholy portrait of Oopjen Coppit in a sumptuous black dress and white lace was sometimes referred to as the Mona Lisa of the North.

OAKLAND, Calif.  A few years ago, back when he was working as a television analyst, Steve Kerr spent some time before a game catching up with Chris Bosh.









At the time, Bosh was in the midst of four straight appearances in the N.B.A. finals with the Miami Heat, a stretch that had turned the teams most benign games into charged events. Bosh told Kerr that the experience had given him an appreciation for what Kerr and his former teammates had done during their trophy-collecting run with the Chicago Bulls.

When you do it year after year, every game is such a big game, said Kerr, now in his second season as coach of the Golden State Warriors. The wear and tear emotionally of having to get up for games  its all a part of it, but its a privilege. Its way better than the alternative.

About an hour after Kerr shared this story, his players took the floor at Oracle Arena for the 63rd game of their season, against the Utah Jazz. The Warriors were coming off a baffling loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday and a disjointed win against the Orlando Magic on Monday, and Kerr was eager to see them smooth some of their rough edges.

With few exceptions, the Warriors have been strangers to adversity this season, and maybe their greatest danger at this late stage is settling into a slumber ahead of the playoffs. They have made something difficult  the grind of 82 games against other highly paid professionals  look effortless. But Kerr has noticed the slow leak of some bad habits.

Continue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.

They were on display, for at least a couple of minutes, against the Jazz. The Warriors committed turnovers on two of their first three possessions before Stephen Curry punctuated the fourth by tossing a behind-the-back pass to Draymond Green for a fast-break dunk.

The entire sequence typified much of Golden States play in recent days  a mix of the sloppy and the sublime. Kerr would prefer to keep things more basic.

Its tricky, and its something we talk about quite a bit, said Kerr, whose team went on to win, 115-94. We have a great home crowd here, and we have guys who want to put on a show, and they should. Thats a big part of what makes it fun. What Im trying to convince them of is, the simple leads to the spectacular.

He added, If they make three or four passes, just moving on and moving on and moving on because the guy is open, that usually leads to the lob dunk, or the open 3 that brings the house down. When you force the issue and try to create the spectacular early in the possession, its usually a turnover.

These are all relative criticisms, of course. The Warriors are 57-6. They break records, or at least approach them, on a regular basis. On Monday, they set a league record by winning their 45th straight game at home. On Wednesday, they nudged the mark to 46 by obliterating an opponent that is probably bound for the playoffs.

Who can stop these guys? Perhaps only themselves, and that is what Kerr appears to guard against most. The usual standards do not apply to this team. Judging the Warriors level of play based solely on wins and losses is useless. They are too talented, too cohesive. So Kerr sifts through the small stuff to make a larger point.

Were trying to make sure that our habits are good, because those carry over, he said. If you dont box out with 10 games left in the season, youre not going to box out in the finals. Might cost you a game. Might cost you a championship.

He was much more pleased with their effort against the Jazz. The Warriors collected 36 assists on 48 field goals. They shot 57.1 percent from the field. Klay Thompson made five 3-pointers. The teams reserves scored 53 points. And Curry banked in a 55-footer to close the first half. Yawn.

Thats not a surprise anymore, Green said.

Above all, the Warriors cut down on their mistakes. After committing 20 turnovers against the Lakers and 24 against the Magic, Golden State had 15 against the Jazz  six of them in the fourth quarter with the game having turned into a blowout and most of the starters sitting on the bench.

I told the guys after the game, That looks more like us,  Kerr said. Thats the best game weve played in a while because of the balance, because of the ball movement and the shot distribution.

Believe it or not, the Warriors will endure more lapses this season. They may even lose again. Kerr acknowledged that his motivational messages to the team carried more weight last season, back when he was among the few people in the organization with a championship pedigree. Now, most of his players have rings of their own.

So he has to be creative, he said, and find new ways to push and prod. The challenge continues for a team that is not perfect, despite the way it looks.",[]

The more hours you work, the greater your risk for heart disease.

Several observational studies have found an association of long work hours with an increased risk for cardiovascular illness. Now a new retrospective analysis has found there is a dose-response relationship: more hours, more risk.

Researchers began following 1,926 men and women in 1986, tracking their health and work history through 2011. Over the course of the study, in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 822 were given diagnoses of cardiovascular disease.

After adjusting for age, sex, income and other factors, they found that for each additional hour of work per week over 10 years, there was a 1 percent increase in the risk for heart disease.

Compared with working 45 hours a week, working 55 hours increased the risk by 16 percent, 60 hours by 35 percent, 65 hours by 52 percent, and 70 hours by 74 percent. Working 75 hours or more doubled the risk for a cardiovascular problem  angina, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke or heart attack.

Still, the lead author, Sadie H. Conway, an assistant professor at the University of Texas School of Public Health, does not recommend that anyone alter work hours based on her study.

Four years ago, when I began working on a book about the secrets of productivity, I had a hidden motivation: I wanted to figure out how to eat dinner with my kids.

Both my wife and I had demanding jobs. We have two sons  now 7 and 4  and knew it was important to eat dinner together. But it proved consistently impossible for us all to sit down at the same time. Every morning, we would announce our intentions of leaving work early enough to dine as a family. But one thing would lead to another, we would get delayed at the office, and then the babysitter would call to say that the children were starving and so we would tell her to appease them with snacks. Most parents know where this leads: Kids all hopped up on Pirates Booty, parents guiltily sipping wine while re-heating leftovers, full of self-recriminations and promises that next week, things will be different. Until, that is, next week rolls around and the same thing happens again.

Talk to Us Do you have a family problem that the Five Whys strategy could help solve? Please send them to us. Well choose some to highlight in the coming weeks.

So, when I began interviewing exceptionally productive companies and people for my book, Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business, I often asked them to help me solve our familys woes. I eventually found a solution in the most unlikely of places  an old car factory  and a method known as the Five Whys.

In the 1980s, the Japanese car manufacturer Toyota opened its first American plant in Freemont, Calif. The factory was guided by a management philosophy known as the Toyota Production System, which at its core holds that even the most complex problems have simple causes  if you know how to look for them.

For us, the Five Whys worked in a fairly straightforward manner. We began by identifying a problem: We never managed to have family dinner. Then we explored, at the most surface level, why that was true: Because my wife and I always got home later than we expected.

Then came another question: Why were we getting home so late? The answer was that, although we intended to leave the office by 5, we often found it impossible to walk away from our desks because there were so many miscellaneous tasks we had ignored during the day.

That prompted the third question: Why had we ignored all those tasks? Well, inevitably, we arrived at work each morning just as our first meetings were starting, and so rather than deal with unread memos and emails, we put them aside until later in the day  and then, when we finally got to them, there were new memos and emails that demanded our attention.

The fourth question: Why were we arriving at work right before our first meetings, rather than earlier in the day? Because although we always intended to leave the house at 8 and get the kids to school, we usually ran late, and didnt get out the door until 8:20 or so.

And, finally, why were we leaving the house later than we planned? Because it took so long to get the kids dressed in the morning that we always left later than we expected.

We had started by identifying a problem  we never managed to have family dinner  and by using the Five Whys found a root cause: Our kids were taking too long to get dressed in the morning. Before conducting this exercise, I had never suspected that there was a connection between our morning routines and our evening mealtimes. But once we forced ourselves to ask why after why, it was clear what needed to change. If we could convince our kids to get dressed earlier, we could make it out the door faster, and in turn would have time at our desks to deal with emails and memos before the day started getting crazy, and then we would be able to leave work earlier, and make it home in time to have dinner together. So we instituted a new family rule: Now, each night before going to bed, our kids lay out their clothes for the next day, and then they get dressed as soon as they wake up.

Researchers have found that this method of looking for root causes works in dozens of settings. The Toyota Production System is arguably the most important invention in operations since Henry Fords Model T began rolling off the production line, the Harvard Business Review observed in 2011. The Five Whys is a process of continually asking questions until you get to the root cause, and getting closer and closer to a problem until you understand whats really going on. The Five Whys method has helped managers eliminate waste, aided executives in figuring out what projects to pursue and which to discard, helped children understand how to analyze problems and find solutions and assisted teachers in creating environments where even underperforming students can succeed.

At the center of the Five Whys  and the reason its so effective  is a basic insight: Productivity means different things to different people, but at its core, its about thinking a little more deeply about the choices we make every day. For my book, I interviewed neurologists and executives, as well as the filmmakers behind Frozen and teachers who transformed the Cincinnati school system, and found each of them echoing this idea. Productivity isnt about running faster or pushing yourself harder, but rather, about working smarter and paying a bit more attention to what is really going on.

Nowadays, our kids are dressed every morning by 7:30. They choose their outfits the night before, and weve made a game of laying out their clothes before they fall asleep. Its a small shift in how we get things done, but the impact has been profound: Mornings are calmer, were out the door more promptly, we get home from work earlier and we usually have dinner as a family at least three times a week. Applying business strategies cant solve every problem in every family, and productivity isnt every familys goal, but understanding how to analyze problems by drilling down to their roots can go a long way toward making life easier.

And in my house, learning to make small adjustments in our routines is delivering big returns. Parenting will never be considered a purely productive activity  but its getting easier, and better, every day.

Do you have a family problem that the Five Whys strategy could help solve? Please send them to us. KJ DellAntonia and Charles Duhigg will highlight some of these problems, and solutions, in the weeks ahead.

Trumps blistering critique of American trade policy boils down to a simple equation: Foreigners are killing us on trade because Americans spend much more on imports than the rest of the world spends on American exports. Chinas unbalanced trade with the United States, he said Tuesday night, is the greatest theft in the history of the world.









Add a few whereins and whences and that sentiment would conform nicely to the worldview of the first Queen Elizabeth of 16th-century England, to the 17th-century court of Louis XIV, or to Prussias Iron Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, in the 19th century. The great powers of bygone centuries subscribed to the economic theory of mercantilism, Wherein we must ever observe this rule: to sell more to strangers yearly than we consume of theirs in value, as its apostle, the East India Company director Thomas Mun, wrote in the 1600s.

Now Mr. Trump is bringing mercantilism back. The New York billionaire is challenging the last 200 years of economic orthodoxy that trade among nations is good, and that more is better.

He is well on his way to becoming the first Republican nominee in nearly a century who has called for higher tariffs, or import taxes, as a broad defense against low-cost imports. And there is a good chance he would face a Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who has expressed fewer reservations about trade, inverting a longstanding political dynamic.

Among Republican standard-bearers, Theres nobody since Hoover who talked this way about trade, said I.M. Destler, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland and the author of American Trade Politics, a history. For most of the last century, Mr. Destler said, such skepticism about trade had been relegated to the fringes of the Republican Party.

Mr. Trumps mercantilism is among his oldest and steadiest public positions. Since at least the 1980s, he has described trade as a zero-sum game in which countries lose by paying for imports. The trade deficit with China, which reached $366 billion last year, makes America the biggest loser. Our trade deficit with China is like having a business that continues to lose money every single year, Mr. Trump told The New York Daily News in August. Who would do business like that?

During the current campaign he has regularly advocated tariffs as the best solution.

He has promised to penalize American companies that build foreign factories. For months his favored example was Ford, which announced plans last summer to expand in Mexico. More recently he has called out Carrier, which is shifting air-conditioner production from Indiana to Mexico.

I will call the head of Carrier and I will say, I hope you enjoy your new building, Mr. Trump said last month. I hope you enjoy Mexico. Heres the story, folks: Every single air-conditioning unit that you build and send across our border  youre going to pay a 35 percent tax on that unit.

In January, Mr. Trump proposed a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports during a meeting with The New York Times editorial board. I would tax China on products coming in, he said. I would do a tariff, yes.

Economists have long struggled against the popular view that exports are a measure of economic vitality while imports are evidence of regrettable dependence.

They argue that the opposite is true.

Economists have spoken with almost one voice for some 200 years, the famous economist Milton Friedman said in a 1978 speech. The gain from foreign trade is what we import. What we export is the cost of getting those imports. And the proper objective for a nation, as Adam Smith put it, is to arrange things so we get as large a volume of imports as possible for as small a volume of exports as possible.

But critiques like Mr. Trumps resonate in part because economists have oversold their case. Trade has a downside and, while the benefits of trade are broadly distributed, the costs are often concentrated. Everyone can buy a cheaper air-conditioner when Carrier disembarks for a lower-cost country, but a few hundred people will lose their livelihoods.

Pietra Rivoli, a finance professor at Georgetown University who explored the impact of increased globalization in her 2005 book, The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy, said Mr. Trump may be finding a receptive audience in part because the United States has provided relatively little help to workers harmed by trade.

You have much more negative sentiment about trade in the U.S. than you do in pretty much any other wealthy country, and theyve lost their T-shirt jobs, too, Ms. Rivoli said. Whats going on there is that in those countries  which are even more exposed to trade than we are  those countries have a bigger safety net.

Mr. Trump has also accused other nations, notably Japan and China, of cheating by suppressing the value of their currencies to make their exports cheaper.

I am all for free trade, but its got to be fair, Mr. Trump has said repeatedly.

Economists persuaded governments to abandon mercantilism by demonstrating that trade barriers impose higher prices on the masses while narrowly benefiting those sheltered from competition. The United States largely dismantled its broad tariffs in the mid-20th century, opening the modern era of globalization. But some tariffs remain, providing a reminder of the costs and benefits.

Annual imports of Chinese tires increased to 46 million in 2008 from 15 million in 2004, and American tire makers shed several thousands of jobs. So the Obama administration, at the urging of workers unions, in 2009 imposed a Trump-like tariff beginning at 35 percent and expiring after three years.

Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires, President Obama said in his 2012 State of the Union address.

The measure, however, also increased the amount that Americans spent on tires by about $1.1 billion, according to calculations by Gary Clyde Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. That money, had it been spent on other things, would have supported jobs in other parts of the economy.

China, moreover, retaliated by slapping a punitive tariff on American chicken parts  China is a particularly lucrative market for chicken feet  which cost American poultry exporters about $1 billion in lost sales over the same period.

Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist, said Mr. Trump is raising legitimate concerns. Other nations do impose disproportionate restrictions on American goods, he said. The problem, Mr. Prasad said, is the proposed solution.

It might be that the threat of tariffs or other trade sanctions could cause American trading partners to open up their markets or drop their barriers to trade, Mr. Prasad said. Perhaps as a bargaining chip its not necessarily so bad. But there is a risk that rather than having that positive effect it leads to retaliation on both sides.",[]

What once was free on airlines now often translates to fees.









An aisle or window seat can cost extra. Bag fees come in at least six varieties. Even airline-issued pillows and blankets have a price tag on some carriers.

While it has done wonders for the airlines bottom line, the fee frenzy has now reached ridiculous levels, in the view of some members of Congress.

On Wednesday, legislators introduced a bill that would limit airline fees for checked bags, ticket changes and cancellations, saying the practice amounts to a form of price gouging.

Backed by several consumer organizations, the bill, called the Forbidding Airlines from Imposing Ridiculous Fees Act, or FAIR Fees Act, follows an attempt to set minimum standards for seat size on commercial airlines.

Chances of the bills passing, either on their own or as part of the major Federal Aviation Administration funding bill currently being discussed, may be slim. But the sudden activity is a sign that legislators are heeding the publics disaffection with the ever expanding list of fees.

American and Delta have a $200 ticket change fee. United charges up to $150 for unaccompanied minors.

There are fees for pillows (JetBlue and Virgin America), fees for carry-on bags (Frontier and Spirit), fees for booking on the phone (Alaska, American and pretty much everyone else), fees to select seats (Southwest and Frontier), and fees for perks like priority boarding, window or aisle seats, or picking exit-row seats with a little more legroom.

According to government statistics, bag fees collected by airlines amounted to $2.85 billion in the first three quarters of 2015. While the figure for the last quarter is not yet available, the total for the year will certainly exceed 2014s haul of $3.5 billion and is up from the $464 million the airlines collected in 2007.

The airlines also netted $2.3 billion from change and cancellation fees in the first nine months of last year.

An investigation by the Democratic staff of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee found that three carriers increased checked baggage fees by 67 percent from 2009 to 2014.",[]

That elusive mix came to Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday: a real musical event that drew a packed house and a young audience  and even Bjork. Listening was close, the excitement palpable and the applause spontaneous.









Thomas Ades was in town.

This British polymath has become a major musical figure, lauded for his operas Powder Her Face and The Tempest, which was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in 2012. For his debut on the New York Philharmonics podium, he led characterful, often madcap accounts of Beethovens First Symphony and Berliozs overture to Les Francs-juges.

But the real draw was the American premiere of Mr. Adess own Totentanz (2013), a grisly symphony-cantata for two singers and a vast orchestra that is his longest, most ambitious and most astounding orchestral composition yet. Despite an imprecise performance here, its clear that with Totentanz, this composer takes a dizzying leap beyond his finest earlier scores  Asyla (1997) and Tevot (2007)  and adds to a lineage of musical death-dances, including those of Liszt and Saint-Saens.

Dedicated to the memory of the composer Witold Lutoslawski, Totentanz was inspired by a frieze painted by Bernt Notke. Dating from 1463 and later copied, it was destroyed in a British bombing raid on Lubeck, Germany, in 1942. It portrays a skeleton skipping through the population, from the pope and an emperor, down to a handworker, a peasant and, most horribly, a baby. Theres a hierarchy on earth, it suggests, but in the face of mortality, everyone is equal.

Of course, Death always survives. Mr. Ades personifies him in a baritone (here, the malevolent Mark Stone, replacing Simon Keenlyside, who withdrew because of illness) and has him sing with a mezzo-soprano (Christianne Stotijn, in magnificent voice) who represents humanity in all its variety. With that basic framework, Mr. Ades takes some of the characters from the Lubeck frieze and weaves a tapestry of 15 portraits.

All the souls are linked by a common fate, but each is wonderfully distinct. A cardinal, for instance, is introduced by a disturbed hymn tune in the flutes; the King gets a rumbling fanfare on the low brass, as if from hell; and the Knight struts in armor evoked by anvils. Frenzied dance rhythms underpin everything, recalling the trippy, influential Ecstasio from Asyla.

Mr. Ades makes his sympathies clear. The bourgeois  a doctor, a merchant, a usurer  are his main target, their music rootless, full of inane little scales that crescendo to deafening, unconducted carnage that implodes into deserved nothingness. But when Death must woo the Maiden, the composer conjures an alluring dreamscape of harps, strings and vibraphones. More tender still is the Straussian duet Mr. Ades reserves for Death and the Child, who dance in a spectral lullaby.

With Totentanz, Mr. Ades is pictorial but always primarily musical in his effects, deploying an enormous percussion section that whistles and rattles, ratchets and whips, even clatters with the sound of bones (wood blocks here, but the score allows for animal bones, too). Like many of his pieces, this one extends the mischievous logic of Berlioz and has a flashy sound world that bridges neo-Romanticism and modernism.

And while Mr. Adess sound is now completely his own, for Totentanz he seems to summon a communion of composers past. The ascetic Monk, for instance, is sent away with the music of high society, a soured Johann Strauss waltz. The Peasant is called by a little horn motif, a classic trait of German Romanticism. Even the Child dies to strains that recall Mahlers Kindertotenlieder, before the reaper clacks off into the distance, Death and humanity chanting tanzen (to dance), on the search for more victims.",[]

Many New Yorkers know at least something about Eli Zabar. They can probably guess that his family opened the Upper West Side emporium that stands for classic New York eating. They may know that he left that business decades ago to open his own store on the Upper East Side, E.A.T., followed by Elis at the Vinegar Factory, and that his markets and takeout shops now dominate the neighborhood above 79th Street.









They can assume that Elis Bread, sold in restaurants and shops all over New York, comes from his bakeries. They may even be aware of Mr. Zabars reputation for treating his customers arrogantly and charging high prices.

Not so many know that Mr. Zabar is a longtime wine lover, with an extraordinary collection of Burgundy and a deep interest in Barolo, Barbaresco and the northern Rhone. Mr. Zabar owns an excellent under-the-radar, typically quirky wine shop on the Upper East Side called Elis List, right next door to his restaurant Elis Table, which offers a terrific wine list with many bottles 10 to 25 years old.

Photo

Many people would be astonished to find great values on this list, and not just in expensive bottles. And they may be pleased to know that a branch of Elis Essentials, his takeout shop and cafe at Madison Avenue and 91st Street, turns into a charming wine bar after 5 p.m.

Mr. Zabar said he never intended to go into the wine business. He opened his wine shop in 2002, he said, as a convenience to his wine-drinking customers at Elis Market on Third Avenue, so he could offer one-stop shopping.

That was, he now concedes, a rationalization for doing what he wanted: to accumulate a lot of wine.

It was antithetical to the rest of my businesses, which are based on buying fresh and selling fast, he said at the wine shop, preternaturally blue eyes peering over the top of his glasses. Youre not going to save a carrot for two months.

Mr. Zabar, 72, exudes the nervous energy of a teenager. Words tumble out on top of one another, disparate thoughts that, in his eagerness to discuss wine, can seem at first to lack an organizing principle, until they finally align and fall into place. One dress shirt is not enough; he wears two at once, with khakis and a down vest.

The layers come in handy in the cramped, mazelike wine cellar under Elis Market, where, stacked at a cool 55 degrees, lie cases upon cases of bottles that would stir the imagination of any Burgundy lover.

Sure, he has some superstar names: Roumier of Chambolle-Musigny and Rousseau of Gevrey-Chambertin among the reds; Raveneau of Chablis, Roulot of Meursault and Leflaive of Puligny-Montrachet among the whites.

But even more evident is his exquisite taste. His cellar is replete with the work of producers who have not been sanctified as superstars and are not known for their grand crus, but who simply make beautiful, expressive wines whatever their terroirs. These include names like Domaine Arlaud Pere et Fils, Domaine Trapet, Alain Burguet, Sylvain Cathiard, Mugneret-Gibourg, Denis Bachelet and Michel Lafarge.

These are not trophy wines, Mr. Zabar said. Thats not my point of view.

This cellar is practically all Burgundy, except for some Champagne. Mr. Zabar has another cellar for his Rhones and Barolos under Elis Night Shift on East 79th Street, a grab-and-go store that turns into a beer bar by night, run by his son Oliver.

As a young merchant setting out in the 1970s, Mr. Zabar said, he allowed his imperiousness to define his business. He was obsessive about the quality of every piece of cheese and each bottle of oil. He learned to cook and bake so that all the prepared foods he sold were made either by his own hand or from his recipes.

I only sold what I liked, and if you were offended, too bad, he said. I was offensive to many customers. I cant even believe some of the things I said.

He has mellowed somewhat. He cant quite exert the control he desires over his markets, except in his wine shop. Ive gotten away from that; it didnt work in groceries, he said. But this wine store is a continuation of that attitude.

Indeed, he sells only wines he likes. He does not stock Bordeaux.

Ive never liked Bordeaux  I never liked the cabernet grape, he said. He said he doesnt know enough about German wines to sell them, and carries wine from only one American producer, Hermann J. Wiemer of the Finger Lakes, because he loves the riesling.

His attachment to Burgundy, though, runs deep. He sees in the Burgundian vignerons the same obsessive concern with craft and quality that he felt as a young man. There was a part of me in each bread, each chicken salad I sold, he said. In Burgundy, they are invested in a way only somebody who works with their hands can be.

Though he knows what he likes, Mr. Zabar does not pretend to be a wine connoisseur. He often defers to his associates: Randall Restiano, his wine director, who handles buying wine for the restaurant and shop, and Jean-Emmanuel Simond, a wine importer and consultant in Paris, whom Mr. Zabar credits with a pivotal role in developing his taste.

Every autumn since 2002, Mr. Zabar has traveled to Burgundy and the Piedmont with Mr. Simond, visiting producers and tasting obsessively. A longtime pilot, he flies his own jet, a Cessna Citation CJ4, to Europe and then meets up with a small group that currently includes Mr. Simond; Mr. Restiano; Dan Feldman, the sales director at the importer Skurnik Wines; and Johanne Killeen, a chef and owner at Al Forno in Providence, R.I., whom Mr. Zabar calls my wine wife. He also tries to visit a new wine region each year with Mr. Simond.

Eli is now being perceived by most top producers we visit not just as a collector, but as someone genuinely passionate, curious to learn every detail about their work and also their lives, Mr. Simond wrote in an email. And as someone who is doing something that very few people are still trying to achieve today in the wine world, aging the wines in his cellar for sometimes more than a decade before releasing them.

Aging wine properly is an obsession for Mr. Zabar. Its one of the reasons he stocks few grand cru Burgundies in his shop, because they need too much time. I want to sell village wines, he said. Others need time, and most people arent going to age them.

The grand crus remain in his cellar until he feels they are ready for his restaurant list, often to be snapped up by the Burgundy lovers who monitor his offerings.

Mr. Zabar came by his obsession with Burgundy in the early 1970s, when he owned a sandwich shop on Nantucket. After a summer season, he took a trip to France, with visits set up by a family friend, Michael Aaron, the proprietor at the time of the Sherry-Lehmann wine shop. He stopped in to see Louis Latour, the head of a venerable negociant house, who took him to a restaurant, Mr. Zabar recalled, redolent of truffles and veal stock.

Photo

Ive always responded to smells, he said. I thought, This is the only place I want to be.

And so it was with the wine. I found Burgundy so difficult, so curious, he said, and I loved the smells.

Back in New York, he worked part time at Morrell & Company, a wine shop where another employee introduced him to his personal collection of grand cru Burgundies and impressed upon him the importance of proper aging.

Mr. Zabar began to acquire a lot of wine but said he didnt start buying in earnest until 2002, when he opened the store and knew that he eventually wanted to open a restaurant. He buys directly from importers, and never from auctions.

Despite his reputation for charging top dollar, the prices on his restaurant list are eminently reasonable, and sometimes steals.

Im making a living in the food business, he said. I didnt make the wine. It doesnt have the same value to me as the food we make. I think margins on wine should be reasonable. Well make the money on the food we sell.

Mr. Zabar offers an ample supply of less expensive wines on his list, often hard-to-find bottles from the Loire and the Jura. And he sticks to his ideals: no wines from Bordeaux, Germany or the United States, not even the Wiemer.

Philosophy gets beaten up by reality, he said. But Im going to do what I want, and there are enough people out there who will appreciate it.

Thomas Ades almost broke up the Punch Brothers. I wanted to be him, Chris Thile, the frontman of that progressive bluegrass band, recently recalled of his first encounter with the surreal music Mr. Ades composed. I was wondering if I should go back to the drawing board: put everything on hold for five years and figure out a way to do something more like that.









Mr. Thile ultimately kept the band together  and wrote a mandolin concerto to release some bottled-up creativity  but the experience had lasting repercussions.

At 43, Mr. Ades (pronounced ADD-iss) is youthful by classical musics standards, though it has been more than two decades since he was first hailed as Britains compositional messiah. And despite his young age, he commands a devoted if unexplored following among even younger American composers, as they disclosed in recent interviews. Hes unlocked some sort of secretive, complicated rhythm, wherein your body is moved even if your mind is titillated, Mr. Thile said.

That has deeply informed the Punch Brothers sound, including that on the bands newest album, The Phosphorescent Blues. The boys and I have listened to a ton of Ades, Mr. Thile added. Particularly in the polyrhythmic department  thats absolutely affected what Punch Brothers is up to these days.

The composer Andrew Norman voiced similar enthusiasm for Mr. Adess oeuvre. Theres something about his music that is particularly, so vividly imagined that people love stealing from it, myself included, he said. On Feb. 22, the Calder Quartet will juxtapose Mr. Normans Sabina and Mr. Adess Arcadiana in a concert sponsored by Carnegie Hall at the Brooklyn Public Librarys Central Library.

Andrew really looks up to and respects Ades, said a violinist for the Calder, Andrew Bulbrook.

That fervor is pervasive among Mr. Thile and Mr. Normans generation. Composers are a catty bunch, said the composer Timo Andres. That Ades is pretty widely adored, at least among my peers, says something.

Minimalism and pop are often cited as the foremost influences on this countrys eclectic younger composers. But Mr. Ades, with his strong commitment to both classical tradition and the avant-garde, complicates that narrative. Teasing out his place in American music reveals much about how todays composers absorb influence and forge a dialogue with one another. Mr. Adess trans-Atlantic reach might hark back to the role Stravinsky once played in reshaping American music. But unlike that of Stravinsky (and his American acolytes), the impact of Mr. Ades has been felt across multiple aesthetics and even genres.

Photo

For many musicians, his 1997 composition Asyla represents a singular fount of inspiration. A compressed symphonic masterwork, Asyla was the culmination of Mr. Adess omnivorous early style, and its 1999 recording entranced Mr. Norman and his college classmates. We would just listen to that thing over and over again and discuss it  a lot of us stole quite liberally from it, he said.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Others attested to the persuasive grip of Asyla. There was this moment where the third movement of Asyla circulated in the new-music community almost like a hit single, the composer Gabriel Kahane said. That movement, Ecstasio, masses swirling orchestral forces to summon the druggy techno of a London nightclub. Mr. Kahane cited the irregular rhythms of his pop song Haircuts & Airports as indebted to Mr. Ades.

The composer Ted Hearne recalled a fervent debate among friends over the best new orchestral music: I remember them being like: Its Asyla, Ted! Its Asyla! 

Photo

Christopher Cerrone described microscopic details he filched from Mr. Ades for his opera Invisible Cities, a finalist for the 2014 Pulitzer Prize in Music. Asyla acted as a textbook for unconventional but effective instrumental writing, he said: A huge percussion battery? Its in there. A quarter-tone piano? Its in there. Weird, bass oboe solo? Its in there. When Mr. Ades attended a performance of Invisible Cities, Mr. Cerrone said, I walked up to him  there was a scene with almglocken and quarter-tone harp  and I was like, I stole this from you. 

Mr. Ades offers a model for composers who want to write music which is not necessarily Minimalist and what is not necessarily avant-garde, Mr. Cerrone added.

Mr. Norman echoed that sentiment. His music is riding a line between a Romantic sensibility and a more modern one, he said, and that is definitely something that I do. That tension is palpable in Mr. Normans Play, a sprawling work recently recorded by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project, in which dense extended techniques undergird a dizzyingly hyper-Romantic vocabulary  an Asyla for the 21st century. Caroline Shaw, whose polyglot Partita won the Pulitzer in 2013, drew parallels between Mr. Normans music and that of Mr. Ades. It feels organized and detailed and precisely engineered, and imaginative, with funny and profound surprises, she said.

Photo

Ms. Shaw was particularly inspired by Mr. Adess attraction to the modest harpsichord works of Couperin, which he has recomposed for orchestra. Being the giant of modern music that he is, she explained, it gave me permission to love some of the music that I love and to do some of the things that I do.

Mr. Andres likened Mr. Adess aesthetic to that of Gyorgy Ligeti: Theres the sense of the overarching, he said. Over all the obsessive detail  and the cool flashy orchestrations and all that stuff  is the sense of this huge object being mobilized in time.

Mr. Andress 2012 Piano Quintet mirrors Mr. Adess own Quintet, refracting Schumann into exquisite miniatures. A culinary enthusiast, Mr. Andres compared his own assimilation of influences to a sieve: When it first comes in, there are big granules sticking out, and you can really tell what the thing is. And then over time, it filters into the lower substrate of my language and its still there  just as much  you just cant hear it on the surface. Its not in big, identifiable clumps.

Sharing this syntax bonds these younger composers, who borrow as much from one another as they do from Mr. Ades. Mr. Cerrone, Mr. Norman, Mr. Hearne and Mr. Andres belong to the collective Sleeping Giant, which has created a reimagining of the Mozart Requiem that will have its premiere with the Albany Symphony in March.

Im influenced by music by my peers all the time; I try to steal from it as much as possible, Mr. Cerrone said. That interchange is manifest in Mr. Hearnes Law of Mosaics, a virtuosic pastiche recorded by the string orchestra A Far Cry. Law of Mosaics chops up and furiously reassembles pre-existing music by Mr. Norman as well as Barber, Vivaldi and Mr. Ades.

Its not hearing Ades, Mr. Hearne said. But it might be hearing Beethoven, or it might be hearing the bygone world of classical music.

Photo

For Mr. Kahane, the history of all art can also be expressed as a conversation between members of a community who are all stealing from each other.

Whats so beautiful about Law of Mosaics, he said, is that it really just makes that conversation  which I think has always been part of how weve evolved artistically  front and center.

Though Mr. Ades and his enthusiasts move in the small, interconnected sphere of contemporary music, the Americans described only a handful of encounters with him. God, Id be like a little groupie: Mr. Ades, Mr. Ades! I would love to meet him, Mr. Thile said. If Mr. Ades ever wants to write anything for the mandolin, I am all ears and fingers.

Photo

To these composers, Mr. Ades is neither mentor nor friend; the crux of the rapport is not personal but musical. (It is bolstered by a minor black market of scores and samizdat live recordings traded by email.)

Its completely news to me, Mr. Ades said with a laugh when asked about his influence. In March, he is to conduct the New York Philharmonic in the American premiere of his work Totentanz. Based on a grim 15th-century frieze, Totentanz is far from the uproarious polystylism of Asyla, though it shares its balance of the lyrical and the unsettling.

Mr. Ades spends much of his time in Los Angeles and expressed admiration for the vibrancy of American new music. But he hesitated at the idea that he represented a paragon. The idea of having followers is quite funny for me, because Im a great non-follower in a way, he said. Having emerged as a cage-rattling enfant terrible, he has a very different approach to musical influence. To truly imitate his path would mean rejecting his music.

I want to be shocked; I want to be outraged, he said. If I felt, Oh, yeah, Im familiar with this, I would think, actually in that case  perhaps this isnt anything to do with me at all.

For an iconoclast who once actively courted controversy, Mr. Ades was flummoxed by a communally focused generation that so readily embraced his music: Im obviously rather stunned by the whole idea.",[]

An alternative title to Eye in the Sky, a riveting thriller about drone warfare and its perils, might be Passing the Buck. When urgent life-or-death decisions are required in a race against time to kill terrorists preparing a suicide attack, officials, wary of being held responsible for civilian casualties, repeatedly refer up to higher authorities for final approval.









That means securing an official go-ahead to deploy a Hellfire missile on a house in a crowded neighborhood in Nairobi, Kenya, where terrorists are meeting. But the British foreign secretary is at an arms trade fair in Singapore and the American secretary of state is attending a table tennis tournament in Beijing. How inconvenient! Meanwhile, the military, champing at the bit to unleash its firepower before the terrorists disperse, are increasingly frustrated.

Eye in the Sky, directed by Gavin Hood (Tsotsi) from a screenplay by Guy Hibbert (Five Minutes of Heaven), is a grim, suspenseful farce in which unpredictable human behavior repeatedly threatens an operation of astounding technological sophistication. Like many films of its type, it doesnt dwell on geopolitical minutiae.

Helen Mirren, in one of her fiercest screen performances, plays Col. Katherine Powell, the chilly officer in charge of Egret, an operation to capture a radicalized English woman meeting with Shabab terrorists at the house in Nairobi. Colonel Powell has been pursuing her for years. But as the moment of capture arrives, Colonel Powells plans abruptly change when a cyborg beetle, a small whirring surveillance device, reveals two inhabitants strapping on explosives for a suicide mission.

The metallic spy, the movies creepiest element, reinforces the Orwellian notion that nowadays there are no hiding places if the powers-that-be are out to get you. The characters robotic techno argot, intended to convey military expertise while camouflaging human element, is equally Orwellian.

Colonel Powell quickly secures permission from her superior, Lt. Gen. Frank Benson (Alan Rickman), to upgrade the order from capture to kill. Those orders are relayed to Steve Watts (Aaron Paul), a drone pilot in Las Vegas poised to launch the air-to-surface missile. But unforeseen interruptions keep delaying the attack.

General Benson is Mr. Rickmans final screen performance, and it is great one, suffused with a dyspeptic world-weary understanding of war and human nature. Because his character is observed early in the movie buying a doll for a child, he is not unsympathetic so much as profoundly sad. Ms. Mirren has rarely been icier, and her powerful, scary performance doesnt strive to make her character likable.

Eye in the Sky covers many of the same issues addressed in Good Kill, Andrew Niccols underrated critique of American drone strikes in Afghanistan, released last year. At what point does warfare by remote control become an impersonal video game in which the human element is overlooked in the pursuit of a so-called good kill? In that movie, Ethan Hawke played a drone operator in Las Vegas increasingly sickened by having to deploy missiles that killed women and children. The movie reserved special contempt for the Central Intelligence Agency, whose attitude toward collateral damage was portrayed as one of indifference. Mr. Pauls pilot, like Mr. Hawkes in Good Kill, is the farthest thing from a blase video-gamer eager to set off an explosion. At moments, he seems near tears.

Sharper, better made and better acted, Eye in the Sky, doesnt present as overtly critical a view of drone warfare. The military officers take their work seriously and fret over every detail as they try to estimate the number of casualties for various scenarios.

The movie still makes very clear the contrast between military personnel who want to discharge their duties as efficiently as possible, and their more cautious overseers who calculate the chances that the attacks could spur a diplomatic crisis, or worse.

As in Good Kill, civilians keep intruding into the line of sight at the last second. Moments before the Nairobi attack is to begin, a spunky little girl (Aisha Takow) selling bread posts herself opposite the terrorists house, and nothing can be done until she leaves. A Somali undercover agent (Barkhad Abdi, from Captain Phillips) is dispatched to buy up her loaves, but that assignment is interrupted.

An assistant of Colonel Powell is strongly pressured to estimate the chances of the girls being killed as less than 50 percent, in which case Colonel Powell can give the order to proceed. Another film might have found black comedy in the continuing risk assessment that accompanies each step of the operation. But Eye in the Sky allows the storys absurdist elements to speak for themselves.

Mr. Rickman, musing in oracular tones, delivers the films despairing overview that pierces to the heart: Never tell a soldier that he does not know the cost of war.

The Boston Symphony Orchestra announced Thursday that it had named the highly acclaimed British composer Thomas Ades to the newly created position of artistic partner, a three-year post that will showcase his work as a composer, conductor, pianist and teacher.

The partnership, announced as part of the orchestras 2016-17 season, will bring Mr. Ades to Boston in the fall to conduct his monumental Totentanz, accompany the tenor Ian Bostridge on the piano in a performance of Schuberts Winterreise, and play the piano with the Boston Symphony Chamber Players.

Being out of shape at age 18 may increase your risk for eventually developing Type 2 diabetes, regardless of your weight and family history, a new study says.

The study looked at data from more than 1.5 million Swedish men, using tests of muscle strength and aerobic capacity when they were conscripted for military service at age 18, between 1969 and 1997. Their muscle strength had been measured with hand grip and other tests, and their aerobic capacity calculated as they exercised on a stationary bicycle.

With this data in hand, researchers checked the mens medical records from 1987 to 2012. They found 34,008 cases of Type 2 diabetes over an average 26 years of follow-up. The study is in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

Both low aerobic capacity and low muscle strength at 18 were associated with a higher risk for Type 2 diabetes; poor aerobic capacity was a slightly stronger risk factor. Having both weak muscles and low aerobic capacity more than tripled the risk for future diabetes. The effect was independent of other risk factors  body mass index, family history of diabetes, education and socioeconomic status.

Early life interventions are really important, said the lead author, Dr. Casey Crump, a professor of family medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. Prevention of Type 2 diabetes should begin early in life, and should include both aerobic fitness and muscular strength. This is important regardless of peoples weight.",[]

In Eye in the Sky, a thriller about a secret drone operation against terrorists in Kenya, it doesnt take long for the characters to land in a moral minefield.









A long-planned mission to capture a radicalized Englishwoman, who is meeting with members of the Shabab Islamist extremist group in Nairobi, is thrown off course when it becomes clear preparations for a suicide-bombing attack are underway.

[Read a review of Eye in the Sky.]

The British colonel in charge of the operation (Helen Mirren) urges that the objective be changed from capture to kill. Her superior (Alan Rickman) agrees. As British politicians debate the repercussions of killing one of their own citizens, an American drone pilot (Aaron Paul) spies a complicating factor: a young girl, selling bread her mother has made, has wandered into the kill zone.

As the film ricochets among London, Nairobi, Nevada, Singapore, Beijing and Hawaii, what ensues is not just a game of bureaucratic buck-passing. Its a nuanced grappling with the ethics of modern warfare. Does killing a suspected terrorist by unmanned aircraft constitute extrajudicial execution? What qualifies as an imminent threat? And is saving the lives of 80 people who could perish in a suicide attack worth the death of an innocent girl and the anger of the local population?

Drone warfare  and the knotty political and moral issues that accompany it  has increasingly piqued the interest of filmmakers, TV writers and playwrights. Last month, The Good Wife returned to the topic, devoting a large chunk of an episode to a debate over the legality of adding an ISIS recruiter who is an American citizen to the kill list. And National Bird, a documentary about drone program whistle-blowers by Sonia Kennebeck, will play at the Tribeca Film Festival next month.

Its not hard to understand why drones make for compelling fare.

Theyre flying robots, said Arthur Holland Michel, co-founder of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College. Theyre used by spies acting on orders that come directly from the president. Theyre operated by former jet pilots living in Las Vegas, who feel the psychological toll of what theyre doing even though theyre not in danger. And they rain missiles called Hellfire on Al Qaeda, the Taliban and also, every so often, women, children and other civilians. How could the public not be fascinated and terrified by drones?

This combustible mix of awe and fear has led to some fanciful depictions in entertainment. In The Bourne Legacy, from 2012, Jeremy Renners character shoots down a drone in the Alaskan wilderness with a rifle before it can obliterate him. And thats not even the most unbelievable part: The drone was operating in stormy weather and swooping low to the ground through a valley, two abilities the current generation of unmanned aircraft does not possess.

In a more realistic approach, the Season 4 premiere of Homeland, in 2014, explored the consequences of collateral damage when a drone strike ordered by Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) takes out a Taliban leader but kills 40 civilians at a wedding in Pakistan in the process.

Last spring, George Brants play Grounded had a critically acclaimed run at the Public Theater in New York, with Anne Hathaway as a drone pilot haunted by waging war half a world away by remote control. And Andrew Niccols Good Kill, released last May, also grappled with drone warfares moral quandaries by focusing on the downward spiral of an Air Force pilot (Ethan Hawke), who blasts enemies in Afghanistan and Yemen to smithereens from a metal hut in the Nevada desert.

The new film Eye in the Sky takes a more wide-angled view of the issues. The English writer Guy Hibbert (Five Minutes of Heaven) began researching drone warfare about seven years ago, before the issue began to permeate the public consciousness. The spark: his imaging of what happens when some glorified toy, 20,000 feet up in the air fires and the horrific disconnect for the victims below.

Photo

A producer at the BBC, a friend of his, commissioned a script, and Mr. Hibbert began talking to British Army and Air Force officers (including some who worried that this new form of warfare was unfolding without any debate in Parliament), politicians and human rights lawyers. After being told about the kill chain  the elements (and players) involved in the selection, vetting and dispatching of targets  Mr. Hibbert found his dramatic instincts kicking in.

Finding financing, however, was a struggle. It took nearly four years before an escalation of the United States drone program moved the subject onto the front pages and the production company of Ged Doherty, a British former music executive, and the actor Colin Firth took on the $13 million project.

Mr. Hibberts kaleidoscopic approach, one that painted in shades of gray, resonated with the director, Gavin Hood (Rendition, Tsotsi).

It doesnt take a smug or easy position, Mr. Hood said. It doesnt profess to have the perfect answer, but it sure gives you an emotional, visceral sense of what its like to be in the shoes of very many different people involved in this warfare.

Mr. Hood, who served two years in the South African Marines more than 30 years ago, then embarked on a fact-finding mission of his own, speaking to military intelligence officers, drone pilots, defense contractors and others.

Mr. Hoods major alteration involved Ms. Mirrens character. In the original script, the colonel was a man. But I didnt want to make a guys war movie, Mr. Hood said. The themes and ideas of the movie should be discussed by all of us, regardless of gender.

Enticed by the multiple-viewpoint story, told in real time, that explored the realistic life-and-death compromises of war in an age of terrorism, Ms. Mirren signed on.

To me, its kind of like a courtroom drama, only the audience is the jury, wrestling with the right and wrong of it while leaving the theater, Ms. Mirren said.

Thats what one really hopes come out of this movie, she added. Not assumption, but discussion.

Ms. Kennebeck, an investigative journalist making her first feature-length film with National Bird, also hopes to spark conversation with her narrower focus.

The stories of three former United States Air Force personnel in the drone program serve as the backbone of the documentary, which counts Wim Wenders and Errol Morris as its executive producers. I wanted to talk to the people on the inside, Ms. Kennebeck said, not experts and other talking heads.

Heather, a former imagery analyst, now receives disability benefits for post-traumatic stress disorder, even though she was thousands of miles away from the strikes. Daniel, a former signals intelligence analyst, has become an antiwar campaigner. And Lisa, a former technical sergeant in the Air Force drone program, is so disturbed and conflicted by what she witnessed remotely, she travels to Afghanistan to meet civilian survivors of a strike gone awry. (That incident resulted in the deaths of 23 civilians, according to the United States military.)

One of the prime attractions of drone warfare is its precision  enabling the country to kill the people who are trying to kill us, as President Obama has told his aides, with minimal collateral damage. But if the intelligence is not accurate, the most robust protocols to prevent civilian casualties do not matter, and the moral superiority of such warfare claimed by its proponents can be tarnished.

Independent investigations have tallied many more civilian casualties than the administration, which has shrouded the drone program in secrecy, will concede. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit based at City University London, has found that an estimated 423 drone strikes in Pakistan since 2004 have killed between 2,497 and 3,999 people. Of these, between 423 and 965 have been civilians.

Winning the hearts and minds of the local population is the core of counterinsurgency philosophy. But how does the West succeed if the drone attacks make the ground only more fertile for the enemy?

That to me is the key debate here, Mr. Hood said. Are we engaged any longer in counterinsurgency, or are we simply engaged in a game of whack-a-mole? And when you whack the mole, do you have one less mole, or do another 20 moles pop up?",[]

I know I am going to take a lot of heat for what I am about to tell you, but I just spent almost $1,000 for a pair of custom shoes.









I didnt even have to call my good friend, the Enabler, who usually lubes my way to expensive purchases. I just got sick of trying to find a pair of high heels to fit my extremely wide feet, found a custom shoe shop and said: I want a pair of shoes with heels that are high, but not too high, that I can wear with everything and will last me the rest of my life. I also want to be able to walk in them.

Oh, excuse me, I have an instant message, from someone called Outraged Reader: You spent $1,000 trying to find a good-looking high heel  that has to be the ultimate, privileged, first-world problem!

You have a point, Outraged. Let me put it in a way to which every citizen of the world will relate: Im not Audrey Hepburn. I cant wear flats with a skirt.

Or maybe its better explained this way: I just paid $1,000 for a pair of orthopedic shoes. I was forced to do this because as one gets older, ones feet often get wider, and designers, concerned as they are with cultivating older shoppers, offer shoes that look like boats. Not those sharp little cigarette boats used to deliver drugs to the Florida coast; the beat-up rowboats with chipped green paint.

When I was in my 20s and saw older women in these ugly shoes, I wondered what made them buy them. Now I understand that it was the same thing that made them go out with unsuitable men: availability. You search and search and theres nothing out there. After a while you say: I cant take it. Just let me find something I can make do with. I dont care if its not perfect, just let it get me through the Kornberg destination funeral.

Now, I am not the sort of person who decides to spend $1,000 on a shoe lightly. I was brought up by a father worried not whether we would die in the gutter, but when. This did not make me a person who never buys a big-ticket item, I just have to torture myself for a while first.

This fall, when I was at an art opening with my friend Elaine, wearing a 9W Naturalizer pump with a three-inch heel, I reached my breaking point. My feet hurt from the moment we arrived. (There were stairs. I hadnt factored in stairs.) When Elaine suggested a restaurant, my only concern was distance.

Im good for two blocks, I said. After that youll have to call E.M.S.

It was time for custom shoes. I grabbed the only comfortable heels I owned, a pair of stretched-out, 12-year-old suede pumps with a two-inch heel that I hoped could be copied. I also took a $280 pair of British high heels I had bought in a pre-wedding panic that were too big at the heel and that I hoped might be salvaged. They had a three-inch heel. Then I headed up to a shop in the theater district that I knew, from my online research, took three months to make a pair of shoes.

The walls were lined with Broadway show posters, which meant that if the shoemaker got another order from the producers of Hamilton Id be waiting even longer. But he also seemed to know his stuff. He had me walk in my too-loose British shoes and told me they would have to be rebuilt to fit, which would cost $750, which didnt make sense. He could copy my suede shoe, but advised against suede because it stretched quickly.

I chose instead a beautiful black leather and was told, after being measured, to call in two months for a fitting. The cost of the shoes with tax would be $979.88. I paid a $750 deposit, and my father rose from his grave screaming.

Be gone, Old Bones, I said, because this is how you talk to a ghost. I will be wearing those shoes for the rest of my life, and they will be as comfortable as the $30 Chucks which now adorn my feet but which one cannot wear with a cocktail dress. Do you want me to have a boyfriend or not?

Still hoping to save my British shoes, I hit another store. No rebuilding needed, I was told. The heels would be tightened and a strap added. Cost: $110.

This made my father even crazier.

You couldnt comparison shop? he yelled. Cancel the goddamn custom shoes.

How little you know of womens footwear, I said. Theyre entirely different shoes. One is two-inch, which I can wear with pants and skirts, safely negotiating Manhattan streets even in winter; the other is three-inch, which will look better at dressy events and which I have, by dint of perseverance, salvaged.

It is great to have the confidence of a well-adjusted adult. I went home and gathered up the shoes that had been hurting my feet for the last 10 years and took them to my local Housing Works thrift shop on West 17th Street. And thats where I saw them: barely worn low-heeled suede pumps, much like the ones I was having copied. Cost: $13. They fit great.

It was time to call the Enabler.

No, no, you did not waste money, she says. You paid, what, $1,100 for three pairs of shoes? Thats just $360 a pair for shoes you will wear and enjoy for the rest of your life.

Youre leaving out the $280 I paid for the British shoes two years ago, I tell her.

Two years ago doesnt count, she says. And when the custom shoes are ready, youll love them.

This week, after a four-month wait and four adjustments, I wore my $1,000 shoes for the first time. They raised a bunion the size of the Hindenberg. The shoemaker adjusted them yet again. I have to go now. My dead father is screaming.",[]

Being tall is associated with higher income for men and being overweight is associated with lower income for women. A new study shows that height and weight may have a direct cause-and-effect relationship with pay.

The study used Mendelian randomization  a genetic technique that helps clarify the causal relationship between human characteristics  to show that genetically determined height and weight can directly affect worldly success.

British researchers studied 119,669 men and women who either had or did not have various genetic variants known to influence height and B.M.I.

The study, in BMJ, found that for each two and a half inches of genetically determined extra height, a man was 12 percent more likely to work in a high-status job and earned an average $1,611 more a year. In women, a 4.6-point increase in B.M.I. resulted in $4,200 less in annual income. These differences between the sexes strengthen the conclusion that the effect has a genetic basis, independent of environment.

That taller men and thinner women are more successful has been shown in several observational studies, and environmental factors are certainly involved.

But your environment, your lifestyle, cant change your genes, said the senior author, Timothy M. Frayling, a professor of human genetics at the University of Exeter. The data shows that there is a causal effect from being genetically a bit shorter or fatter that leads you to being worse off in life. Previously we didnt know that.",[]

It was mortifying enough when the Republican debate last week introduced the question of whether it was appropriate for one presidential candidate to accuse another of wetting his pants. But the final straw for Gary Goyette and Andrea Todd, who were watching at home in Sacramento with their 10-year-old son, was Donald J. Trumps jarring, out-of-left-field boast about his sexual endowment.









We were just incredulous, Ms. Todd said, when Mr. Trump leeringly declared that there was no problem with that part of his anatomy. She and her husband looked at each other, she recalled, and then looked at their son. Gary said, Tommy, youve got to leave  youve got to get out of here. And Tommy actually got up and ran out of the room.

Many unforeseeable things have happened so far in the raucous Republican presidential race. But the 2016 election  with its rudeness, crudeness, bluster and bullying  has also presented adults with an unexpected, unpleasant dilemma: How on earth do they explain Donald Trump to children?

Quite frankly, its been quite embarrassing when I have an 11-year-old who is better behaved and more polite than some people who are the potential next leaders of our country, said Maury Peterson, who runs Parenting Journey, a nonprofit group in Somerville, Mass., that provides support for families. This name-calling and making fun of people is basically the opposite of what hes been taught at home and at school.

Kathy Maher, a sixth-grade teacher in Newton, Mass., said that election years usually presented an excellent opportunity for students to observe the virtues of the American democratic process. But this year, she said, she worries about the schools mock-debate season, when someone will have to play Mr. Trump  a candidate who, if he were a student, would be sent straight to the principals office.

Her school has a program encouraging students to speak up if they see someone being mistreated, Ms. Maher said, and for that reason she has felt obliged to address the subject of Mr. Trump.

I try really hard, when we discuss politics, to take a balanced view, she said. But I felt I had to say something this time, because the things Donald Trump says wouldnt be tolerated in our schools. He bullies people, he name-calls, he makes fun of people because of their race, their ethnicity and the way they look.

What about students whose parents are Trump supporters? I say, People might like some of the things that Donald Trump stands for, but there are better ways of saying it, Ms. Maher said. I did say that some people like that he says things for shock value, like the crazy old uncle who just says whatever he wants. But as an educator, I cant support that. Its not funny  its mean.

For some children, Mr. Trumps message has filtered down in extremely upsetting, possibly dangerous, ways. Social media has buzzed with parents relaying their childrens fears that they or their friends would be deported, walled in or walled out if Mr. Trump becomes president.

Jon Michaud of Maplewood, N.J., who is white and whose wife is Dominican, wrote on Facebook about a conversation he had with one of his two sons: So if Donald Trump becomes president, hes going to bring racism back, he said his 8-year-old had told him. That means Marcus, Mommy and I will be separated from you because we have darker skin than you do, right?

Speaking on MSNBCs Morning Joe on Wednesday, Cokie Roberts put the question to the candidate himself. Thereve been incidents of white children pointing to their darker-skinned classmates and saying, Youll be deported when Donald Trump is president, she said. Thereve been incidents of white kids at basketball games holding up signs to teams which have Hispanic kids on them, saying, Were going to build a wall to keep you out.

Are you proud of that? Ms. Roberts asked. Is that something youve done in American political and social discourse that youre proud of?

Mr. Trump replied that he had no knowledge of such reports. I think your question is a very nasty question, he said, and Im not proud of it because I didnt even hear of it, O.K.?

As much as they might want to, parents and educators cannot keep their children insulated from news about Mr. Trump.

Hes omnipresent. Its going to come up, so you better be prepared, said Carolyn Lee, a substitute kindergarten teacher in the Hawaii public school system.

With very young children, she advised that parents remain calm and refrain from retaliatory anti-Trump name-calling. Lets say the familys watching the news and they see this man on TV tossing water bottles and making fun of people, Ms. Lee said. I would say something like, We try to treat people the way we would like to be treated, and somehow hes showing the exact opposite of that.

Richard Klin of Stone Ridge, N.Y., said he saw little point in trying to shield his 11-year-old daughter from the campaign. I had this impulse to lock her away in an enchanted land where Donald Trump doesnt exist, but you cant, he said.

Mr. Klin said he had traumatic memories of watching his own father erupt into paroxysms of rage whenever he saw President Richard M. Nixon on television. I didnt want to be that guy yelling at the TV, so Im trying to cool it, he said.

In Los Angeles, Andy Behrman, a single parent of two girls, 8 and 10, said that his daughters continually accused Mr. Trump of violating the double vs, a reference to their schools virtues and values program.

Theyre not picking up on the innuendoes of his hands, theyre not catching on to the genital issue, Mr. Behrman said. But theyre catching on to the fact that Trump, Rubio and Cruz are all talking at the same time, which theyve learned doesnt make sense. Its not polite and it doesnt allow anyone to voice their own opinion.

Parents who support Mr. Trump disagree, of course. They say that his authenticity and his refusal to pander to his critics are more important than the words he uses. And they ask why Americas children are so sensitive that they cannot be exposed to robust views, forcefully expressed.

This is not about him being rude to people randomly, said Jeremy Diamond, a marketing executive who lives in Manhattan and has a son, 12, and a daughter, 15. He shows passion and aggression, and that hes going to fight for his point of view.

He said he was confident in the integrity and behavior and values of his children, both of whom have been impressed by Mr. Trumps take-no-prisoners approach, which Mr. Diamond called strategic aggression.

My son said, Daddy, he just wants to show that he is stronger than the other candidates and that hes not going to get pushed around, he said.

Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University, who has a 15-year-old daughter and has written about Mr. Trump for CNN.com, said that for older children, it helps to place Mr. Trump in the context of a society driven by celebrity and social media.

My daughter asks, Why are you so obsessed with Trump? So what if he did a retweet? Ms. Ben-Ghiat said. But we can tell our children that hes a product of our branding culture and our selfie culture and our attraction to reality-show television, where the behavior is so brutal.

The ubiquity of Mr. Trump, she said, provides a useful opportunity for children to examine their own preoccupations.

They can learn to look beyond flash and glamour, to be skeptical of the power of messaging and branding, but also to learn that its important that each one of us speak out and use our right to vote, Ms. Ben-Ghiat said. And to listen to the other side even if you dont agree with them.

In Sacramento, though, Mr. Goyette and Ms. Todd have still been unable to bring themselves to fully explicate last weeks debate to 10-year-old Tommy.

He asked us later, What does it mean about the hands thing? Ms. Todd related. But none of us wanted to tell him.",[]

Its unplugged, unscheduled, good clean fun  a lifestyle holiday from our overcommitted, overconnected lives.









TWO YEARS AGO, the Los Angeles artist Fritz Haeg, perhaps best known for his 2005 Edible Estates project  which exhorted people to replace their front lawns with kitchen gardens  went looking for land of his own. For the past decade, hed been living on the road, doing urban art projects in an itinerant way. Now, he felt the dialectical tug of the opposite: A settled, rural situation, where I could live full-time with a community of people.

He did not want raw land; rather, a place with an interesting history. A realtor called about a 35-acre parcel in Mendocino County, and as soon as I saw the pictures and read the description, Haeg tells me, it was like a revelation: This is it. Salmon Creek Farm is a rugged, mostly sloping expanse shrouded in second-growth redwood forest in the town of Albion; it was also a commune in the early 70s. The property was still owned by its original members, even though it had ceased being a functioning community in the late 1980s. Haeg had come looking for land, and found a legacy instead.

We are sitting in the Orchard Cabin (named for the abutting grove of apple trees), one of the propertys eight on the grid structures, and Haeg is spooning stewed apples, made from a recent harvest, into a bowl. Hard cider from those same apples ferments in a huge milky jug under the kitchen table. A wood fire hisses, pour-over coffee drips. His dog, Ivy, a 17-year-old Australian shepherd, lies at his feet. The walls of the cabin are lined with canned fruit and an eclectic range of books, from ones on Modernist architecture to Mushrooms Demystified and Cider, co-written (who knew?) by Annie Proulx. Outside, the only sound is the Pacific Ocean, two miles away, deep, raspy and constant. Haeg calls the landscape enchanted, and I am inclined to agree.

Haeg, who has been here for 15 months, has mostly been trying to bring the place, with its range of idiosyncratic cabins in various states of disrepair and its homespun yet surprisingly effective water and power infrastructure  one original communard had been an engineer  up to some level of rustic comfort. All of this preparation is setting the stage for his latest work, a revived Salmon Creek Farm. He has no illusions of recreating the original commune. That was life, he says. This is also an art project. Haeg imagines something between an arts colony and a gathering place, somewhere to come when you want to take a step back from contemporary society.

IT MIGHT BE EASY to dismiss Haegs commune as an artists folly, some cabin porn exercise fit for Instagram consumption, had his entire career not signposted him toward Salmon Creek. There was his 2001 Sundown Salon, a monthly gathering (organized around themes that ran from knitting to political ennui) which operated for five years at his William King-designed hilltop geodesic domestead in Los Angeles; and 2012s Domestic Integrities at the Walker Art Center. With its participatory fruit canning, wild food foraging and huge, hand-knit circular rugs made from recycled textiles  the center of one occupied the cabin in which I was staying  that piece hadnt been dissimilar to the activities of the young communards.

Haegs vision is to bring together artists whose work, he says, goes beyond conventional studio practice, and who, rather, are responding to wilderness and the basics of daily life. There is a sense, as with the original commune, of a kind of withdrawal  from the cities, from the overheated, rigorously professionalized art market  if only in the name of a deeper engagement. Salmon Creek: the land, the cabins, the whole temporarily communal aspect, is at once muse, studio and exhibition space. Its not hard to imagine environmental sculptors like Andy Goldsworthy, Patrick Dougherty or David Nash having a field (and stream) day here. Or artists like Andrea Zittel (a friend of Haegs), who is vaguely affiliated with the social practice movement, and whose High Desert Test Site near Joshua Tree National Park is also a place where daily life becomes a site of exploration.

And so Haeg has invited a young Los Angeles artist named James Herman to turn a huge, burned-out stump of a redwood into an outdoor shower. The San Diego-based artist Keenan Hartsen, meanwhile, is building a site-specific xylophone for the sauna so that, as Haeg describes it, you can play the structure. And a Point Reyes-based sculptor, woodworker and abalone diver named Ido Yoshimoto has been fashioning furniture from the abundant fallen tree matter. Others will work on the future dining hall, currently staked out with pink ribbon in a clearing next to the meadow.

One spiritual antecedent might be Food, Gordon Matta-Clarks influential SoHo restaurant-as-performance-piece, which opened in 1971, the same year as Salmon Creek. Like Matta-Clark, Haeg wants to essentially curate people, to see what happens when you put them together in a new space. In the beginning, at least, this was an extended group of his artist friends. Now, though, hes beginning to accept letters of interest from students and recent graduates. They will come two or three at a time and propose individual projects. There are no fixed plans as to how long they will stay or their specific chores  beyond helping out with the cooking and the running of the place  but guests in general, he says, should remain at the site at least a week. Any shorter, he says, is disruptive for whoever the community is.

During my visit, the cast included Niki Ford, a former line cook at Chez Panisse who is working with Haeg on a Salmon Creek Farm cookbook; Alex Tieghi-Walker, an itinerant Londoner who edits the Anonymous Sex Journal; Chelsea Wills and Devon Sampson, a pair of scientist-artists from Geyserville who were compiling a field guide to the local flora and fauna; and Rachael Hawkins, who perhaps best fit the spirit of the original commune. A 40-year-old wardrobe stylist who most recently lived in L.A., she had, two years before, decamped for a vagabond life. Here, she was sewing, canning, excavating the history of the place, but come spring, she told me, she was gearing up for an all punks boat float, a ragtag expedition of homemade rafts set to travel down the Mississippi River.

COMMUNES EXIST all over the world, but it is in the U.S., with its bountiful land, fluid personal identities and DNA of self-reinvention and social experimentation, where the idea appears most potent. They seem of the 60s, but this could just as easily mean the 1860s; history is rife with examples of seekers, united by some thunderous religion or utopian ideology, pining for a fresh start in some new Eden. There are scores of so-called intentional communities in America today; some of them are early 1970s holdovers with reburgeoning populations. Even the co-working spaces that have blossomed in cities speak to the idea of finding community amidst the always-connected-yet-isolated vagaries of free-agent economic life. In a shared space, people engage differently. Or as Haeg puts it, When people are here, they are really here.

Last December, to celebrate the one-year birthday of the newly revived Salmon Creek, Haeg invited a group of the original communards for a potluck Sunday lunch in the cabin he had christened Dawn, after the woman who built it. Dawn Hofberg is a petite, youthful-looking sexagenarian, who gave birth to two children in this cabin, and with whom I chatted about recent New Yorker articles and long-ago peyote circles.

She and the others had all come in their early 20s, from lives in quiet East Coast suburbs and California college towns, to this place that Robert Greenway, a psychology professor, had purchased with his companion River. It was not dropping out, argued River, in her 1974 book Dwelling, but an active search for a new pattern of living that does not rip off the planet or any of her inhabitants. Her son, Salmon, built his own cabin here at age 13.

In the 1960s and 1970s, this area north of San Francisco had the countrys densest concentration of communes, both because of the proximity to countercultural hubs and its mild climate. Mendocino County became pop-cultural shorthand for a longhair Shangri-La, while the area near Salmon Creek was so thick with communes it was half-seriously referred to as Albion nation. Over time, people slowly moved away, drifting into more conventional living arrangements. Yet the impulse has not entirely vanished; in addition to Haegs project, a new Radical Faerie commune named Groundswell has opened nearby, in a former Catholic boys camp.

Later that evening, we sit in Haegs cabin, listening to the local station KZYX  the only one that comes in, and for Haeg, who grew up in a Midwestern radio family, the virtual town square knitting together the dispersed community. With its placidly voiced surf reports and announcements of local lost and found pets, it is at a soothing oneness with the snapping fire and Ivy curled at our feet. Haeg mentions the Scandinavian propensity for this kind of coziness, exemplified in abstruse Danish concepts like hygge. In his stark modern cabin he says, I was always jealous of the coziness of other peoples houses. Not any longer.",[]

When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau, arrived at the White House this week for the first state dinner given for a Canadian in two decades, it was on a wave of international attention not accorded a Canadian politician in, well, maybe ever.









Within Canada, where I was born and raised and where my family still lives, Ms. Gregoire-Trudeau is a singular figure. Hailed from the start for her attractiveness by a giddy news media thrilled to have someone to hail, she was called Canadas latest fashion icon by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. (Latest suggests shes replacing someone  who, exactly?)

Often compared to Kate Middleton, Ms. Gregoire-Trudeau was similarly thrust into the spotlight alongside a husband who has been known to the country since birth, and she appears to have undergone a similar, acceptably fashionable style overhaul.

Photo

Even so, most of the Canadians I spoke with were thoroughly uninterested in what she was wearing other than that she looked both smart and relatable.

I think shes unique for her position, said my friend Meghan, an executive at a leading Canadian bank. She looks young and down-to-earth, like Id expect to find her playing with the kids at my park.

Shes really beautiful, and thats part of the charm, said Allana Harkin, a producer of Full Frontal With Samantha Bee. But I dont think people up here are looking at her as a style icon. Ms. Harkin was quick to note that Ms. Gregoire-Trudeau was successful in her own right, and that together she and Justin represent couples that I know, who all make decisions together. It would be weird and disappointing for her not to have a presence.

When I asked my sister, who is the same age as Ms. Gregoire-Trudeau, 40, and also the mother of three small children, what she thought of Ms. Gregoire-Trudeaus style, the only image she could conjure was of the family out for Halloween, dressed as Star Wars characters.

To be sure, Ms. Gregoire-Trudeau has definitely joined the ranks of Canadas stylish prime ministers wives, which in fairness, is a short list consisting primarily of Mr. Trudeaus mother, Margaret, who was a beautiful 22-year-old flower child (so described to me by my mother, in a tone that suggested this explained everything) when she married Pierre Trudeau, then the prime minister and 23 years her senior. Ms. Trudeau hung out at Studio 54, arguably making her one of the coolest Canadians who ever lived.

Photo

Theres also Mila Mulroney, the wife of Brian Mulroney, who replaced Pierre Trudeau as prime minister in 1984 and stayed in office for nearly a decade. Even as a child, I noticed Ms. Mulroneys shiny, pretty hair. I was far less aware of the fact she was highly criticized for styling herself as a first lady (read: American) and for owning too many shoes. In 2012 she was mentioned in a Vanity Fair article toasting the ladies who lunched at Manhattan hot spots like Le Cirque.

Like I said, its a short list.

It is possible weve had other nicely dressed first ladies  presumably they were all reasonably nicely dressed, anyway  and just dont know about them. (We dont call them first ladies, by the way; they are simply the spouse, or wife of.) As I tried to come up with this list, I realized I could not name more than the two I have already mentioned. As in, I didnt know the names of any of our prime ministers wives.

Photo

Worried this lack of knowledge was the result of my having spent too many years in New York, I asked a few gainfully employed, well-educated Canadian friends if they could name spouses. They couldnt. What was Mulroneys wifes name? one asked. Harper, who? another said.

A number of people I spoke with, however, immediately mentioned Kim Campbell, who was the prime minister of Canada for four heady months back in 1993. Was she stylish per se? In the early-1990s, Hillary Clinton sense of the word, perhaps. Was her husband? Was she even married? No one knew. (The answer: She has been married three times.)

The reality is that Canadians and Americans have different relationships with their leaders; we dont tend to put them on pedestals, or use them as examples of perfect citizenry to which we can aspire. Were not as interested in their personal lives so much as their ability to run the country. If they look good trying, thats nice, too.

Which is not to suggest that Canada isnt, generally, extraordinarily excited about the Trudeaus. Over Christmas I was given a sweatshirt depicting the prime minister riding a horse, set against a backdrop that included a rainbow and waterfall.

Photo

But it can be hard to distinguish all the icon hyperbole being thrown at the couple from the excitement Canadians feel about being recognized by the United States. Do Canadians genuinely think the Trudeaus are deserving of such high praise, or are our opinions being influenced by the fact that so many news outlets in America are trumpeting them? I never, ever expected to see my prime minister in Vogue, its unreal, I was told by Anita Clarke, founder of the Toronto-based fashion site I Want - I Got.

It was Mr. Trudeaus father, Pierre, who famously said, at a 1969 Washington Press Club dinner, that living next to the United States is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant. No matter how friendly and even-tempered is the beast, if I can call it that, one is affected by every twitch and grunt, he said.

To be Canadian is to live with equal parts fear and fury that the United States has no idea who we are (and may inadvertently roll over on us in the middle of the night without realizing it). We dont necessarily want your attention, but then again, why arent you giving it to us?

And while weve certainly produced our fair share of internationally recognizable figures (with Linda Evangelista, Pamela Anderson and Ryan Gosling, weve got style, sex and hot male feminist covered), they all had to leave Canada to find fame.

That is the big difference with the Trudeaus; they are finding fame, on very American terms, while remaining in Canada. They are the greatest Can con ever invented. Its like were that kid in high school who was kind of a geek, but has grown up and looks really hot, Ms. Harkin said. You want to know that kid now.

Which is why what Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau is wearing may be of so little interest to so many Canadians. We dont get this kind of platform or attention very often. Were dying to hear what shes going to say and (quietly) thrilled everyone on the planet appears to be listening.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Another Poll Shows Donald Trump Ahead of Marco Rubio in Florida,['Alan Rappeport'],"Photo

Donald J. Trump is leading Senator Marco Rubio in Florida, according to a new poll that shows the Republican lawmaker on the ropes in his home state ahead of its primary election next week.

A survey of likely Republican voters in Florida from Suffolk University found that 36 percent support Mr. Trump, while 27 percent back Mr. Rubio. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas comes in third with 19 percent, and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio trails them with 10 percent.

A number of polls this week have shown Mr. Rubio trailing in Florida, a state considered a must win for him to keep his dimming presidential hopes alive. Despite the senators ties with the state, Mr. Trumps message of economic populism and his tough stances on immigration and terrorism have resonated more.

Although Florida voters view Mr. Trump as the least conservative of the remaining Republicans in the field, they still find him appealing, and many said that the New York businessman most reminds them of former President Ronald Reagan  a celebrity Democrat who became a Republican later in life.

Mr. Trump has faced an onslaught of attacks in recent weeks from Mr. Rubio and leaders in the Republican Party, such as Mitt Romney, who have accused him of conning conservatives into supporting him. But Floridians who have already voted early or will cast their primary ballots on Tuesday do not seem too worried about such suggestions when it comes to Mr. Trump.

According to the Suffolk poll, 67 percent are not bothered by the fact that he gave money to Hillary Clintons 2008 presidential campaign.

And Floridians seem to have heard enough from Mr. Romney. Three-fourths of the Republicans questioned said that the 2012 Republican nominee should stay out of the 2016 race, and a majority of voters said that if he endorsed a candidate, it would make no difference or even make them less likely to support that person.

The poll, which was conducted this week, had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.",[]

WASHINGTON  Senators on the Judiciary Committee clashed openly on Thursday over filling a Supreme Court vacancy during an election year, with Republicans insisting that they were doing the right thing by refusing to consider any nominee put forward by President Obama and Democrats accusing them of shirking their constitutional duty.

The Judiciary Committee chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, denounced Democrats for the pressure they have brought in recent days in pushing him to convene confirmation hearings once Mr. Obama picks a nominee, which could happen as soon as next week.

Mr. Grassley again invoked remarks by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. from when Mr. Biden was the committee chairman in 1992, in which he urged that no Supreme Court vacancy be filled in a presidential election year. Mr. Biden said he was speaking hypothetically, apparently out of concern of a voluntary retirement before the end of President George Bushs term.

Mr. Grassley accused Democrats, including Mr. Biden, of revisionism. Some have tried to recast what Joe Biden said to give it an entirely different meaning, he said, noting that no Democrat had disputed the remarks at the time.

Mr. Grassley also chastised his Democratic colleagues for singling him out for attack on the Senate floor, and he defended his written pledge not to hold hearings on any replacement for Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last month, until after the November elections.

Mr. Grassley said it was clear no action would be taken on a nominee. So, why this charade? he asked. Why all this outrage about a hearing? He closed by saying he was confident in the Republicans position. Its the right thing to do, he said.

The senior Democrat on the committee, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, said he had so many disagreements with Mr. Grassley that he could not possibly discuss them all. But he disputed the relevance of Mr. Bidens comments.

The fact is we have taken action every time there has been a Supreme Court vacancy, he told Mr. Grassley sharply. We have always done the hearings and had the votes when theres a Supreme Court vacancy.

Thursday mornings hearing was just the start of a day of aggressive maneuvering in the court nominee fight. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee were scheduled to go the White House for a strategy session with senior administration officials.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-11 00:00:00,Mario Draghi Throws the Kitchen Sink at Europes Economic Distress. Again.,['Neil Irwin'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

One hopes that at the very least, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, is able to buy kitchen sinks in bulk at a discount from some plumbing supply shop in Frankfurt.









Because on Thursday, for the umpteenth time in his five years in that job, he has thrown his and everything else at Europes continuing economic malaise. This time, the E.C.B. managed a quadruple whammy: cutting its short-term interest rates even further below zero; pumping more money into the eurozone economy through quantitative easing  by 20 billion euros a month (with purchases currently planned to continue through March 2017); expanding the Q.E. program to include corporate bonds to make more credit available to businesses; and encouraging more borrowing by creating a new bank lending program.

This would seem on its face to be a really aggressive intervention to try to jolt Europe out of its deflationary muddle. Indeed, when it was initially announced, the euro fell 1.1 percent against the dollar, bond yields fell and European stocks rose, all suggesting that financial types saw it that way. But as Mr. Draghi began addressing the news media Thursday morning about the actions, he played down the likelihood of further rate cuts, and those market shifts reversed.

Photo

It was Mr. Draghis answer to the pessimism that has taken over global financial markets in the last few months, a malaise rooted in part by a sense of the impotence of global central banks. For years, new rounds of Q.E. and other moves have been the inevitable response to periods of market tumult and economic weakness. Now markets fear that the central banks just have nothing left to combat global deflationary forces that have seemed more powerful with every tick down in the price of oil.

Not so, according to Mr. Draghi. I think the best answer to this has been given by our decisions today, he said in his news conference after the policy announcement. We have shown that we are not short of ammunition.

That is, to be cynical, exactly what you would expect someone who is out of ammunition  but doesnt want you to know it  to say. However, people with less of a vested interest have made similar arguments. Joseph Gagnon of the Peterson Institute for International Economics argued in a briefing this week that Europe and Japan especially have plenty of room for more quantitative easing, which he argues would help them get to the 2 percent inflation levels they seek.

They may be right, of course; the last seven years have upended what we thought we knew about how central banks can and should operate. If you told some time travelers whod just arrived from 2007 that the E.C.B. had an official bank lending rate of negative 0.4 percent and was buying 80 billion euros of bonds each month, you would blow their minds.

But monetary policy works through different channels, and their relative importance shifts with time. For years, Q.E. seemed to have its greatest impact by pumping up prices of stocks and other financial assets. That both made consumers wealthier and lowered the cost of capital for businesses, helping restore confidence and encourage economic activity.

That has worked well enough that global financial assets look relatively richly priced relative to historical fundamentals, despite some recent turbulence. Its not clear that asset prices are as powerful a channel for central bank activism to stimulate the economy as they were in earlier years when they were undervalued. It is also not clear if further large increases in financial markets values would provide anything other than an unwelcome bubble.

That being the case, attention has shifted in the last year or so toward currencies. With good reason: When a central bank eases monetary policy, the price of its currency tends to decline relative to others, encouraging inflation and giving an advantage to domestic exporters.

But this has problems of its own, including being more of a zero-sum game than other channels. (Its not totally zero sum, though, as the former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke argued this year.)

Finally, to the degree the remaining tools for central bank easing are pushing into negative interest rates, there is a risk of destabilizing the global financial system, which would be counterproductive.

Negative rates like those in place in Europe may encourage more lending and economic activity, but if they go deeper into negative territory and persist for a long time, they could also cause people to withdraw money from banks and throw the business models of banks into chaos. Going too far into negative rates would be essentially telling banks: We want you to make loans and expand credit, but were also taking policy action that could obliterate your business.

In other words, Mr. Draghi may still be able to procure a few more kitchen sinks to throw at Europes economic problems. But each additional one may start to get a little more expensive, and a lot harder to throw.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-11 00:00:00,Senate Passes Broad Bill to Combat Drug Abuse,['Jennifer Steinhauer'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

WASHINGTON  Responding to an urgent drug crisis that has contributed to more American deaths than car crashes, the Senate Thursday overwhelmingly passed a broad drug treatment and prevention bill, the largest of its kind since a law in 2008 that mandated insurance coverage for addiction treatment.









This is big and significant, said Marvin Ventrell, the executive director of the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers. It had legs and interest because of the opioid crisis that has hit Middle America.

The bill  which passed 94 to 1  is a boon for Republican senators in swing states, which have been hit particularly hard by the drug crisis. Republican Senators Rob Portman of Ohio and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire spent weeks promoting the measure on the floor after seeing opioid-related crime and addiction soar in their states.

It was threatened by Democrats who were angered that Republicans turned away an accompanying measure to provide $500 million in extra funding to pay for what the bill authorizes.

What good are additional programs if they arent adequately funded? said Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania. We cant ask medical professionals to do more to treat addiction if they dont have the resources. (Mr. Portman and Ms. Ayotte were among five Republicans to vote for the extra funding measure.)

But in the end, the bill was considered too urgent to dismiss over a funding fight.

While meaningful bipartisan legislation in the Senate is about as rare as a spoon-billed sandpiper these days, Republicans and Democrats have found a common ground over the last year on criminal justice and mental health issues.

The House has been working the drug issue and is expected to have legislation on the floor this spring.

The epidemic is probably one of the most pressing public health issues facing American families across the country, said Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, one of dozens of senators who came to the Senate floor to praise the bill, which was sponsored by Mr. Portman and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island.

In contrast, Ms. Murkowskis bipartisan energy bill has been held up for weeks by Democrats over a similar funding fight, in that case for money to help the city of Flint, Mich., recover from its tainted water crisis.

The drug crisis has become increasingly pervasive, and in places rarely associated with issues like opioid addiction. An epidemic of abuse of prescription painkillers and heroin  often abused when the prescription drugs run out  has swept the United States, with overdose deaths quadrupling since the late 1990s.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drug overdose was the leading cause of injury death in 2013  the most recent date available  among American 25 to 64 years old, surpassing deaths caused by motor vehicle traffic crashes; 71 percent involved opioid painkillers.

Some public health experts have bemoaned the lack of federal response and have argued that the Food and Drug Administration has exacerbated the problem by continuing to approve new opioids in a market already flooded with them.

The treatment and prevention action has largely been at the state level. Some states, like Florida, which have passed such laws, have seen a decline in opiate-related deaths.

We really havent seen major legislation in this space for well over a decade, said Daniel Raymond, policy director of the Harm Reduction Coalition. Its a big deal because its bipartisan and because it symbolizes this broader shift we are seeing at community level in addressing addiction more as a health problem rather than just criminal justice problem.

The measure authorizes money for various treatment and prevention programs across a broad spectrum of addicts including those in jail. It also strengthens prescription drug monitoring programs to help states and expands the availability of naloxone, which helps reverse overdoses, to law enforcement agencies and increases disposal sites for prescription medications which are often abused by teenagers and others.

There are so many people whose lives are being ruined, families torn apart, communities devastated, Mr. Portman said. Its a comprehensive approach.

Democrats vowed to keep fighting for more money, which the White House has encouraged them to do.

Calling the bill, an important first step, said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York. He added, but its only the first step in a long race against this epidemic  by itself it wont get us over the finish line.",[]

Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, announced on Thursday what he described as a comprehensive package of measures aimed at spurring the eurozone economy and raising inflation.

The moves include cuts to interest rates, the expansion of a bond-buying program and loans to commercial banks that would pay banks to lend to businesses and consumers.

Its a fairly long list of measures, Mr. Draghi told reporters, and each one of them is very significant and devised to have the maximum impact.

The steps include:

Dissuading Banks From Hoarding Cash

The central bank cut its benchmark interest rate, the main refinancing rate, to zero, from 0.05 percent, and also lowered its deposit rate  the interest commercial banks receive for their holdings at the European Central Bank  to minus 0.4 percent, from minus 0.3 percent.

By charging banks more to keep deposits at the central bank and less to borrow from it, Mr. Draghi and his colleagues hope to make it less attractive for commercial banks to hoard cash, spurring increased lending.

Encouraging Borrowing to Stimulate Growth and Inflation

Starting in April, the European Central Bank will buy 80 billion euros, or $88 billion, worth of government bonds and other assets on a monthly basis, as part of a program that will continue until March 2017.

That not only expands an existing program that involves the purchase of 60 billion of assets a month, but it also includes for the first time the purchase of corporate bonds. Bank bonds, however, will be excluded from the asset-buying plan.

The program, which is a form of quantitative easing, is similar to ones undertaken by the Federal Reserve in the United States and the Bank of England in Britain. It is meant to lower interest rates and encourage borrowing, in that way helping economic growth and inflation.

Paying Banks to Borrow Money

Starting in June, the European Central Bank will offer four-year loans to commercial banks every three months until March 2017. It was not clear how many banks would be eligible for the program.

Banks could, under special circumstances, be paid to take out the loans, meaning they would effectively receive interest both from the European Central Bank for borrowing the money and interest from the customers they lend the money to.",[]

After years as the lone holdout among Division I conferences in not holding a postseason basketball tournament, the Ivy League announced Thursday that starting next season its automatic bids to the mens and womens N.C.A.A. basketball tournaments would be decided by a season-ending playoff.

The Ivy League tournaments will feature only the top four teams after the full conference season, the eight-team conference said in a statement, and will take place shortly before the N.C.A.A. tournament bracket is released. Next seasons tournament will be at the Palestra in Philadelphia, Penns home court, on consecutive days  a Saturday and a Sunday  in March.

The structure of our basketball tournaments is consistent with our model of college athletics, and the format allows us to preserve the significance of the regular season, the Ivy Leagues executive director, Robin Harris, said in a statement.

Besides announcing the postseason games, the Ivy League announced that its teams regular seasons would be reduced by one game, though the 14-game conference schedule, which came to be known as the 14-Game Tournament, with each of the leagues eight members playing every other team home and away, will be unaffected.

A league spokesman said the league still must develop a process for determining the tournaments composition in the event of a tie for fourth place.

Momentum for the Ivy League to hold a postseason tournament grew last season, when Yale and Harvard, who shared the league title, held a one-game playoff at the Palestra for the conferences automatic bid to the N.C.A.A. tournament. Harvard won, 53-51.

I witnessed not only a great game at last years mens basketball playoff, but also a perfect example of what the atmosphere for Ivy League tournaments will be, Harry Sheehy, Dartmouths athletic director, said in the statement.

Like many Division I conferences, the Ivy League generally receives no at-large bids to the N.C.A.A. tournament, so winning the regular-season title has been the only way to make it into the field.

Postseason tournaments can introduce an air of unpredictability. On Wednesday night, Holy Cross, seeded ninth, upset No. 2 Lehigh to win the Patriot League tournament. The Crusaders are 14-19, but as conference tournament champions they are guaranteed the leagues automatic bid into the N.C.A.A. tournament.

A postseason tournament could help three Ivy League teams currently enduring significant postseason droughts finally break through. Columbia and Brown have not played in the N.C.A.A. tournament since 1968 and 1986, while Dartmouths 57-year drought is the longest of any Division I team aside from the five charter members who have never played in the tournament.

Asked if the Ivy tournament would give Columbia a better chance to end its drought, Peter Pilling, the universitys athletic director, said: Yes, absolutely. This year we were right on the cusp on the mens side. If you get hot, you can be in the tournament.

Yale had not qualified for the N.C.A.A. tournament since 1962 until last weekend, when it clinched the Ivy championship with a win at Columbia to finish with a conference record of 13-1.",[]

It was mortifying enough when the Republican debate last week introduced the question of whether it was appropriate for one presidential candidate to accuse another of wetting his pants. But the final straw for Gary Goyette and Andrea Todd, who were watching at home in Sacramento with their 10-year-old son, was Donald J. Trumps jarring, out-of-left-field boast about his sexual endowment.









We were just incredulous, Ms. Todd said, when Mr. Trump leeringly declared that there was no problem with that part of his anatomy. She and her husband looked at each other, she recalled, and then looked at their son. Gary said, Tommy, youve got to leave  youve got to get out of here. And Tommy actually got up and ran out of the room.

Many unforeseeable things have happened so far in the raucous Republican presidential race. But the 2016 election  with its rudeness, crudeness, bluster and bullying  has also presented adults with an unexpected, unpleasant dilemma: How on earth do they explain Donald Trump to children?

Quite frankly, its been quite embarrassing when I have an 11-year-old who is better behaved and more polite than some people who are the potential next leaders of our country, said Maury Peterson, who runs Parenting Journey, a nonprofit group in Somerville, Mass., that provides support for families. This name-calling and making fun of people is basically the opposite of what hes been taught at home and at school.

Kathy Maher, a sixth-grade teacher in Newton, Mass., said that election years usually presented an excellent opportunity for students to observe the virtues of the American democratic process. But this year, she said, she worries about the schools mock-debate season, when someone will have to play Mr. Trump  a candidate who, if he were a student, would be sent straight to the principals office.

Her school has a program encouraging students to speak up if they see someone being mistreated, Ms. Maher said, and for that reason she has felt obliged to address the subject of Mr. Trump.

I try really hard, when we discuss politics, to take a balanced view, she said. But I felt I had to say something this time, because the things Donald Trump says wouldnt be tolerated in our schools. He bullies people, he name-calls, he makes fun of people because of their race, their ethnicity and the way they look.

What about students whose parents are Trump supporters? I say, People might like some of the things that Donald Trump stands for, but there are better ways of saying it, Ms. Maher said. I did say that some people like that he says things for shock value, like the crazy old uncle who just says whatever he wants. But as an educator, I cant support that. Its not funny  its mean.

For some children, Mr. Trumps message has filtered down in extremely upsetting, possibly dangerous, ways. Social media has buzzed with parents relaying their childrens fears that they or their friends would be deported, walled in or walled out if Mr. Trump becomes president.

Jon Michaud of Maplewood, N.J., who is white and whose wife is Dominican, wrote on Facebook about a conversation he had with one of his two sons: So if Donald Trump becomes president, hes going to bring racism back, he said his 8-year-old had told him. That means Marcus, Mommy and I will be separated from you because we have darker skin than you do, right?

Speaking on MSNBCs Morning Joe on Wednesday, Cokie Roberts put the question to the candidate himself. Thereve been incidents of white children pointing to their darker-skinned classmates and saying, Youll be deported when Donald Trump is president, she said. Thereve been incidents of white kids at basketball games holding up signs to teams which have Hispanic kids on them, saying, Were going to build a wall to keep you out.

Are you proud of that? Ms. Roberts asked. Is that something youve done in American political and social discourse that youre proud of?

Mr. Trump replied that he had no knowledge of such reports. I think your question is a very nasty question, he said, and Im not proud of it because I didnt even hear of it, O.K.?

As much as they might want to, parents and educators cannot keep their children insulated from news about Mr. Trump.

Hes omnipresent. Its going to come up, so you better be prepared, said Carolyn Lee, a substitute kindergarten teacher in the Hawaii public school system.

With very young children, she advised that parents remain calm and refrain from retaliatory anti-Trump name-calling. Lets say the familys watching the news and they see this man on TV tossing water bottles and making fun of people, Ms. Lee said. I would say something like, We try to treat people the way we would like to be treated, and somehow hes showing the exact opposite of that.

Richard Klin of Stone Ridge, N.Y., said he saw little point in trying to shield his 11-year-old daughter from the campaign. I had this impulse to lock her away in an enchanted land where Donald Trump doesnt exist, but you cant, he said.

Mr. Klin said he had traumatic memories of watching his own father erupt into paroxysms of rage whenever he saw President Richard M. Nixon on television. I didnt want to be that guy yelling at the TV, so Im trying to cool it, he said.

In Los Angeles, Andy Behrman, a single parent of two girls, 8 and 10, said that his daughters continually accused Mr. Trump of violating the double vs, a reference to their schools virtues and values program.

Theyre not picking up on the innuendoes of his hands, theyre not catching on to the genital issue, Mr. Behrman said. But theyre catching on to the fact that Trump, Rubio and Cruz are all talking at the same time, which theyve learned doesnt make sense. Its not polite and it doesnt allow anyone to voice their own opinion.

Parents who support Mr. Trump disagree, of course. They say that his authenticity and his refusal to pander to his critics are more important than the words he uses. And they ask why Americas children are so sensitive that they cannot be exposed to robust views, forcefully expressed.

This is not about him being rude to people randomly, said Jeremy Diamond, a marketing executive who lives in Manhattan and has a son, 12, and a daughter, 15. He shows passion and aggression, and that hes going to fight for his point of view.

He said he was confident in the integrity and behavior and values of his children, both of whom have been impressed by Mr. Trumps take-no-prisoners approach, which Mr. Diamond called strategic aggression.

My son said, Daddy, he just wants to show that he is stronger than the other candidates and that hes not going to get pushed around, he said.

Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University, who has a 15-year-old daughter and has written about Mr. Trump for CNN.com, said that for older children, it helps to place Mr. Trump in the context of a society driven by celebrity and social media.

My daughter asks, Why are you so obsessed with Trump? So what if he did a retweet? Ms. Ben-Ghiat said. But we can tell our children that hes a product of our branding culture and our selfie culture and our attraction to reality-show television, where the behavior is so brutal.

The ubiquity of Mr. Trump, she said, provides a useful opportunity for children to examine their own preoccupations.

They can learn to look beyond flash and glamour, to be skeptical of the power of messaging and branding, but also to learn that its important that each one of us speak out and use our right to vote, Ms. Ben-Ghiat said. And to listen to the other side even if you dont agree with them.

In Sacramento, though, Mr. Goyette and Ms. Todd have still been unable to bring themselves to fully explicate last weeks debate to 10-year-old Tommy.

He asked us later, What does it mean about the hands thing? Ms. Todd related. But none of us wanted to tell him.",[]

Why Convert?









To the Editor:

Asking Garry Wills to review Susan Jacobys Strange Gods (Feb. 28) is akin to asking the pope to review God Is Not Great. Actually, Pope Francis would probably be more open-minded and less critical of Jacobys book than Wills is.

It is somewhat mystifying (no pun intended) why people of faith often cannot accept the criticism that religion is not based on reason. Simply acknowledging that fact ought not to be viewed as a threat.

A secular humanist like Sam Harris would have been a much better choice as a reviewer. He could have taken Jacoby to task for any errors without lapsing into a rant based on his personal beliefs.

RICK MACDOUGALL

To the Editor:

It is understandable that the editors would have asked Garry Wills, a distinguished scholar of religion, to review Strange Gods, but less understandable that Wills would have so misread and maligned the book. His central criticism, that Jacoby cannot admit there ever is such a thing as a genuine spiritual conversion, is belied by her statement: I would never deny that an intense emotional desire to believe in something true  to see face to face, as Paul, Christianitys first great proselytizer, put it  motivates many conversions and plays an important role in their outcome.

It is unfortunate that a scholarly and fascinating contribution to the history of religion should thus be so unfairly dismissed and doubtless lose many prospective readers.

Whether conversion was a matter of survival, as it was for so many Jews in 14th- and 15th-century Spain; or a bid for economic and social mobility, as was the case for

David Ricardo, Benjamin Disraeli, Felix Mendelssohn and Gustav Mahler, to name just a few; or motivated by real belief, as it was for Jean-Marie (born Aaron) Lustiger, Archbishop of Paris from 1981 to 2005, who proudly described himself as a Jew, these converts were, in the end, viewed as suspect by many of their adopted faith.

John Gross, a former editor of The Times Literary Supplement and book critic for The New York Times, understood the predicament: To be Jewish is to belong to a club from which no one is allowed to resign.

Incarceration Nations

To the Editor:

With regard to the review of Incarceration Nations: A Journey to Justice in Prisons Around the World (Feb. 21), I can think of few things less useful to long overdue criminal justice reform in the United States than a book of anecdotes about imprisonment practices in countries whose societies and criminal justice systems are as disparate, and different from ours, as those mentioned in this book.

Nor can I think of a reviewer less likely to be informative than one who refers to the ineffectual senselessness of punishment without the slightest nod to the specific deterrence effects of imprisonment. Alternatives to imprisonment show promise for reducing the costs to governments and communities of incarceration which does not serve, or no longer serves, a purpose. The heart of the matter has always been how best to judge when such a point is reached.

I have been a federal prosecutor for 27 years, and for the last six I have worked increasingly, and now nearly full time, in programs for alternatives to imprisonment. Making sound judgments about whether punishment is needed, and how much, depends on intensive fact-finding and humility. Neither was much in evidence in the review.

Reckoning With Guns

To the Editor:

I read with interest the review of Sue Klebolds memoir, A Mothers Reckoning (Feb. 28). I feel for her, as for any parent with a mentally ill child. That said, both Klebold and the reviewer leave out the key issue: guns. Through time immemorial, parents have both underestimated and overestimated their teenagers depression and misery. But if Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris hadnt been able to acquire guns, the Columbine massacre would not have happened. Dylan might have killed himself, and that would have been a tragedy, but a tragedy not remotely comparable with what happened at Columbine, or what has happened since. Its way past time to wake up.

If the point of a book review is to help me to decide if I want to read a book, I am not certain I will read Ethan Canins A Doubters Almanac (though I have read everything else he has written). But if the point of Ellen Ullmans review (Feb. 28) is to describe to me her experience in reading the book, I have never read a sentence more eloquent and precise than: At this juncture of no meaning yes (not the only such in these pages), I took a moment to toss the book across the room.

William and George

To the Editor:

As a Trekkie, I found Gregory Cowless Inside the List column (March 6), about Leonard, William (Capt. James T. Kirk) Shatners book about his relationship with his co-star Leonard Nimoy (Mr. Spock), compelling.

But I wish the captain would come out with another book, titled George, about his fellow actor George Takei (Hikaru Sulu). Now that would be interesting, since both of them have spoken openly about their long feud. Takei calls Shatner very self-centered, and Shatner complains that Takei has been saying mean things about me for nearly 40 years.

CAPIATA, Paraguay  Deep in the subtropical heart of South America, the hunt is on.









Buried beneath red ocher earthen streets, or perhaps in the shade of mango trees in the fields beyond, opulent treasures are scattered for hundreds of miles  at least according to a fable that has suffused Paraguays cultural subconscious for generations.

The treasures are known as plata yvyguy (pronounced PLA-ta uh-vee-GWOOY) in Paraguays guttural national language. They are largely thought to have been hidden by the government and the panicked elite fleeing Asuncion, the capital, just 13 miles to the northwest, as occupying forces advanced during the War of the Triple Alliance, fought against Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay 150 years ago.

But the passage of time has not dimmed hope of unearthing tons of bullion, troves of British pound coins and  most coveted of all  ornamental pineapples forged from gold.

Paraguay is full of plata yvyguy, said Juan Alberto Diaz, 57, a full-time treasure hunter in a rural corner of this small city. Mr. Diazs neighbors manufacture bricks, and the heat rolls off the land, dotted with cows and guava shrubs, like an ovens breath. Everybody who knows it exists is after it.

In recent years, high-ranking military officers, mayors, a presidents brother, architects, physicians and laborers have all been consumed by the legend: planning expeditions; deciphering maps; sweeping sites with metal detectors; and cutting up swaths of land.

It is, in many ways, one of the greatest modern-day treasure hunts in the Americas. In different countries, the nature of these hunts has varied. In the United States, a search continues in the Rocky Mountains for a treasure chest hidden by an eccentric art dealer. In Peru, the plundering of ancient sites in recent decades has at times imperiled the countrys archaeological preservation.

The job of preventing a similarly ugly scenario from occurring in Paraguay belongs to Ana Rosa Lluis OHara, the governments director of cultural heritage. She has a 64-page file on Mr. Diaz and rejects authorization requests for digs from her basement office in the national library, citing a law that protects archaeological artifacts and sites.

Its a threat to our cultural heritage, Ms. Lluis OHara said.

Arguments erupt here because the countrys civil code includes provisions that can give finders of hidden treasure the rights to ownership. Still, the provisions do not apply to items of historic value, including most wartime artifacts, according to legal advisers to the government.

Seated by a hole 10 feet deep and partly covered with corrugated iron  remnants of a recent failed dig  Mr. Diaz, a former electronics dealer, recalled an audacious excavation he led in 2013 that piqued curiosity nationwide.

In that attempt, Mr. Diaz and several other treasure hunters, authorized by the mayor of Capiata at the time, Antonio Galeano, opened up a pit here with excavators where they thought they had detected 13 tons of gold bullion.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Within two weeks they uncovered a hefty steel chest, Mr. Diaz said. But by then a federal prosecutor had halted the hunt, charging Mr. Diaz with endangering an important aquifer and ordering the pit to be filled.

Another high-profile case, in 2006, featured a prominent group of officials, including a Supreme Court judge and a military general  tipped off by a dentist with a treasure map.

Enrique Riera, who was then mayor of Asuncion, gave them permission to search Parque Caballero, a downtown park, on the condition that some of the find would go to the city. But the hunt was interrupted when neighbors called a local radio station, exposing the group and alerting public prosecutors.

More recently, in 2014, three men died digging for treasure in one of Asuncions satellite towns.

Most Paraguayans seem to believe the theory behind plata yvyguy, viewing it as feasible that in the midst of a savage war Asuncions elite buried small fortunes, and state treasures were sent out of the city on train wagons and then hidden along tracks or in nearby hillsides.

But wild myths now color the hunt.

Theres so much fantasy, fabrication and rumor, said Jorge Rubiani, 71, an architect and former culture secretary for Asuncion who has written about the treasures. Historys been reduced to a moronic tale.

Some believe that treasures are defended by local goblins like Karai Pyhare, the jet-black Squire of the Night tasked with protecting nature. Others say families or even the government killed Paraguayan soldiers and buried them with the fortunes in the hope that their spirits would act as guardians. Mysterious fleeting fires are said to flicker in the night at sites where treasures were stowed.

In their quests, many hunters hire local clairvoyants to find hidden fortunes. Others turn to experienced hands like Francisco Moreno, 68, a retired port worker captivated by plata yvyguy since his grandmother told him of treasure she discovered almost 80 years ago: a clay urn filled with Spanish coins.

Paraguayans sensing there may be treasure in their backyards pay Mr. Moreno $175 a day to visit them in his 1994 Mitsubishi sport-utility vehicle equipped with metal detectors, which he also sells to budding hunters.

Demonstrating the detectors in the garden of his Asuncion home lined with fig and palm trees, Mr. Moreno said he had unearthed coins here and there, though never a larger haul. Still, he persists.

A pessimist never triumphs, Mr. Moreno said with a wide smile, flashing a golden tooth.

There is even a dubious set of maps detailing the locations of treasures across this central part of Paraguay, said to have been sketched by Domingo Francisco Sanchez, vice president to Francisco Solano Lopez during the War of the Triple Alliance.

The mass treasure hunt absorbs this nation to such an extent that filmmakers and playwrights have dedicated works to it.

Its in Paraguays DNA, said Miguel Rodriguez, 37, the director of Empty Cans, a small-budget picture about rural treasure hunters released in 2014. Who doesnt want to win the lottery?

Theories about the origins of the treasures abound, with obscure explanations that involve Egyptian pharaohs and shifting tectonic plates. One popular theory is that during colonial times several Spanish galleons headed for the Atlantic Ocean with loads of precious metal from Bolivian mines sank in the River Paraguay. Others point to Jesuit colonizers in the 17th century.

But the most common belief, endorsed by prominent local historians like Alfredo Boccia Romanach, is that heirlooms including jewelry, watches and porcelain were buried by affluent families during their getaway from Asuncion in 1868, when Paraguay lost a decisive battle to Brazilian-led forces and the government ordered an evacuation of the city. Historians say it is also quite likely that government reserves of precious metal were hidden by the wartime president, Mr. Lopez.

The vast majority of these treasures, some of which were also stuffed into wall cavities, were stolen when the enemy troops pillaged the city, Mr. Boccia Romanach said.

The Brazilians destroyed Asuncion, torching homes to keep searching through the night, said Mr. Rubiani, the architect. They probably found most of the treasure.

But this has not deterred the hunters.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,The New York Times,['Eric Grode'],"Misery loves company, especially the exquisitely calibrated, funny-despite-it-all misery that runs rampant through Anton Chekhovs major plays. Not content with the more or less faithful translations by the likes of David Mamet and Annie Baker, many intrepid theater companies have been re-radicalizing the once shocking Russian master, to quote the playwright Aaron Posner.

How do you get through your life, your lack of life, your lack of love? asks Mr. Posner, whose Seagull reboot Stupid ______ Bird starts previews on Tuesday, March 15, at the Pearl Theater Company after several regional productions. How do you get through the brokenness in yourself and in the world? If Im going to be asking the harder, deeper, finer questions about my life, I have no better guide than these plays.

No wonder Mr. Posner already has an Uncle Vanya update wrapped up and is currently working on a Three Sisters revamp called No Sisters.

Still, he cautions, these revolutionary works eventually suffered from their own influence. Since the last 100 years have seen Chekhov imitated by virtually every play, movie and TV show, he says, what was once radical is now cliched.

Each of these productions, three of which are opening in New York this season, plumbs the depths of Chekhovs signature blend of laughter and tears, not to mention his oft-cited rule that any gun shown in Act I must be fired by Act II. And with hardly a samovar or a babushka to be found.",[]

The first time that the heroine in the disarming comedy Hello, My Name Is Doris sees the kid, theyre in a crowded office elevator. Hes not a child at all, but somewhere in his mid-30s, which can seem light-years away for a woman who has been of a certain age for decades. So when he jostles Doris (Sally Field), she braces for the usual morning-elevator scrum. Instead, he straightens her lopsided eyeglasses. With this one small, human kindness he does something that astonishes Doris, something that doesnt often happen to the worlds invisible women: He sees her.









Not that Doris, whos in her 60s, tries to be invisible, exactly. From her cat-eye glasses to the headscarves that make her look hastily regifted, she seems like someone yearning to be seen. But wrinkles have a way of making women disappear one crease at a time, and Doris, whos in mourning when the movie opens, has done her part to vanish. When this kid  he turns out to be a new co-worker, John (Max Greenfield, an effortless charmer)  notices Doris, it changes everything. Doris is more than just surprised by his attention, she is also transformed. He makes her visible, most importantly to herself, a revelation that turns Doris into a woman who desires and is desired in turn. Its a ferocious awakening.

Its also a fairly slow, gaudy bloom. Like his heroine, the director Michael Showalter eagerly oversells the goods. Right off, he throws a lot in thats hard on the eyes and ears. Theres Doriss dowager-dumpster wardrobe and topsy-turvy Staten Island house, along with her mutterings and facial contortions, which seem one tic away from a medical diagnosis and sound the bag-lady alert. As he puts these messy parts into play, I kept thinking no, no, no, no. Its all much too much (those shoes, that hair!) and together they announce that youre in for an ingratiatingly cutesy slog about a lovable kook  except that the movie and Doris arent easy to love, which is partly why they work.

The movie starts big and broad at the funeral for Doriss mother, where everyone is shedding stage tears. Seated pointedly alone, Doris looks ashen enough that she wouldnt be out of place next to Mom in the open coffin. The whole thing is as dire as the priests eulogy, but a few beats later, when Doriss brother, Todd (the great character actor Stephen Root), speaks to her with unforced feeling, the movie shifts into something more complex. Mr. Showalter continues to play with comic tone and mood  he folds in some slapstick, enables the mugging and stages several cringing fantasy sequences that encourage you to laugh at Doris. It feels cruel, specifically because she isnt an ordinary American movie protagonist: Shes an older, frumpy, lower-middle-class woman who works in a cubicle.

Indirection can be a beautiful tool in comedy and so it is in Hello, My Name Is Doris, which uses this funny, outwardly ridiculous character to tell a simple story about a love that rarely speaks its name, including in movies: that of an older woman for a much younger man. These kinds of screen stories have always been few and far between, and its instructive, given the prevailing cultural horror of aging, that some of the more memorable ones turn on her-or-his pathology, whether its the deranged actress in Sunset Boulevard or the traumatized boy-man in the cult film Harold and Maude. Doris has issues, mostly grief and social isolation, which Ms. Field makes movingly real with a performance that reveals its truth incrementally.

Less interestingly, Doris has also become a hoarder. The home that she shared with her long-term invalid mother has become  with its bric-a-brac, bounty of old shampoo bottles and stacks of magazines  a showcase for their obsessive, compulsive behavior and an overly obvious manifestation of Doriss struggles. Mr. Showalter doesnt hang out in the house much, but the pack-ratting motif allows him and his co-writer, Laura Terruso, to pad the story with some family storming and stressing. This mostly concerns Todd and his wife, Cindy (Wendi McLendon-Covey), urging Doris to declutter and insisting that she visit a therapist (Elizabeth Reaser).

Doriss burgeoning friendship with John, meanwhile, leads her down alternately goofy and sweet avenues involving online stalking, late-night clubbing and new alliances, including with his girlfriend, Brooklyn (Beth Behrs). Doriss female attachments, including with her best friend, Roz (Tyne Daly), are particularly appealing because  as with Johns first kindness  theyre reminders that you can tell a lot about people from how they are loved. To that end, in one funny, meaningful passage, Doris ends up at a concert with John, wearing an eye-popping yellow outfit, a look that draws compliments and attention from various young revelers, who, treating her as a kindred spirit, are understandably taken with her. Doris turns out to be an excellent mirror, including for your own chauvinism.

BECKY, NEW JERSEY

The fact that It Gets Better, as that moving video project about bullying attests, is no argument for twiddling our thumbs until it does. Who lets their child be bullied for the sake of a few summer barbecues? Teach your children to intercede. Very few 11-year-olds will still be nasty after a 16-year-old says: Knock it off. Being mean is uncool.

If the teasing persists, report it to the parents of the bully (regardless of what the new parents want). The longer this behavior continues with your knowledge, the more you are signaling to your children that its O.K.

Loud Talk

On a recent trip, I stopped by the airline lounge before my flight. After settling in, I couldnt help hearing a businessman conduct a very loud conversation on his Bluetooth device. Everyone heard him. What to do about such rude behavior? Sit in front of him and glare? Ask the lounge staffers to intercede? Start my own loud phone conversation?

JIM, ATLANTA

I just had the same experience  as did four million of our fellow travelers. When I complained politely to the woman working at the American Airlines lounge, she told me she wasnt allowed to stop this man from torturing us. (Really?) And Ive never understood the efficacy of glaring. If people knew they were shouting, or cared, they wouldnt. So, why glare? Lets not start competing screech-fests, either. Fighting fire with fire gets awfully toasty.

MIAMI  Senator Ted Cruz is expected to receive the endorsement of Senator Mike Lee of Utah on Thursday, according to someone familiar with the decision, netting Mr. Cruz the public support of a Senate colleague for the first time.

The endorsement provides a counterpoint to the criticisms leveled against Mr. Cruz by opponents like Donald J. Trump, who has reveled in the fact that the Texas lawmaker could not attract the support of a single senator for much of the campaign. It is also a blow to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is friendly with Mr. Lee, as he strains to catch Mr. Trump before Tuesdays Florida primary vote.

Mr. Lee appeared with both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio earlier in the campaign and had expressed concern with the tenor of the race.

Its not easy to see them fighting, he said last month outside a barbecue restaurant in South Carolina, where Mr. Cruz was set to hold an event.

Mr. Lee is admired by the conservative base for his anti-spending positions, and Mr. Cruz had long coveted his endorsement. The men had a spat last year during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, after Mr. Cruz argued that measures proposed by Mr. Lee would weaken punishments for violent offenders. Mr. Lee called that a mischaracterization.

The moment seems to have passed, and now Mr. Cruz, a day after announcing the endorsement of Carly Fiorina, is better positioned to make the case that the primary is becoming a two-man race.

Even longtime skeptics of Mr. Cruz, like Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have begun to express an openness to his candidacy  if only because many establishment Republicans see him as the lesser of two evils with Mr. Trump.

Aides to Mr. Cruz and Mr. Lee did not comment on the endorsement plans. On Thursday, the Cruz campaign alerted reporters to a major endorsement announcement at 3 p.m. at the site of the evenings Republican debate.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-11 00:00:00,Wheres My Mercedes? Egypts Financial Crisis Hits the Rich,['Declan Walsh'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

CAIRO  Gucci Corner is the nickname for a bustling plaza at the private American University in Cairo, where well-heeled students hang out between classes and strut their imported fashions.









These days, though, even the privileged are feeling the squeeze of Egypts economic crisis.

Zeyad Mohamed, 19, a business student, said he was shocked to discover on a recent visit to a Mercedes-Benz showroom that his desired model would not be available for 18 months. Normally Im not interested in politics  if it doesnt affect me, I dont care, Mr. Mohamed said, reflecting a disengagement that is typical among well-to-do youth. But this is a problem. And things are getting more expensive.

Wealthy Egyptians were among President Abdel Fattah el-Sisis most ardent supporters after he seized power in 2013, favoring stability and a harsh crackdown on Islamists, even at the cost of civil liberties. But that loyalty is being tested now, as Egypts severe shortage of foreign currency cripples businesses, impedes luxury imports and crimps their lifestyles. And that has prompted a tide of unusually sharp criticism of Mr. Sisi.

Photo

Mr. Sisi is using what scarce resources he has mainly to help the poor  and the seven million people on the states payroll  by propping up the value of Egypts currency. Politically, that makes sense: Mr. Sisi is mindful of the popular protests that drove President Hosni Mubarak from office in 2011. Even so, the poor have suffered from shortages of some staples, like cooking oil, while the rich are confronted with restrictions that amount to a sharp pinch, if not quite pain.

Thats whats new  the suffering of the rich, said Ibrahim Eissa, a prominent journalist who was once among Mr. Sisis loudest advocates, but who recently published a withering attack on the presidents policies. Mr. Eissa said: No class or demographic is happy now, from Alexandria to Upper Egypt. Sisi isnt satisfying anyone.

Stringent new government regulations restrict the use of Egyptian credit cards abroad and limit purchases of foreign currency. Business people seeking American dollars have scrambled to the black market, where the price has jumped 20 percent in recent months. Meanwhile, their families are faced with sharp riss in supermarket prices, long waits for luxury cars and worries about obtaining enough dollars or euros to pay for foreign vacations or for their children to study abroad.

Last weekend at U Bistro, a lounge with a buzzing bar filled with local high rollers, the price of the dollar was all people are talking about, said Dina Alhassani, an education consultant at one of the tables. People are worried, she said. Theres a sense of anxiety about what comes next.

The worsening currency crisis  one headline this week spoke of a dollar fever  is one of several woes facing Mr. Sisi, who is also under fire for rights violations by his security forces. The strain appeared to show in a recent speech where he lashed out at critics, urged them to shut up, and told the audience, Please, do not listen to anyone but me.

The hectoring, emotional tone of that speech drew derision on the Internet. After Mr. Sisi rhetorically offered to ease the crisis by selling himself, one Internet user set up an eBay page with his picture, offering a slightly used field marshal for sale. The page attracted bids of over $100,000 before it was shut down.

Such mockery can be dangerous to practice inside Egypt, where many Sisi critics languish in jail. But the widespread mirth that the gag inspired seemed to illustrate how the presidents aura has dimmed.

In Mr. Sisis defense, government officials point to external factors driving the crisis. The countrys already-struggling tourism industry, a crucial earner of foreign exchange, was devastated after a Russian airliner crashed in the Sinai Desert on Oct. 31, probably as a result of a bomb. The countrys tourism minister says that the slump has cost Egypt $1.3 billion in revenue since then, and that the number of visitors to the country was down 44 percent in January.

Egypts Gulf allies, like Saudi Arabia, used to give the country generous aid  some $30 billion in the first two years of Mr. Sisis rule  but since last summer that has slowed to a trickle. Low oil prices have also reduced remittances sent home by Egyptian workers abroad, and have cut into traffic at the Suez Canal, where Mr. Sisi inaugurated an $8 billion expansion last summer.

The wealthy make up only a small fraction of Egypts 90 million people, while 26 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, according to the United Nations. And they are increasingly living apart, in Palm Beach-style gated communities ringing Cairo, far from the crumbling infrastructure and chronic poverty of the city center.

But it is really businesses large and small that have been bearing the brunt of the currency crisis. General Motors has a car plant in Egypt, but it had to temporarily halt production recently because it could not get the parts it needed. Foreign airlines have threatened to curtail flights to Egypt because of rules blocking them from repatriating profits. For a time, British Airways stopped selling tickets in Egyptian currency.

At the Gezira Sporting Club in Zamalek, an island in central Cairo, wealthy parents said they were struggling to pay their childrens tuition at private schools that require payment in dollars or euros. Sisi has lost popularity with the upper segment of society, said a businessman, Ashraf Omran. He gave a good story, and people want to believe in it. But you need to follow through. We havent seen that.

The argument has been most heated on influential TV stations that were once staunchly pro-Sisi but have now adopted a more critical tone. I hated that speech, Youssef al Hosseiny of ONtv said, referring to Mr. Sisis much-derided remarks last week. He looked isolated, and he looked angry. Hes been in power for just 20 months. Its too early to be isolated.

The presidents popularity has been hurt by more than just the economy, Mr. Hosseiny said. The recent imprisonment of a TV evangelist, a novelist and a poet, all on charges related to religion and public morality, has stoked worries about free speech. Government critics are regularly prevented from leaving the country, including the journalist Hossam Bahgat and the human rights advocate Gamal Eid.

And after a policeman shot and killed a taxi driver two weeks ago in an argument over a fare, a furious crowd surged through the streets, defying laws that ban public protests.

Still, there remain plenty of Egyptians, rich and poor, who continue to see Mr. Sisi as a bulwark against the instability that has roiled other countries in the region.

At a sale for imported designer fashions on the banks of the Nile last weekend, Hala Mahmoud defended the president. People are trying to frame Sisi, as if he did something wrong, she said. But hes a military man, and we face a lot of problems here. Look at Syria or Iraq, where is no country left. Weve got to work with what we have.

To older Egyptians, the shortages of luxury goods recall earlier periods of economic belt-tightening in the 1990s and 2000s. We understand it, said Hany Genena, chief economist at Beltone Financial, an investment house in Cairo. Noting that many foreign investors see Egypt as an attractive medium-term bet, he said, Just forget the next two years.

Young Egyptians may have less patience. At the American University in Cairo, Nada el Halaswany, a recent graduate, said her family had voted for Mr. Sisi. But the hotel her father manages on the Red Sea is virtually empty now, and she is applying for jobs in Dubai.

I dont see any positive change on the horizon, she said.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-11 00:00:00,"Video Review: The BMW 750i xDrive, Tranquillity With a Touch of Vegas",['Tom Voelk'],"A case could be made that modern automobiles are the most impressive consumer products created. Sophisticated cars contain more than 100 million lines of computer code (apparently all of Facebook comes in at about 60 million), and you probably dont leave your laptop outside in the rain, snow or blistering heat for days on end. If you do, please write and tell me why.









The new 2016 BMW 750i xDrive folds an entire Best Buy of technology into a sedan and then takes on Boeing for good measure with a carbon-fiber-rich chassis that reduces weight by 190 pounds. If Apple is truly serious about building cars, Ill wager BMW could quickly counter with a credible smartphone.

While new owners could easily hop in and drive away without consulting the manual, mastering the features could take a few days. Bullet points include a traffic jam assistant that semiautonomously keeps the car paced and placed within its lane during rush hour.

There is night vision should the LED headlamps not be brilliant enough, and an 8-speed transmission that takes cues from GPS to anticipate shift dynamics. Hand gestures can control phone and sound system functions  usually. I had some hiccups, and Ill note again that Im not crazy about BMWs transmission selector.

Ultimately, though, this car is not about gadgetry. For the lucky ones whose garages are graced by this machine, its about indulgence. The 750i tranquilly runs with a 4.4-liter, 8-cylinder engine with two twin-scroll turbos tucked in the V. Rich torque helps usher the car from rest to 60 miles an hour in 4.3 seconds.

Using GPS, electromechanical dampers and adjustable antiroll bars, BMWs adaptive suspension provides a serene ride quality. Agility is courtesy of all-wheel steering and the expected BMW chassis tuning.

In sport mode, the car feels as if half a ton has been lifted from its 4,600-pound mass, but the sixth-generation 7 Series is no M3, nor is it meant to be one. Please, BMW purists, hold your venomous tongues. Dynamics are impressive and appropriate for this class, which includes the Audi A8 and Mercedes S-Class. Chill out and buy an M235i to romp around in.

The 7s back seat probably has the same volume as an entire 2 Series cabin. All 7 Series brought to the United States are of the long-wheelbase variety (for now, anyway). Equipped with the Executive Seating package, it pampers chief executives with a removable Samsung tablet that controls entertainment and iDrive features. Doing its best Optimus Prime impression, with the push of a button the car can transform its right side into a true first-class experience with a footrest deploying from the front passengers seat back. The gyrations of seats, screens and footrest can cause children to go bonkers (adults, too, though theyre loath to admit it).

It appears the Bavarians have been visiting Las Vegas. The cabin lighting is mesmerizing. LEDs rim the panoramic roof, illuminating a pattern etched into the glass. A spiral glow graces a speaker in the superb Bowers & Wilkins sound system, proving music can look as good as it sounds. Even people walking by get a taste of the owners good fortune; the puddle lamp pattern is a work of modern art.

Starting at $82,295 for a 740i ($129,245 as driven), this stealth luxury ride has a polish and depth that demand time to truly grasp. The cabin is stuffed with inlaid wood and offers sumptuous seats. The large key fob has smartphone envy, its touch screen offering information on vehicle range and whether the doors are locked. In other markets, it can dispatch the 7 to saunter off on its own to park. In reality, it may be a chauffeur behind the wheel. Perhaps what BMW has built is the Ultimate Riding-In Machine.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-13 00:00:00,The Neocons vs. Donald Trump,['Jacob Heilbrunn'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

THERE they go again. The neocons who led the George W. Bush administration into Iraq are now touting a fresh crusade to save American democracy  and the Republican Party  from an authoritarian foe: Donald J. Trump.









Their campaign began with an impassioned essay in The American Interest last month by Eliot A. Cohen, a former Bush State Department official, who depicted Mr. Trump as symptomatic of the broader moral rot of America. Then, in an open letter, more than 100 hundred Republican foreign policy mavens, including neocons such as Mr. Cohen and Robert Kagan, as well as more traditional Republican foreign policy figures like the former World Bank president Robert B. Zoellick, announced they were united in our opposition to a Donald Trump presidency.

Now, in a last-ditch effort, leading neocon thinkers have established what they call the National Security Advisory Council to support Senator Marco Rubio. And many are announcing that if push comes to shove, they will support Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump. Indeed, in the magazine Commentary, the neoconservative historian Max Boot wrote, somewhat hyperbolically, that Mr. Trump is the No. 1 threat to American security  bigger than the Islamic State or China.

The neocons are right that a Trump presidency would likely be a foreign policy debacle, not least because of his unpredictable personality and penchant for antagonizing foreign leaders and publics. But they are wrong in asserting that he is somehow a danger to the traditional principles of the Republican Party. On the contrary, Mr. Trump represents a return to the partys roots. Its the neocons who are the interlopers.

The extent to which the neocons and their moralistic, crusading Wilsonian mission overtook the Republican foreign policy establishment, beginning in the 1970s, was so nearly complete that it can be hard to remember that a much different sensibility had previously governed the party, one reminiscent of Mr. Trumps own positions: wariness about foreign intervention, championing of protectionist trade policies, a belief in the exercise of unilateral military power and a suspicion of global elites and institutions.

Consider the 1919 League of Nations debate, the crucible in which much Republican foreign policy was forged. In leading the charge against United States membership in entering the league, the Republican senator Henry Cabot Lodge argued that intervening abroad would undermine American security: If you tangle her in the intrigues of Europe, you will destroy her power for good and endanger her very existence.

By the 1920s, the Republicans took Lodges logic a step further. So-called mossback Republicans supported the punitive Immigration Act of 1924, which included provisions barring Asians and restricting African immigrants. The party also backed protectionism: In June 1930 Herbert Hoover signed the Smoot-Hawley tariff, which worsened the Great Depression and stoked nationalism around the world.

The partys embrace of outright isolationism culminated in opposition to aiding Britain once World War II began in 1939. Liberal Republicans like Henry Stimson and Frank Knox were drummed out of the party at the 1940 convention for joining the Roosevelt administration, the first as secretary of war and the second as secretary of the Navy. At the same time, The Wall Street Journal editorial page argued for realism toward Hitler, who, it assured its readers, had already determined the broad lines of our national life for at least another generation.

After World War II, the right remained suspicious of militarism. It denounced Harry S. Trumans sweeping alliances in Europe. In 1950, Herbert Hoover created a national uproar when he declared that America had to acknowledge limits to its power. Meanwhile, Senator John W. Bricker of Ohio proposed constitutional amendments aimed at destroying the presidents ability to conclude foreign treaties. And in 1951, another Ohio senator, Robert A. Taft, announced, The principal purpose of the foreign policy of the United States is to maintain the liberty of our people.

One can hear echoes of this Republican past in Mr. Trumps own positions. His animating credo on foreign policy seems to be to farm out the heavy lifting to other countries whenever possible. Speaking on The Hugh Hewitt Show last August, he made his distaste for intervention clear: At some point, we cant be the policeman of the world. We have to rebuild our own country."" Since then, to the consternation of the party establishment, he has also forthrightly denounced the Iraq war, declaring that the Bush administrations case for it was based on a lie.

The Trump doctrine, if that term can be employed, is reminiscent of basic foreign policy realist tenets. In fact, as Thomas Wright of the Brookings Institution first pointed out in Politico, Mr. Trump has a remarkably coherent and consistent worldview. Mr. Trump, you could even say, is a spheres-of-influence kind of guy: Europe should take care of Ukraine, Russia should handle Syria. When I see the policy of some of these people in our government, he said on MSNBC this month, well be in the Middle East for another 15 years if we dont end up losing by that time because our country is disintegrating.

At the same time, hes rejected the idea of repudiating the Obama administrations Iran deal, and says that its important to remain neutral in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians  two points that strike at the heart of Republican neocon orthodoxy. And he seems to have little use for alliances: Hes demanding that countries like Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia pay more for the United States to defend them. At the same time, hes ready to slap high tariffs on Japan and China  something that could trigger a global depression.

Mr. Trumps position can resemble realism on steroids. At bottom, he doesnt want America to lead the world; he wants the world to get out of its way. Even many die-hard realists are unwilling to follow him: Last Friday his sinister advocacy of torture, which he has since disavowed, prompted not only neocons but prominent realists like Andrew J. Bacevich and Richard Betts to sign a letter called Defending the Honor of the U.S. Military from Donald Trump in Foreign Policy.

None of this seems to antagonize the Republican base, which appears less ideological on taxes and foreign policy than the party elite. Once George W. Bush and the neocons led us into Iraq, it was probably only a matter of time before the neocons were called to account. Maybe the surprising thing isnt that the party is starting to morph back into its original incarnation, but that it took this long.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-13 00:00:00,Andrew Schneider Now Embraces Glitches in Youarenowhere,['Alexis Soloski'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

On the first night of Andrew Schneiders performance piece Youarenowhere, which played the experimentally inclined Coil festival in 2015, Mr. Schneider gathered his crew and gave a pep talk entirely devoid of any pep.









I know weve been working on this very hard, and weve done everything possible, he recalled saying. But I just dont think its going to work. Its going to be a disaster. Its going to be horrifying and terrible. I might die.

This was only mild hyperbole. During rehearsal, a heavy curtain rig had ripped out of the theaters ceiling and crashed to the floor.

But Mr. Schneider did not die. Youarenowhere, which has begun an encore run at 3LD Art & Technology Center and continues through April 3, became one of the most talked-about shows of the festival and has toured successfully since. A chaotic mix of personal revelation and relativity theory, enhanced by some alarming and splendid visual effects, the show established Mr. Schneider, who had created and run video for the Wooster Group for many years, as a significant artist in his own right. It highlights the particular ways he integrates technology, much of it untidy and homemade and somehow organic, into live performance.

He wasnt always so vanguard. Mr. Schneider grew up in Milwaukee, the child of two school administrators, and earned a B.F.A. from Illinois Wesleyan University, specializing in musical theater. At 34, he still possesses an aw, shucks quality to his demeanor, a shyness and eagerness that leaven his cool-kid cred.

On a recent rainy morning at 3LD, he arrived 15 minutes late, a consequence of a flat bicycle tire. (Technical glitches, large and small, are a hallmark of his work. And his life.) He was dressed in a shredded scarf, bright blue pants, a black T-shirt, a light black jacket and black sneakers, which was perhaps too little considering the weather, but a lot more than Mr. Schneider wears in performance.

In Youarenowhere, he appears only in pants and boots. Is there a particular reason for this shirtlessness? Does it speak to a quality of the character he plays, or does it help to cue some of the audio and visual effects? After all, Mr. Schneider, who earned a graduate degree at N.Y.U.s Interactive Telecommunications Program, has a sideline in wearable tech, most famously the solar bikini, a swimsuit that can recharge a cellphone.

No, he explained. He just never found the right shirt. A white T-shirt? he asked. A button-down? A tank top? It doesnt make sense to me. But theres a lot about Youarenowhere that doesnt make sense  its genesis, its unforeseen triumph and the piece itself, at least as it appears on the page. Even its title, which can be read as You Are Nowhere or You Are Now Here, is a conundrum.

After college, Mr. Schneider spent a couple of unhappy years in New York, lining up for casting calls and booking roles in regional productions. His baritone typed him as a villain, and he played the dentist in Little Shop of Horrors three separate times. It wasnt especially rewarding. On the advice of friends he had met while interning with the Wooster Group and the Builders Association, he enrolled in the N.Y.U. graduate program. My parents were kind of devastated that I wasnt going to be doing musical theater anymore, he said.

He joined the Wooster Group just after finishing his degree. The position, video technician, wasnt initially very creative. During their production of Hamlet, he remained offstage, for like 90 shows or something, pressing three keys on a keyboard, he said. But it offered a stable salary, benefits and the chance to work with artists he admired.

He longed to perform with the group but was so shy that for years he barely spoke to anyone. Still, he brought in items hed created, like gloves that could cue sound effects, or a robot cat. Some lacrosse sticks that had built-in sound effects and the ability to glitch out video were nearly part of Cry, Trojans! in which Mr. Schneider finally appeared as an actor. But an enthusiastic fight scene destroyed them.

Elizabeth LeCompte, the Wooster Groups artistic director, said that she would have used Mr. Schneider and his devices earlier if he hadnt been so timid. He was so shy about bringing them in that I thought he didnt want us to use them, she said. But she noted that during his tenure, he began revealing himself very slowly and beautifully, until he became a center mover in the company. When she put him onstage, she discovered a focus and interiority that made you want to watch him. He has some kind of a private aura that is very powerful, she said.

But even when he was at last performing with the company, he was already thinking about leaving it, making his exit in mid-2014. The touring schedule allowed him to make only very short works of his own. I had so many ideas for making things, it was no longer sufficient to insert my ideas piecemeal into Wooster Group shows, he said. In 2012, he began creating the first elements of Youarenowhere, and in 2013, Vallejo Gantner, the artistic director of Performance Space 122, commissioned a full-length version, about an hour long, for the Coil festival in 2015.

Youarenowhere began with a lighting idea, a black frame rigged with LED lights that could black out a performers face while illuminating the rest of the body. As Mr. Schneider tinkered with that, he began assembling text, writing some weird stuff to say. The result is a not especially coherent collage of ruminations on alcoholism, relationships and quantum mechanics. There is also a Ricky Nelson song. I know the stories that I really want to tell, but Im generally not very good at telling them, he said.

Rather than working in Microsoft Word or popular playwriting software, he created the piece using music and video programs like Ableton Live and Final Cut, so that the words were intimately twinned with the lighting and sound. He calls this technique curating emotion without narrative.

After seeing a rough draft of the script and then a work-in-progress showing, Mr. Gantner urged him to reconsider the form and maybe some of the content, particularly a flabbergasting coup de theatre. We just didnt think anybody could pull it off, Mr. Gantner said, speaking by telephone.

Mr. Schneider had his own doubts, too. He wasnt sure he could ask audiences to watch a performance without a story. And he worried that the programming and equipment, which hed built himself, would break down in performance, which they did.

But somehow the piece was a success. Mr. Gantner called it a jaw drop. The show managed to seem deliberate and accidental, controlled and entirely unpredictable.

These are qualities that apply to Mr. Schneider as a performer, too. As Rachel Chavkin, a director who is working with him on a coming project, noted, Hes precise as hell, and also theres this messy heart fluttering within. His ability to integrate the technical into his performance, making it somewhat inextricable from his own body, is more or less unparalleled. As Lars Jan, who directed Mr. Schneider in the recent The Institute of Memory (TIMe), explained, He wears lights, video, sound like an organic exoskeleton.

Mr. Schneider is developing a musical based on a Mac Wellman novel, in collaboration with Heather Christian and Ms. Chavkin, and a show that borrows from the light and space artists of the 1970s to explore hallucination.

He continues to refine Youarenowhere. The glitches that plagued the early showings have mostly been remedied. Though these malfunctions were once a source of incredible worry, Mr. Schneider now finds that he misses them. He has built a few deliberate bugs into the show and has also created a safe word, spacebar, which he deploys when he wants to halt the preprogrammed material and go off script for a while, he said, so that everyone feels like anything could still happen.

Even now, he finds himself amazed that the show happens at all  after all the doubts, after all the disasters, after all the years spent alone in his apartment messing with a lighting effect or a sound cue. I cry every night during the show, he said. I tear up at the end. Every show. Because I cant believe that it works.",[]

Few would dispute the notion that apartments have become over-the-top expensive for many New Yorkers. But just how very far out of reach can still be surprising.









The median price of a studio, long considered an entry-level apartment, in Manhattan is now $485,000, according to the Corcoran Group. If that price does not make your hair stand on end, consider that in the coveted submarket of Downtown Manhattan, the median price of a resale condo studio hit $863,000 in the last quarter of 2015.

But back to the buyer in the half-million-buck bracket. What this will purchase in Manhattan is likely little more than a single room with a windowless kitchen.

For those who absolutely must be in the city, the other boroughs are generally cheaper, and the offerings roomier. But the trade-off for that extra square footage might be limited shopping and dining options, so-so schools and long commutes.

Using online services like nytimes.com/findahome and StreetEasy.com, it was possible to find many existing apartments and houses for $500,000 or less beyond Manhattan in places such as Grymes Hill, Staten Island; Sunset Park, Brooklyn; and Spencer Estates, the Bronx.

And if you require natural light while making breakfast, take heart: Many of the kitchens came with windows. Most of the places were an improvement over their Manhattan counterparts in some way.

Were the last of the Mohicans, said Charles Bludeau, a salesman with Douglas Elliman Real Estate who represents a two-bedroom condo on the water in Spencer Estates for $489,500. Where else can you even go?

Brownstone Brooklyn

If a Brooklyn neighborhood has a hill in the name, as in Boerum or Cobble or Vinegar, it is fair to assume it may be pricey. A heights, as in Brooklyn Heights, is probably not the place to hunt for bargains, either.

But finding an apartment for less than $500,000 that improves upon a similarly priced Manhattan studio does appear possible in neighborhoods like these, although the upgrade may be slight.

For example, 111 Hicks Street, Apt. 15A, in Brooklyn Heights, which was offered late last month for $425,000 and has already drawn many interested buyers, does not on paper seem a big step up. Its a studio, and its price is steep for Brooklyn Heights. According to the Corcoran Group, the median price for a studio in the area that includes Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, Dumbo and Downtown Brooklyn was $385,000 in the fourth quarter of last year.

Then again, the 500-square-foot unit has an appealing layout, and the kitchen is not a wall of appliances. Its a separate, windowed room, which has, moreover, been renovated. The ceiling is beamed, and there is quite a bit of storage space. A better yardstick might be the one-bedroom median for the area, which was $549,000.

And the yellow brick co-op building has a pedigree. Designed by Emery Roth and completed about 1929, it was once part of the massive Hotel St. George complex.

The 30-story tower is not hemmed in by like-size structures, but looms over a low-slung neighborhood that is protected from development by a historic district. From Apt. 15A, views sweep south and east.

What kept this $425,000 unit under the $500,000 mark was its relatively high maintenance fee of $1,005.95 a month, said Zelda Josephs of Zelda Josephs Real Estate, who is listing the unit, and who is a longtime resident of the co-op. The full-service building has an operating budget of about $5 million a year, according to the co-ops website.

That maintenance bill may be about a couple hundred dollars higher than a typical studio in Brooklyn, but you wont find this in Manhattan, Ms. Josephs said. And if you found it in Manhattan, it would be way, way more.

Beyond Brownstone Brooklyn

In the borough of Brooklyn in its entirety, the median sale price for a studio in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $426,000, according to Corcoran.

But beyond the popular brownstone-lined neighborhoods close to Manhattan, brokers say, prices drop off, which means buyers who search slightly farther afield may be rewarded.

For instance, Sunset Park, which is near Park Slope and has similar rowhouse architecture, though some of it is in rough shape, seems to offer deals. Late last month, 605 41st Street, Apt. Q, a two-bedroom, one-bath co-op, was for sale for $364,000.

Buyers who like historic details may incline toward the unit, one of 20 in a walk-up brick building completed in about 1921 by Finnish developers who constructed several co-ops in the area. Geometric inlays enliven the floors in the 725-square-foot space. Wallpaper also adds vintage charm, though few would preserve the dated kitchen, which still has an ice box, cooled solely by the outside air, tucked into a wall.

Buyers hoping to finance the purchase should look elsewhere. The co-op prohibits bank loans, an obstacle that partly explains the low price. Otherwise, this apartment could sell for about $550,000, said Paul Hyun, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman, who added that, Finns didnt believe in debt, and the building prefers to keep it this way.

If cash deals offer opportunities for discounts, so does a lack of elevators, Mr. Hyun said. Had there been one in the building, which offers views of the Statue of Liberty, the price for this fourth-floor apartment might be a heftier $650,000, he said.

Still, even if a buyer had to break the bank to land the unit, he or she would have a relatively easy time keeping current on the maintenance. Its just $311 a month.

Staten Island

When thoughts turn to ownership, Manhattan residents might focus on apartments, but a house might offer smoother sailing in the other boroughs.

The buyer of a house will encounter no persnickety co-op board to scrutinize his or her finances. Nor will house-buyers be subject to fees for condo-style amenities, like pet spas and tween rooms, that they would never use.

In Grymes Hill, on the north shore of Staten Island near Wagner College, a three-bedroom Cape at 32 Cunard Place offers an amenity that might be more popular: an in-ground swimming pool in a small, neatly landscaped yard. Theres also an elevated, shaded patio from which to admire it.

With a finished basement and driveway, the 1,300-square-foot house was listed last month for $479,000, though its rooms, some of which sport pink or mirrored walls, might be in line for a makeover. On the other hand, 32 Cunard received a new furnace and hot-water heater last year, so the buyer wont have to worry about that for a while.

Buyers likely wont mistake quiet Grymes Hill for a trendsetting hood. People always say, Why cant we become like a Hoboken or Williamsburg, because we have a waterfront, too?  said Christopher J. Long, an associate broker with Gateway Arms Realty Corporation, referring to the north shore in general. But youve got to have the restaurants, the shopping, the bars, added Mr. Long, who has the listing for 32 Cunard, and who grew up in nearby West New Brighton and lives there today.

Several neighborhoods on Staten Island are the site of major investments in new retail. Meanwhile, buyers are hopping on board the ferry. The median sale price of houses on Staten Island in January hit $438,000, surpassing the prerecession peak in May 2005 of $435,000, according to the Staten Island Board of Realtors, which also noted that inventory is the lowest it has been in a decade.

What Im seeing now, said Mr. Long, who has been selling homes since 2000, is something Ive never seen before.

The Bronx

To make your money go far, there may be no borough like the Bronx. Three hundred and ninety apartments and houses there were for sale for $500,000 or less on Feb. 26, according to StreetEasy, at a median list price of $215,500. And of that group, 18 listings could be picked up for less than $100,000.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But StreetEasy and nytimes.com/findahome are heaviest in listings clustered in the northwestern Bronx, in the more expensive neighborhoods like Spuyten Duyvil and Riverdale. Instead, brokers say, consider the multiple listing service offered by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, which casts a wider net. On Feb. 26, it generated 717 sub-$500,000 results.

Spencer Estates, 12 miles from Midtown in the northeastern Bronx, where Mr. Bludeau has the listing for that two-bedroom $489,500 condo, may not register on the radar of many buyers. The condo itself is more than a mile from the nearest subway, so the units two dedicated parking spots may come in handy. On the bright side, the enclave faces Eastchester Bay and offers views of City Island and Long Island.

Thick with modest stand-alone houses in brick, clapboard and vinyl from the mid-20th century, Spencer Estates is not postcard New York City. Mr. Bludeaus condo, at 1424 Outlook Avenue, Apt. 1, is part of the Outlook Point Condominiums, a gated 36-unit complex that opened in 2002 and could be at home in the suburbs.

Besides a pair of bedrooms, the 1,022-square-foot apartment has one bath, five closets and views of a marina from the master bedroom. Waves lap on the rocky shore a few steps away from the ground-floor unit. For a monthly common charge of $379, an owner has use of laundry facilities and an on-site fitness center.

Trend-spotters have not planted a flag here just yet. First, wide-scale development needs to happen in the Bronx, to correct decades of disinvestment, according to Mr. Bludeau. Only then will the existing housing stock get the attention it deserves, he said, hazarding a guess that moment is five years hence. That will be the time frame when it will really blow up, he said.

Queens

Queens may be known for its stand-alone houses, but theyre hardly the only style of housing available. And the others tend to be lighter on the wallet.

In late February, the borough had 239 co-op apartments for sale for $500,000 or less, according to a search of nytimes.com/findahome listings. Single-family houses? Just 93 in that price segment.

And those co-ops, which started at $53,000, werent just found in urbanized Long Island City, but also in more suburban neighborhoods like Whitestone, Forest Hills and Bay Terrace. Jackson Heights, in central Queens, also packed them in, with 26.

One of the Jackson Heights entries, 34-35 82nd Street, Apt. 21, a two-bedroom, one-bath apartment in a brick Beaux-Arts walk-up, could silence anybody who thinks Queens does not have pizazz.

Listed at $488,000 with Teresa Reid, a saleswoman with Daniel Gale Sothebys International Realty, and now under contract, the second-floor apartment has nine-foot ceilings, hardwood floors and a nicely flowing 1,150-square-foot layout, plus numerous eye-catching details.

Built-in bookshelves line the living room. Both granite and wood were deployed for kitchen counters. And the bath, redone in 2015, gleams in white tile.

The five-story building, which opened in 1915 and went co-op four years later, lacks the leafy central garden of many larger prewar buildings in the area. But it does have a small courtyard.

The sellers, William Bryant, an architect, and his wife, Joanne Liou, who manages construction projects, moved to Jackson Heights from the Upper West Side in 2006 in search of more space. The unit cost $337,000, near the peak of that market, and it required a major renovation.

Though property values have clearly appreciated, Mr. Bryant, who is moving to Long Island, said it is curious how Jackson Heights, which regularly tops lists of best-value neighborhoods, still seems to be waiting for its moment. I guess theres still a perception that Queens is Queens, he said.

But based on the enthusiastic turnout for a recent open house for the apartment, he believes progress is being made. The secret is out more than it was then, he said. But your money still goes a long way here.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-13 00:00:00,The Neocons vs. Donald Trump,['Jacob Heilbrunn'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

THERE they go again. The neocons who led the George W. Bush administration into Iraq are now touting a fresh crusade to save American democracy  and the Republican Party  from an authoritarian foe: Donald J. Trump.









Their campaign began with an impassioned essay in The American Interest last month by Eliot A. Cohen, a former Bush State Department official, who depicted Mr. Trump as symptomatic of the broader moral rot of America. Then, in an open letter, more than 100 hundred Republican foreign policy mavens, including neocons such as Mr. Cohen and Robert Kagan, as well as more traditional Republican foreign policy figures like the former World Bank president Robert B. Zoellick, announced they were united in our opposition to a Donald Trump presidency.

Now, in a last-ditch effort, leading neocon thinkers have established what they call the National Security Advisory Council to support Senator Marco Rubio. And many are announcing that if push comes to shove, they will support Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump. Indeed, in the magazine Commentary, the neoconservative historian Max Boot wrote, somewhat hyperbolically, that Mr. Trump is the No. 1 threat to American security  bigger than the Islamic State or China.

The neocons are right that a Trump presidency would likely be a foreign policy debacle, not least because of his unpredictable personality and penchant for antagonizing foreign leaders and publics. But they are wrong in asserting that he is somehow a danger to the traditional principles of the Republican Party. On the contrary, Mr. Trump represents a return to the partys roots. Its the neocons who are the interlopers.

The extent to which the neocons and their moralistic, crusading Wilsonian mission overtook the Republican foreign policy establishment, beginning in the 1970s, was so nearly complete that it can be hard to remember that a much different sensibility had previously governed the party, one reminiscent of Mr. Trumps own positions: wariness about foreign intervention, championing of protectionist trade policies, a belief in the exercise of unilateral military power and a suspicion of global elites and institutions.

Consider the 1919 League of Nations debate, the crucible in which much Republican foreign policy was forged. In leading the charge against United States membership in entering the league, the Republican senator Henry Cabot Lodge argued that intervening abroad would undermine American security: If you tangle her in the intrigues of Europe, you will destroy her power for good and endanger her very existence.

By the 1920s, the Republicans took Lodges logic a step further. So-called mossback Republicans supported the punitive Immigration Act of 1924, which included provisions barring Asians and restricting African immigrants. The party also backed protectionism: In June 1930 Herbert Hoover signed the Smoot-Hawley tariff, which worsened the Great Depression and stoked nationalism around the world.

The partys embrace of outright isolationism culminated in opposition to aiding Britain once World War II began in 1939. Liberal Republicans like Henry Stimson and Frank Knox were drummed out of the party at the 1940 convention for joining the Roosevelt administration, the first as secretary of war and the second as secretary of the Navy. At the same time, The Wall Street Journal editorial page argued for realism toward Hitler, who, it assured its readers, had already determined the broad lines of our national life for at least another generation.

After World War II, the right remained suspicious of militarism. It denounced Harry S. Trumans sweeping alliances in Europe. In 1950, Herbert Hoover created a national uproar when he declared that America had to acknowledge limits to its power. Meanwhile, Senator John W. Bricker of Ohio proposed constitutional amendments aimed at destroying the presidents ability to conclude foreign treaties. And in 1951, another Ohio senator, Robert A. Taft, announced, The principal purpose of the foreign policy of the United States is to maintain the liberty of our people.

One can hear echoes of this Republican past in Mr. Trumps own positions. His animating credo on foreign policy seems to be to farm out the heavy lifting to other countries whenever possible. Speaking on The Hugh Hewitt Show last August, he made his distaste for intervention clear: At some point, we cant be the policeman of the world. We have to rebuild our own country."" Since then, to the consternation of the party establishment, he has also forthrightly denounced the Iraq war, declaring that the Bush administrations case for it was based on a lie.

The Trump doctrine, if that term can be employed, is reminiscent of basic foreign policy realist tenets. In fact, as Thomas Wright of the Brookings Institution first pointed out in Politico, Mr. Trump has a remarkably coherent and consistent worldview. Mr. Trump, you could even say, is a spheres-of-influence kind of guy: Europe should take care of Ukraine, Russia should handle Syria. When I see the policy of some of these people in our government, he said on MSNBC this month, well be in the Middle East for another 15 years if we dont end up losing by that time because our country is disintegrating.

At the same time, hes rejected the idea of repudiating the Obama administrations Iran deal, and says that its important to remain neutral in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians  two points that strike at the heart of Republican neocon orthodoxy. And he seems to have little use for alliances: Hes demanding that countries like Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia pay more for the United States to defend them. At the same time, hes ready to slap high tariffs on Japan and China  something that could trigger a global depression.

Mr. Trumps position can resemble realism on steroids. At bottom, he doesnt want America to lead the world; he wants the world to get out of its way. Even many die-hard realists are unwilling to follow him: Last Friday his sinister advocacy of torture, which he has since disavowed, prompted not only neocons but prominent realists like Andrew J. Bacevich and Richard Betts to sign a letter called Defending the Honor of the U.S. Military from Donald Trump in Foreign Policy.

None of this seems to antagonize the Republican base, which appears less ideological on taxes and foreign policy than the party elite. Once George W. Bush and the neocons led us into Iraq, it was probably only a matter of time before the neocons were called to account. Maybe the surprising thing isnt that the party is starting to morph back into its original incarnation, but that it took this long.",[]

TOKYO  Of the thousands of workers who have answered the help-wanted ads at Fukushima Daiichi, the ruined and radioactive nuclear power plant in northeastern Japan, the part-time lettuce farmer and occasional comic-book artist Kazuto Tatsuta must be among the least likely.









I needed a job, Mr. Tatsuta, 51, recalled of his decision in 2012 to accept work at the site of one of the worlds worst nuclear accidents.

His duties included welding broken water pipes and inspecting remote-controlled robots that survey radioactive hot spots. And his comic strips, once populated with baseball players and gangsters, now tell stories of middle-aged, blue-collar men like himself who do the grunt work at Fukushima, some of whom find a sense of purpose and belonging they lacked in the outside world.

Its secure. Youre not going to get laid off there, Mr. Tatsuta said. But youre also working for a goal.

Five years after a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck, causing three reactors at Fukushima to melt down, that goal is the focus of a colossal effort at once precarious and routine. A veneer of stability at the plant masks a grueling, day-to-day battle to contain hazardous radiation, which involves a small army of workers, complex technical challenges and vexing safety trade-offs.

Fukushima has become a place where employees arrive on company shuttle buses and shop at their own on-site convenience store, but where they struggle to control radiation-contaminated water and must release it into the sea. Many of the most difficult and dangerous cleanup tasks still lie ahead, and crucial decisions remain unsettled.

Theres no precedent or manual, said Prof. Tatsujiro Suzuki, a former vice chairman of the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission who is now at Nagasaki University.

A smooth cleanup is a top priority for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who wants to rebuild Japans tattered nuclear power industry. He has had little success so far. This week, a court ordered one of only two atomic power stations operating in the country to shut down, saying new safety measures it put in place after the Fukushima disaster were inadequate. More than 40 reactors are sitting idle.

The effort at Fukushima has reached a few milestones. About 1,500 spent fuel rods were successfully removed from a damaged storage tank in late 2014, a delicate and risky operation. Much of the contaminated rubble left by the tsunami and hydrogen explosions has been cleared, and overall radiation levels are down. Workers will soon be able to enter some areas of the plant without full-body protective gear.

But a full cleanup of the site  including the extraction of melted uranium fuel from the damaged reactor cores  is expected to take at least 40 years according to the governments timetable and a century by other estimates. In the meantime, officials acknowledge, Fukushima remains vulnerable.

The question is, Is there a Plan B to deal with another big quake or tsunami? Professor Suzuki said.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The duration of the cleanup also creates the risk of labor shortages, he said, especially in jobs requiring special skills. Japans population is shrinking and, with the future of nuclear power uncertain, many young people are unwilling to stake careers on the industry.

For now, Fukushima is bustling with about 7,000 workers, much more than before the disaster and twice as many as two years ago. The town of Iwaki to the south has become a kind of workers village. At dawn, vans and buses line up to ferry workers to the plant via staging areas where they don protective white Tyvek suits, radiation monitors and gas masks.

You think of it as totally normal work, said Mr. Tatsuta, who asked to be identified only by his pen name to avoid being blacklisted by the plants owner, Tokyo Electric Power Company.

Water is perhaps the biggest challenge at Fukushima. Engineers must keep it flowing through the damaged reactor cores to prevent the melted fuel from overheating, and then through miles of plastic pipes to recycle it inside the plant. But because the buildings are damaged, radioactive water leaks out and builds up in the basements. When it rains, more water seeps in.

To prevent it from spreading, Tokyo Electric pumps out about 720 tons of water from the basements every day, storing it in huge tanks that workers are building. About 1,000 of the tanks have already been filled. But because there are not enough tanks, the plant also releases 2,000 tons of the water into the ocean every week after a process that removes most, but not all, of the radioactive particles.

Tokyo Electric says the water poses no danger to people or marine life because radiation levels are low and further diluted in the ocean. But environmentalists are worried, nearby fishing grounds remain closed and it is a public-relations nightmare for the government.

Other workers are building a mile-long ice wall around part of the plant to prevent rain and groundwater from seeping into the basements. The plan is to pump chemicals into the soil to freeze it, but the technique has never been used on such a large scale before.

The company says it may not be able to solve the water problem until 2020. Other goals, including the removal of spent fuel rods stored inside the reactors, are still further off.

And then there is the problem of the melted nuclear fuel itself. Tokyo Electric has ruled out burying the buildings in thick layers of concrete as the Soviets did at Chernobyl, because so much radioactive material remains that it could explode during the burial process or burn through the concrete or into the ground.

Robots have recently begun mapping out areas around the cores, which are still too dangerous for workers to approach. Engineers are trying to determine if cracks in the containment vessels can be repaired, which would allow them to fill the cores with water to ensure the fuel remains submerged as it is extracted, minimizing the risk of releasing radiation. The process is expected to take decades and cost billions.

For workers at the site, radiation is a constant enemy  though many see it more as a threat to their livelihoods than their lives. Government regulations forbid cleanup workers from being exposed to too much radiation, and when they hit the limits, they risk being laid off or reassigned to lower-paying jobs.

If you go over the radiation limits, you cant work, Mr. Tatsuta said. Youre always calculating how to keep the dose low.

The temptation to cheat can be strong, for both workers and their managers. A government examination of Tokyo Electrics safety practices in 2013 found that it had underreported the radiation exposure of a third of the workers whose records were reviewed. The company says it has since tightened reporting procedures.

Minoru Ikeda, 63, a retired postal worker, said he joined the cleanup in 2013, over his wifes objections, because of a sense of social obligation and curiosity. Fukushima felt so close and so far away at the same time, he said. I wanted to see for myself.

Photo

He started out cutting contaminated weeds in a town deserted since the accident and stuffing them in plastic bags. Mountains of collected soil and leaves have piled up across the region, as politicians debate how to dispose of it.

Eventually, Mr. Ikeda got work in the plant itself, picking up papers and broken glass in the administrative offices. There was still sand on the floor from the tsunami, he recalled, and newspapers dated March 11, the day of the disaster.

He later wrote a memoir describing the rhythm of life in the cleanup zone, where almost the entire work force is male and many have little history of stable employment.

Because it took so long to change in and out of protective gear and pass through radiation checks, he usually worked only two to three hours a day, he said. In off hours, he and his colleagues slept, drank or played pachinko, a Japanese gambling game that resembles pinball.

Mr. Ikeda still carries a small radiation book, similar to a bank passbook. Over 15 months, it shows, he was exposed to 7.25 millisieverts, well below the regulatory limit but still high enough that, should he contract cancer during his lifetime, he would be eligible for workers compensation.

Mr. Ikedas last job at Fukushima involved the destruction of used protective coveralls. Tens of thousands had been compacted into cubes for incineration, but they were too big for the incinerator. Mr. Ikeda and his team broke the cubes apart and repacked the coveralls in smaller bundles.

The works not hard, he said, if you dont think about radiation.",[]

WASHINGTON  Federal regulators on Thursday proposed a set of privacy rules for Internet service providers that would significantly curb the ability of companies like Comcast and Verizon to share data about their customers online activities with advertisers without permission from users.









In the proposal, before the Federal Communications Commission, the agencys chairman, Tom Wheeler, called for broadband service providers to disclose clearly how data may be collected about users online browsing and other activities. The plan also called for the companies to bolster the security of customer data.

The rules, if approved, would establish first-time privacy rules for the companies that manage the traffic of the web and would create some of the strongest privacy regulations for any segment of the technology and telecommunications industries. It is the first major regulatory action of broadband providers after the F.C.C.s declaration last year that high-speed Internet carriers should be treated like utilities.

In a statement, Mr. Wheeler said that since Internet service providers handle all network traffic, the companies have a broad view of all of your unencrypted online activity. He added that even when data is encrypted, your broadband provider can piece together significant amounts of information about you  including private information such as a chronic medical condition or financial problems  based on your online activity.

The regulations, if approved, would put broadband providers under stronger privacy oversight than Internet companies like Google and Facebook. Those companies are monitored by the Federal Trade Commission, whose ability to create specific privacy rules is limited.

Many privacy advocates have pushed for a greater role by other agencies because the F.T.C. cannot create rules for online privacy and can only monitor data collection practices as an enforcement agency.

This is nothing short of a historic moment, said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy advocacy group. Unlike the Federal Trade Commission, the F.C.C. has the legal authority to enact safeguards that will allow an individual to have real control over how their information can be gathered and used.

Some privacy experts said Internet service providers were capable of stitching together a more complete picture of a consumer by tracking the sites a customer visits using its network. Because more devices in the home are now being connected to Wi-Fi, the broadband providers also have more ways to collect data on their customers for online advertising, said Harold Feld, a senior vice president of the nonprofit media advocacy group Public Knowledge.

In an enforcement action against Verizon this week, the F.C.C. found that the wireless company was using supercookies to continue tracking the activity of users through mobile browsers even when the customers tried to delete cookies  small files created by sites that are stored on devices and used to track activity  from browsers and clear their browsing history.

The F.C.C.s proposal on Thursday has already drawn protest by telecom and cable companies, which have pointed to the F.T.C. as a strong privacy enforcer. But the F.C.C. has argued that after it reclassified broadband as a utility, it was compelled by law to create privacy rules.

In a recent blog post, AT&T said Internet service providers were collecting less data as more sites become encrypted. Also, consumers are choosing virtual private networks that prevent broadband providers from seeing the sites people visit, the company said. Websites like Google are leading behavioral advertising companies that should be held to the same standards as broadband access providers, AT&T said.

Given the realities of this complex market, there is no basis for treating I.S.P. data as somehow proprietary or subjecting I.S.P.s to unique privacy requirements, wrote Bob Quinn, senior vice president of AT&Ts federal regulatory affairs, referring to Internet service providers. Consumers expect and deserve consistent privacy protections for their online data, regardless of which company is collecting it and the technology used to collect it.",[]

UPDATED: You can now hear this essay read by actor Stephen Bogardus, followed by a conversation with the writer Marc Jaffe, in Modern Love: The Podcast. Look for the play button below.









Somehow our three children were out of the house and otherwise engaged, leaving my wife and me a rare moment to ourselves. So I suggested to Karen that we take advantage by heading straight to the bedroom.

She rebuffed me, asking, How do men get anything done when theyre thinking about sex all the time?

Perhaps I could have come up with some explanation, but thats not really what she was after. We had been married for 15 years by then and were raising three daughters.

In addition, Karen was a busy ob/gyn and part-time mohel. Our opportunities for having sex were scarce. Karens interest was even scarcer.

Friends who married long before I did told me that passion may wane in a marriage, but the love doesnt have to. This was from couples who were still in their 20s.

I couldnt believe it. To me, single and looking for love and sex, the two seemed so intertwined that I couldnt imagine one ending while the other blossomed. Fifteen years into my marriage, I was hoping that just a touch of rekindled lust would enable my love to more easily flourish.

Karen wasnt as concerned about commingling those twin emotions. Her point of view was reinforced each day at work when her patients complained how their interest in sex had faded to the background of lifes challenges.

For these women and my wife, there had to be the perfect confluence of events for sex to happen. My wifes requirements were that her job had to be going well, the children didnt need her attention, the house had to be clean, the temperature had to be between 76 and 84 degrees, and the Democrats had to control at least one branch of government.

Her patients would ask if there wasnt some pill that would let them ignore the externals and give them back their desire. Karen would assess the acuteness of the concern and try to offer a solution, but she knew there was no magic pill. All she could do was commiserate.

She would come home and tell me how typical we were and that I would just have to deal with my oversize libido like all the other unsatisfied married men out there.

Then we learned she had Parkinsons.

Suddenly we were faced with new challenges that completely outweighed any issue of unequal sexual desire. Our fantasy of the next 35 years had included Karen staying in a job she loved for as long as she wished and then for the two of us to shift to a retirement of travel and newfound hobbies.

That image was replaced by one depicting her early exit from the job she loved and a retirement filled with financial concerns, frequent doctor visits and uncertain health.

Our first adjustment was to try to live in and enjoy the present. It took a few months of finding the right medication and dosage, but since Karens Parkinsons was in the early stages and could be controlled, it wasnt long before her natural optimism took over.

For now she would be living her same life, with the minor addition of keeping a secret (so as not to alarm anyone or harm her career), and taking some pills each day.

Those pills would change our life more than the Parkinsons.

Some of the most common Parkinsons medications have a potential side effect of compulsive behavior. This can destroy lives when, for example, formerly staid members of the community end up gambling away their life savings or compulsively shopping their way to financial ruin.

Thankfully, my wife suffered neither of those side effects. What she did experience, however, was hyper-sexuality.

It started slowly. I would set the mood for a romantic evening and gird myself for the familiar rejection only to have her say yes. The positive reinforcement led me to try again a few days later, and again I was rewarded.

Soon I stopped hearing no entirely. Then she was the one suggesting we race to the bedroom when an opportunity arose.

More than suggesting, she insisted. Unlike my meek, hopeful forays, she began to demand it, urgently and often and in places I never dared.

Her former parameters for sex also became somewhat more generous. Now she merely had to have a job, the children had to be alive, the house had to be standing, the temperature had to be between 0 and 104 degrees and the Democrats had to control at least one branch of government. The combination of those things happening all at once occurred with great frequency.

I was thrilled with our renewed sex life, and so was Karen. She kept saying how happy she was to be back in the club.

She could no longer relate to her low-libido patients, but did wonder if there may be some way of prescribing her drug as an off-label aphrodisiac. Its used for restless leg syndrome as well as Parkinsons. But medical ethics kept her from doing that.

Meanwhile, Karens Parkinsons progressed to the point where she had to increase her medication. I wondered whether this might also increase her obsession with sex.

I got my answer a week later when out of the blue she asked me the exact same question she had asked a few years before, although this time with a different inflection and wholly different meaning.

Rather than being dismissive of and confounded by male behavior, she asked plaintively and with empathy: How do men get anything done when theyre thinking about sex all the time?

Thats when I started to fade. Whether it was the excessive demand, an aging libido or psychological stress (knowing that if I didnt perform, she would have to go to other medications with potentially worse side effects), I was no longer able to consistently please her. Sex became more obligation than joy. I looked for ways to avoid it. In two short years we had completely switched roles.

Perhaps if I had my usual support of friends and family to talk through all this, I might have been O.K. But we were still living in fear of discovery, keeping everything hushed. I would soldier on.

To keep going, I sought help from my doctor in the form of Viagra or Cialis, but he was reluctant to prescribe erectile dysfunction drugs for an otherwise healthy 52-year-old male. Beyond that, he didnt know which medication would be best for me if he even accepted that one was necessary.

He asked about our frequency of sex. I told him nine to 12 times a week.

Oh, he said. I didnt realize the severity of the problem. He wrote me prescriptions for all the drug options and told me to let him know which worked best.

Its understood that when one spouse gets Parkinsons, the other spouse will be affected by it. But we never expected that I would have to start taking medication to help with the side effects of my wifes medication. She was cursing her amped-up libido for what it was doing to me. Something had to give.

What gave was the secret we had kept for two years: her diagnosis. Karen decided that the consequences of going public and perhaps losing her job (and of course enduring all the mohel with Parkinsons jokes shed be subject to) couldnt be worse than living in this bubble we had created.

So she began to tell people, and when she did, everyone was sympathetic and supportive, which allowed Karen to focus her obsessive behavior into something worthwhile: fund-raising and advocating for Parkinsons research.

Her newly found voice allowed us to start a foundation, Shaking With Laughter (we joke that shes Shaking and Im Laughter), that has raised nearly $700,000 for Parkinsons research in four years.

Three years after Karens coming out, she retired from her medical practice and we now work together on the foundation, being partners in a way we never were before.

After 25 years of marriage, our sex life has slowly reverted to a dynamic more common to couples who have been married for decades, not weeks.

The Parkinsons, relentless as it is, has progressed. Karens interest in sex has not only been redirected, but also tempered considerably by the advancing physical complications of the disease.

Last year we became empty nesters. This is the time I envisioned long ago when she and I would travel and rekindle our sex life. My libido isnt as strong as it was before the diagnosis, but it is back to being stronger than Karens.

Im O.K. with that. Im thankful for our multiyear interlude of youthful lust. We were each given the rare opportunity to be on opposite ends of the desire spectrum and have an appreciation and understanding of this common sexual divide.

And in the end, my married friends were right: There may be a limit to passion, but love flourishes.",[]

Han Tak Lee, 81, spends much of his time alone in a small room in Queens. Its a ground-floor studio apartment with a kitchenette and a bathroom, right beside train tracks used by the Long Island Rail Road. Commuter trains roar by every so often, though the double-glazing of his windows reduces the noise to a gentle whoosh.









His cramped living situation begs a comparison to the way he spent most of the past quarter century. From 1990 to 2014, he was locked away in a series of prisons in Pennsylvania, serving a life sentence for murdering his daughter in a fire. Two years ago, however, a judge exonerated Mr. Lee and ordered him freed after determining that his conviction was based on theories about arson that had later been discredited. An appellate court upheld the ruling in August.

Yet Mr. Lee, a free man now, still seems bound by his imprisonment. The experience weighs on him as he reckons with his past and considers the final stretch of his life. And he admits to feeling bitterness.

I still think its totally unfair that I had to serve 24 years in prison, he said in an interview. Im innocent.

He has been surviving on Social Security payments and, more so, on the largess of people who have sympathized with his plight. A support group that formed while he was in prison raised tens of thousands of dollars to help with his legal fees and, after his release, to help pay for his rent and living expenses. But that fund has nearly dried up, and Mr. Lee recently contacted Ron Kim, a Democratic state assemblyman, seeking assistance in finding subsidized housing.

He wants to live with dignity for the rest of his life, Mr. Kim said.

Though in his ninth decade, Mr. Lee, a Korean immigrant who became a naturalized American citizen, is not confronting the challenges of his current circumstances with anything resembling meekness. He is angry at the justice system for locking him up and taking so many years of his life. He is resentful toward his ex-wife, who divorced him while he was in prison. He is estranged from his surviving daughter and her family, he said. He has accused the leadership of his former church of not sufficiently coming to his defense when he was being investigated, even as the church raised about $80,000 over the years to help pay for his legal representation. And he has alienated some of his most ardent supporters.

Chris Chang, the spokesman for the support group, said the prison experience had left Mr. Lee suspicious of everyone and their motives, leaving him prone to sudden changes of heart. This unpredictability has led some of his supporters to keep their distance, friends said.

Like a volcano, Mr. Chang said.

Mr. Lee is unapologetic. I recognize my personality but thats because of the many experiences Ive had, he said. I am resolute. I am different.

He added: I was fully exonerated. It gave me the confidence to be more vocal.

In two interviews with Mr. Lee at his apartment, he seemed mostly cheery and good-natured, patiently answering questions about his life in Korean and rudimentary English and laughing frequently. His mood darkened somewhat only when the conversation turned to the subject of his ex-wife and daughter.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

I dont want to talk about my family, he said sharply. (A member of the support committee provided a phone number for Mr. Lees daughter, but calls went unanswered.)

To be frank with you, Mr. Lee has a very special character, said Kyung Tahk Sohn, who attended high school in Seoul with Mr. Lee and is a co-president of the support committee. He has a very quick temper. Thats why his words hurt them here and there.

In my case, Mr. Sohn continued, Ive known him a long time, I feel like hes my older brother. Thats why I just help him and whatever he says I try to understand him and read his mind. Thats why Im the only one who can talk to him freely.

The fire that killed Mr. Lees daughter occurred in July 1989 at a religious retreat in the Poconos run by the church he attended at the time.

Mr. Lee, who ran a clothing store and lived with his then-wife and two daughters in Sunnyside, Queens, had taken his oldest daughter, Ji Yun, to the retreat at the urging of the churchs pastor. Ms. Lee, who was 20 and an art student at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, had been suffering from severe mental illness. He hoped the trip would help her.

Early one morning a fire broke out in their cabin. The authorities found Mr. Lee sitting stoically outside the burning cabin with two packed bags, the ABA Journal, a publication of the American Bar Association, reported in an article about the case. His behavior, deemed strangely passive by investigators, became part of the prosecutions case against him. Ji Yuns burned body was found inside the cabin.

At the trial, prosecutors, citing the testimony of fire experts, argued that the specific charring patterns and glass fracturing indicated a deliberately set fire, and that the arsonist had started the fire in at least eight different spots in the cabin using a mixture of home fuel oil and another accelerant, according to news reports. One expert witness said a chemical analysis of Mr. Lees clothes suggested a link to a plastic glove and a jug said to have been used to pour the fuel.

In defending Mr. Lee, his lawyer argued that Ji Yun had set the fire herself. Mr. Lee said he had been asleep when the flames broke out and had unsuccessfully tried to rescue his daughter.

The jury sided with prosecutors, and he was convicted of murder and arson and sentenced to life in prison.

His case became a cause celebre among Koreans in the United States, and his trial was closely followed in South Korea. After his arrest, members of the Korean population in New York formed the support group, called the Free Han Tak Lee Committee, and in the ensuing years raised tens of thousands of dollars to help pay his legal fees.

Mr. Lee said that in prison he was very isolated, keeping largely to himself and living for years in his own cell. He never encountered another Korean during his entire time behind bars, he said.

In 2014, a magistrate judge in Harrisburg, Pa., found that long-held beliefs about the science of fire, which were at the core of the prosecutions case, had been discredited. A federal judge adopted the magistrate judges recommendation that Mr. Lees conviction and sentence be vacated, and Mr. Lee was released. Prosecutors unsuccessfully appealed the decision to a federal appeals court.

After he left prison, Mr. Lee moved into his current home, just off Northern Boulevard, in Murray Hill, a middle-class neighborhood with a large Korean immigrant population. He said he chose to live there because it was near his sister, who lives on Long Island.

Four days a week, he goes to a senior center where, he said, he takes exercise and dance classes and eats meals.

Sometimes, in the evening, he meets with members of his current church. But otherwise he is mostly by himself in his apartment, which is dominated by a large bed with a saffron-colored bedspread. The room is cluttered with the flotsam and jetsam of a curious man  or a man who for years was deprived of possessions: stacks of printed material neatly piled on tables and a small desk, including books, magazines, fliers and store brochures; a quiver of small American and South Korean flags; an empty Starbucks cup; pill bottles; a paper Burger King crown. A framed naturalization certificate is one of the few adornments on the walls. His television is often on.

Pennsylvania does not provide compensation to people wrongly convicted of a crime, and Mr. Lee has not filed a lawsuit over his wrongful imprisonment. But his lawyers are looking at whether he has a remedy available, said Peter Goldberger, a lawyer who has represented Mr. Lee for about 15 years.

The support committee has been paying his rent  $1,000 per month  and giving him a monthly allowance of $700, Mr. Chang said. But with the money running out, the members are trying to find alternative, cheaper housing for Mr. Lee.

Mr. Kim, whose district includes Murray Hill, said city officials had done a full assessment of Mr. Lees living situation and health and were considering his case. In addition, the assemblyman is working with community groups to figure out ways to help him.

Im putting myself in his shoes and trying to understand about how he was able to cope with being locked away for so many years and to be back and finally have his freedom yet is struggling to live with some sort of integrity, Mr. Kim said. Theres such a feeling of injustice.

But Mr. Lee is far from giving up. Mental focus, he declared. Endurance.",[]

My Own Words, a collection of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburgs writings, will be published by Simon & Schuster in January. The book will include her writing and speeches on a variety of subjects, like her Jewish identity, gender equality, interpreting the Constitution, and the way lawyers and the law are depicted in opera. It will have an introduction by Justice Ginsburg, who was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1993.

Justice Ginsburg is one of the most important and articulate legal thinkers and interpreters in the country, Alice Mayhew, the vice president and editorial director of Simon & Schuster, who acquired world rights to the book, said in a statement. She is also a witty and engaged writer and speaker, and I am personally delighted to have another opera lover on board.

Ms. Mayhew, who has edited books by President Jimmy Carter, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Bob Woodward and others, has also acquired Justice Ginsburgs authorized biography, which is being written by the Georgetown Law professors Mary Hartnett and Wendy W. Williams.

Ms. Harnett and Ms. Williams will select the writings compiled in My Own Words, and will write introductions to each of the chapters, with biographical information and other context.

Justice Ginsburg, 82, was the second woman appointed to the Supreme Court, after Sandra Day OConnor. She has taken up gender-based discrimination as one of the signature issues of her legal career. She has already become a pop-culture phenomenon, as captured in the Tumblr blog-turned-book, Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The book, written by Irin Carmon and Shana Knizhnik, is a chatty biography that features fan art of Justice Ginsburg in the form of nail art, shoulder tattoos, cartoons and baby Halloween costumes. It has more than 145,000 copies in print, and is in its seventh printing.

At a public lecture in Italy earlier this year, Justice Ginsburg was asked what she thought about the images collected in the book and fanss extravagant displays of devotion.

In the words that the current generation uses, its awesome, she said. Its quite unbelievable that at age nearly 83 everyone wants to take a photograph with me.

As for the mugs and the T-shirts that is fine, she continued, but the tattoo... that is a bit much.",[]

Aesthetically speaking, Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a cheery curio, as if a scrapbook and the Talmud decided to have a baby. Pages are filled with photographs of the Supreme Court justice old and young (ravishing, by the way). More entertaining are the dozens of images of her rendered in every conceivable medium  as nail art and shoulder tattoos, as needlepoint samplers and bronze busts, as surrealist watercolors, deadpan cartoons and somber illustrations. (Fear the frill, says one, referring to her signature jabots.) Woven throughout are excerpts from Justice Ginsburgs most influential opinions, with added blocks of scholars commentary strutting down the margins.









Notorious RBG began in 2013 as a saucy Tumblr blog by Shana Knizhnik, then a law student, shortly after the Supreme Court decided Shelby County v. Holder, which discarded a crucial provision of the Voting Rights Act. (For the hip-hop unlettered, Notorious RBG is a play on the Notorious B.I.G., the rapper who was murdered in 1997.) Justice Ginsburg read her dissent from the bench, which in the genteel, marbled universe of the Supreme Court, is most unusual  the equivalent of shaming your spouse in front of dinner guests. More unusual still was that shed read two other dissents from the bench the day before.

Photo

Almost overnight, she became a supersignifier of liberal idealism, with Washington artist-activists plastering stickers and posters saying, Cant Spell the Truth Without Ruth all around town. A cottage industry of Ginsburgiana  greeting cards, T-shirts, homemade Halloween costumes (Ruth Baby Ginsburg, in the case of toddlers)  was born, and Ms. Knizhniks Tumblr became a clearinghouse for it. Objets de Ruth are now part of the temple of highbrow kitsch, along with Freud bobblehead dolls and Shakespeare rubber ducks.

Though Ms. Knizhnik collaborated on the research and reporting of Notorious RBG, its her co-author, Irin Carmon, an MSNBC journalist known for her smarts and feminist bona fides, who wrote the book and gives it its distinctive voice. (Ms. Knizhnik also curated the images, naturally; and checked the facts.) As Ms. Carmon explains in a prefatory authors note, she and Ms. Knizhnik are both #millennials, which some readers may take as an early typographical cue to close the book and slowly back away.

This book is not for them. Notorious RBG may be a playful project, but it asks to be read seriously. Its an artisanal hagiography, a frank and admiring piece of fan nonfiction. One chapter is devoted almost entirely to Justice Ginsburgs workout (impressive) and lace collars (she owns at least a dozen). Early on, we learn that Justice Ginsburg was a fan of Nancy Drew as a child, and Notorious RBG, with its earnest superhero framing, reads like a Nancy Drew novel itself: After years of toil, often in the shadows, she is poised to explain to the country just what is going wrong. Its an Honest Abe tale for the 20-something set.

Justice Ginsburgs story of self-invention is pretty remarkable. At Harvard Law, she was one of just nine women, and she didnt have access to one of the reading rooms. (Never mind that she was a member of the law review.) She was refused a clerkship with Justice Felix Frankfurter in part because she was a mother, in part because he liked to curse and didnt wish to watch his language. When she argued her first case before the Supreme Court, Justice Harry Blackmun rated her a C+ in his diary. (Very precise female, he wrote.)

To this female book critic, who will hand in her review to a female editor, who in turn reports to another female editor, this cold universe of belittlement is unimaginable. That I responded so personally to it is a testimony to Ms. Carmons storytelling and panache. I was especially moved by the chapter about Justice Ginsburgs husband, Marty Ginsburg, which confirmed Sheryl Sandbergs dictum, The most important career choice youll make is who you marry. Mr. Ginsburg cooked for Justice Ginsburg, made professional sacrifices for her, and at one point proclaimed, I think that the most important thing I have done is enable Ruth to do what she has done.

Read his note to her 10 days before he died. I dare you not to cry.

This book is also a direct descendant of contemporary feminist websites (Ms. Carmon spent two years as a staff writer at Jezebel) and as such, has not just their strengths  wit, sharp consciousness-raising  but also, on occasion, their weaknesses (a Manichaean worldview, a lack of tonal maturity).

I am not sure this books target audience will much care. Nor, Im guessing, will this audience care that the book doesnt wade too deeply into the marshes of Justice Ginsburgs jurisprudence. Ms. Carmon does a fine job of showing how shrewd Justice Ginsburg was as a womens rights lawyer, deliberately taking on male plaintiffs who had been disenfranchised in their caregiver roles. Through a discreet back door, she established a meaningful body of law that said neither mens nor womens rights should be determined or limited by sex.

But Justice Ginsburg always insisted that progress should come in slow, methodical steps rather than extreme gestures. In 1993, she gave a famous (one might say notorious) lecture that decried Roe v. Wade because the decision invited no dialogue with legislators, but wiped out, in a single stroke, every states abortion law.

Ms. Carmon mentions this lecture. But as the book winds down, she does not so much as remark upon  much less reckon with  the idea that Justice Ginsburgs belief in incrementalism might live in tension with her recent votes on marriage equality, which invalidated many state laws and made no overtures to state legislatures at all. Yet these votes clearly suggest that she sometimes does see a role for the courts as an agent of transformative social change.

Perhaps Justice Ginsburg thought the country was ready for marriage equality. Perhaps she saw these landmark same-sex marriage cases as legally different from Roe v. Wade  as two instances of the law providing a clear answer, rather than begging for discretion. For now, we cannot say.

There is much about Justice Ginsburg that remains enigmatic. The achievement of Notorious RBG is that the authors make this unassuming, most studious woman come pulsing to life. A colleague of the justices once said, The anecdote that describes her best is that there are no anecdotes. In this way, Justice Ginsburg is a bit like the Mona Lisa, whose likeness has also launched a thousand fanciful appropriations. To be a scrim for the worlds projections, it helps to be a little hard to read.",[]

When a fireball whizzed over Florida on Jan. 24, more than a hundred witnesses reported spotting the flare on the American Meteor Societys website. Within a week, Mike Hankey, an amateur meteorite hunter based thousands of miles away near Baltimore, was holding a muddy chunk of the space rock he found near a swamp.









With A.M.S. we are connecting the sky to the ground, Mr. Hankey, 43, said, referring to the fireball tracker he manages for the American Meteor Society, a nonprofit organization that monitors fireballs and meteor showers, when hes not running a software development business. People are seeing this object in the sky and then a few weeks later they are holding it in their hands.

Since last October, citizen scientists like Mr. Hankey have uncovered fragments from at least three different fireball sightings using data collected and analyzed by the society. For his Florida hunt Mr. Hankey reconstructed the trajectory of the fireball from the eyewitness reports and then compared it with Doppler radar readings he received from a colleague at NASA. Doppler radar are normally used to measure rain clouds and weather patterns but on occasion they catch a meteors path through the sky. Using both tools, Mr. Hankey pinpointed where the fireballs fragments could have fallen.

A fireball, if you dont know, is a bright meteor that streaks through Earths atmosphere, usually breaking apart and scattering into small pieces. Most chunks that land on Earth are small, weighing a few pounds at the most. But on occasion they can be large and destructive, like the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013, and was captured on multiple dashcam videos. The fireball that flew over Florida did not cause any damage, but it too was caught on a dashcam.

Photo

With the newly drawn treasure map, Mr. Hankey embarked on a 13-hour drive to Jacksonville, Fla., in search of a bounty billions of years old.

Once there he met with a few other amateur meteorite hunters and they began searching a large ranch near the maps metaphorical X, but found nothing. On the second day they set their sights on some swamps near Osceola National Forest.

Photo

The team walked through muddy trails, but again found nothing. Then, as Mr. Hankey paused for a stretch, he spotted a glimmering black rock, about the size of a thumbnail, amid the dried out grass. The team scored its first meteorite.

Its a neat rush, Mr. Hankey said. He had been on five hunts previously, but had not found one himself. Its been traveling for hundreds of millions of miles for billions of years and came down in this giant explosion, and Im the first person to look at it and find it.

Two hours later the hunters made their second find about a half a mile away, and the next day they found a few more.

They had hit the jackpot he recalled thinking. There are meteorites everywhere around here.

After several days he drove back home. Some of his colleagues stayed behind another week and unearthed their biggest treasure: an 840-gram fragment about the size of a tennis ball. In total the team found six meteorites.

The team mailed samples from the hunt to Alan Rubin, a geophysicist at U.C.L.A. who later confirmed their finds. Dr. Rubin said in an email that he suspected the meteorite they recovered experienced several intense collisions before breaking from its parent asteroid and plummeting to Earth. The teams finds were only the sixth time that meteorite chunks were found in Florida, according to Mr. Hankey. It was also the first time in that a team of meteorite hunters had recovered fragments in the state from a fireball that people had witnessed. Most of the previous meteorites found in the state had been dug up years after they fell.

Reached by phone in Pittsburgh last month, where he was conducting yet another hunt, Mr. Hankey said: For me to find a meteorite from a fireball I tracked, and find it meters away from where I said it would be its supreme validation, to be like, Wow, I connected all these dots.",[]

NAZARETH, Israel  Long before he was a professional basketball player in Israels most prestigious league, Karam Mashour honed his game on one of the only courts in this city: the tiny alleyway between his parents house and his grandmothers. The narrow sliver of concrete and portable hoop came with very specific challenges  duck low if you want to dribble to the right but avoid a collision with the electrical box jutting out from the window, for example  yet Mashour never dwelled on the setting.









There was no point, mostly because there was no alternative.

Everyone here plays football, Mashour said. When my brother and I told people we wanted to play basketball, they said, Why?

Mashours story, and his current place at the heart of fourth-placed Bnei Herzliyas roster, is undeniably unusual. In a league full of Israeli Jews, top Europeans and talented Americans, Mashour is the only player of Arab heritage. And, perhaps more pointedly, in a country where more than a fifth of the eight million residents are Arab, Mashour is one of only two to play in the top division in more than decade.

In an interview at his parents home here, Mashour said repeatedly that he did not see himself as any kind of pioneer or leader  I dont think of myself that way, I just want to be a basketball player, he repeated often  but his arrival in the league has brought forward the larger question of why basketball has not yet found the same popularity in Israels Arab community as it has among the countrys Jews.

According to Hagay Segal, a communications official with the Israel Basketball Association, about 10 percent of the 35,000 registered basketball players in the country are Arab. Of that group, Segal added, a majority are women and youth players, as opposed to adult men.

Its just not in our culture, not like football, said Fadi Mustafa, a leading sports broadcaster who produces Israels only Arabic soccer television program. There are no courts in the Arab sector, no infrastructure. The first time I ever played basketball was when I was 15; we didnt know the rules, we just threw the ball in the basket. Nobody knew or cared or wanted to know. It was easier to just put down a few stones for goals and play soccer.

He added: I remember, they tried to do a basketball tournament once at the community center but had to cancel it. No one wanted to actually play right.

Yair Galily, a professor who has studied and written extensively on sports and Israeli society, said that basketball played a part in the Americanization of Israeli culture, but added that some elements of that shift, including an attraction to basketball, had not taken root in the Arab community.

There is often an element of circular logic to the issue, Galily said: public infrastructure in predominantly Arab cities in Israel is frequently lacking (there are often fewer buses or rail links, for instance) and so, by extension, there are generally fewer courts or organized programs for basketball in Arab communities, too. That means there are precious few high-level players for children to admire, making them less interested in basketball as a sport and making leaders less inclined to push for more courts or programs.

Think about how many role models there are for Arab children in football, Galily said. In basketball, its a tiny, tiny fraction of the number. It makes it hard for a sport to grow.

That reality is not limited to Israel; when the Dallas Mavericks signed Salah Mejri, a Tunisian center, last year, they gave the N.B.A. its first Arab player since Rony Seikaly, a Lebanese center, retired in 1999.

The history of Arab basketball players in Israel is glaringly thin, too. The first Arab-Israeli to play in the top division, according to the league, was Nizhar Dahi, who played for Maccabi Netanya during the 1987-88 season. Since then, the league said, there have been only three other Arab players in the first division, the most successful of whom was Rafat Chider, who scored a total of 220 points in five seasons. By comparison, Manshour  who is being tipped as a candidate for the leagues rookie of the year award  has scored 155 points in 20 games this season alone, averaging 7.8 points and 4.0 rebounds a game. Earlier this season, he scored 25 points against Israels most-storied team, Maccabi Tel Aviv.

Despite his reluctance to be in the spotlight, Mashour conceded that his accomplishments may increase the likelihood of young Arabs hoping to someday be like him instead of, say, Zahi Armeli or Walid Badir, two of the countrys most famous Israeli-Arab soccer players.

Football is so big; even my family, they come to the games and they say, Karam scored a goal tonight, Mashour said, laughing. But maybe this will open some doors. I would like to see more people interested in basketball.

Lior Lubin, a former coach in the Israeli Premier League who now works closely with many of the countrys top youth basketball players, said Mashours continued rise could be a critical boost to the development of the game in Arab communities. If Mashour signed with Maccabi Tel Aviv, for example, his visibility would skyrocket.

Photo

If he were to earn a spot on Israels senior national team  a prospect that is unlikely before this summers Rio Olympics but could be considered in a few years  the attention would be intense. The bigger the stage, the bigger the interest, Lubin said.

Basketball is not completely foreign in Israels predominantly-Arab communities or in the Palestinian territories. There is a fledgling Palestinian national team, though the local league there is more akin to a recreational operation than a professional one, and an interfaith program known as Peace Players International, which is designed to use basketball to connect young people in contentious or struggling areas around the world, has had success bringing Arabs and Jews together inside Israel.

But Lubin added that it was not until recently that Israels basketball federation began a program targeted at identifying players in predominantly Arab communities. Progress has been slow, he said, but there is a growing attention to the sport that had been missing in the past.

At a recent shooting clinic near Nahariyah, a coastal city in the north of the country, Lubin said 14 out of 40 participants were Israeli-Arab or Druze, an Arabic-speaking sect. . That sort of breakdown would have been impossible to imagine 10 years ago, when Mashour and his brother had to go to Haifa, nearly 30 miles from their home in Nazareth, to find a store that would sell them the basketball hoop that still hangs in the alley beside their house.

When Mashour first joined an organized team, he had to take a bus more than 30 minutes out of Nazareth to reach its practice site. It was the closest club, he said.

He had never even considered playing basketball until he was 13, which is when his brother, Saher, introduced him to YouTube clips of N.B.A. stars like Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Vince Carter and Allen Iverson. Immediately intrigued, Mashour began staying up until the wee hours of the morning to watch basketball on the Internet.

He and Saher also began to play, banging into the houses on either side of the alley as they bounced around their makeshift court. Mashour, who stands 6 foot 6 and plays as swingman, showed an instinctive talent early on, but it wasnt until his growth spurt, around 11th grade, that he said to himself, Thats it; this is my sport.

When he was 18, Mashour said his uncle, who lives in Las Vegas, suggested he move to the United States to see if his skills could earn him a college scholarship. Mashour leapt at the opportunity and caught on with a high-level A.A.U. team. Not long after, he was offered a scholarship by Lon Kruger, then the coach at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.

Mashour played two seasons at U.N.L.V. (he still frequently wears his team tracksuit) before transferring to Morehead State after Kruger departed. He sat out one season then played two more before returning to Israel last August.

Now, he is happy to be with Bnai Herzliya, a team with a strong fan base and serious ambitions based just outside Tel Aviv. Mashour said he has not encountered much direct attention from fans or opponents because of his ethnicity but said that he did his best to focus only himself as a basketball player.

He knows, though, that the reality is that he symbolizes something greater.

Sometimes I think about where I am now and where I started, on that court out there, he said, gesturing toward the alley. And I wonder if there are other kids here who want to do the same thing.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-13 00:00:00,"On an Italian Island, How He Met My Mother",['Jessica Silvester'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

When you pull into the port of Ponza, a tiny Italian island between Rome and Naples, you can see my grandfathers childhood home. Position yourself outward from the terra-cotta wall of the harbor, which is shaped like a crescent. Glance across the ombre Tyrrhenian Sea and up the western hillside specked with pastel doll houses. Look closely and you can spot one outlier, an eroding whitewashed facade haunting the cheery amphitheater like a holy ghost. There it is.









I dont know when exactly I decided Ponza was the place where Dan would connect with my dead mother. When we first started dating, I told him about the house as a way to impress him. Technically I was a part owner, along with a handful of both Italian and American relatives. In reality, this meant very little as a potential real estate inheritance  it had been abandoned for decades, and the family here and abroad seemed doomed to fight over it forever  but these were just details.

The house and the island were also a sort of indirect, nondepressing way of talking about my mother. She died of colorectal cancer a few months before Dan and I got together, when I was 23 and she was 55. I was wrecked with grief, a zombie covered in artificially bronzed skin and warm blond highlights, trying desperately not to seem like a downer. (Guys liked the girls who were all sunshine and travel stories.) I brought up my mother only in breezy contexts, such as the enchanting island where her father grew up: It was a mini Nantucket for Romans; it didnt appear on most maps, and the houses didnt have addresses.

I recounted moments from a family trip we took in 1996  my parents and their only child, my Uncle John and Aunt Anne and two cousins  when we rowed through blue grottoes and all but bathed in squid ink risotto. Even though that trip was the one and only time she visited Ponza, my mother never let me forget, Thats your heritage. If I won a swimming race at our town pool, shed fold over me with her glossy black perm and say, Thats your Ponzesi blood! If I seemed to be enjoying her stuffed calamari and oven-baked blue crabs on Christmas Eve, shed squish my cheeks with her smooth acrylic nails: My little Ponzesi. To this day, Im not certain whether I really liked the taste of seafood or just how pleased my mother looked to see me eat it.

As the years went on in my relationship with Dan, I of course expanded talk of my mother far beyond the subject of Ponza. Dan usually got quiet, blushing across his wide neck; he grew up in a movie parody of an Irish-Catholic Massachusetts household where emotions were best reserved for Red Sox games. But even had he emoted like an Italian, it wouldnt have changed the fact that he would never know her. He would never taste her food, never see her manicured-hand gestures, never hear us laugh as we did in Ponza at the rooster who terrorized my snoring father from outside our unventilated pensione.

I thought about all this not-knowing on the night Dan proposed one early December. (Were going to turn Christmas around for you, he said hopefully, after years of me more or less refusing to celebrate the holiday without my mother.) I thought about it on our wedding day, which came and went without any of her homemade biscotti for dessert. And I thought about it on our honeymoon, when we headed to Ponza.

On the bumpy two-and-a-half-hour ferry ride from Naples, I tried and failed to picture my grandfathers house  I guess I was a typical, preoccupied 14-year-old during that 1996 family vacation. I also acknowledged, maybe for the first time, how little I had actually researched this honeymoon, too wrapped up in the wedding and the fact that my mother wouldnt be there. Other than my Uncle Johns hotel recommendation and my risotto memories, we were going in blind. As the ferry slowed and a dreamy Wes Anderson palette of painted houses emerged, all I knew was, Ponza was a Very Meaningful Place.

We waited close to an hour in the summer sun for our transportation to come and barrel us up to the Chiaia di Luna hotel. There, as advertised on the website, the property looked out onto a spectacular sheer tuff cliff bleached by the northwest winds. Inside, the 230-euro-per-night room had barely enough space for our luggage and a purely decorative air-conditioner.

Then there was the challenge of finding my grandfathers house. All I knew was that it was on the Via Sopra Giancos, a street above an imperial Roman aqueduct. Contrary to Uncle Johns promise, nobody at the hotel seemed to know what I was talking about  mostly because they did not speak English and I, unlike my mother, could not speak Italian.

Photo

Between that afternoon and the next morning, with each failed attempt to get someone to point us in the right direction, the house began to loom larger and larger in my mind. Our hazy plan in coming here seemed to crystallize as a mission on which Something Meaningful must happen  a chance to find my mothers spirit, and for Dan to finally meet it.

At last, the hotel managed to call us Joe Mazzella, self-proclaimed as the islands one English-speaking taxi driver. A man who would fit right in with my movie parody of an Italian-American family, he shared the Mazzella name with my mother  its the Ponzesi equivalent of Smith. He grew up in the Bronx like her, too ( though he said they never knew each other), before moving back to the homeland (paradise) nearly 30 years earlier with his parents. He had a vague sense of which house I was talking about  the abandoned one  just not exactly how to locate it.

Joes mini-S.U.V. chugged farther and farther up the five-mile islands main road, terraced vineyards and fig trees sloping off to one side, religious statues and thatched-roof food stands lining the other. In our series of false starts and hairpin turns, Joe pointed out other notable residences. One belonged to Anna Fendi, that high priestess of all the pebbled-leather purses my mother could not afford on her teachers salary but occasionally bought herself anyway. Fendi, baby! she had stage-whispered when we were there so many years earlier and heard about the brands Ponza connection.

A string of locals guided Joe closer and closer to our target. Finally, he parked on an incline and said we had made it. Before Dan ducked his oversize head out of the car, he squeezed his clammy forefinger around mine. Joe led us up a steep flight of concrete steps and through a narrow dirt path, and there it was: a weather-beaten block of stone adjoined to a much shorter hunk of stone, which was the original house; my ancestors carved it directly out of the cliffside over a century ago.

There was a curved roof designed to collect rainwater, shattered pieces of ceramic tile, a dried-up well, boarded-up doors. In the front yard, tall bristle grass that Id been told my grandfather once used to sweep the floors gave way to overgrown grape vines alongside spurts of wild fennel and licorice. Dans mouth, like mine, was agape, but he didnt say much. He snapped pictures, offered hard numbers about how many hundreds of feet above the sea the house might be.

We looked onto the port below  it turned out the house was visible from way down there  and I wanted to feel as if I was standing in my mothers light. I wanted to sense a recognition flickering in Dans hard-to-read green eyes, a sudden release of the torso under his Red Sox tee, a narrowing of the gap that separated him from all my greatest memories. But Im fairly sure that didnt happen.

Why had I decided Ponza was such a Meaningful Place? Yes, I liked saying I owned property on a little Italian island that no one had ever heard of. Yes, my mother talked about it, felt proud about it. Yes, wed been there together. But we went lots of places together. We went to Ponza only once; she went to Ponza only once. Her father left in adolescence for a better life and died before I could meet him; on his last visit back, his family shunned him for abandoning them. And our Ponza relatives now wanted nothing to do with us other than to fight over the house. In the early days of dating Dan, Ponza was simply a vessel for talking about my mother; there was no reason it should have brought him any closer to actually knowing her.

All the same, its pretty cool to spend time on a little Italian island that no one has ever heard of. Weve returned twice since the honeymoon.

Anna Fendi once said Ponza is the only place in the last 30 years that has stayed the same. Indeed, most things havent changed on the island since I visited with my mother, and probably since my grandfather lived there. The drinking water still comes off barges from Naples; there are no movie theaters or proper hospitals (even though there are four churches); they use figs milk to treat foot fungus and wear unironic Ponza-shaped choker necklaces. A banner stretched across the main church features San Silverio, the islands patron saint, atop a world globe  except in this version of the earth there is only one landmass, and that is Ponza.

But some parts of the island have progressed. Most recently, theyve gotten their first stoplight, their first Williamsburg-inflected beer bar, their first school curriculum teaching tourism (and English!), their first D.O.C. seal on a crisp local Biancolella wine that tasted a little like apricots and didnt leave me hung over. Theres a new mayor, who is trying to make people get serious about paying taxes and who plans to install a desalination system by the end of 2017.

The way Dan and I see the island has changed, too. On our most recent trip, last June, we went for the San Silverio festival  its Bronx iteration is where my mother could once be found all dolled up in her white lace communion dress with a zeppole-smeared face. Dan and I took part in the whole centuries-old ritual from start to finish, joining the procession by land and then on a dinghy out to sea, surrounded by some 18,000 people (the islands population is only about 3,000 in the off-season, but on this holy day, it reaches peak tourism). Swarms of boats sounded their horns while fireworks and red carnations hit the air like exploding shrines. People cried in remembering the miracles the saint performed in their own lives: healing a sick child, clearing up a violent storm.

In our case, nothing especially magical happened. The sky did not crack open and rain my mothers biscotti into Dans mouth. Ponza still has not, as far as I can tell, become Dan and my mothers metaphysical bonding place. But it has become our place.

The day after the festival, we took a boat ride with a fisherman named Paolo. We passed volcanic-rock beaches, and ruins of Augustan-era villas, and Duomo-like natural arches. Dan and I snorkeled through rays of light while Paolo dove with his hunting knife to slice snails off the rock. We gorged on them between sips of cold prosecco.

As a parting gift, Paolo gave us each a seashell necklace. I assumed that Dan would conveniently leave his back at our Fendi-owned bed-and-breakfast, but in fact he put it around his big neck and didnt take it off for months. He wore it to work under his gingham shirts; he wore it on weekends under his merino wool sweaters. He only recently removed it because the rope started to smell like mildew, but he still sometimes kisses it for luck. It is a gesture so out of character I have to wonder whether he truly loves the necklace or just loves how happy it made me to see him wear it. Maybe he doesnt really know the difference.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-02-10 00:00:00,"When Women Fire Back, Are They 'Ferocious'? When Is a Critic a Scold?","['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Last week, The Times prominently displayed an analysis piece which explored the matter of sexist language and speech in the presidential campaign. Through interviews and other research, it showed how negative words such as shrill or shouting have been applied to Hillary Clinton, but not to her male rivals.

The piece was well reported and an interesting read. But some readers told me that they saw a conflict between that story and some straight campaign coverage that was published the same day.

An article on the fifth Democratic debate depicted Mrs. Clinton lobbing her harshest assault yet in the campaign. She appeared tense and even angry. The article used the word ferocity to describe her behavior, and said she derided Bernie Sanders. By contrast, Mr. Sanders kept his cool. His remarks were well-honed.

Teresa Kopec, a reader, wrote to me, objecting to the choice of words in the debate news coverage. She saw the debate as spirited but respectful on both sides, and found the language choice offensive.

Ms. Kopec wrote: Compare and contrast the words used to describe Mr. Sanders and Ms. Clinton. Sanders: cool, reiterated, well honed. Clinton: harshest, cutting, vitriol, deriding and tense. This is ridiculous. The NYT ought to be ashamed.

The journalist and author Rebecca Traister, who perceptively took up some of the gender issues in the presidential campaign in a recent New York magazine column, told me that she was struck by this, too.

There is no imaginative room for another read like she finally took the gloves off, or was forceful, or impassioned or drove home her point. Theres simply no room for this to have been anything other than a screwup that people will hate her for because she was unhinged. Meanwhile, our babysitter came in this morning and said, THAT was a relief! She finally told him off! I have been waiting for that! but the idea that anyone could have a positive reaction to a loud woman is beyond the scope of imagination.

And, Ms. Traister said, this depiction was especially irritating given Mr. Sanderss characteristic impassioned demeanor: He is always loud and combative.

A few days later, another gender-related issue brought reader mail. A headline on an article about two longtime feminists urging young women to support Mrs. Clinton read as follows: Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright Scold Young Women Backing Bernie Sanders. (The online headline has been changed and now reads, Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright Rebuke Young Women Backing Bernie Sanders.)

A reader, Dora OShaughnessy of Charlotte, N.C., wrote:

Scold? Nothing like treating these two amazing trailblazers like nagging old harpies. It feels like the person who wrote the headline is framing this like a catfight. The word criticize would not have been so offensive.

Another reader, Nadine Berrini, agreed: If the former secretary of state was a man, would your headline writer have chosen the word scold? I doubt it. Given the earlier article on gender and language, she observed: Right hand not talking to the left, it seems.

I took up the criticism with Philip B. Corbett, the standards editor, who writes the After Deadline blog on style and usage in The Times, and is the resident expert on language.

We have to be very aware of the perception of sexism and the impression that women are described differently, he said.

At times, Mr. Corbett said, it is more perception than reality. With a word like scold, we have many, many examples, he said, of the word being applied to men, including male candidates. However, he said, in describing women, it may carry a different tone and we really need to be sensitive to that. And, he said, perception matters; one cant simply blame readers for somehow reading it wrong.

Similarly, readers sometimes complain about descriptions of womens appearance in articles. In fact, Mr. Corbett noted, mens appearance is often noted, too, but the long history of defining and judging women by their appearance may mean that these descriptions are read differently.

As for the language in the debate story  derided for Mrs. Clinton, and reiterated for Mr. Sanders  he sees such reportorial interpretation as legitimate. But he had a caveat. Its largely what readers are paying us for, the ability of our reporters to be able to characterize what they are observing, he said. But, he said, We have to be aware that we gravitate to writing about conflict. That, he emphasized, can sometimes go too far.

Heres my take: The Times is obviously aware of the gender pitfalls, especially in a presidential campaign with a prominent female candidate, and generally avoids overtly sexist language or framing. (And yes, Bernie Sanders supporters, I know! I am well aware that Mrs. Clinton has nothing to complain about in terms of the relative amount of attention she has received in The Times; I happen to agree with you on that, and have pointed it out several times.)

But in articles where gender plays a role  just as in those involving race  unconscious framing needs attention, too. Cultural biases can creep in unannounced and should firmly be shown the door. Greater awareness (you could even call it consciousness-raising) would help.

Forceful, after all, doesnt have to equal ferocious. And a scold may just be someone whose passion is showing.",[]

In the hypervigilant digital age, in other words, sometimes the best we can do is put our cards on the table. Toward that end, I want to tell Times readers about my plans for the next few months.

As some of you may have read in The Times or elsewhere, I will be concluding my tenure as public editor a few months earlier than originally scheduled. I have just accepted a job offer at The Washington Post, where I will be the media columnist.

I will move from New York City to Washington to start work there in May, and will finish up at The Times in April. (My four-year contract with The Times was due to expire in August; and, although I am leaving early, I have been in the role longer than any of my predecessors, most of whom stayed for two years or less.)

In the weeks ahead, Ill still be doing the job of representing Times readers to the best of my ability. Some of that involves responding individually to the large amount of reader email that my assistant and I receive every day. And Ill write a few more columns, as well, though perhaps not at quite the same pace Ive been keeping. There are some subjects on my ever-changing list that I want to get to before leaving, and a few that I will want to revisit.

If an issue arises involving The Washington Post, my plan is to inform The Timess publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., and to recuse myself, handing the matter off to The Timess standards editor and other top editors.

Im glad that Ill be able to continue writing about the issues that I care so much about  the crucial role of the press in our democracy, journalistic standards and ethics, and more. Ive been very touched by some of the comments from readers in recent weeks that encouraged me to keep writing about these issues in my next professional chapter. Im planning to do just that.

Here is Mr. Sulzbergers memo to staff announcing my departure, and the plans for selecting a new Times public editor. The Times has affirmed its commitment to continuing the position. And here is a memo from The Washington Post describing my new job.

The idea is to do that fact-checking aggressively and in real time, on a live blog, editors told me.

Later, in the Thursday print edition, readers will also see the results of this effort as part of the debate coverage.

I raised the question to editors on Tuesday afternoon because the subject of fact-checking has been very much on the publics mind and very much in the news. Whats more, the news media have been much criticized for not effectively getting to the bottom of the candidates claims and counterclaims during this contentious campaign.

Richard L. Berke, an assistant managing editor who oversees The Timess politics coverage, calls this advance effort the most ambitious fact-checking weve ever done.

Mary Suh, a deputy politics editor, has a team of 20 reporters who have worked on the effort and who will be present to respond to what comes up during the debate. Michael Cooper will play a leading role among those reporters, she said. Many of the fact-checking reports will be accompanied by graphics. In other instances, the graphics will stand alone.

Were writing these fact-checks in advance so that were not scrambling, Ms. Suh said. Its all on an Excel spreadsheet  from Romneys Bain history to Obamas record on the deficit.

The Times, both editors noted, has always done this kind of work. But it has taken on a new urgency.

Members of the public are demanding that news organizations do more to get at the truth. And they are right to do so.

Theres no more important role for the news media in this campaign. It will be interesting to see how well it plays out.



More on this subject from The Times and around the Web:

The former Times national political correspondent Adam Clymer wrote this week about how the debate will most likely stretch the truth in many directions, putting it in historical context.



And here, from around the Web, is more from other news organizations and from campaign strategists:

How PolitiFact, based at The Tampa Bay Times, is doing it.

nytimes.com,2016-02-12 00:00:00,Is Global Expansion Good for Times Readers?,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","If all goes well for The Times in its latest incarnation  a Spanish-language site, The New York Times en Espanol, that officially began this week with a base in Mexico City  readers may benefit twice.

The first benefit is obvious enough. The Times is trying to expand its digital readership around the world, which will help it stay afloat as a profitable business. Sustainable financial health, if it comes, means that the company can continue to pay for its large news-gathering and news-producing operation. (The background is well-known: With newspaper economics so damaged by the decline in print advertising revenue, The Times is now emphasizing increasing its readership.)

Publishing in languages other than English  first Chinese, now Spanish, with others to come  vastly expands the pool of possible Times readers.

These new readers will help attract new digital advertising, and may eventually pay for subscriptions. (At the moment, there is no pay wall for the Spanish-language site, which offers 10 to 15 translated Times articles a day  culled from hundreds of possible articles  and also produces some original journalism, which may be reverse-translated for English-speaking readers.)

But there is a second, less obvious benefit: a deepening of the papers reporting strength in various regions of the world. The Times has hired six experienced Spanish-speaking reporters and editors in Mexico. That hiring has been made easier because Mexico has become a very difficult and dangerous place to do hard-hitting journalism, and working under the umbrella of The Times can mean a little more protection.

They are all very ambitious journalists in their own right, with a reputation for digging and asking tough questions, the International editor, Joseph Kahn, told me. (Among them, for example, is Alberto Arce, formerly of The Associated Press.)

The new staff amounts to an impressive force multiplier for The Timess enterprise journalism in Latin America  something that should benefit all readers, he said.

And this will be replicated in other parts of the world as The Times starts other, similar efforts  probably at least two more this year, according to Lydia Polgreen, the deputy International editor in charge of the global-growth effort. She declined to say where they might be.

The hope, though, is for substantial readership growth over the next two or three years. There are signs of considerable interest: The Spanish site quickly garnered 250,000 likes on Facebook and 25,000 Twitter followers, Ms. Polgreen said.

Mr. Kahn described the readership goal in terms of engaged readers who are regular digital visitors. The Times has an audience that includes 30 million unique visitors a month outside the United States; of that number, about 1.5 million are the sought-after engaged readers.

We want to significantly more than double that number of engaged readers in the next few years, Mr. Kahn said.

The companys international growth has had its troubles. The Chinese-language site started out strong, with 10 million page views a month. But after The Times wrote uncomplimentary articles about the Chinese government, the site was blocked in October 2012. It remains blocked, but he said that the page views  which took a sharp dive  are now back at close to that initial level because the site is being read in other Chinese-speaking parts of the world, and even in China through various backdoor methods.

Such problems are unlikely in Mexico but, Ms. Polgreen said, there are plenty of other challenges. Translating Times journalism so that it is not only accurate but also has the right idioms, phrasing and tone  while still remaining true to The Timess style  is tricky.

Draft is a series about the art and craft of writing.

When I was growing up, crossword puzzles were  along with watching Ken Burns movies and eating lox  among the unfathomable pleasures of grown-ups. My grandmother would sit in her den for hours, the puzzle in her lap, looking blankly around the room as if she had just read a piece of news whose enormity she could scarcely comprehend. Other adults would periodically drift by to offer their condolences (A nine-letter religious figure, hmm...) and I would stare from the rug in disbelieving boredom.

My conversion to a crossword puzzler, then  and not just any puzzler, but one who has favorite puzzle makers, and who occasionally snorts audibly at especially clever clues  has required a bit of an inner adjustment. To my 10-year-old self I can say only: Forgive me. And perhaps more defensibly: Crossword puzzles turn out to be great practice for one of the few endeavors that both of us can respect  fiction writing.

I say this not because of puzzles supposed mind-sharpening powers or their vocabulary-building benefits (there are whole reams of words  METE, TYRO, EWER  that I have never used anywhere but in a crossword puzzle). For me the value in puzzling lies deeper than that. A crossword may seem meaningless, but to the hapless writer it can provide a crucial map of the strange terrain of his chosen profession. The crossword-puzzling fiction writer may struggle (in fact, he will certainly struggle), but he will not despair. Here are some of the landmarks hell encounter:

The Blank Beginning

Every crossword puzzler is familiar with the sensation: You sit down with a Saturday puzzle, you cheerfully raise your pencil (or pen, depending on your arrogance or foolishness) and ... nothing. The white spaces cover nearly the entire grid, the clues are a forbidding mix of foreign rivers and inscrutable opera references. Well, you think to yourself, I guess its finally happened: I cant fill in a single box.

But then, after a few minutes of dumbfounded staring  you dont have a breakthrough, exactly, but you glimpse a possibility. You somehow hadnt seen this Its a burden clue, and you arent certain that its ONUS, but its the right length, and its not as if youve got anything else going. And then, O.K., well, coming down from that O  couldnt One with bone certainty be OSTEOPATH? And before too long youre underway.

The equivalent blank period in novel writing can, unfortunately, last months or even years, but the principles at work are just the same. There will be stretches in which the only characters youre able to summon arrive faceless or, worse, voiceless. There will be whole seasons in which every plot idea you come up with collapses the moment it appears on your screen. These are the times when youd start Googling law school application deadlines if it werent for the memory of that Saturday puzzle: Even a granite wall, studied with sufficient patience, reveals its cracks.

The Walk-Away

Once youve made some progress in a puzzle, however halting, a certain pleasurable momentum begins to build. There are areas of difficulty, little nodes of uncertainty, but all in all youre feeling pretty good, and youre wondering if this is the year when youll enter the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, until 

You come face to face with the part of the puzzle that refuses to give. All youve got is FARMLAND, and this FARMLAND seems to have been salted. This down slot here seems as if it should be AVIATOR, but that would mean cramming two letters into a single box....

I cant emphasize strongly enough what you should do at this point: Walk away. No matter how loudly the stubborn sectors of your brain insist that just a few more minutes of concerted staring will do the trick, put down the puzzle, rub your eyes and go wash the dishes. It will very often happen that I return to a puzzle, after an hour or two away, and find the answers coming in such a cascade that I hardly have time to wonder what kind of idiot was working on the puzzle before.

And so it is in writing. I can count on one hand, or possibly one elbow, the number of good writing ideas Ive had while straining at the keyboard. When you find yourself stumped, when a character seems to want to do this but the story seems to demand that she do that, its time to go for a walk. The answer will pop up into your mind so unexpectedly that you will very likely not be carrying a pen.

The Dam Breakage

At some point in every worthy puzzle there comes a moment when you realize that there has been, all along, a huge mistaken answer at the center of your grid. For an hour youve been running up against the obstruction that is this answer, considering every possibility  a misprint, a conspiracy, an unprecedented lapse into Esperanto  except that the answer itself could be wrong. When it finally occurs to you to erase it (or scribble it out, forced now to write in tiny letters in the boxes corners), the sensation is as of a river suddenly running free.

In novels, too, it is very often the most basic decisions  the ones that seem less like decisions than like givens  that turn out to be the problem. It isnt his neighbor who comes over; its his brother. They arent going to meet their adopted childs parents; they are the parents. The pain of undoing months of work is nothing compared to the feeling of sudden freedom.

The Slow Clap

Toward the end of a puzzle  all the major mistakes having been cleared up, all the TSARs and EMIRs having been put in their places  theres a moment when you shift from being the puzzle makers adversary to being her admirer, even her accomplice. So this is why there were those extra REs everywhere. Finally the design of the thing, the human intelligence on the other side of the page, begins to come clear, and you shake your head in weary wonder that you could ever have wished to set this beautiful puzzle on fire.

In fiction writing you are of course both the maker and the solver, but the sense of discovery  the feeling that whole sublayers of structure and theme have been created by a stranger with your pleasure in mind  is no less acute. So this is why I had him be a dentist. This is why it matters that her father grew up in Spain.

And this, you think  until the next book, the next puzzle, appears, and the whole maddening cycle begins again  is why I became a writer.

Ben Dolnick is the author, most recently, of At the Bottom of Everything.

nytimes.com,2016-02-25 00:00:00,We Googled 'Trump Polish workers.' Here's what we found,[],"Says Donald Trump hired illegal workers ""from Poland and he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment.""

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio charged Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump with hypocrisy for hiring undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects instead of American citizens.

HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN IMMIGRATION FACT-CHECKER

""He hired from Poland, and he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment,"" Rubio said. ""Thats a fact. People can look it up. Im sure people are Googling it right now, Trump Polish workers. Youll see $1 million for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did.""

""Wrong, wrong,"" Trump said.

We did some Googling and also reached out to the Rubio campaign, which referred us to media reports about a protracted class-action lawsuit involving his hiring of Polish aliens 36 years ago.

Rubio is right about the Polish workers, but its unclear how much Trump ended up paying. (The Trump campaign did not get back to us.) Heres the story.

Sometime between 1979 and 1980, Trump hired a contractor to demolish an old building in midtown Manhattan to make way for Trump Tower. The contractor signed on workers from a local union and, to meet Trumps tight deadline, also brought on 200 undocumented laborers from Poland dubbed the ""Polish Brigade.""

The Polish employees were off-the-books, working 12-hour shifts seven days a week for $4 to $5 an hour, with no overtime. Some workers were never paid what they were owed.

In 1983, union members sued a union boss, Trump and his contractor for cheating the union out of pension and welfare funds by hiring the Polish Brigade. Trump owed the union pension fund $1 million, the plaintiffs said.

Appearing in court in 1990, Trump blamed the violations on the contractor and denied knowing that the Polish workers were undocumented.

""Nobodys proven to me that they were were illegal,"" Trump said, according to a Newsday report from the time.

Nonetheless, Manhattan Judge Charles Stewart ruled against Trump a year later, saying that his representative ""knew that the Polish workers were doing demolition work"" and that his company participated in a ""conspiracy"" to cheat the union.

Trump owed the workers a little more than $325,000 plus interest and attorneys fees and costs, Stewart ruled.

That wasnt the end of it. Trump appealed and it would drag on for another decade.

In 1998, several members of the Polish Brigade told the New York Times about their horrid working conditions. But Trump repeated that he didnt know about the legal status of the Polish Brigade and said he would not settle the case out of court ""on principle,"" according to the New York Times.

If the case was retried and Trump lost again, he would have had to pay about $4 million, the Times calculated.

A year later, Trump quietly settled, according to the New York Daily News, but the agreement was placed under seal.

""It has been resolved on terms agreeable to both sides,"" labor lawyer Wendy Sloan, who represented the union members, told the New York Daily News.

Our ruling

Rubio said Trump ""hired from Poland and he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment.""

It was Trumps contractor, not Trump himself, who hired 200 undocumented Polish workers to demolish a building to make room for Trump Tower in Manhattan. Trump said he didnt know. The lawsuit sought $1 million in damages, and a judge ruled that Trump had to pay $325,000 plus interest.

But the case was appealed and before it was retried, Trump settled the case out of court, so its unclear how much he ended up doling out.

Rubios statement is partially accurate but missing that context. We rate Rubios claim Half True.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-02 00:00:00,How Trump's 'Off the Record' Remarks Crept Out,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Updated, Friday, March 4, 2016.

A reader, Ken Fitzpatrick, read about what has been called a secret recording of Donald Trumps meeting in January with the Times editorial board. On that recording, an article by Buzzfeeds editor in chief Ben Smith suggests, Mr. Trump says that his extreme position on deporting immigrants is not anything he would necessarily carry out in real, postelection life, but rather might be a starting point for negotiation.

Mr. Fitzpatrick writes:

Can you please elucidate why the NYT is conducting any part of an interview with a Presidential candidate off the record? Obviously if you have informed someone that part of the interview is off the record, going back on that would be unethical. But why, oh why, would you ever agree to that in the first place? Youre not interviewing someone whose cat was rescued from a tree. These are candidates for PRESIDENT. Youve created a situation where a candidate may have told NYT editors something that is illuminating and worth reporting on, but they are restrained from doing so.

I asked the editorial page editor, Andrew Rosenthal, to address the question. He told me that the editorial boards meetings with presidential candidates are often done on an off-the-record basis, at the candidates request. These meetings with candidates are not for the purpose of writing news articles, he emphasized, but are intended as informational sessions for the board so that board members can make observations, challenge the candidate on his or her positions, and eventually consider an endorsement.



The editorial board, an 18-member group that writes The Timess editorial positions, is a distinct entity from the reporters and editors in the newsroom.

Often, the sessions are recorded so that the board members can refer to the conversations as they make their considerations.

The endorsement interview with Mr. Trump on Jan. 5 was different for two reasons. One, it was attended by Dean Baquet, The Timess executive editor, who runs the newsroom staff. He is an occasional guest of the editorial board, he told me Tuesday.

Two, it was partly on the record because that was Mr. Trumps preference. This made it fair game for news coverage, particularly after a question arose about Mr. Trumps stance on tariffs. (The tariff portion of the meeting was on the record.)

So that the news side could check that on-the-record information, Mr. Rosenthal sent a digital copy of the recording to a newsroom editor whom he declined to name, with the reminder that there had been an agreement to treat portions of it as off the record.

These sessions are not about news gathering for stories, he told me. And, responding to those who are calling for the recording to be released publicly, he said: Its not as if we are sitting on a news story here, or holding something back from publication.

Is there a big story here? I dont know what Mr. Trump said in the meeting, nor do I have access to the recording. If Mr. Trumps statements are as Buzzfeed describes them, they may not be all that new. Mr. Trump has made similar comments before, including in an on-the-record interview with the Washington Examiner in January. (The Intercepts Glenn Greenwald made reference to this in a piece published Tuesday.)

Mr. Baquet told me that he didnt know who had spoken to Buzzfeed to describe the off-the-record portion of the session, and that he didnt intend to pursue it.

I dont know how it got out, but Im certainly not going to do a leak investigation, Mr. Baquet told me. He also said that he found the idea of an off-the-record agreement when there are 30 people in the room to be difficult to enforce and probably impractical.

Update: Mr. Baquet elaborated on what happened and his reaction in an interview with CBS This Morning on Thursday.

After Buzzfeeds report, many others followed, often with criticism of The Timess practices. The Times itself published an article that mentioned the dust-up later Monday.

My take: Having agreed to an off-the-record conversation, The Times (both editorial department and news side) was and is obligated to honor that arrangement, as Mr. Fitzpatrick rightly notes. The trouble here had to do with the mixing of editorial and news side, the mixing of on- and off-the-record, and the well-intentioned but hazardous sharing of a recording that involved off-the-record information.

Should The Times continue to host off-the-record sessions with candidates, so that the editorial board can consider endorsements? Im certainly no fan of The Times taking information from politicians or government officials that cannot be used or attributed, as Ive written endlessly. But this opinion-side practice for pre-endorsement meetings is a long-established one that can serve a worthwhile end, if everybody observes the rules.

What got The Times in trouble was the mixing of purposes (opinion and news), the blending of on- and off-the-record material in a single candidate session and the sharing of the recording  including among those who evidently didnt care much about an off-the-record agreement. All of that amounted to an accident waiting to happen.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-02-10 00:00:00,Times Reporter: 'I Would Never Cut a Deal Like That',"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Heres an ugly term: Transactional journalism  also known as a quid pro quo.

Hardly an unfamiliar idea, it came up this week with the disclosure that a writer for The Atlantic made a deal to use a particular word  muscular  in describing a 2009 speech by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in order to get an advance copy of the speech. Her aide also required the writer, Marc Ambinder, to favorably mention a State Department delegation attending the speech.

In emails that were made public by Gawker, Mr. Ambinder agreed (got it, he wrote of the instructions from Philippe Reines of Mrs. Clintons staff) and received his advance copy. The practice rightly was termed corrupt by Erik Wemple of The Washington Post, though he gave Mr. Ambinder credit for appropriate contrition. (The Atlantic has appended an editors note to the article.)

A New York Times reporter, Mark Landler, whose article on the speech also used the word muscular and also mentioned the delegation, told me in the strongest terms on Wednesday that he had not made any sort of similar arrangement and would not do so. That would be a very serious breach of journalistic ethics, Mr. Landler told me by phone.

Earlier, in an email, he wrote: No, I would NEVER cut a deal like that. My use of the word muscular may have reflected a lack of originality, but it did not reflect collusion.

I asked Mr. Landler about it because I had heard from a reader, Ian Frazer, who saw an article in Breitbart, the conservative news and opinion website, that pointed out the use of the word and the description in Mr. Landlers article. Mr. Frazer wrote that the suggestion that any Times reporting was guided by its subject in order to gain access is very troubling and should be disclosed if true.

I agree that it would be very troubling  and possibly grounds for dismissal. Mr. Landler told me that he did not recall receiving an advance text of the speech (a common enough practice) but that he certainly had not cut such a deal, and would not ever do so.

Its worth noting that the word muscular came up often in a search of Mr. Landlers articles of that period. He told me that more recently, he has made an effort to use the word muscular far less often because it tends to equate a hawkish foreign policy with a good foreign policy. Its been reasonably criticized as a value-laden term and its a good idea to stay away from it, he said.

Mr. Landler also noted that the State Department wasnt happy with his article, which put the speech in the context of her trying to regain her relevancy in the administration, after a period in which she seemed to have been sidelined. He said he has seen an email from Anne-Marie Slaughter to that effect. And he said that Mrs. Clinton had mentioned the delegation during her speech, which is what drew his attention to it.

I have been critical of Washington reporting that functions as a government mouthpiece, especially through the use of unnamed government sources. And while the practice described in the emails is shocking in how blatant it is  at one point, Mr. Reines instructs Mr. Ambinder to write something, but in your own clever way  lets not be naive: this kind of deal cutting is not entirely surprising.

Having said that, I find Mr. Landler thoroughly credible about all of this. And I was glad to hear his condemnation of this practice.

Speaking of journalistic ethics and practices, it would have been decent of Breitbarts reporter to reach Mr. Landler for comment before going the route of innuendo.

Correction, February 11, 2016:

An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that Mr. Landler was the recipient of an email from Anne-Marie Slaughter that referred to his article. In fact, that email was sent to Mrs. Clinton.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-02-12 00:00:00,Is Global Expansion Good for Times Readers?,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","If all goes well for The Times in its latest incarnation  a Spanish-language site, The New York Times en Espanol, that officially began this week with a base in Mexico City  readers may benefit twice.

The first benefit is obvious enough. The Times is trying to expand its digital readership around the world, which will help it stay afloat as a profitable business. Sustainable financial health, if it comes, means that the company can continue to pay for its large news-gathering and news-producing operation. (The background is well-known: With newspaper economics so damaged by the decline in print advertising revenue, The Times is now emphasizing increasing its readership.)

Publishing in languages other than English  first Chinese, now Spanish, with others to come  vastly expands the pool of possible Times readers.

These new readers will help attract new digital advertising, and may eventually pay for subscriptions. (At the moment, there is no pay wall for the Spanish-language site, which offers 10 to 15 translated Times articles a day  culled from hundreds of possible articles  and also produces some original journalism, which may be reverse-translated for English-speaking readers.)

But there is a second, less obvious benefit: a deepening of the papers reporting strength in various regions of the world. The Times has hired six experienced Spanish-speaking reporters and editors in Mexico. That hiring has been made easier because Mexico has become a very difficult and dangerous place to do hard-hitting journalism, and working under the umbrella of The Times can mean a little more protection.

They are all very ambitious journalists in their own right, with a reputation for digging and asking tough questions, the International editor, Joseph Kahn, told me. (Among them, for example, is Alberto Arce, formerly of The Associated Press.)

The new staff amounts to an impressive force multiplier for The Timess enterprise journalism in Latin America  something that should benefit all readers, he said.

And this will be replicated in other parts of the world as The Times starts other, similar efforts  probably at least two more this year, according to Lydia Polgreen, the deputy International editor in charge of the global-growth effort. She declined to say where they might be.

The hope, though, is for substantial readership growth over the next two or three years. There are signs of considerable interest: The Spanish site quickly garnered 250,000 likes on Facebook and 25,000 Twitter followers, Ms. Polgreen said.

Mr. Kahn described the readership goal in terms of engaged readers who are regular digital visitors. The Times has an audience that includes 30 million unique visitors a month outside the United States; of that number, about 1.5 million are the sought-after engaged readers.

We want to significantly more than double that number of engaged readers in the next few years, Mr. Kahn said.

The companys international growth has had its troubles. The Chinese-language site started out strong, with 10 million page views a month. But after The Times wrote uncomplimentary articles about the Chinese government, the site was blocked in October 2012. It remains blocked, but he said that the page views  which took a sharp dive  are now back at close to that initial level because the site is being read in other Chinese-speaking parts of the world, and even in China through various backdoor methods.

Such problems are unlikely in Mexico but, Ms. Polgreen said, there are plenty of other challenges. Translating Times journalism so that it is not only accurate but also has the right idioms, phrasing and tone  while still remaining true to The Timess style  is tricky.

Weve wrestled a lot with that, she said, Theres a literary art to translation, and weve had some spirited debates.

As for which stories are offered to Spanish-speaking readers, its a collaboration, she said, that takes place throughout the day. Some of the most successful selections might seem surprising: The long story of George Bell, the man who died alone in his Queens apartment, was extremely popular, she said.

More than a year after residents of Flint, Mich., were switched onto a water supply that has since been linked to rising levels of lead in the blood of some children, state and city officials abruptly reversed course, announcing on Thursday that Flint would return to its old water source.









The realization of increased lead exposure and a rise in the number of children with elevated blood lead levels was devastating for our community, Dayne Walling, the mayor of Flint, said at a news conference where he and Gov. Rick Snyder announced plans to spend $12 million to restore the citys connection to Detroits water system, which comes from Lake Huron. I could hardly sleep knowing that our youngest and most vulnerable children could be at greater risk if precautionary steps were not taken, said Mr. Walling, who is seeking re-election next month.

Residents of Flint and others lauded the decision. Some had been pressing for it for many months as complaints emerged about strange smells and colors coming from faucets, as well as unexplained rashes, ailments and worries about lead.

Im happy that the city is finally doing what they should have done a long time ago, said LeeAnne Walters, a resident who says her 4-year-old son was found to have high lead levels in his blood. They should have taken it seriously back months ago when we tried to tell them, but they chose to ignore it. If they had been doing their jobs from the start, it wouldnt have taken all this.

Flint, an economically troubled city 70 miles from Detroit, switched its water supply to the Flint River last year, after leaving Detroits costly water system. As part of efforts to cut costs that had overwhelmed the shrinking city, Flint officials planned to join a new, regional water system, which would also draw water from Lake Huron. But the new system will not be ready until mid-2016, and so the city turned in the interim to the Flint River in April 2014, leaving many residents skeptical.

In addition to the strange appearance of the water in some homes, which some residents began collecting in bottles as evidence, there were other problems. When fecal coliform bacteria turned up in the water, residents were told to boil their water. The extra chlorine that was used to solve that problem caused a new one: elevated levels of another contaminant, total trihalomethanes, which health officials say can lead to liver or kidney problems. At the time, the authorities assured residents they were handling the issues, and that the water remained in safety guidelines.

But then came worries about lead. In early September, a researcher from Virginia Tech reported that tests of the water in nearly 300 Flint homes showed elevated lead levels in the city. A pediatrician announced that blood tests showed increased lead levels in some children since 2014, and last week state officials corroborated those findings.

In recent days, the city, county and state issued advisories  guidance to residents such as installing lead-removing filters; running water for five minutes before using it; and using only cold water for drinking, cooking and making baby formula. But by Thursday morning, there was a more significant announcement, and it was the one some residents like Ms. Walters had long sought: In about two weeks, the city will stop drawing water from the Flint River and return to Detroits system until the new regional system is ready.

We all care about the citizens of Flint, all the citizens in the state, in making sure we can have safe clean water for people, said Mr. Snyder, who said he would seek $6 million from the State Legislature to help pay for Flints temporary return to Detroit water. The city is expected to pay $2 million, and the other $4 million will come from the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation.

Health experts suspect that the water from the Flint River is particularly corrosive and may be leaching lead from some of the citys oldest pipes and service lines. They said water from Detroits facility is treated with substances that help coat the inside of pipes, which tends to prevent such corrosion.

Yet even as officials announced their plans on Thursday, new test results were announced. Sampling of water in Flints schools over the past week found that three schools had lead levels higher than a federal standard, state officials said. Flint schools, where water fountains have been turned off in recent days, are providing students with donated bottled water.",[]

Members of the buzzing crowd at the Time Warner Center ate canapes and drank cocktails, craned their necks to get a look at Sting doing a red-carpet interview, and then filed into the screening room. Once they did, the party atmosphere quickly turned somber.

The film, an HBO documentary, is about the life and death of James Wright Foley, the American journalist who was kidnapped by ISIS in Syria, and later was executed, as shown in a horrific video seen around the world. Jim: The James Foley Story left the audience quiet and, in my case at least, in tears. Then things got still more emotional, as the journalists parents, John and Diane Foley, stood at a lectern and spoke briefly  and with incredible grace  about their son.

I met them afterward and introduced myself to another of their sons, Michael Foley, with whom I had significant phone and email contact last year after he vehemently complained about some of The Timess coverage of his brothers time in prison. He objected, for example, to the description of his brother as an enthusiastic convert to Islam.

I considered his complaints, and others I had heard about, in a Sunday column, and I tried to take on some of the broader, and very thorny, issues involved in covering Americans who have been kidnapped by terrorists. Times coverage broke important ground when Rukmini Callimachi reported that American hostages often suffered because of their governments policy on opposing the payment of ransom.



Many of the same issues arose in the documentary  again, leaving a great deal unanswered and unresolved. Directed by a childhood friend of Mr. Foleys, Brian Oakes, the documentary celebrates the journalists life and his character as a man for others. Relying heavily, and effectively, on family interviews and on those with former hostages imprisoned with Mr. Foley, it gives only a glancing treatment to the role of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Obama administration in failing to secure his release. And, for the most part, it skirts the larger geopolitical issues.

This film leaves a lot of questions, the elder Mr. Foley said afterward. And that, his wife added, was done by design. The Foleys have established a foundation devoted to freeing American citizens imprisoned abroad.

Despite the lingering questions, and its troubling subject matter, the film, which recently won a Sundance award, is certainly worth seeing; it debuts Saturday on HBO.

Separately, it is of the utmost importance that The Times continues to dig deep into ISIS coverage. The executive editor, Dean Baquet, recently told me that this is among his highest priorities for the newsroom in the year ahead.

For The Times, Bernie Sanderss entry into the presidential race was almost a nonevent. Although many candidates declarations were treated on the front page with considerable fanfare, Mr. Sanderss was tucked inside the paper on Page A21.

Since that time, the Vermont senator has received considerable attention from The Times, but for his supporters, not nearly enough. And the tone of the coverage, many complain, has sometimes been derogatory or dismissive, and has been focused on personality, not issues.

Its not hard to understand the early news judgment at play here: Given Hillary Rodham Clinton as such a dominant candidate, with widespread support, lots of money and the Democratic Partys likely imprimatur, almost any other Democratic candidate looked like an also-ran. And Mr. Sanders  whose politics are significantly left of center and who is 74 years old  didnt appear to be the kind of candidate to change that view.

Since that announcement, Ive heard a great deal from readers, unhappy about both quantity and tone of The Timess stories. And Sanders articles have generated thousands of reader comments along the same lines.

Is the Times planning on having fair coverage of Bernie Sanders  many of us like him  or is it just going to treat everyone but Hillary as a crank, a reader, Joan McClusky, asked in an email.

In the past few days, I have looked back over the coverage, with the help of my assistant, Joumana Khatib.

First, some numbers. Mr. Sanders, since his announcement on April 30 until the end of August, has been the subject of 59 Times articles (opinion pieces are not included here, nor are wire-service reports). This includes not only those on the news pages of the paper but also those in such mainly online homes as The Upshot and First Draft. Of those, 12 have been straight news coverage. And five Sanders articles have been on the front page since he declared.

How does this compare with the coverage of some of the other candidates, particularly Mrs. Clinton? Looking at August alone, The Times ran 14 articles on Mr. Sanders, compared with 54 on Mrs. Clinton. Donald Trump  like Mr. Sanders, also considered by many an extreme long shot for his partys nomination  got the most coverage last month: 63 articles. Other Republican candidates received far less ink than Trump: Jeb Bush was the subject of 18 articles in August, and Marco Rubio, 10. (Of course, not all press is good press for any of the candidates. In Mrs. Clintons case, for example, many of the August articles dealt with her questionable email practices as secretary of state.)

So, in terms of numbers alone, The Times certainly has not ignored Mr. Sanders. The Times did get off to a very slow start with its Sanders coverage but has responded as the crowds at his events have grown.

What about the tone and content of the Sanders coverage? This is what really frustrates most of the readers Ive heard from. They want the candidate, and the issues he raises  particularly those concerning income inequality  to be taken seriously. Instead, they say, theres too much snark and too much fluff.

The fluff may have reached its zenith  at least, one can always hope  with an exchange included in a Times Magazine interview. Not a part of the Times political coverage, it was by a well-known freelance contributor, Ana Marie Cox:

Do you think its fair that Hillarys hair gets a lot more scrutiny than yours does?

Hillarys hair gets more scrutiny than my hair?

Yeah.

Is that what youre asking?

Yeah.

O.K., Ana, I dont mean to be rude here. I am running for president of the United States on serious issues, O.K.? Do you have serious questions?

Many readers also found this passage in an Aug. 20 campaign trail article objectionable:

When a gaggle of reporters  corporate media in Sanders parlance  mentioned Mrs. Clinton here, he snarled, Thats the sport you guys like, meaning their focus on the kind of political questions he disdains. When asked to reconcile his anti-establishment status with being a career politician, Mr. Sanders, who except for two years has held political office continually since 1981, glared at the young reporter who asked the question.

Career politician? he said to her with a disdainful laugh. Other questions.

Constance Sullivan of Minneapolis wrote that it was astonishingly inaccurate: Sanders didnt snarl (I have seen the video clip). He typically responds calmly and with cool reason that tends to deflate a lot of self-important young reporters.

Regina Schrambling of Manhattan (a former Times writer and editor) wrote to me complaining about an early headline on a piece about Mr. Sanderss popularity on Facebook and Reddit. It read: A Grumpy Old Socialist and Social Media Sensation.

She couldnt recall this sort of tone with any of the Republican fringe candidates as she put it. The article, too, she said, was dismissive.

It seems the editors have decided the race already and have written him off, she said.

Beyond the specifics of word choice, many readers have told me in emails and written in hundreds of passionate comments on news stories that they are deeply frustrated by coverage that doesnt dig into the important issues plaguing the nation, particularly economic inequality and climate change.

And Dave Lippman of Teaneck, N.J., complained about a circular system of news, in which fringe candidates are not deserving of respect because they dont have support because the press doesnt treat them with respect.

Its a given that Times editors and reporters must make news judgments about how much attention to give various candidates. That can vary widely. Since 2013, for example, The Times has assigned a reporter to cover Mrs. Clinton full time, arguably adding to her early anointment as the all-but-certain Democratic nominee, though many would argue that the coverage has been far from favorable.

Do these decisions merely recognize political reality or are they part of a self-perpetuating cycle in which someone like Bernie Sanders can never stand a chance?

On Tuesday, I asked Carolyn Ryan, the senior editor who heads The Timess political coverage, for her response. I also sent her a summary of the numbers and the reader complaints. (Update: I published her response in a separate post.)

Heres my take: The Times has not ignored Mr. Sanderss campaign, but it hasnt always taken it very seriously. The tone of some stories is regrettably dismissive, even mocking at times. Some of that is focused on the candidates age, appearance and style, rather than what he has to say.

And then theres the Trump factor. While it may be realistic, and reflective of reasonable news judgment, to give Mr. Sanders less coverage than Mrs. Clinton, thats certainly not happening with Donald Trump  whose every utterance and dust-up is breathlessly chronicled.

The Timess executive editor, Dean Baquet, told me recently that he wants to focus more heavily on issue stories in the coming weeks and months. Candidates like Mr. Sanders  no matter how electable they are seen as  can and should be a part of that. Times readers are completely within their rights to expect and demand it.",[]
nytimes.com,2015-01-03 00:00:00,When Prisoners Are Patients,"['All Contributors', 'The Great Divide', 'The Conversation', 'Errol Morris', 'Theresa Brown', 'The End']","Bedside is a series about health care from a nurses-eye view.

Its an odd thing, to take care of someone who is chained to a bed, guarded 24/7 by bored corrections officers idling away time with TV and card games, who cannot receive visitors or even phone calls. But it happens when prison inmates are sick enough that they need care that only a hospital can provide.

As a nurse caring for such patients, the first rule I learned  or figured out, because no one said it aloud  was not to ask what the prisoner had done to land him (they were all men) in jail. Better not to know that he is a serial murderer, a vicious rapist. It was easier for me to think of the prisoners as people, just like the rest of our patients, rather than to condemn, because condemnation and compassion are tough impulses to reconcile.

I cared for one prisoner over several weeks, and I got to know him in a vague dont ask, dont tell way. He had an above-the-knee amputation and could walk only with an artificial lower limb, which we kept propped against the wall whenever he lay down. His other leg, the whole one, was handcuffed to the bed. He was very sick from cancer and chemotherapy. It seemed absurd.

Hes a nice guy, I told a corrections officer one day after the prisoner and I had talked.

No hes not, the officer replied, fixing me with a level look that suggested he knew things about the prisoner that I didnt.

The guards intimation about the prisoners troubling past didnt change how I treated him, or even how I felt about him. But it did make me wonder if I should be more wary around him. The violent prisoner who feigns illness to break out of a hospital, killing staff members as he goes, is a recurring plot element on TV crime shows (and actually happened, in 2006, when a prisoner receiving care at a hospital in Blacksburg, Va., killed a guard and a police officer in an unsuccessful escape attempt). Was the one-legged prisoner just waiting for his moment? I have no idea. He was discharged and was readmitted several times, eventually dying in the hospital unvisited and, except for some of us nurses, unmourned.

The conundrum posed by prisoners in the hospital was most challenging when we had two child molesters who were long-term patients on the floor. I would have preferred not to know their crimes, but the National Sex Offender Registry, which makes such information easily available to caregivers, made ignorance impossible. One was an older adult we all knew from multiple admissions, the other basically a kid himself, whod done to a younger member of his family what had already been done to him.

They were both hospitalized for weeks, and their continuing presence tested the empathy of all of us nurses. A sense of unease permeated the floor. Was it wrong to give understanding care to the violators of children?

In the end, of course, I decided it was not. The job is the job. Being a nurse should mean we care for everyone, even criminals, with the best in our hearts. Child molesters are almost universally loathed, but when I am at work, in the hospital, those loathsome criminals became patients.

Ive put off writing about prisoner-patients because I imagined the overwhelming response from readers would be anger at the idea of convicted criminals receiving free health care that many Americans cannot get or afford, even under the Affordable Care Act. Prisoners with cancer do not have co-payments or deductibles. They receive the same treatment regimens as our other patients, and are cared for by the same oncology nurses and doctors.

Prisoners receiving free health care may seem morally objectionable. But lets reverse that ethical formulation and instead ask why anyone in this country has to financially struggle to obtain health care that the least free among us receive without paying a dime.

A lot of whats wrong with our health care system has to do with money and the profit motive being injected into every possible health care experience. In these prisoner/nurse encounters, though, the task was very different. I had to hold on firmly to my humanity in order to recognize theirs. A dose of similar soul-searching might be just what our ailing health care system needs. If we give needed, accessible care to the most despised and potentially violent among us, surely we can try a little harder to provide it to all.

nytimes.com,2010-12-13 00:00:00,The Human Incubator,"['The End', 'The Great Divide', 'The Conversation', 'Tina Rosenberg', 'Errol Morris', 'All Contributors']","Fixes looks at solutions to social problems and why they work.

Bullit Marquez/Associated Press

Sometimes, the best way to progress isnt to advance  to step up with more money, more technology, more modernity. Its to retreat.

Towards the end of the 1970s, the Mother and Child Institute in Bogota, Colombia, was in deep trouble. The institute was the citys obstetrical reference hospital, where most of the citys poor women went to give birth. Nurses and doctors were in short supply. In the newly created neonatal intensive care unit, there were so few incubators that premature babies had to share them  sometimes three to an incubator. The crowded conditions spread infections, which are particularly dangerous for preemies. The death rate was high.

Dr. Edgar Rey, the chief of the pediatrics department, could have attempted to do what many other hospital officials would have done: wage a political fight for more money, more incubators and more staff.



He would likely have lost. What was happening at the Mother and Child Institute was not unusual. Conditions were much better, in fact, than at most public hospitals in the third world. Hospitals that mainly serve the poor have very little political clout, which means that conditions in their wards sometimes seem to have been staged by Hieronymous Bosch. They have too much disease, too few nurses and sometimes no doctors at all. They can be so crowded that patients sleep on the floor and so broke that people must bring their own surgical gloves and thread. I recently visited a hospital in Ethiopia that didnt even have water  the nurses washed their hands after they got home at night.

Proof that more money and more technology isnt always the answer.

Rey thought about the basics. What is the purpose of an incubator? It is to keep a baby warm, oxygenated and nourished  to simulate as closely as possible the conditions of the womb. There is another mechanism for accomplishing these goals, Rey reasoned, the same one that cared for the baby during its months of gestation. Rey also felt, something that probably all mothers feel intuitively: that one reason babies in incubators did so poorly was that they were separated from their mothers. Was there a way to avoid the incubator by employing the babys mother instead?

What he came up with is an idea now known as kangaroo care. Aspects of kangaroo care are now in use even in wealthy countries  most hospitals in the United States, for example, have adopted some kangaroo care practices. But its real impact has been felt in poor countries, where it has saved countless preemies lives and helped others to survive with fewer problems.

Agence France-Presse

In Reys system, a mother of a preemie puts the baby on her exposed chest, dressed only in a diaper and sometimes a cap, in an upright or semi-upright position. The baby is strapped in by a scarf or other cloth sling supporting its bottom, and all but its head is covered by moms shirt. The mother keeps the baby like that, skin-to-skin, as much as possible, even sleeping in a reclining chair. Fathers and other relatives or friends can wear the baby as well to give the mother a break. Even very premature infants can go home with their families (with regular follow-up visits) once they are stable and their mothers are given training.

The babies stay warm, their own temperature regulated by the sympathetic biological responses that occur when mother and infant are in close physical contact. The mothers breasts, in fact, heat up or cool down depending on what the baby needs. The upright position helps prevent reflux and apnea. Feeling the mothers breathing and heartbeat helps the babies to stabilize their own heart and respiratory rates. They sleep more. They can breastfeed at will, and the constant contact encourages the mother to produce more milk. Babies breastfeed earlier and gain more weight.

The physical closeness encourages emotional closeness, which leads to lower rates of abandonment of premature infants. This was a serious problem among the patients of Reys hospital; without being able to hold and bond with their babies, some mothers had little attachment to counter their feelings of being overwhelmed with the burdens of having a preemie. But kangaroo care also had enormous benefits for parents. Every parent, I think, can understand the importance of holding a baby instead of gazing at him in an incubator. With kangaroo care, parents and baby go through less stress. Nurses who practice kangaroo care also report that mothers also feel more confident and effective because they are the heroes in their babies care, instead of passive bystanders watching a mysterious process from a distance.

The hospitals were the third beneficiaries. Kangaroo care freed up incubators. Getting preemies home as soon as they were stable also lessened overcrowding and allowed nurses and doctors to concentrate on the patients who needed them most.

Kangaroo care has been widely studied. A trial in a Bogota hospital of 746 low birth weight babies randomly assigned to either kangaroo or conventional incubator care found that the kangaroo babies had shorter hospital stays, better growth of head circumference and fewer severe infections. They had slightly better rates of survival, but the difference was not statistically significant. Other studies have found fewer differences between kangaroo and conventional methods. A conservative summary of the evidence to date is that kangaroo care is at least as good as conventional treatment  and perhaps better.

Related More From Fixes Read previous contributions to this series.

In much of the world, however, whether a mothers chest is better or worse than an incubator is not the point. Hospitals have no incubators, or have only a few. And millions of mothers never see a hospital  they give birth at home. In very poor countries, where pregnant women are unlikely to get the food and care they need, low birth weight babies are very common  nearly one in five babies in Malawi, for example, is too small. Nearly a million low birth weight babies die each year in poor countries. But thanks to kangaroo care, many of them can be saved. The Manama Mission Hospital in southwest Zimbabwe, for example, had available only antibiotics and piped oxygen in its neonatal unit. Survival rates for babies born under 1500 grams (3.3 lbs.) improved from 10 percent to 50 percent when kangaroo care was started in the 1980s. In 2003, the World Health Organization put kangaroo care on its list of endorsed practices.

Dr. Rey took a challenge that most people would assume requires more money, personnel and technology and solved it in a way that requires less of all three. I am not a romantic who wants to abandon modern medical care in favor of traditional solutions. People with AIDS in South Africa need antiretroviral therapy, not traditional healers home brews. If you are bitten by a cobra in India, you should not go to the temple. You should go to the hospital for antivenin. Modern medical care is essential and technology very often saves lives.

Kangaroo care, however, is modern medical care, by which I mean that its effectiveness is proven in randomized controlled trials  the strongest kind of evidence. And because it is powered by the human body alone, it is theoretically available to hundreds of millions of mothers who would otherwise have no hope of saving their babies.

But theoretical availability is only helpful for theoretical babies. Another of kangaroo cares important innovations is that its inventors realized that ideas dont travel by themselves. They established a way to get the practice from Bogota into hospitals and clinics all over the world  something that takes a lot more creativity and work than it sounds. On Saturday Ill respond to comments and talk about how kangaroo care has been able to reach the places that need it most.

Since Pete Wells took over the restaurant critics job in November 2011, he has never  until Wednesday  written a review that comes not only with no stars, but also with the label poor. (He has given only one four-star review, to Le Bernardin .)

But when he decides to really pan a place, Mr. Wells doesnt hold back. His review in Wednesdays Dining section of Guys American Kitchen & Bar is a masterpiece of scorn.

Written entirely in questions (except for its one-word ending: Thanks), it nevertheless makes a major statement.

He begins: Guy Fieri, have you eaten in your new restaurant in Times Square? Mr. Fieri is the protagonist of the television food show Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and the owner of other restaurants around the country. This is his first venture into Manhattan.

He also asks: Were you struck by how very far from awesome the Awesome Pretzel Chicken Tenders are? and When we hear the words Donkey Sauce, which part of the donkey are we supposed to think about? and Why did the toasted marshmallow taste like fish?

The review is very mean and very funny and, of course, completely within the purview of the restaurant critic who, like all critics, has all the pleasure and all the pain that comes with the freedom to speak his mind.

I chatted by phone with Mr. Wells on Wednesday and asked him if he approached writing the review with a certain amount of glee  because it certainly read that way.

He said he hadnt.

Its good to make people laugh, he said. But I dont roll up my sleeves and get out the knives.

In fact, although the review is fun to read, he said he is well aware that restaurants are made by people  theyre very human. He understands that lives, jobs and reputations hang in the balance.

And in his four visits to Guys American Kitchen & Bar since mid-October, he said: I did go in hoping there would be good things on the menu. I would have liked to write the man-bites-dog review.

That kind of surprising news development was not to be.

And, in the case of this review of the 500-seat restaurant situated in the former New York Times Building, Mr. Wells hoped to make a larger point: that the kind of vernacular food that Mr. Fieri features on his show  burgers, chicken wings and the like  is worth celebrating.

This is important American food that makes a lot of people very happy, Mr. Wells said. And since thats the case, you ought to do it right.

Mr. Wells doesnt plan to make a habit of this. Negative reviews should be done sparingly, he said.

Left unsaid is whats obvious: When you must write a negative review, make it memorable.

nytimes.com,2015-12-11 07:58:00,How Baltimore cut its infant mortality rate: Saving the Smallest,"['The Plain Dealer', 'Follow On Twitter', 'Brie Zeltner', 'Lisa Dejong', 'William Neff']","BALTIMORE, Maryland -- Da'Naejah Felton was 16 and only a couple weeks from starting her junior year of high school when she learned she was pregnant.

Njkema Smith was 36 when she delivered her first baby in June. Both women were surprised by their pregnancies. Both were at high risk for problems, including losing their babies. Both were scared.

Smith and Felton have something else in common: They live in Baltimore, and when each delivered a baby boy, they were supported and cared for by a coordinated, comprehensive infant mortality prevention program that's been lauded as a national model for keeping women and their babies safe.

That effort, called B'More for Healthy Babies, was launched in 2009 in response to the city's historically high infant mortality rate, particularly among black women. It aimed to help high-risk pregnant women like Felton and Smith deliver healthy babies, but also to promote family planning, curb smoking during pregnancy, and reduce teen pregnancies, crib deaths and preventable sleep-related infant deaths.

Over the past five years, Baltimore's infant deaths have dropped by 24 percent, outstripping their home state's progress in the same period by a factor of three, and the nation's by four.

Baltimore's initiative is just one of many city-level efforts aimed at tackling infant mortality in the United States, which for years has had the highest rate of infant deaths among most developed countries.

Cleveland, which is at the beginning of a plan to turn around decades of failure in preventing infant deaths, is roughly where Baltimore was before B'More began: About 13 Cleveland babies per 1,000 die before seeing a first birthday, and in some neighborhoods four to five times as many black babies die as white babies.

The city's next steps are critical in determining if, like Baltimore, Cleveland can change these odds for hundreds of area babies a year.

No simple solutions

On a sticky Wednesday morning in July, Celeste Spears climbs the dimly lit steps to the second-floor apartment of a squat brick building, identical to the 10 others that flank it.

It's Spears' job to visit new and expectant moms in South Baltimore at risk of having problems in their pregnancies that could threaten their health or the lives of their babies. Today, she's here to see Njkema Smith.

In Smith's version of events, Spears called her out of the blue one day and told her about the B'More initiative and the services it could offer, free of charge.

""I was like wow, really? Yes, I'm interested!"" Smith said.

In reality, it took years of work to create a system that could find Smith, reliably connect her to the precise level of care she needed, and then track her to see how well those programs served her.

That system began to take shape in 2009, when Baltimore's health department started digging into what it takes to turn around an entrenched, multifaceted problem like infant mortality.

That year, 128 babies died in Baltimore, and 92 percent (118 of 128) were born to black women. The city's population is 63 percent black.

Most of the babies who had been dying in Baltimore were born too soon or too small, were born to teen mothers or mothers who smoked, or shared a bed with an adult or had some other unsafe sleeping arrangement.

""We had a large number of babies dying totally unnecessarily, in ways that people could simply and personally prevent,"" said Rebecca Dineen, lead of the B'More initiative and assistant commissioner for the Bureau for Maternal and Child Health at the city health department.

Having spent 10 years working in maternal and child health in different parts of Africa before arriving in Baltimore in 2008, Dineen was struck by how poor mothers in Baltimore seemed to be faring so much worse.

""In a village in West Africa it's poor, but people don't generally have access to services, so that's what you're working on a lot,"" she said. ""Here, we have every resource on the planet and almost the sickest population in the country. It's deeply, deeply disturbing.""

Greater Cleveland is in the same boat, with its three major hospital systems and one of the highest concentration of physicians per resident, and one of the worst infant mortality and child poverty rates in the country.

In Baltimore as in Cleveland, it was clear that a lot of people cared about helping babies survive. There were dozens of programs across as many agencies and institutions, all fighting for the same resources to try and change things in their small pocket of the city.

No one was looking at the bigger picture. ""It seems to be the case everywhere in public health,"" Dineen said.

To get that bird's eye view of the problem, Baltimore proposed bringing together all of the city's infant mortality efforts under one umbrella, B'More for Healthy Babies, with the leadership of the city health department, the Family League, a respected community non-profit, and HealthCare Access Maryland, which helps enroll and direct women into services.

At the same time, the state of Maryland recognized that to reduce its overall infant mortality rate (in 2009, it was 12 percent above the national average at more than 7 deaths per 1,000 live births), it had to focus its resources on its worst performers: Baltimore and Prince George's County, which borders Washington, D.C., on the eastern edge of the state.

Instead of doling out funds to individual programs in Baltimore, the state began giving the health department all of the city's allotted maternal and child health grant money -- about $4.7 million a year -- to use for the B'More initiative. Maryland also agreed to match any private funding the city could raise to support its efforts.

Health insurer CareFirst stepped up and provided a hefty initial grant -- $3 million for each of the first three years, tapering to $750,000 a year over time.

Despite the initial costs for retraining staff, research and data collection, the plan was never to create new, expensive programs. It was instead to focus on what works, and use the city's limited resources  both money and staff  as efficiently as possible. The B'More program now costs about $15 million annually, mostly for the more expensive weekly home visits to the city's most at-risk pregnant women.

It's a small investment given 14.7 percent of Baltimore's babies are born premature, and the average cost of caring for each of these babies is about $54,000 -- more than 12 times the cost for a healthy baby.

Home visits are only one small part of the city's strategy, though. All pregnant women receive some kind of help, whether it's basic education in the hospital, weekly group prenatal care and pregnancy education through the city's ""Baby Basics"" curriculum, or free fitness classes for new mothers. Safe sleep messages blanket the city, from public service messages broadcast in barbershops to the sides of buses and on billboards.

Visiting at home

Celeste Spears has about 20 women in her home visiting caseload for The Family Tree, where she's worked for about four years. She's been seeing Njkema Smith since early in her pregnancy.

On this July morning, Smith answers the door for Spears wearing a black T-shirt, gray sweatpants and a big smile. Smith's 6-week-old son Walter Malloy Jr., tiny and perfect, is asleep in her arms.

Spears' agency, The Family Tree, has been providing prenatal home visits for more than a decade. In 2009 when the B'More initiative began, theirs was one of nine such programs across the city, all with widely varying services, eligibility criteria, staff training levels, and overlapping recruitment efforts.

Only one used a tested curriculum shown to reduce the risk of infant deaths and other problems, said Dineen.

""Some were actually serving the same neighborhoods and the same clients,"" said Laura Latta, director of early childhood initiatives at Baltimore's Family League. ""There was competition between programs and huge areas of the city that were left uncovered.""

In Cleveland there are four home visiting programs, run out of the city and county, but it's difficult to tell exactly what percentage of eligible women they reach.

Tackling the profusion of home visiting programs in Baltimore was one of B'More's first orders of business. Today, five home visiting programs, all using evidence-based content and trained staffs, are able to reach 2,100 women a year, 378 more than before.

Spears and The Family Tree home visitors follow the Healthy Families America curriculum, which research has shown to increase the use of prenatal care and access to primary care, decrease the percentage of preterm and low-weight babies, improve parent child interaction, increase immunization rates, and improve school readiness.

In controlled studies of the model, babies whose families did not receive home visiting services were 2.5 times as likely to die in infancy compared to those who did receive home visits.

Spears and Smith talk easily about breastfeeding (which is going well), sleeping patterns (both Walter's and mom's), upcoming doctor's appointments, how Smith is feeling (exhausted but happy) and Walter's developmental milestones (mom can expect more cooing, gurgling, fussing and crying soon).

A lot of the information is new to Smith, who never expected to have a baby at 36 and hasn't cared for small children since her siblings and cousins were young.

""I'm always learning something new,"" she says, ""things you think most people know.""

Today, it's simple child development information that will help Walter and his mother bond, like infant massage, and tips on building Walter's growing brain by reading, talking and singing to him. They also talk about signs of illness to watch out for, and when to call a doctor.

Walter was born seven weeks early by emergency C-section due to a condition called placenta previa, which can cause life-threatening blood loss during delivery. In the weeks before his birth, Smith drove to the ER twice in the middle of the night, bleeding. The third time, on June 14th, the doctors delivered her baby.

He weighed 3 pounds, 13 ounces and spent three weeks gaining strength in the neonatal intensive care unit and another five days on a regular hospital floor.

On this July day, he weighs only 612 pounds, but has full cheeks and a plump belly, and his mother swears he's already starting to look like his father. All he does is eat, sleep and poop, she tells Spears, as they settle into their hour-long visit.

Spears is only one member of Smith's support team. Throughout her pregnancy and since Walter's birth, she's also had the help of a medical case manager, and now has weekly visits from a nurse who answers all of her questions about breastfeeding.

""It's like a family,"" Smith says. ""I don't know what I would have done without them.""

Creating order out of chaos

Finding the women who need help, and figuring out which need it most are perhaps the two most bedeviling problems for cities looking to prevent infant deaths.

Baltimore's answer to these problems, at least in part, was a single document: a prenatal risk assessment.

In the past, the city had used a woman's neighborhood or zip code as a rough approximation of her need for services. The one-page risk assessment, filled out for every pregnant woman on Medicaid, establishes actual risk factors known to increase the likelihood of an infant death. Doctors and nurses, hospitals, community service agencies and women themselves fill them out.

So when Da'Naejah Felton went with her mother to a health clinic in 2013 and found out she was pregnant, she received a risk assessment. Same for Njkema Smith last year.

The form includes questions about risks such as close birth spacing, smoking or alcohol use, exposure to long-term stress, diabetes, high blood pressure or previous infant losses. It also gathers valuable demographic and medical data for city health officials looking to track the effectiveness of their programs.

The standard risk assessment had been used across the state of Maryland for decades, but Baltimore started using it in a different way in 2010.

That year, the city set up a triage system, using responses to the risk assessment to assign the smallest number of women with the highest need and risk to the most expensive home visiting programs staffed by nurses. Those with less urgent needs are then filtered to three less costly tiers of home visiting care. Another 3,000 women annually who don't need or want home visiting services are offered pregnancy education through the Baby Basics ""Moms Clubs"" classes.

The triage system is managed through a central databank by the non-profit agency Healthcare Access Maryland, which screens and organizes the forms by risk level and census tract, and then sends them out to the appropriate B'More providers.

Dr. Leana Wen, Baltimore's health commissioner, said the centralized triage system is vital to B'more's success, allowing the city to target its resources to the most vulnerable.

Colleen Wilburn, who runs The Family Tree's home visiting program, said the central triage system has cleaned up a once confusing, overlapping landscape of services.

""It makes so much more sense in terms of making sure people are getting what they need, but also that people weren't getting more than they needed and crowding out others who got nothing,"" she said.

Not everyone was excited about the changes, she said, but any turf battles and bruised egos that resulted have since disappeared. ""I think we've all realized that we can reach such a small percentage of the women who truly need help, that there are more than enough people to serve to go around.""

It's not a perfect system. Only 50 percent of women who should have the form completed do. Still, the importance of the assessment is remarkably clear: B'More's analysis of fetal and infant deaths has shown that women who don't get a prenatal risk assessment are four times more likely to have a bad birth outcome.

Cleveland has no such standardized risk assessment or triage system currently in place.

""It's not because the paper tells you anything; it's because it actually links you to services,"" Dineen said. ""It's hugely important.""

Learning from loss

One of the first questions Celeste Spears asked Njkema Smith during this July morning home visit was about birth control. When Smith reassured Spears that she was soon starting the pill, Spears told the new mom about a smartphone app she could use to remind her to take them every day.

""You know I have everything programmed into my phone,"" Smith said. ""I'm not going to mess up. I'm determined.""

Da'Naejah Felton was resolute about birth control after her pregnancy too. It was one of the first things she took care of after delivery, she said. B'More staff told her about the benefits of long-acting reversible contraception (known as LARC, which include IUDs and simple implants placed in the arm) and that's what she chose.

""Some of my friends, they dropped out [of high school] when they got pregnant, and then after dropping out, then they had another baby,"" she said. ""Not me. Not no more, not now. Probably later, like later later, down the line. I've still got to get myself together.""

When it became clear that there was a systemic lack of adequate post-partum contraceptive counseling for women in Baltimore's hospitals, the B'More initiative adopted the goal of increasing access to family planning, and use of LARC in particular. Offering LARC first, explaining its higher effectiveness at preventing unwanted pregnancies, and making it easily accessible has been shown to reduce birth rates, decrease the percentage of high-risk births, and decrease abortions and use of federal support programs.

Cleveland is just beginning to implement wide-scale LARC training with local and state-level grants.

It was the Baltimore's fetal and infant mortality review, or FIMR, process that alerted the city to a need for more contraceptive counseling. FIMR, used in cities across the country to varying degrees, is a way to track and learn from the deaths of babies in a community, tweaking programs and services to plug gaps in care.

Once a month, about 20 people from all the B'More agencies gather to review the most recent cases, listen to the stories of mothers who have lost babies, and discuss their responses.

A recent annual review showed that through last year, both fetal and infant deaths have declined almost every year since the B'More initiative began.

The program is working, but there are consistent problem areas: too many women not receiving prenatal care or receiving it late, a higher-than-average smoking rate among those who'd lost a baby, and too many babies born too soon and very small.

The data show that the vast majority of fetal and infant deaths can be tied back to the health of the mother before conceiving, rather than prenatal, hospital or postnatal care. Women with risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity were far more likely to suffer an infant loss, and these women were far more likely to be black.

Many of the same issues face mothers in Cleveland, and in many other cities with majority black populations and high poverty rates.

After two-hour meetings, the group leaves with dozens of recommendations, large and small, for improving the B'More initiative.

Among the most recent: replicate the city's successful peer support bereavement program in the Hispanic community, begin a 'loss doula' program to assist mothers who have to deliver stillborn babies, and screen women through the prenatal risk assessment for violence and childhood abuse that might increase their risk of losing a baby.

Moving forward

Da'Naejah Felton is never far from her B'More family.

After she graduated from high school in May, she started an internship at the B'More location in her West Baltimore neighborhood. Her mother, Celeste Tolliver, also works there as a home visitor.

Felton has since taken a job at a local grocery store, but still volunteers at B'More as a mentor for other teen mothers.

Her son, who she calls ""Little Mike,"" is thriving. He loves singing his ABCs, hates to sit still, and loves being around his father. ""He's a goofy baby,"" she says with a smile.

The 19 year old is making plans for her future but is cautious. She's a mother first.

""I want to go,"" she says, then stops and corrects herself. ""Not I want to. I'm going to go to college. But I don't want to... just jump. I want to be set. I don't want to go out there and then me and my son don't have nothing and be right back at square one.""

She'd like to attend Florida State University and hopes for a career in criminal justice, but says she'll start with some community college courses first.

""I want to have a job and experience things,"" she says, light in her eyes. ""I want to do things I've never done before.""

In April 2011, the editors of Disunion, The New York Timess series on the Civil War, convened a panel of historians to mark the 150th anniversary of the Confederate assault on Fort Sumter and the onset of the four-year conflict. Before a sold-out audience at the Times Center in New York City, the panelists  David Blight, Ken Burns, Adam Goodheart and Jamie Malanowski  discussed the origins of the conflict, the role of slavery and the immense challenges facing a still-new president.

Four years later, with the anniversary of Appomattox behind us, The Times has reconvened the same panelists  virtually, this time  to bring the series to a close. Using questions posed by readers and Facebook fans, Disunion asked them to consider the meaning of the war, its consequences and its legacy.

1. What were the two or three biggest mistakes made by Jefferson Davis?

Photo

David Blight, professor of history, Yale University: There is a case that Davis made big mistakes in not developing a better tax policy for the Confederacy, although he surely did work to great ends to develop a centralized federal government, ironically thwarting or ignoring so much of the states rights doctrine on which his government was founded. The cotton embargo may also have been in the long run a big mistake, although that was not all Daviss doing.

But as a long-term historical mistake  or perhaps more of an embarrassment  I would rank Daviss publication of his memoir in 1881 as a genuine low point in the development of his legacy.

The two-volume, 1,279-page Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government is perhaps the longest, most turgid and most self-righteous defense of a failed political movement ever written by an American. The book is hundreds of pages of vindication for the Confederacy, for the slaveholders republic he led, and for the right of secession.

The book also stands as one of the most open and aggressive defenses of slavery written by a former Confederate. Although Davis went to great length to argue that slavery was in no wise the cause of the conflict, but only an incident, he nevertheless provided a thorough version of the alleged mental and historical inferiority of black people. American slaves African ancestors, argued Davis, were born the slaves of barbarian masters, untaught in all the useful arts and occupations, reared in heathen darkness. In America they had been enlightened by the rays of Christianity, taught the arts of peace, order and civilization by their new masters. This world of contented ... faithful service, a happier dependence of labor and capital than realized anywhere else in the world, had all been crushed by Yankee armies and industry.

Davis thus gave the Lost Cause its fundamental lifeblood  faithful black slaves and heroic, victimized white Southerners who in their noble exercise of sovereign rights had tried to hold back the ravages of the Yankee Leviathan. It would be ahistorical to simply wish Davis had not written such a defense of the Confederate cause; but it is always fascinating to witness a colossal tragedy and failure all but unwittingly defended.

Ken Burns, documentary filmmaker: I think the biggest mistake that Jefferson Davis made was being on the wrong side. But it wasnt so much the mistake that Jefferson Davis made but the very configuration of the Confederacy that was central to its defeat  a defeat blamed on Davis the politician rather than on the celebrated generals. Davis had to manage the loose confederation of states when he needed a strong federal government as Lincoln had. The prosecution of the war was impossible for Davis under those circumstances.

Adam Goodheart, director of the C.V. Starr Center for the Study of the American Experience at Washington College: Jefferson Daviss first mistake of the war was also his biggest: the decision to open fire on Fort Sumter in April 1861, thus taking upon the new Confederacy the responsibility for the Civil Wars first shot. By doing so, he created for the Union a moment much like Pearl Harbor or 9/11, when the nation rallied together in the face of a shocking attack, setting aside previous political differences to avenge the awful sight of the American flag going down amid smoke and flames. He badly underestimated the impact this would have on Northern public opinion, especially at a moment when new technologies like the telegraph and steam-powered printing spread descriptions and images of the attack throughout the Union almost immediately.

Davis might easily have waited. The new Confederacy faced no real threat from the tiny Union garrison  just five dozen soldiers and a brass band on a two-acre island, hemmed in on all sides by thousands of rebel troops  and Abraham Lincoln was clearly loath to open hostilities himself. The worst thing Davis could say about the Sumter garrison, in a private letter just a few days before the attack, was that its existence irritate[s] the people of these [Confederate] states.

Had Davis instructed rebel commanders to hold their fire, he not only would have avoided the blame for starting the war, but could also have embraced the opportunity to make his government appear moderate and reasonable to the Northern public and foreign powers. He could have taken additional time to establish the authority of Confederate rule and the apparatus of government  currency, a postal system, custom houses, courts  throughout the South. A smarter strategist might have maneuvered U.S. authorities into effectively treating the Confederacy as a foreign power in negotiating Sumters fate. All of this would have advanced the rebels true strategic interest, which was not to kill Yankees but rather to establish the Confederate States of America as a legitimate national power.

In short, Davis made a mistake that Lincoln would never have: He let a purely symbolic irritant determine the course of national policy. The rebel forces 34-hour artillery barrage at Fort Sumter killed not a single Yankee. But it may have cost the newborn Confederacy its life.

Jamie Malanowski, author of Commander Will Cushing: Daredevil Hero of the Civil War: Many people believe that Daviss biggest mistake was to start the war. True enough, by reacting to Lincolns plan to resupply the garrison at Fort Sumter by opening fire, Davis lost any claim to reasonableness, alienated Northerners who didnt care if the South stayed or left, and fired up the union cause.

But the bigger mistake, the tragic mistake, was in thinking, like the rest of the secessionists, that the Confederacy could ever win the war. At the time the war began, the Confederacy was composed of only seven states; by opening fire, Davis won his bet that he would draw Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas to his side, but he was wrong about Maryland and Kentucky. The confederacy was ill equipped for war; it had a much smaller population than the North, and lacked foundries and railroads. Davis might have sensed that he was being delusional when he appointed a secretary of the navy, even though the South had no ships. Moreover, the South was hardly unified; tens of thousands of former slaves eventually fought for the Union, but 100,000 white Southerners did as well. Southern armies consistently lacked ammunition, equipment and, most seriously, food, primarily because plantation owners kept producing cotton instead of corn.

Most seriously, Davis, like most secessionists, simply underestimated the resolve of the North to preserve the Union. Davis and his fellow secessionists invited the war, and reaped the whirlwind.

2. Who was the most effective military leader of the Civil War?

Photo

Burns: We celebrate the daring and genius of many Southern generals, including Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson and Nathan Bedford Forrest. But they were in essence the last vestige of an old order. The new order was best represented by very middle-class (rather than aristocratic) military men, particularly Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman. Though Sherman is hated in the South, and a good deal of that hatred has migrated north, he was by far the most effective leader of the Civil War, bringing the war to the industrial centers of the South, i.e., the plantations.

Malanowski: Lets raise a glass to Gen. Winfield Scott. Though seemingly something of a comical figure, the aged, infirm Scott devised the strategy of strangulating the Southern economy with a total blockade of the Southern coast, while using a joint Army-Navy force to capture the Mississippi and sever the Confederacy in two. At first it was derided for its passivity; it wasnt called the Anaconda as a compliment. But it worked. Although many blockade runners successfully eluded Navy vessels, Southern commerce was reduced to a tenth of prewar levels. The Southern economy could not supply the food it needed to feed its people, let alone the weapons and supplies needed to sustain a war.

3. Notwithstanding the much-celebrated Emancipation Proclamation, was the end of slavery not accomplished by the slaves themselves, by refusing to remain slaves whenever the presence of Union forces made this possible?

Photo

Blight: We have almost worn this question out. The answer should be and always has been that emancipation was both the result of Lincolns Emancipation Proclamation (the policy) and the brave volition and actions of the slaves themselves (the process). History can never be as simple as sometimes we would like it to be. Either-or history simply does not work in this instance. The crooked path to the Proclamation during 1861-62, its roots in Republican Party ideology, in congressional measures such as the Second Confiscation Act and in hugely important military events such as the battle of Antietam  all this is crucial to understanding how Lincoln ends up delivering the executive order to the armed forces to free all slaves in the states in rebellion by January 1863. But the thousands of individual decisions by slaves themselves, who were at least in proximity to the Union forces, to strike out for their own liberation are equally important.

The very term self-emancipation has sometimes been forced to carry too much weight and significance. It is simply too operatic. This dual story needs to be seen through real evidence, real stories on the ground during the war. There are thousands of such cases well documented in the documentary history of emancipation volumes published over the years at the University of Maryland.

But as a streamlined way into understanding how emancipation came about, see my book A Slave No More, which reprints the postwar memoirs of two former slaves, John Washington and Wallace Turnage. In each case, these former slaves would never have achieved their freedom without their own cunning and extraordinary courage. But they also would never have become free without the presence of the Union Army along the Rappahannock River in April 1862 (Washingtons case) and the Union Navy in Mobile Bay in August 1864 (Turnages case). Willing or unwilling, Union soldiers and sailors helped to free thousands of slaves who were already risking everything to free themselves.

Goodheart: In early 1861, Lincoln and nearly all other white Northern leaders  and most of the general public  wanted to avoid the slavery issue as much as possible. It seemed much safer to frame the struggle in terms of Southern treason and the Unions survival. It was enslaved African-Americans themselves who forced ending slavery onto the Unions wartime agenda.

The most dramatic single event occurred on the night of May 23, 1861, when three Virginia slaves  Frank Baker, Shepard Mallory and James Townsend  escaped across the James River and sought asylum with U.S. forces. By declaring them contraband of war and offering his protection, Gen. Benjamin F. Butler placed the federal government in the role of liberator. This was a revolutionary change, since throughout its previous existence U.S. authority had protected slaveholding as a constitutional right. Soon, thousands more escapees were pouring into the Union lines and becoming the Yankees only reliable allies in the otherwise hostile South. This eventually made Lincolns Emancipation Proclamation appear not just politically acceptable to millions of Northern whites, but even historically inevitable.

To give the Confederates their due, they also did their part to hasten the day of jubilee  albeit inadvertently. When leaders like Vice President Alexander Stephens declared slavery the cornerstone of the Confederacys existence, they more or less acknowledged that Union forces could undermine the rebellion by freeing the slaves. Increasingly as the war went on, Northern leaders, ordinary soldiers and the general public found that a pretty tough invitation to resist.

4. How different was Andrew Johnsons reconstruction strategy from the one Lincoln would have likely employed had he lived to complete his second term?

Blight: To answer and understand this question would take pages. But a quick way to grasp how different Johnsons policy was is to concentrate on the period from midsummer to December 1865. During this period, with Congress out of session, Johnson engineered a process by which the ex-Confederate states were allowed to take back control, practically overnight, of their state governments and of their societies generally. They passed the infamous black codes, restricting movement, economic activity and any civil or political rights for the freedmen. They also restored ex-Confederates to power and office.

Johnsons approach to Reconstruction was rooted in a few fundamental ideas: states rights, white supremacy and rapid presidential control over the readmission of Southern states to the Union. His philosophy about Reconstruction was often summed up in a slogan he adopted: The Constitution as it is and the Union as it was.

We cannot know precisely, of course, how Lincoln would have done all of this differently. What we do know is that he had at least signaled some support for black suffrage, and he was a far more adroit politician than Johnson, a great deal more skilled in dealing with friends or enemies in Congress. It is worth remembering that Johnson was not a Republican; he was an old Jacksonian Democrat, placed on the presidential ticket in 1864 because of his loyal unionism from a seceded state during the war. And it is worth concentrating on why, for very good reasons, the congressional Republicans wrested control of Reconstruction away from Johnson in 1866.

Burns: President Johnson was a reluctant Reconstructionist, a pale diet version of the one Lincoln would have likely employed. He was tentatively carrying out his dead predecessors wishes and into the vacuum of his ambivalence was driven the wedge that would ultimately help cause Reconstruction to collapse.

Malanowski: I dont know about policies, but it would have been interesting to see if Lincolns personal qualities  his magnanimity, intelligence, empathy, personal warmth  and his gifts of language and politics would have allowed him to make a connection with ordinary Southerners and bring about genuine reconstruction. Sadly, its possible that the task would have overwhelmed anyone, and left Lincoln with a diminished reputation.

5. Since the end of the Civil War, the United States went on steadily to become a global power, while Europe went in the opposite direction. Can you comment on the effect of the post Civil War United States in the geopolitical configuration of the world?

Burns: In very simple geopolitical terms, the paradox of the Civil War is clear: It made a diverse collection of states one thing, a Nation. Before the war, when speaking about our country Americans said, the United States are, plural. After the war, we began to say, as we do today, United States is, which is actually ungrammatical. That one thing would within 50 to 75 years be the most powerful country on earth, freed seemingly forever from the sectarian divisions that had driven it to civil war. Europe, with its long history of separate nationalities, its cultural and linguistic differences, couldnt keep up. Even its modern-day attempt at union is beset by problems and divisions from all corners.

Malanowski: I think you would have a hard time convincing Queen Victoria or Winston Churchill or Otto von Bismarck or Vladimir Lenin or almost any European that Europe declined vis a vis the United States at any point prior to the catastrophe of World War II.

Its much more interesting to consider how the post-Civil War United States would have declined if the South had won the war. Had secession succeeded, its easy to imagine other states and sections breaking away, leaving North America like 18th century Europe, a continent of smallish nations of competing interests and ideologies, vying for and going to war over land and resources. Powerful European nations like France and Spain would have tried to retrieve old possessions, inviting Britain and other powers to tamper as well.

And even with the federal armies defeated, it is hard to imagine that millions of Southern slaves would have docilely accepted their crushed hopes. North America would have been a constant war zone, and the wealth and prosperity and power enjoyed by a stable United States during the last 150 years would have been squandered in war and competition.

6. How do you envisage the Civil Wars bicentennial being commemorated in 50 years time? Both within the academic world of Civil War scholars and within the wider American political and public spheres? Where do you see the future of the Civil War heading in these arenas?

Blight: At various gatherings and panels this past spring commemorating the ending of the Civil War, this question would often emerge in some form. The real answer is, of course, none of us know. It would be too easy to predict that the Lost Cause and neo-Confederate memory will have eroded much more, if not even died out. But I rather doubt that. As long as we have a politics of race in America we will have a politics of Civil War memory, and therefore the Lost Cause will have salience. It certainly still does in Americas right-wing politics.

I suspect that the roiling salience of federalism, the battles over states rights that are so persistent in our political culture today, will still be around in some form. But events determine these matters, over and over.

The only thing we might be certain of is that if as a world community, as a species, we do not do something serious and soon to reduce greenhouse gases, and therefore stop global warming, then the commemoration of the Civil War in 2061 will likely not be held in Charleston to remember Fort Sumter, because that city may be under the sea. Perhaps, ironically, by 2061 we will have a new Lost Cause with which to contend: the long, failed effort to thwart the power and greed of climate change deniers. Why is it that only dystopian projections come to mind in relation to this counter-factual question, and very few resembling their opposites?

But to offer something uplifting: Lets all hope that the 14th Amendment survives the next 50 years, that the right to vote for every American, rooted so deeply in the blood of the Civil War, will not be further eroded by one of our political partys desperation to survive, that we can somehow imagine a politics that will revive faith in that federal government saved in the war of 1861-65, and that the disasters that will be necessary to force us to rebuild our national infrastructure will not be too terrible.

Burns: I believe that the Civil Wars centrality will never diminish as long as the United States survives. Fifty years from now at the bicentennial, both the academy and the wider public will marvel at how important the Civil War was and is to almost every aspect of American life.

Goodheart: I hope Ill still be around to see the start of the bicentennial. Ill be 90 years old then, so my own lifetime will cover nearly half the distance between the 1860s (a past that we think of as distant) and the 2060s (a future that still feels remote). The Civil War, in other words, will still be barely two lifespans away. In biological terms, thats the merest blip. Yet our pathetic human concept of what constitutes a long time  unlike our idea of a long distance  seems only to have shrunk during the modern era.

Something tells me that this may start changing in the next 50 years, as the cycles of climates, species and technologies come to overshadow those of wars and presidencies. Centuries and millennia may (again) loom larger than years and decades as the significant units of historical and political time. So Ill make a wild bet that in 2061, the Civil War may actually feel less distant than it does now.

Does that mean it will seem more important, or less? Hard to say. But Im guessing it will increasingly be seen as a signal modernizing and liberalizing moment not just for the United States, but also for the world. Other major developments of the 1850s and 1860s  Darwinism, digital communications, mass media, consumerism, new ideas about gender and sexuality, the rise of European nation-states, the end of Russian serfdom, the vast upheavals in China, India, and Japan  may get smooshed together with the American Civil War into one big story, the story of how one version of human society yielded way to another. The full consequences of that painful and joyous revolution, that fiery jubilee, may be clearer to everyone in 50 years time than they are now.

A safer bet is to predict that the story, or stories, of 1861-65 will continue to enthrall and infuriate us, unite and divide us. Certain episodes in history are like great books: They can be endlessly read, reread, retold and reinterpreted. The ancient Greeks Iliad hasnt gone stale after more than a hundred generations, and theres no reason to expect that our American Iliad will do so after just another two.

Malanowski: Americans dont have much interest in history generally, and less interest in the Civil War than they used to. This is particularly true in the South, where even those who still take pride in a defiant rebel yell find the legacy of slavery and segregation increasingly an embarrassment. Consider this: In February 1961, 100,000 people, most of them ardent segregationists, showed up in Montgomery, Ala., to mark the centennial of Jefferson Daviss inauguration. In Charleston S.C., in December 2010, about 400 people showed up for a secession ball.

We still battle with many of the same issues that brought about the Civil War, and perhaps will continue to do so in 2061. But an increasingly diverse, multiethnic America will find itself celebrating the South that produced Elvis Presley and Martin Luther King Jr., Eudora Welty and Tennessee Williams, Peyton Manning and Muhammad Ali, B.B. King and Johnny Cash, Coca-Cola and whoever invented barbecue  all pillars of modern American culture  and stuffing Nathan Bedford Forrest into the attic.

nytimes.com,2012-10-22 00:00:00,Contradictions and Confusion on an Agreement With Iran,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","The lead news article in Sundays Times raised questions for a number of readers, who were either puzzled or angered by its apparent contradictions.

In the bulldog edition, published Saturday afternoon, The Times reported that Iran and the United States had agreed to one-on-one negotiations over Irans nuclear program. The news  certainly a major development on a hugely important subject was attributed to unnamed Obama administration officials.

In subsequent online editions and in the late print edition, which now appears on NYTimes.com, new information was added to the article, and heres where the confusion began. The White House now denied that an agreement had been reached. So the words in principle had been added to the first paragraph to describe the agreement, and a White House spokesman, Tommy Vietor, was quoted denying there was an agreement.

(If you want to see the different iterations of the story throughout Saturday, visit NewsDiffs.org.)

By Mondays paper, both sides  the White House and Irans foreign minister  were officially denying an agreement.

Readers wanted to know a few things: Is this story for real? Is there indeed an agreement? Whom are we to believe?

I posed the questions to the executive editor, Jill Abramson, who called the Sunday story solid and true. She said that the White House was hair-splitting when it denied that there was an agreement, and that information was added to the original article to reflect the denial while still standing by its original reporting.

Good journalism practice sometimes involves changes between editions. We did not see these changes as significant, Ms. Abramson said.

Complicating the issue is that the reporting is based on unidentified sources, described only as Obama administration officials or U.S. officials.

One reader, Bill OFallon of Brentwood, Tenn., expressed his reaction this way:

Who are these U.S. officials? How strong are the sources? Strong enough to contradict Mr. Vietor? Who shall we believe in this obvious contradiction?

The prominent display of the article, and Ms. Abramsons answer, says that there is indeed an agreement and that the denials are relatively unimportant.

A former foreign editor of The Times, Bernard Gwertzman, was another who wrote, calling himself an unhappy reader.

I would like The Times to be more specific. Is there an agreement or not? If there is, the White House is lying. If there is not, The Times is guilty of overplaying a phony story.

When newspapers use unidentified sources  as sometimes they are justified in doing  they say to the reader: Trust us. We know what were talking about. And that trust is earned over time.

The more information about the sources that can be included, the more the reader has to go on. It makes for a more transparent and far better process.

Its unfortunate that there wasnt much information offered about the unidentified sources in this case. While that may not have been feasible, the result of the vagueness is that it puts the reader in the position of not knowing quite what to believe.

Update: At Monday nights final presidential debate, President Obama firmly branded the Times report on Iran as false: Well, first off, those are reports in a newspaper. They are not true. Click here for The Timess fact-check on Mr. Obamas statement.",[]

Of all the patients I have seen in my 40 years as a psychoanalyst, Daniel was the strangest. He was the most inaccessible, inwardly tormented and infuriating man I have ever known, and yet he stayed in therapy with me for over a decade, calling faithfully every week  he insisted that his work schedule precluded coming in person  even though he spent many of those sessions in silence or addressed me as if I were inanimate. He drove me crazy, he haunted me and he moved me, sometimes all in the same session.

The reason he came to me was simple. He wanted, as he put it, to become a participant in the human race, and to learn how to relate to others of his species. I was hired to teach him how to do it.

Daniel initially chose me for this job because he had read a book I wrote about problem siblings that resonated with his own childhood. He had been terrorized by his older brothers daily violent outbursts, which his parents had done nothing to contain, and had concluded early on that relationships offered no comfort or satisfaction, merely depletion and misery.

Needing or being needed by anyone seemed perilous to Daniel. He barely exchanged a word at work with colleagues whom hed known for years, and his home, which he shared with his extraordinarily longsuffering wife (who had problems of her own), had the air of a monastery, where words were exchanged only by necessity.

Daniel rarely followed through on anything I recommended: having brief conversations by appointment with his wife, going to the company cafeteria, keeping a journal of his thoughts, emailing me between sessions. He would always agree to try, and then find excuses or forget the assignment.

After nine years of this, I was at my wits end. The only thing that kept me going when I lost hope of ever getting through to Daniel was that occasionally he spoke with real feeling about the depth of his loneliness, and his dread that he would never find a way out of the bunker he had constructed to keep himself safe.

Then one day, I got an idea. There was another inhabitant of Daniels household  Jeff  whom I learned of only years after Daniel and I began therapy, because Jeff was so little a part of his consciousness. Jeff was a dog of an unusual breed that Daniels wife doted on and that he utterly ignored, never feeding, petting or walking.

My idea was to enlist Jeff as my co-therapist to help Daniel break through his isolation. I proposed to Daniel that he take some responsibility for Jeffs care, preparing and feeding him dinner daily  his wife would continue to do the morning shift while he was at work  and that he observe his emotions as he did so.

The plan actually piqued Daniels interest, since no talking was involved and the encounters would not require as much from him as human contact would. He agreed to make a serious effort.

Every session thereafter I asked for a progress report. Im doing O.K. with it, Daniel invariably said, but on closer examination it always turned out that there were gaps in his fulfillment of his obligation that he glossed over and then rationalized away. I didnt do it yesterday because there was a TV show around dinner time I didnt want to miss, he might say, or I was out of town or I went running.

The task itself, which seemed simplicity itself to me  at feeding time, open can, fill bowl, wash bowl  proved herculean for Daniel. The sticking point, as we both had anticipated, was reliability. Daniel would have to provide things for Jeff  consideration and support  that nobody had ever given him.

Still, I refused to let Daniel off the hook. You cant just assume that your wife will take up the slack, I cautioned him. Jeff still has to be fed every single night on schedule, just like you do. Now he depends on you for survival  you have to keep his needs in mind and provide for them.

He chafed at this, but he took it to heart.

Then one day, Daniel made an announcement that surprised me as much as it surprised him. Today I heard the dog eating, he said. I noticed it. I liked it. This was the first time that Daniel could recall having ever been pleased, rather than threatened, by being aware of the presence of another. For a man who by his own account rushed through every social interaction, unable to savor it, this was remarkable.

Jeff was more forgiving of Daniels derelictions than I was. And as Daniel became a more reliable, even if far from perfect, master, Jeff  whom Daniel never called by name  took notice, wagging his tail at Daniels approach. The dog just jumped up and laid down by my feet, he reported with unconcealed delight one session. Its a wonderful thing. I have an effect on others.

This was the first time I had heard joy in Daniels voice. Jeffs expression of gratitude, responsiveness and appreciation made Daniels efforts feel worthwhile to him. Feeding your dog is feeding your soul, feeding your humanity, I said, and Daniel responded with a striking reformulation of the same thought: Im only fed when Im feeding.

The next session, Daniel reported another milestone. Today, he said, the dog and I looked each other in the eye. I suggested that he start to call Jeff by his name, to indicate that they had a mutual relationship.

There were signs of real love developing between Daniel and Jeff. I miss it when I dont feed the dog, Daniel said one day. Hes so happy to see me. Im becoming part of his life. I pat his belly and stroke his head.

There were still limits to Daniels engagement. He had yet to take Jeff for a walk, for example. But I left the two of them alone to work out that issue at their own pace. I tried to be as patient with Daniel as Jeff was.

Finally, one night, unprompted, Daniel took a leap of faith. He turned to his wife after dinner and said: Im lonely. I havent treated you well or thought about you for all these years. I was too afraid to let myself care about anything or anybody, but I know you care about me. I want to make it up to you.

She reached for his hand.

Then he took her for a walk.

Photo

There is a photograph of my father and grandfather, taken on Sunday, Aug. 27, 1939, at a spot overlooking the Rhine above the Lorelei Rock, where the chasm of the river tightens and the quickened flow makes a murmuring sound, which has mystical resonance for the Germans.

My dad had emigrated to Canada in 1934. He was in Germany that summer visiting his parents for the first time in five years. His name was Hermann, but even his German friends called him Billy. My grandfather was Heinrich, but his Anglo-Irish wife called him Bobs.

They had come out from Frankfurt, on a Sunday jaunt, in a little car that my father had borrowed from a friend. Their lives were insecure, jangled by history, and dressing well was very important to them. They always had to be perfectly tailored and groomed, as they are in the photo. Bobs ordered suits he really couldnt afford from his English tailor in Hamburg. The American soft-collared shirt hes wearing in the picture was a present from his son, who had made a quick stop at Brooks Brothers on Madison Avenue between getting off his train from Montreal and boarding the New York, a Hamburg-American liner.

Five days after the photograph was taken the German Army invaded Poland and the Second World War began. When I look at the photo, it seems to me my grandfather is seeing the war coming down the river. Billy has a hand on his fathers shoulder, as if to reassure him  but Bobs sees what he sees. Or maybe hes listening to the Lorelei. In some legends the rivers murmur is a bewitching sound made by a beautiful woman, luring men to their death in a dangerous place.

Maybe shes whispering, War.

They were Catholics, not Jews, not socialists, so not especially vulnerable. Bobs had been scolded by a febrile shopkeeper, a local Nazi Party boss, for declining to return the German greeting, the Heil Hitler gesture, but that was nothing compared with the insults and terror that others experienced.

My grandparents had met and were married in London. They were living in a seaside villa on the Isle of Wight when World War I began in August 1914. Bobs was arrested and interned as an enemy alien for four and a half grim years, then deported. His health was shattered. Their savings were exhausted. English Quakers gave them enough money to pay for their tickets and food on the journey to Germany. Along the way their trunks of clothes and household goods were looted by French occupation troops.

When they stepped off the train in Frankfurt in January 1919, neither my grandmother nor my father spoke a word of German. She never learned, but Billy taught himself by reading and rereading the novels of Karl May, romantic tales of German adventurers and noble Apaches on the high plains of Texas and New Mexico. May was Einsteins favorite writer. Hitlers, too.

That summer of 1939 Billy had hoped to persuade his parents to leave Germany. But applying for exit visas meant posting bonds and paying an extortionate flight tax, with no guarantee the visa would even be granted. And my grandfather doubted that England, Ireland or Canada would welcome him, well-dressed or not, any more than they welcomed German Jews. He was a deportee. If they did let him in, he was sure to be interned if another war began.

Five days after that moment on the Rhine, with the war underway, Billy received a telegram from the British consul in Cologne, warning of strained relations between His Majestys Government and Germany and suggesting he leave the country immediately.

He had booked his return on another Hamburg-American liner sailing for New York in the first week of September. But waiting that long was risky. And he couldnt afford to be caught aboard a German-flagged ship if England declared war (which it did on Sept. 3). According to the Nuremberg racial laws he was a German. The Nazis wouldnt recognize his British passport in time of war; he would owe the same duty to the Fatherland as anyone else. Which meant military service or a one-way ticket to Dachau.

He decided to aim for Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, and a Holland America ship. His train from Frankfurt was oversold. The mood on the platform was near hysteria: In a few hours Britain would declare war on Germany. He said goodbye to his parents, in English. Bobs was concerned the German border police would board the train as it approached the frontier and take Billy off, but he reached Rotterdam safely. After three fraught weeks, he was able to get passage on a ship for New York. Reaching Montreal, he immediately applied for a commission in the Royal Canadian Navy. He was turned down for being too German.

My father did not hear from his parents for years, didnt know they were still alive until a friend serving in the Canadian Army found them living in the rubble of Frankfurt in 1945.

My grandparents were not Jews. Nothing else in their story probably mattered more than this: They werent Jews. Theyd bartered their English shoes and silver picture frames for potatoes, their city had fallen down around them, but they were alive.

Decades later I was with my father in a hospital room in Montreal. He was dying, and slipping in and out of a coma. No one had shaved him or combed his hair in a couple of days and he wore one of those demeaning hospital johnnies. He looked pretty wild. Every now and then hed start climbing out of bed. Then hed calm down and, sounding very lucid, ask me to fetch his suit out of the closet, and his shoes, and help him get dressed, quickly. Properly dressed, because the last train was leaving for Rotterdam, and he had to get himself aboard, and across the frontier.

Within the setting of the often excellent Opinion section blog, Room for Debate, and in the context of Sheryl Sandbergs book Lean In, it read: Do Women Have What It Takes to Lead?

On Twitter, Sarah Green, an editor at the Harvard Business Review, deemed it not fit to print. Those responding to her were quick to note that The Timess own newsroom is led by Jill Abramson, the executive editor.

In a blog called Policymic, Elizabeth Plank took up the topic with a certain amount of impatience.

Can you hear that? Ah yes. Thats the distinct sound of thousands of face palms echoing all over the nation. And she noted that the subject was last formally addressed in 1954 in the October issue of The Homemaker.

By phone, Ms. Green later called the question undermining.

If you substituted any other demographic group, I think there would have been an a-ha moment by an editor that this wasnt such a good idea, she told me.

She added: Why, with women, are we still asking questions like that? Is it, she wondered, because sexism is harder to see? And, she said, Because we dont see women in leadership positions as much, people think theres something wrong with the women.

Harvard Business Review has published a number of studies that suggest that women actually outpace men in leadership abilities, according to both genders.

So why dont we have more female leaders? I think thats a much more interesting (and debatable) question than Do women have what it takes? Ms. Green said.

Rachel Sklar, co-founder of Change The Ratio  a nonprofit organization which sets out to increase visibility, access and opportunity for women in tech and media  and who was behind much of the Twitter traffic on this subject, also joined the fray in her blog.

The editor of Room for Debate, Susan Ellingwood, responded to my question about the headline.

Raising a provocative question is our way of starting an interesting discussion. That title starts a productive conversation about gender stereotypes and leadership  even if, in the end, the consensus among the debaters is yes, women do have what it takes. Each post explored the question from a different angle. And as readers reactions show, the pieces sparked a conversation about an important topic. Thats our goal. What struck all of us here at Room for Debate is that the publicity around Sheryl Sandbergs book promotes an aggressive self-centered male approach to leadership, and yet there are many studies that show that team-building and consensus, seen as a female, approach to leadership can be more effective.

Gender equity, equal pay, the differences in leadership styles, the relatively small number of women in top corporate jobs or top elected positions, how women can succeed at both career and home life  all of these topics are worth discussing. (And now that we all live in what sometimes feels like Ms. Sandbergs Lean In nation, were certainly getting plenty of opportunities to do just that.) No complaints there.

But prompting the discussion with a question whose answer is self-evident may not be the best approach.

As Ms. Plank responded to the question: Uh, yes.",[]

And its no wonder, since President Obama needs women desperately to win in November. Female voters tend to like Mr. Obama more than Mitt Romney  though Mr. Obamas popularity among women has fallen sharply. So women were very much in the mix. (A nifty interactive graphic on NYTimes.com shows that women was the keyword mentioned third most often Tuesday night  after Obama and work.)

Each female speaker had her subject: Nancy Keenan had abortion (and she actually used the word, not its euphemism, choice). The Iraq war veteran Tammy Duckworth, a moving figure with her prosthetic limbs and heartfelt delivery, had the military and overcoming poverty.

Michelle Obama had everything (including, it must be said, a great dress, featuring what a friend of mine would call her Second Amendment look  the right to bare arms). Smart female commentators like Rebecca Traister of Salon were impressed by the first ladys speech and yet a bit regretful that it essentially blotted out this Ivy League-educated womans accomplishments beyond those of Mom in Chief. Alessandra Stanley s TV Watch ably and entertainingly compared Ann Romneys speech last week with Mrs. Obamas.

Then, there was Lilly Ledbetter, the 74-year-old Alabama woman whose (unsuccessful) fair-pay suit became the basis of the first law that Mr. Obama signed as president, who spoke about pay equity.

One would think that this subject  and those closely related  would be a topic worth noting, given how it lives right at the nexus of all-important women and the all-important economy.

But that subject  not just pay equity but also gender-economic issues in general  were all but ignored in press coverage of womens night, at least in print. The Times gave Ms. Ledbetter a half-sentence in Wednesdays print edition. The Wall Street Journal allotted not even that in its morning newspaper, although the Washington Wire on WSJ.com took up the subject the night before. (Granted, only Ms. Ledbetter, among the speakers, focused on gender-pocketbook issues fully, so the fault may be as much a missed opportunity by the Democratic strategists as a hole in coverage by the press.)

Tim Harper of The Toronto Star took up the gender gap story in his online column Wednesday, but there wasnt much else  at least not that I saw. Readers, I know, will correct me if Im wrong.

Gender issues, particularly those going beyond the hot-button discussion of abortion, are worth exploring, and its too bad that the Democratic night-of-women opportunity didnt prompt such a focus.

There was plenty of reader response to Tuesdays post about fact-checking and the truth. I hope to develop the subject further for a column in the Sunday Review section.

About a week before he used the national political stage to ask viewers to think about Donald Trumps finger size, Marco Rubio told the audience during another recent Republican presidential debate to Google Donald Trump and Polish workers. They did.

The worry is no longer about who controls content. It is about who controls the flow of that content.

Rubio wanted voters to see news stories about Trump illegally hiring undocumented Polish workers more than 35 years ago to demolish a building to make way for Trump Tower. Searches for those terms, and the fraudulent Trump University, shot way up. It was like a public version of the now ubiquitous phenomenon of everyone whipping out smartphones to verify a disputed fact at a party or meeting. Not that it did much good in this case; as numerous commentators have noted, Trump and many of his supporters dont seem particularly worried about minor annoyances like facts. (For the record, PolitiFact, which checks the veracity of politicians statements, judged Rubios charge to be half true.)

Nonetheless, Rubios Google gambit and Trumps (non)reaction to it, reveals an interesting, and troubling, new change in attitude about a philosophical foundation of democracy: the ideal of an informed citizenry.

Political thinkers have long claimed with Jefferson that, An educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free people. The idea is obvious: If citizens are going to make even indirect decisions about policy, we need to know the facts about the problem the policy is meant to rectify, and to be able to gain some understanding about how effective that policy would be. In the larger sense, if we are going to decide who runs the country  and we are, if you think the electoral college allows for that  we need to know the facts about the candidates records.



This is one reason philosophers have always been worried about the ebb and flow of information, and who controls it. Plato argued in The Republic that the fact that democracies couldnt control that flow and point it toward truth was one reason they often dissolved into tyranny. In a different vein, Noam Chomsky argued in the 1980s that consent was being manufactured by Big Media  large consolidated content-delivery companies (like this newspaper) that could cause opinions to sway one way or the other at their whim. Knowledge is power; capture it and you capture power in a democracy.

Now in print The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments An anthology of essays from The Timess philosophy series, published by Liveright.

The political importance of information  and the fear that it can be manipulated  has not changed. What has changed is how we are informed about politics or anything else, or how we arent. The Big Media that worried Chomsky 30 years ago is largely a thing of the past; many of the largest newspapers are gone, and others are shadows of their former selves. In the halcyon early days of the Internet, when we began excitedly exploring the information Garden of Eden, still free of the shadow of social media, it was easy to think that knowledge itself had become democratic, and that Platos worry had at last been shown to be bankrupt. But the worry hasnt gone away  it has just changed form.

The worry is no longer about who controls content. It is about who controls the flow of that content. It is no coincidence that we are now seeing Big Data companies like Facebook sponsor presidential debates. Nor is it a coincidence that people are increasingly following the election on social media, using it both as the source of their information and as the way to get their view out. Consent is still being manufactured, but the manufacturing is being done willingly by us, usually intended for consumption by other people with whom we already agree, facts or no facts.

It really isnt a surprise that Rubio would ask us to Google for certain facts; thats how you and I know almost everything we know nowadays  it is a way of knowing that is so embedded into the very fabric of our lives that we dont even notice it. What else could Rubio ask us to do to fact-check Trump? We used to say that seeing is believing; now Googling is believing.

Of course, in many ways following that norm  Google it!  can help us realize the Jefferson ideal of an informed citizen I sketched above. That ideal, recall, emerges out of the simple fact that reasonable action requires knowledge, and reasonable political action requires political knowledge. And Google places more politically important information at our fingertips than ever before. So if the ideal of being informed means having more information available for uptake, there is a case for saying that we are now closer than ever to realizing that ideal. That is behind the thought, commonly voiced in the early part of this century, that the Internet has democratized knowledge.

The Internet is both the worlds best fact-checker and the worlds best bias confirmer  often at the same time.

The problem of course is that having more information available, even more accurate information, isnt what is required by the ideal. What is required is that people actually know and understand that information, and there are reasons to think we are no closer to an informed citizenry understood in that way than we ever have been. Indeed, we might be further away.

One reason for thinking so is that searching the Internet can get you to information that would back up almost any claim of fact, no matter how unfounded. It is both the worlds best fact-checker and the worlds best bias confirmer  often at the same time. Group polarization on the Internet is a fact of digital life. Liberals friend liberals and share liberal-leaning media stories and opinions with them; conservatives friend conservatives, and do the same.

And the flow of digital information is just as prone to manipulation as its content  even when that flow is directed at an audience larger than our own immediate circle. Take an example: Search for what really happened to the dinosaurs and one of the top results is likely to be from a site called answersingenesis.org  not, I suggest, a good source of information on the T-Rex. But it illustrates how canny use of search engine metrics can be used to push an agenda. No wonder Trump and his followers on Twitter immediately shrugged off Rubios inconvenient truths; there is nothing to fear from information when counterinformation is just as plentiful.

Thats why the real worry here isnt about the regrettable if obvious fact that citizens are less informed than our ideals demand. Nor is it simply the amusing specter of candidates shouting competing Googling instructions at the audience like so many carnival barkers. The real worry concerns our faith in the ideal of an informed citizenry itself. That worry, as I see it, has two faces.

First, as Jason Stanley and others have emphasized recently, appeals to ideals can be used to undermine those very ideals. People on both the left and the right tell one another that the information is right there; people just arent paying attention to the facts (Google it!). The very availability of information can make us think that the ideal of the informed citizen is more realized than it is  and that, in turn, can actually undermine the ideal, making us less informed, simply because we think we know all we need to know already.

Second, the danger is that increasing recognition of the fact that Googling can get you wherever you want to go can make us deeply cynical about the ideal of an informed citizenry  for the simple reason that what counts as an informed citizen is a matter of dispute. We no longer disagree just over values. Nor do we disagree just over the facts. We disagree over whose source  whose fountain of facts  is the right one.

And once disagreement reaches that far down, the daylight of reason seems very far away indeed.

UNDERSTANDING American drone strikes is like a deadly version of the old telephone game: I whisper to you and you whisper to someone else, and eventually all meaning is lost.









You start with uncertain information from dubious sources. Pass it along, run it through the media blender, add pundits, and youve got something that may or may not be close to the truth.

How many people have been killed by these unmanned aircraft in the Central Intelligence Agencys strikes in Yemen and Pakistan? How many of the dead identified as militants are really civilians? How many are children?

The Bureau of Investigative Journalism in Britain has estimated that, in the first three years after President Obama took office, between 282 and 535 civilians were credibly reported killed by drone strikes  including more than 60 children. The United States government says the number of civilians killed has been far lower.

Accurate information is hard to come by. The Obama administration and the C.I.A. are secretive about the fast-growing drone program. The strikes in Pakistan are taking place in areas where reporters cant go, or would be in extreme danger if they did. And it is all happening at a time when the American public seems tired of hearing about this part of the world anyway.

How does The New York Times fit into this hazy picture?

Some of the most important reporting on drone strikes has been done at The Times, particularly the kill list article by Scott Shane and Jo Becker last May. Those stories, based on administration leaks, detailed President Obamas personal role in approving whom drones should set out to kill.

Groundbreaking as that article was, it left a host of unanswered questions. The Times and the American Civil Liberties Union have filed Freedom of Information requests to learn more about the drone program, so far in vain. The Times and the A.C.L.U. also want to know more about the drone killing of an American teenager in Yemen, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, also shrouded in secrecy.

But The Times has not been without fault. Since the article in May, its reporting has not aggressively challenged the administrations description of those killed as militants  itself an undefined term. And it has been criticized for giving administration officials the cover of anonymity when they suggest that critics of drones are terrorist sympathizers.

Americans, according to polls, have a positive view of drones, but critics say thats because the news media have not informed them well. The use of drones is deepening the resentment of the United States in volatile parts of the world and potentially undermining fragile democracies, said Naureen Shah, who directs the Human Rights Clinic at Columbia Universitys law school.

Its portrayed as picking off the bad guys from a plane, she said. But its actually surveilling entire communities, locating behavior that might be suspicious and striking groups of unknown individuals based on video data that may or may not be corroborated by eyeballing it on the ground.

On Sunday, Ms. Shahs organization will release a report that raises important questions about media accuracy on drone strikes. But accuracy is only one of the concerns that have been raised about coverage of the issue.

Its very narrow, said David Rohde, a columnist for Reuters who was kidnapped by the Taliban in 2008 when he was a Times reporter. Whats missing is the human cost and the big strategic picture.

Glenn Greenwald, a lawyer who has written extensively on this subject for Salon and now for The Guardian, told me he sees a Western media aversion to focusing on the victims of U.S. militarism. As long as you keep the victims dehumanized its somehow all right.

Mr. Rohde raised another objection: If a Republican president had been carrying out this many drone strikes in such a secretive way, it would get much more scrutiny, he said. Scott Shane, the Times reporter, finds the topic knotty and the secrecy hard to penetrate. This is a category of public yet classified information, he told me. Its impossible to keep the strikes themselves secret, but youve never had a serious public debate by Congress on it. Last month, ProPublica admirably framed the issue in an article titled How the Government Talks About a Drone Problem It Wont Acknowledge Exists.

As for the human cost, Sarah Knuckey, a veteran human rights investigator now at New York University School of Law, says she got a strong sense of everyday fear while spending 10 days in Pakistan last spring.

I was struck by how afraid people are of the constant presence of drones, said Ms. Knuckey, a co-author of a recent Stanford/N.Y.U. report on the drone campaigns impact on Pakistanis. They had the sense that they could be struck as collateral damage at any time.

She is also troubled by the governments lack of transparency. The U.S. is creating a precedent by carrying out strikes in secrecy without accountability to anyone, Ms. Knuckey said. What if all countries did what the U.S. is doing?

The Taliban and Al Qaeda are much worse problems for the Pakistani and Yemeni people than American drone strikes are. But acknowledging that doesnt answer the moral and ethical questions of this push-button combat conducted without public accountability.

With its vast talent and resources, The Times has a responsibility to lead the way in covering this topic as aggressively and as forcefully as possible, and to keep pushing for transparency so that Americans can understand just what their government is doing.",[]
nytimes.com,2013-03-25 00:00:00,Anna Quindlen and Andrew Solomon Join Discussion About Media and Transgender Children,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","My blog post last week  about Coy Mathis, the 6-year-old transgender Colorado child  drew some strong responses from readers. On Twitter, I immediately heard from those who sharply questioned my suggestion that the willingness of the child be considered, along with parental approval, in deciding to name her and use photographs of her. As many of these critics (some of whom were parents) noted, young children are willing to do many things they might regret later; they dont have the maturity to know how their actions will play out.

More thoughtful reasoning than mine came from Anna Quindlen, the author and former Times columnist whose work I have long admired. She wrote in an e-mail:

I was intrigued by your journal entry today because it raises a question that is so beautifully and intelligently explored in the new book Far From the Tree, by Andrew Solomon. If you havent read it, I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is about children who are essentially different than their parents  there is a chapter on transsexual children and their familiesbut an overarching question he raises is when and whether parents have a moral right to make certain choices for their minor children. Can hearing parents really make a dispassionate decision for a toddler about a cochlear implant? What about the average-sized parents of a dwarf, who, if she is to receive painful and extensive limb-lengthening surgery, must begin at 7 or 8? And do parents make such decisions based on what is best for their child or what is best for their self-image? Its a fascinating question, and I thought of it when you noted that Coys parents had agreed to let her be photographed and interviewed. They have the legal right to do that, Im surebut do they have the moral right to do so? I dont know the answer. I only know that, as Solomon suggests over and over again in his exceptional book, parents frequently make decisions based on a complex calculus that has as much to do with them as their kids. I know I did that even as I tried not to do so.

Ms. Quindlens e-mail prompted me to get in touch with Mr. Solomon, who had appeared on Katie Courics ABC program with Coy Mathis and her parents last month. In a phone interview, he agreed that young children cant be allowed to make important decisions for themselves, joking that he wont let his own four-year-old son decide what to have for dinner, much less make choices that could change his life forever. Parents accepting and loving guidance is a necessity, he said.

But, on balance, he sees an enormous greater good coming from children such as Coy Mathis and her parents taking their stories public and in articles like the one in The Times. He spoke of another transgender girl, 11-year-old Jazz, who became well-known through a January interview with Barbara Walters.

The presence of these children has a huge impact in making other transgender children feel that they are not alone and that their lives are not a cause for shame, Mr. Solomon said, noting the high rate of suicide and despair among transgender children.

Stories like these can spare families enormous suffering.

In addition to that greater good, there is potential for personal benefit to the child as well: being able to live openly and honestly, and in some cases, even to feel a sense of mission in helping other children accept themselves.

There is a tendency to see this as shameful and best kept secret, he said. That is tremendously burdensome.

I talked at length, after the post appeared, with the associate managing editor for standards, Philip B. Corbett, who described making decisions involving a childs privacy as a very difficult issue, made more difficult because of the Google factor. By that, he means that references to the child in news stories live on forever and are instantly accessible.

That doesnt change our fundamental approach of weighing what we need to tell our readers against privacy concerns, he said, but it is a complicating factor.

But, Mr. Corbett added, Our default setting is to inform readers, not to withhold information.

The Times article, sensitively told by Dan Frosch, certainly had more impact because of the pictures, the details, the name, Mr. Corbett said. Without those elements, he said, We would have lost something.

It is, of course, a tricky balance. We need to be reluctant to say we know better than a childs parents whats good for the child, Mr. Corbett said.

Reporters do need to be sensitive to parents whose motivations are questionable. That doesnt seem to be the case here, he said.

Many readers also questioned the thinking that, because Coy Mathis had already appeared on a network talk show and elsewhere, The Times had a less difficult choice to make.

Mr. Corbett responded to this point: When something is so widely known that theres no privacy left to protect, that does weigh into our consideration, he said. We need to think it through every time and be prepared to pull back.

In this case, he said: We did a thoughtful, difficult story on an important subject. Its a decision were comfortable with but not an easy one.

Without a doubt, Mr. Solomon said, Its murky territory. News organizations should evaluate the motives of parents who are willing to make their childs story public and to actively advocate, as the Mathises have done.

Theres a lot of self-aggrandizement that can creep in, but I dont think thats so in this case.

The media has to assess the balance of harm and good, Mr. Solomon said. There are risks but the positives count, too.",[]

On the day before my mother died, she gave my father a list of demands. He wrote them on the back of an envelope and showed them to me as he left the intensive care unit. There, in his clear block handwriting, it read:

CREAM

WHISKEY

HEROIN

My mother was not herself. And yet, she was completely herself. When Moms liver stopped working, her brain, which we had always considered loopy, grew addled. But she was still funny. She hallucinated monkeys on unicycles circling her bed. She learned that Michael Jackson had died, probably from all that plastic surgery, she said. She remembered Sarah Palin, and thought she was a twit.

Mom died, at 67, in 2009, but lately Ive been reflecting on her last days. Im applying to medical school, and her story keeps coming up in my essays and interviews. Her death spurred me to apply, partly because it gave me courage  nothing in med school could be worse than watching the way my mother died. Her death was so grisly that I vowed to help change the way people die in America.

Mom had a chronic liver condition, an autoimmune disease that had been under control for years but suddenly worsened. After her liver failed, her kidneys followed, then her lungs. After four months in the I.C.U. she was on 24-hour dialysis, with a breathing tube down her throat and a feeding tube up her nose. She hated all the tubes; her hands were tied to the bed so she couldnt pull them out.

She needed a liver transplant, but was too sick to survive one. Then a fungal infection invaded her lungs, dodged the antibiotics and spread through her body. On a Friday afternoon in August, our family met with the doctors. If we left Mom on life support, the fungus would eat her alive, putrefying her innards, turning her fingers black. It would be a cruel death, they said.

Its already been a cruel death, I thought.

We decided to let Mom go.

And so there we were, standing at the edge of my mothers life. After the nurse removed the tubes and machines, we gathered around the hospital bed. The doctors didnt know how long she could live without life support  somewhere between 15 minutes and a week. We didnt tell her she was dying, but she understood. A nurse for 28 years, she knew the game was up. But she was happy, thrilled to be off the ventilator. She talked, made jokes, greedily sucked on mouth swabs soaked in ginger ale. The television played soft piano music and looped pictures of sunsets and mountains, birds and flowers. The C.A.R.E. channel, it was called  continuous ambient relaxation environment. That was good for some laughs. Maybe this wont be so bad, I thought.

It got dark. Most of the family went out for a break, leaving my brother, uncle and me with Mom. Moments later, her face crumpled into despair. As we held her hands, she sobbed silently, turning her head from side to side. She didnt speak. She just wept.

She wept for fear of death, for the betrayal of her body, for the hopelessness of it all. She wept for the places she would never visit, the retirement she never had. She wept for her only grandchild  my son  who would not remember her, for the second grandchild in my pregnant belly whom she would never meet.

I have never seen such anguish. I have never felt so helpless. My stomach churned in panic. I had no experience with death, or consoling the dying. The only person I knew how to comfort was my 18-month-old son.

Do you want to hear a song? I asked.

My mother, crying silently, nodded yes.

Heres one that Finny likes.

I took a breath and blurted it out:

Three little speckled frogs

Sitting on a speckled log

Eating the most delicious bugs 

Yum! Yum!

One jumped into the pool,

Where it was nice and cool,

Now there are two speckled frogs!

I danced around the darkened hospital room. Blub blub! Mom rolled her eyes.

By the next evening Mom was on a steady morphine drip, drifting in and out of consciousness. She slept fitfully, her hands fluttering toward her face, touching her forehead, then resting on her chest. Occasionally she opened her eyes and stared at her hands uncomprehendingly. They were knobbed with arthritis, yellowed with jaundice; already the hands of a corpse.

When she woke up, my sister and I went to the bed. Hi Mom, I said. Are you in pain?

She squinted at me, then rolled her eyes. Why are you still here? she asked. Youre crazy! Watch out, I warned, or Ill sing the frog song again. She smiled and fell asleep.

My mothers room, on a top floor of a major university teaching hospital near Boston, had a large picture window. Through it, I could see the roof of the building next door, and beyond that the lake where my sister and I had learned to sail. On the rooftop an orange windsock swelled in the breeze. It was illuminated somehow, and strangely beautiful. I sat next to the window, dozing.

I dreamed about Ted Kennedy. He had died a few days earlier, and his memorial services had blanketed the Boston news. I was jealous of Kennedy. He spent his last days at home, smelling the salt of the ocean. He ate bowls of butter crunch ice cream, watched James Bond movies and shared dinner with friends.

Im sure Kennedys death had its share of horror, but that didnt curb my envy. Teddy got ice cream; my mom got a sterile sponge soaked in warm ginger ale. Ted got the ocean; Mom got a gritty rooftop with a windsock. Ted got his own bed and movies; Mom got the blinking lights of the I.C.U. and the stupid C.A.R.E. channel. Her TV didnt even have good reception.

She did not regain consciousness, and died the next morning. I made peace with her death, but not with her dying. She had four months in the I.C.U., endless and pointless and painful procedures, and final days full of fear and despair. Why is this medicines default death for so many people?

Now, seven years later, as I apply for medical school, the question comes up again and again. I suppose I should have devised some pat answers by now, prepared my bullet points. But I havent.

My mothers brutal death exposes so many flaws in American medicine: our lack of palliative care, our unwillingness to face end-of-life decisions, our inability to stop the procedures and just let go. Her death was a system failure, and as a doctor I dont know how I alone can fix the system. I know only that I will try.

The comments on this weeks column on kangaroo care were extraordinary. Reader after reader told personal, emotional stories of how they did kangaroo care  wearing a baby for many hours a day on a parents chest  with their premature babies. I particularly liked the story sent in by Anita Bruce of Modesto, Calif.: her five- and seven-year-old boys also took turns kangarooing their preemie sister. Many other readers discussed the wonders of holding their newborns of normal weight, and even older children. Clearly, kangaroo care was already familiar to many people, and its benefits instinctively appreciated.

How did kangaroo care get from Bogota, Colombia to Lilongwe, Malawi? Not by accident.

Since we cannot remember our experiences as newborns, it is not surprising that many readers focus was the feelings of closeness, assurance and competence that they received as parents from kangaroo care. Cmw from Florida proposes a study comparing the long-term effects of kangaroo care on mothers. It is a great question. Cmw writes that she visited the Bogota hospital where kangaroo care was born, and remembers the pride of the mothers. Im sure that for many if not most of them, saving their babies was their first opportunity to feel successful and proud and to win the respect of others, she says.

Other readers, however, recounted the barriers to this practice put up in hospitals by the American medical-industrial complex. It is a peculiarly American deformation to throw lawyers and things that beep at a job mothers elsewhere accomplish armed with a scarf and a few throw pillows. Jane from Princeton, N.J. writes that despite the posters touting kangaroo care on the neonatal intensive care units wall, she had to fight to hold her babies. She writes: I know so many American parents who are bullied throughout their deliveries and in hospital nurseries and NICUs, and they dont have the knowledge or the confidence to tell the medical staff that much of what the staff espouses has nothing to do with health and healing and everything to do with hospital routine, convenience, and modern medical mythology.

The very real fear of litigation if the baby doesnt turn out all right and the push towards practices that are well-covered by insurance probably also play a role. Reader Cat from North Dakota reports that when members of the special kangaroo care team at the hospital realized that her insurance didnt cover them training her, they packed up and left.

I appreciate the comments by Prof. Kim Gutschow of Williamstown, Mass., who was able to answer some readers questions with information from scholarly studies about kangaroo care.

Readers seem to have ceded to me the subject of kangaroo care in places where there is no doctor, no incubator, not much of anything. To the credit of the Colombians, they did not stop with developing the concept. They are also ensuring it can be transplanted everywhere.

Mary Yenda gave birth to twin boys in Bwaila Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi, on October 28. Innocent Yenda weighed 1500 grams  less than 3 pounds, 5 ounces. His brother Innock weighed 1600 grams at birth. It is fair to say that 10 years ago, the boys would not have survived. But now they are at home and growing well  the larger boy weighs 2800 grams (6 pounds) and the smaller one weighs 2500 grams. Every mother there was doing kangaroo, Yenda said. I followed the instructions of the nurses. I did kangaroo the entire time except when I went to the bathroom. Her mother was there to help her  crucial with twins.

If your child is lying in the nursery you cannot know what is going on with him, Yenda said. But with kangaroo, when your child is having a problem, you know it. You know if he cries and why he cries. And you can sit and feed him any time you want. At home, she does kangaroo as she does her housework. She was wearing one of the twins, in fact, as we talked on the phone.

Nurses came around when they saw that kangaroo care helped babies and also cut their enormous workloads.

How did kangaroo care get from Bogota, Colombia, to Mary Yenda in Lilongwe, Malawi? Not by accident. The Colombians established the Fundacion Canguro to spread the word about kangaroo care. With grants from rich-country groups  early on, most important was the World Laboratory in Switzerland, which promotes scientific cooperation  groups of doctors and nurses from 25 countries have visited Bogota. They include Vietnam, Mali, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Chile, Cuba, Mexico and India. The Fundacion Canguro will only host health teams if they can show that their hospital is committed to establishing kangaroo care, said Dr. Nathalie Charpak, who runs the Fundacion today. The visiting doctors and nurses stay in Bogota for 10 days or three weeks and watch kangaroo care in hospitals and in homes. Once they have returned home and set up a program, the Fundacion sends them its own doctor and nurse to help them get started.

Now, much of the financing to teach kangaroo care comes from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In many countries the work on the ground is done by Save the Children, which campaigns for kangaroo care to become official policy, trains health ministry workers, provides materials and hosts training visits by health care workers from other countries.

Before kangaroo care came to Malawi, low birth weight babies were kept in wooden boxes with a light bulb below the mattress for warmth. Babies stayed in these incubators for up to three months, sometimes three per incubator. Many died, often of infection.

This began to change when Richard Luhanga and his wife, Madalitso, went to Bogota in 2000. He was a clinical officer at Zomba General Hospital in Malawis capital of Lilongwe and she was a nurse midwife at Zomba. When they came back, they established an 8-bed unit for kangaroo care in the hospitals newborn wing. In 2002, with help from Save the Children, that ward at Zomba became a training center. Richard Luhanga became the kangaroo mother care coordinator for Save the Children in Malawi.

Now, instead of traveling to Bogota, nurses and doctors from other hospitals in Malawi could learn about kangaroo care in Malawi. The Zomba kangaroo trainers soon decided that they were the ones who had to travel. By going to the trainees hospital, they could teach more people, show them how the practice would work in their own environment, and help them set it up. The newly trained health workers could begin doing kangaroo care immediately.

The practice spread  first to some of Malawis other big hospitals, and gradually to smaller hospitals. Now it is starting in small local health centers. Since many women in Malawi give birth at home, some health workers are training community health workers and enlisting grandparents to spread the word about kangaroo care in their villages. Kangaroo care is used now in 20 of Malawis 28 districts.

Initially when it was being introduced, health workers had to be convinced, said Evelyn Zimba, senior maternal and newborn health program manager for Save the Children in Malawi. They felt babies in incubators were receiving quality care. They were undermining the idea of skin-to-skin. Zimba found videos of kangaroo care in South Africa and Zimbabwe, where it was already established, to be helpful. The nurses came around when they saw that babies did better with kangaroo care and  perhaps just as important  realized it cut their enormous workload. Some hospitals dont even have a nurse assigned to the nursery  hospitals with 60 babies may have no doctor at all and just one labor nurse and one post-natal nurse, who ducks into the nursery once in a while. With kangaroo care, babies go home sooner. And once mothers are trained, the nurses job gets easier. You can have 10 mothers taking care of 10 babies, said Zimba. The nurse can just supervise.

The challenge now, she said is to get rid of the special kangaroo care room at the hospital  which often fills up quickly  and spread the practice to the entire maternity ward.

If the people at the Mother and Child Institute in Bogota had not tried to formalize the teaching of kangaroo care, the practice would probably be saving premature babies in various places in Colombia, and, with luck, perhaps a few other hospitals whose doctors happened to stumble on the idea during a visit to Bogota. Instead, it is spreading throughout the world. Inventing a useful new idea is very glamorous. What is less glamorous  its a slog, really  is to figure out effective ways to teach it to others. But its just as important.

The history of Western philosophy can be presented in a number of ways. It can be told in terms of periods  ancient, medieval and modern. We can divide it into rival traditions (empiricism versus rationalism, analytic versus Continental), or into various core areas (metaphysics, epistemology, ethics). It can also, of course, be viewed through the critical lens of gender or racial exclusion, as a discipline almost entirely fashioned for and by white European men.

The philosophers hands were never clean and were never meant to be.

Yet despite the richness and variety of these accounts, all of them pass over a momentous turning point: the locating of philosophy within a modern institution (the research university) in the late 19th century. This institutionalization of philosophy made it into a discipline that could be seriously pursued only in an academic setting. This fact represents one of the enduring failures of contemporary philosophy.

Take this simple detail: Before its migration to the university, philosophy had never had a central home. Philosophers could be found anywhere  serving as diplomats, living off pensions, grinding lenses, as well as within a university. Afterward, if they were serious thinkers, the expectation was that philosophers would inhabit the research university. Against the inclinations of Socrates, philosophers became experts like other disciplinary specialists. This occurred even as they taught their students the virtues of Socratic wisdom, which highlights the role of the philosopher as the non-expert, the questioner, the gadfly.

Philosophy, then, as the French thinker Bruno Latour would have it, was purified  separated from society in the process of modernization. This purification occurred in response to at least two events. The first was the development of the natural sciences, as a field of study clearly distinct from philosophy, circa 1870, and the appearance of the social sciences in the decade thereafter. Before then, scientists were comfortable thinking of themselves as natural philosophers  philosophers who studied nature; and the predecessors of social scientists had thought of themselves as moral philosophers.

The second event was the placing of philosophy as one more discipline alongside these sciences within the modern research university. A result was that philosophy, previously the queen of the disciplines, was displaced, as the natural and social sciences divided the world between them.

This is not to claim that philosophy had reigned unchallenged before the 19th century. The role of philosophy had shifted across the centuries and in different countries. But philosophy in the sense of a concern about who we are and how we should live had formed the core of the university since the church schools of the 11th century. Before the development of a scientific research culture, conflicts among philosophy, medicine, theology and law consisted of internecine battles rather than clashes across yawning cultural divides. Indeed, these older fields were widely believed to hang together in a grand unity of knowledge  a unity directed toward the goal of the good life. But this unity shattered under the weight of increasing specialization by the turn of the 20th century.

Early 20th-century philosophers thus faced an existential quandary: With the natural and social sciences mapping out the entirety of both theoretical as well as institutional space, what role was there for philosophy? A number of possibilities were available: Philosophers could serve as 1) synthesizers of academic knowledge production; 2) formalists who provided the logical undergirding for research across the academy; 3) translators who brought the insights of the academy to the world at large; 4) disciplinary specialists who focused on distinctively philosophical problems in ethics, epistemology, aesthetics and the like; or 5) as some combination of some or all of these.

If philosophy was going to have a secure place in the academy, it needed its own discrete domain, its own arcane language, its own standards of success and its own specialized concerns.

There might have been room for all of these roles. But in terms of institutional realities, there seems to have been no real choice. Philosophers needed to embrace the structure of the modern research university, which consists of various specialties demarcated from one another. That was the only way to secure the survival of their newly demarcated, newly purified discipline. Real or serious philosophers had to be identified, trained and credentialed. Disciplinary philosophy became the reigning standard for what would count as proper philosophy.

This was the act of purification that gave birth to the concept of philosophy most of us know today. As a result, and to a degree rarely acknowledged, the institutional imperative of the university has come to drive the theoretical agenda. If philosophy was going to have a secure place in the academy, it needed its own discrete domain, its own arcane language, its own standards of success and its own specialized concerns.

Having adopted the same structural form as the sciences, its no wonder philosophy fell prey to physics envy and feelings of inadequacy. Philosophy adopted the scientific modus operandi of knowledge production, but failed to match the sciences in terms of making progress in describing the world. Much has been made of this inability of philosophy to match the cognitive success of the sciences. But what has passed unnoticed is philosophys all-too-successful aping of the institutional form of the sciences. We, too, produce research articles. We, too, are judged by the same coin of the realm: peer-reviewed products. We, too, develop sub-specializations far from the comprehension of the person on the street. In all of these ways we are so very scientific.

Our claim, then, can be put simply: Philosophy should never have been purified. Rather than being seen as a problem, dirty hands should have been understood as the native condition of philosophic thought  present everywhere, often interstitial, essentially interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary in nature. Philosophy is a mangle. The philosophers hands were never clean and were never meant to be.

There is another layer to this story. The act of purification accompanying the creation of the modern research university was not just about differentiating realms of knowledge. It was also about divorcing knowledge from virtue. Though it seems foreign to us now, before purification the philosopher (and natural philosopher) was assumed to be morally superior to other sorts of people. The 18th-century thinker Joseph Priestley wrote a Philosopher ought to be something greater and better than another man. Philosophy, understood as the love of wisdom, was seen as a vocation, like the priesthood. It required significant moral virtues (foremost among these were integrity and selflessness), and the pursuit of wisdom in turn further inculcated those virtues. The study of philosophy elevated those who pursued it. Knowing and being good were intimately linked. It was widely understood that the point of philosophy was to become good rather than simply to collect or produce knowledge.

As the historian Steven Shapin has noted, the rise of disciplines in the 19th century changed all this. The implicit democracy of the disciplines ushered in an age of the moral equivalence of the scientist to everyone else. The scientists privileged role was to provide the morally neutral knowledge needed to achieve our goals, whether good or evil. This put an end to any notion that there was something uplifting about knowledge. The purification made it no longer sensible to speak of nature, including human nature, in terms of purposes and functions. By the late 19th century, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche had proved the failure of philosophy to establish any shared standard for choosing one way of life over another. This is how Alasdair MacIntyre explained philosophys contemporary position of insignificance in society and marginality in the academy. There was a brief window when philosophy could have replaced religion as the glue of society; but the moment passed. People stopped listening as philosophers focused on debates among themselves.

Once knowledge and goodness were divorced, scientists could be regarded as experts, but there are no morals or lessons to be drawn from their work. Science derives its authority from impersonal structures and methods, not the superior character of the scientist. The individual scientist is no different from the average Joe; he or she has, as Shapin has written, no special authority to pronounce on what ought to be done. For many, science became a paycheck, and the scientist became a de-moralized tool enlisted in the service of power, bureaucracy and commerce.

Here, too, philosophy has aped the sciences by fostering a culture that might be called the genius contest. Philosophic activity devolved into a contest to prove just how clever one can be in creating or destroying arguments. Today, a hyperactive productivist churn of scholarship keeps philosophers chained to their computers. Like the sciences, philosophy has largely become a technical enterprise, the only difference being that we manipulate words rather than genes or chemicals. Lost is the once common-sense notion that philosophers are seeking the good life  that we ought to be (in spite of our failings) model citizens and human beings. Having become specialists, we have lost sight of the whole. The point of philosophy now is to be smart, not good. It has been the heart of our undoing.

Hillary Clinton speaks in Clear Lake, Iowa, last year. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)

Former Atlantic contributing editor* Marc Ambinder is showing appropriate contrition for having participated in some dubious journalistic practices back in July 2009. As exposed by some Freedom Of Information Act documents secured by J.K. Trotter of Gawker, Ambinder was pursuing a copy of the speech that then- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was to make at the Council on Foreign Relations. So he emailed renowned Clinton advocate and spokesperson Philippe Reines.

The back-and-forth confirms anyones worst suspicions about access journalism. The transaction went like this:

 Ambinder asks for a copy of the speech;

 Reines says hell send it, with conditions;

 Ambinder writes back, ok;

 Reines lays out the conditions:

1) You in your own voice describe them as muscular

2) You note that a look at the CFR seating plan shows that all the envoys  from Holbrooke to Mitchell to Ross  will be arrayed in front of her, which in your own clever way you can say certainly not a coincidence and meant to convey something

3) You dont say you were blackmailed!

 Ambinder writes, got it.

The story, it turns out, rated Clintons speech muscular and indeed made reference to the seating thing: The staging gives a clue to its purpose: seated in front of Clinton, subordinate to Clinton, in the first row, will be three potentially rival power centers: envoys Richard Holbrooke and George Mitchell, and National Security Council senior director Dennis Ross, wrote Ambinder, completing his compliance with Reiness conditions.

In a series of remarks to Gawker, Ambinder lamented making the deal. It made me uncomfortable then, and it makes me uncomfortable today, said Ambinder. And when I look at that email record, it is a reminder to me of why I moved away from all that. The Atlantic, to their credit, never pushed me to do that, to turn into a scoop factory. In the fullness of time, any journalist or writer who is confronted by the prospect, or gets in the situation where their journalism begins to feel transactional, should listen to their gut feeling and push away from that.

Thats a dash of knowledge seasoned by seven years of perspective: Who remembers Clintons July 15, 2009, speech before the Council on Foreign Relations? And even if it was a consequential address, what lasting contribution or analysis did Ambinder contribute with his piece on it? The story was a quick-hit classic, incorporating the elements required by Reines, plus some further analysis and some block quotes from the speechs text. Of course, Clinton eventually issued the speech, meaning that the rest of the journalism field gained access to it. An ego scoop, as New York University Professor Jay Rosen would say. Maybe it drove some traffic that day.

Though Ambinder will bear most of the smirch from this Beltway bucket of slime, the episode speaks to the inadvisability of encouraging journalists to flout the SPJ code of ethics. Sure, Reines secured a bit of positive coverage for the speech and perhaps deepened his relationship with a prominent journalist or two. The term muscular scooted around the web in connection with Clinton, as Gawker pointed out. And perhaps the secretary came away satisfied with what Reines had orchestrated.

The boost, however, was just as transitory as the Ambinder article itself. And the risk of insisting on conditions with ball-playing journalists is now emerging: The Clinton camp was so desperate for praise that it went to extremes to place a single positive adjective in coverage. Also, Reiness insistence on secrecy about the blackmail was a reckless bet against the very industry he dealt with each day; via the FOIA process, journalism outed his part in rancid sausage-making.

Weve all heard the argument that philosophy is isolated, an ivory tower discipline cut off from virtually every other progress-making pursuit of knowledge, including math and the sciences, as well as from the actual concerns of daily life. The reasons given for this are many. In a widely read essay in this series, When Philosophy Lost Its Way, Robert Frodeman and Adam Briggle claim that it was philosophys institutionalization in the university in the late 19th century that separated it from the study of humanity and nature, now the province of social and natural sciences.

This institutionalization, the authors claim, led it to betray its central aim of articulating the knowledge needed to live virtuous and rewarding lives. I have a different view: Philosophy isnt separated from the social, natural or mathematical sciences, nor is it neglecting the study of goodness, justice and virtue, which was never its central aim.

The idea that philosophy was and still is isolated from other disciplines ignores much of its history.

The authors claim that philosophy abandoned its relationship to other disciplines by creating its own purified domain, accessible only to credentialed professionals. It is true that from roughly 1930 to 1950, some philosophers  logical empiricists, in particular  did speak of philosophy having its own exclusive subject matter. But since that subject matter was logical analysis aimed at unifying all of science, interdisciplinarity was front and center.

This was followed (in Britain) by two decades in which leading philosophers identified philosophy with informal linguistic analysis. Fortunately, this narrow view didnt stop them from contributing to the science of language and the study of law. Now long gone, neither movement defined the philosophy of its day and neither arose from locating it in universities.

The idea that philosophy was and still is isolated from other disciplines ignores much of its history. From 1879 to 1936 the philosopher-mathematicians Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, Kurt Godel, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing invented symbolic logic, helped establish the set-theoretic foundations of mathematics, and gave us the formal theory of computation that ushered in the digital age.

In the field of linguistics, from roughly 1945 to 1975, the philosophers Rudolf Carnap, Saul Kripke, Richard Montague and David Kaplan developed ideas relating logic to linguistic meaning that provided a framework for studying meaning in all human languages. Others, including Paul Grice and J.L. Austin, explained how linguistic meaning mixes with contextual information to enrich communicative contents and how certain linguistic performances change social facts. Today a new philosophical conception of the relationship between meaning and cognition adds a further dimension to linguistic science.

Decision theory  the science of rational norms governing action, belief and decision under uncertainty  was developed by the 20th-century philosophers Frank Ramsey, Rudolph Carnap, Richard Jeffrey and others. It plays a foundational role in political science and economics by telling us what rationality requires, given our evidence, priorities and the strength of our beliefs. Today, no area of philosophy is more successful in attracting top young minds.

Far from fostering isolation, specialization in philosophy makes communication and cooperation among disciplines possible. This has always been so.

Philosophy also assisted psychology in its long march away from narrow behaviorism and speculative Freudianism. The mid-20th-century functionalist perspective pioneered by Hilary Putnam was particularly important. According to it, pain, pleasure and belief are neither behavioral dispositions nor bare neurological states. They are interacting internal causes, capable of very different physical realizations, that serve the goals of individuals in specific ways. This view is now embedded in cognitive psychology and neuroscience.

Philosophy also played a role in 20th-century physics, influencing the great physicists Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. The philosophers Moritz Schlick and Hans Reichenbach reciprocated that interest by assimilating the new physics into their philosophies. Today, leading philosophers  including David Albert, Hans Halvorson, Laura Ruetsche, Hilary Greaves and David Wallace  explain quantum physics to outsiders, while conceptualizing issues in ways physicists find useful. Philosophy of biology is following a similar path. Todays philosophy of science is less accessible than Aristotles natural philosophy chiefly because it systematizes a larger, more technically sophisticated body of knowledge.

Philosophys interaction with mathematics, linguistics, economics, political science, psychology and physics requires specialization. Far from fostering isolation, this specialization makes communication and cooperation among disciplines possible. This has always been so. William of Ockham, Descartes, Leibniz and Kant were heavily informed by the science and mathematics of their day. Locke and Hume responded to Newton not with envy and a sense of inferiority (which Frodeman and Briggle wrongly attribute to philosophers responding to 20th-century science), but with a desire to apply Newtons lessons to their natural philosophies of mind, which were then psychology-in-the-making.

Nor did scientific progress rob philosophy of its former scientific subject matter, leaving it to concentrate on the broadly moral. In fact, philosophy thrives when enough is known to make progress conceivable, but it remains unachieved because of methodological confusion. Philosophy helps break the impasse by articulating new questions, posing possible solutions and forging new conceptual tools. Sometimes it does so when sciences are born, as with 17th-century physics and 19th-century biology. But it also does so as they mature. As science advances, there is more, not less, for it to do.

Our knowledge of the universe and ourselves expands like a ripple surrounding a pebble dropped in a pool. As we move away from the center of the spreading circle, its area, representing our secure knowledge, grows. But so does its circumference, representing the border where knowledge blurs into uncertainty and speculation, and methodological confusion returns. Philosophy patrols the border, trying to understand how we got there and to conceptualize our next move. Its job is unending.

Although progress in ethics, political philosophy and the illumination of lifes meaning has been less impressive than advances in some other areas, it is accelerating. After an erosion of faith in ethical theory in the first third of the 20th century, and calls for its abolition in the middle third, John Rawls and Robert Nozick revived theories of justice in the early 1970s. Comprehensive ethical theories, including Thomas Scanlons and Stephen Darwalls, have also reappeared. Even discussions of death and the meaning of life have returned, led by Thomas Nagel, Samuel Scheffler, Shelly Kagan, Susan Wolf and others. As my colleague Jake Ross observes, the advances in our understanding because of careful formulation and critical evaluation of theories of goodness, rightness, justice and human flourishing by philosophers since 1970 compare well to the advances made by philosophers from Aristotle to 1970.

The knowledge required to maintain philosophys continuing task, including its vital connection to other disciplines, is too vast to be held in one mind. Despite the often-repeated idea that philosophys true calling can only be fulfilled in the public square, philosophers actually function best in universities, where they acquire and share knowledge with their colleagues in other disciplines. It is also vital for philosophers to engage students  both those who major in the subject, and those who do not. Although philosophy has never had a mass audience, it remains remarkably accessible to the average student; unlike the natural sciences, its frontiers can be reached in a few undergraduate courses.

Far from being years of enduring failure, the last 150 years have been philosophys best.

nytimes.com,2016-02-23 00:00:00,Notes From Psychiatry's Battle Lines,"['All Contributors', 'The Great Divide', 'The Conversation', 'Errol Morris', 'George Makari', 'The End']","Couch is a series about psychotherapy.

I have two offices, one for answers and another for questions. As a clinical psychiatrist, I begin my day in a room filled with soothing art and soft leather chairs, where my pharmaceutical prescriptions and psychological interventions are intended to meet the pressing needs of my patients. Here, Im supposed to have answers, or at least thats the hope.

Then, at some point near noon, I descend 12 floors, cross a cobblestone drive, pass into an old granite building and settle into a cubicle that overlooks Manhattans East River. Here, by a blackboard filled with arrows, scribbles and circles, and surrounded by hundreds of color-coded files and books, I do my work as a historian of psychiatry. It now becomes my job to critically pick apart the assumptions and beliefs of my own practice, my own field.

Two separate rooms, two different modes. Is that true? I was daydreaming recently, searching for a simple response to a question often asked of me  namely, how does my practice as a psychiatrist relate to my historical studies?  and that was what I first came up with.

Unfortunately, after but a moment of reflection, my neat division collapsed. In clinical psychiatry, perhaps more than in any other field, you incessantly ask questions, and the right question can often become an answer. Not good enough for what? may be all that is required from me to help a patient comprehend a sudden depressive turn. Likewise, historians, though driven by skeptical questioning, certainly can generate solid answers about what happened and why.

Better to say, then, that I inhabit two deeply related realms that have long been divided by mutual suspicion and conflict.

Consider this: Like most clinicians, I am eager for scientific progress, something new that will yield more clarity and provide my patients with faster or deeper relief. However, as I take stock of a new neuroenhancer, or the latest genetic correlation that may point to the cause of an illness, or a suddenly popular diagnosis, the historian in me senses ghosts beginning to stir.

Historians have shown that psychiatry has long suffered from the adoption of scientific-sounding theories and cures that turned out to be dogma. Perhaps the clearest example of such scientism was psychiatrys embrace, in the early 19th century, of Franz Joseph Galls phrenology, in which all mental attributes and deficiencies were assigned to specific brain locales, evidence be damned. During much of the 20th century, psychoanalysis proposed far more conclusive answers than it could support, and today, the same could be said for some incautious neurobiological researchers.

These exaggerations are not merely academic errors. Over the years, scientism has persuaded mental doctors to do bad, even terrible things. Ice-pick lobotomies, refrigerator mothers, insulin shock: The list is not short. The most notorious example involved the father of psychiatric genetics, Ernst Rudin, who during the Nazi era sought to cleanse the German population of so-called degenerative heredity through the sterilization and euthanasia of the mentally ill.

Much less extreme, everyday infiltrations of ideology can be discerned in the portraits that psychiatrists have drawn of their field. Most of these accounts have been self-serving affairs, in which the past was ravaged so as to justify present clinical certitudes. Nearly every generation has featured a proud practitioner who dismissed his predecessors and lifted the flag of victory, only to have it snatched away some years later. Since 1800, the end of history in psychiatry has come with the triumph of the asylum, followed by Romanic medicine, brain anatomy, genetics, psychoanalysis and, most recently, drugs like Prozac.

And so, as my morning sessions end and I cross over to my scholarly retreat, I am acutely aware that my present commitments as a doctor might undermine my capacity to fairly envision the past. Then I settle in before my archives and books and my troubles multiply.

For the past three decades, the reigning model among historians of my field has been dubbed antipsychiatric. Following the work of Michel Foucault, the fashion has been to argue that psychiatry emerged as a police arm of the modern state. Mental doctors were self-deluded or malevolent, their treatments cunning, at times barbaric, methods of control. Mental illness itself, they argued, was a false construct used to control dissidents, rebels and outcasts.

Some fine work along these lines has exposed the creation of bogus diseases that served to pathologize wrong behaviors, such as homosexuality. Researchers have shined light on the supposed madness of runaway slaves in antebellum America and political dissidents in the Soviet Union. They have also explored diagnostic fads, disappearing diseases like hysteria or sudden epidemics of ailments like attention deficit disorder.

However, this vein of research has been tarred by its own crude ideology. If scientism can falsely turn ethical and political issues into matters of disease, and grossly exaggerate what we know about the nature of mental illness, Foucault and his acolytes are prone to an antithetical failing: radical social constructionism. Madness, they would have us believe, whether it is schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder or anorexia, is not grounded in any biological reality. Greedy commercial interests and a repressive society, they claim, have falsely transformed human differences and personal choices into psychiatric disorders.

Arguments of this sort can be morally compelling, for they appeal to the liberal ideal of toleration and argue for the civil rights of stigmatized minorities. However, no one is a Foucauldian in an emergency room. I was a medical resident in psychiatry when I first studied Foucaults arguments, and I got the distinct impression that his madness was often just a metaphor with which to challenge authority, not much related to the shaking, hallucinating teenager that I would soon return to on the wards.

To me, Foucault and his followers seemed impossibly naive, even complacent. Had they ever encountered severe obsessive-compulsive disorder or suicidal depression? Had they ever seen a manic patient take lithium and be restored? Psychiatrists might be blinded by their commitments as insiders, but this academic view seemed sustainable only by remaining on the outside looking in.

Over the years, in my dual roles as practitioner and historian, I have watched each camp become more strident, thanks in part to a lack of dialogue. Too often, psychiatrists dismiss the disturbing lessons from the past, while historians roll their eyes at the very possibility of progress in psychiatry. In these isolated worlds, scientism and radical social constructionism flourish.

Perched as I am between the disputants, lucky to be supported by a unique interdisciplinary institute and a group of like-minded colleagues, I have sought to reconcile my quarreling loves. Its been a bit like marital therapy, in which profoundly intertwined partners mostly ignore each other, then occasionally pipe up to loudly dismiss each others perspective.

Amid such conflict, in my work with patients and in my writing, I do my best to explore contradictions, look for specifics amid abstractions, search for syntheses and, in the face of real uncertainty, advocate for polyphony, a multiplicity of explanatory perspectives. And I have come to distrust unstable dualities like mind or brain, artificial divisions like nature or nurture, and seductive dichotomies that should not end but merely begin an inquiry  such as having one office for answers and another for questions.

Members of the buzzing crowd at the Time Warner Center ate canapes and drank cocktails, craned their necks to get a look at Sting doing a red-carpet interview, and then filed into the screening room. Once they did, the party atmosphere quickly turned somber.

The film, an HBO documentary, is about the life and death of James Wright Foley, the American journalist who was kidnapped by ISIS in Syria, and later was executed, as shown in a horrific video seen around the world. Jim: The James Foley Story left the audience quiet and, in my case at least, in tears. Then things got still more emotional, as the journalists parents, John and Diane Foley, stood at a lectern and spoke briefly  and with incredible grace  about their son.

I met them afterward and introduced myself to another of their sons, Michael Foley, with whom I had significant phone and email contact last year after he vehemently complained about some of The Timess coverage of his brothers time in prison. He objected, for example, to the description of his brother as an enthusiastic convert to Islam.

I considered his complaints, and others I had heard about, in a Sunday column, and I tried to take on some of the broader, and very thorny, issues involved in covering Americans who have been kidnapped by terrorists. Times coverage broke important ground when Rukmini Callimachi reported that American hostages often suffered because of their governments policy on opposing the payment of ransom.



Many of the same issues arose in the documentary  again, leaving a great deal unanswered and unresolved. Directed by a childhood friend of Mr. Foleys, Brian Oakes, the documentary celebrates the journalists life and his character as a man for others. Relying heavily, and effectively, on family interviews and on those with former hostages imprisoned with Mr. Foley, it gives only a glancing treatment to the role of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Obama administration in failing to secure his release. And, for the most part, it skirts the larger geopolitical issues.

This film leaves a lot of questions, the elder Mr. Foley said afterward. And that, his wife added, was done by design. The Foleys have established a foundation devoted to freeing American citizens imprisoned abroad.

Despite the lingering questions, and its troubling subject matter, the film, which recently won a Sundance award, is certainly worth seeing; it debuts Saturday on HBO.

Separately, it is of the utmost importance that The Times continues to dig deep into ISIS coverage. The executive editor, Dean Baquet, recently told me that this is among his highest priorities for the newsroom in the year ahead. (Update: This has been illustrated by two pieces published this week.)",[]

Most of the time that makes excellent sense.

The Times made an exception to that rule on Sunday with Scott Shanes riveting piece on John C. Kiriakou, the former C.I.A. operative who is facing prison for giving information to a freelance reporter.

Mr. Shane, a national security reporter in the Washington bureau, became a tangential part of the situation when Mr. Kiriakou was also charged with revealing to Journalist B the name of a person who had participated in the operation to catch the Qaeda terrorist Abu Zubaydah, which the government said was classified.

Some readers found fault with Mr. Shanes writing of the story, given his involvement. One was James Savage, a former longtime investigations editor with The Miami Herald.

Theres an easy way to avoid this glaring conflict of interest, he wrote in an e-mail. Assign another reporter to write the story. That reporter could interview Mr. Shane and include his comments, properly attributed, in a balanced story.

That point certainly occurred to me on Saturday when I first read the story online, and again later when I saw it prominently displayed on the Sunday front page. I was also interested, as I read deeper into the article, to see Mr. Shane writing in the first person  thats rare for a news story in The Times.

But my overall reaction was sheer fascination with the tale he told  an invaluable glimpse inside a secret world, one that provided rare insights into the reporter-source relationship. It also illuminates a troubling subject that does not get enough attention: the Obama administrations prosecution of government employees who leak information to the press  an effort with major implications for press freedom and the ability to inform the public.

I talked with Mr. Shane and with two editors who were involved in the decision-making. They told me that, after quite a bit of discussion, they decided that the pros far outweighed the cons.

Having Scott tell the story wasnt a downside; it enriched the story, by allowing us to give readers insight on how Kiriakou operated, said David Leonhardt, the Washington bureau chief.

Mr. Leonhardt added, So long as the story made the disclosures that it did, I dont see the argument that the reader would have been better served by someone else writing the piece and Scott being quoted in it.

The piece originally was intended to appear in The Times Magazine on Sunday, but was moved to the news pages to get it published sooner. We felt competitive pressure, said Dean Baquet, a managing editor. Editors thought another news organization might be writing a similar story.

The articles point of view, and Mr. Shanes writing in the first person, might have seemed more at home in the magazine. But the value remained, despite its change of places. More than 500 readers commented on the story, and it generated plenty of attention on Twitter and elsewhere.

Mr. Shane, who proposed the piece to his editors months ago, saw an opportunity to tell a story from a different angle.

It was a chance to be more direct about the dilemma involved when we report publicly on the secret activities of government, he told me. That involves rather risky relations between reporter and source  more risky now than its been in the past.

Ive been writing recently about the debate over reportorial impartiality and its role in the truth-telling that makes journalism worthwhile. One crucial element when impartiality comes into question is transparency.

This story is an example of just that. The reporters involvement is disclosed, and readers can draw their own conclusions.

Its always awkward when youre a part of it, Mr. Shane said, but I thought it was justified.

I agree. In this case, no one could have told this important tale as well. Those who have read it know more about how government and reporting work than they did before.

Its the kind of story that makes you think; it may make you question the status quo. Thats a pretty good definition of what effective journalism does.",[]

The New York Times is drawing a clear line against the practice of news sources being allowed to approve quotations in stories after the fact.

The practice, known as quote approval, puts so much control over the content of journalism in the wrong place, the executive editor Jill Abramson told me in an interview. We need a tighter policy.

Times editors have been working on the policy for months, she noted  ever since a July story by Jeremy Peters revealed the practice as a widespread one that included many reporters.

A memorandum on Thursday says that demands for after-the-fact quote approval by sources and their press aides have gone too far.

The practice risks giving readers a mistaken impression that we are ceding too much control over a story to our sources, it says. In its most extreme form, it invites meddling by press aides and others that goes far beyond the traditional negotiations between reporter and source over the terms of an interview.

It includes this firm directive: So starting now, we want to draw a clear line on this. Citing Times policy, reporters should say no if a source demands, as a condition of an interview, that quotes be submitted afterward to the source or a press aide to review, approve or edit.

Ms. Abramson said that she never wants to put obstacles to news-gathering in front of reporters but that anodyne or generic quotes that are scrubbed or changed dont add anything to stories.

If the practice were allowed to continue, she said, you will only see more control and manipulation by news sources in the future. In making this move, The Times joins news organizations like The National Journal and Reuters in opposing quote approval; Reuters stopped short of an outright ban.

Ms. Abramson, who has many years of Washington reporting and editing in her own background, including a stint as Washington bureau chief, said she understands that well lose interviews because of the new policy.

Interviews without quote approval will be seen as too risky by news sources, she said. The practice is so ingrained.

She said there could be exceptions to the rule if there were critical information that would otherwise be denied to the reader, and if the exception were discussed with a senior editor in advance.

Believing that such a directive might be coming  and responding to a Monday column by David Carr and my blog calling for a clear policy  a number of reporters have been in touch with me this week to express their points of view.

One who provided thoughtful commentary was the White House correspondent Peter Baker. He wrote:

As much as I hate the practice, it grew out of a laudable desire on the part of newspapers to stop using so many blind quotes in White House stories. As I recall, it was during the late Clinton era and editors pushed us to go back to sources who spoke on background and get permission to use their names with specific quotes we were planning to use anyway but anonymously. Sources generally found that being on the record was not so worrisome (or career-threatening) once they knew what we actually wanted to use and they often agreed. As a result, stories that traditionally were filled with anonymous quotes began having more named sources. This was a benefit to our readers. Over time, sources began to take advantage of this and institutionalize it to the point that they came up with this name for it, quote approval. Its grown way too common and has become an objectionable means of control by too many people who should frankly just talk on the record, especially paid spokesmen. But its also a practice with tangible benefits for our readers and we should consider the trade-offs before making any hard-and-fast rules.

The memo recognizes that distinction:

We understand that talking to sources on background  not for attribution  is often valuable to reporting, and unavoidable. Negotiation over the terms of using quotations, whenever feasible, should be done as part of the same interview  with an on the record coda, or with an agreement at the end of the conversation to put some parts on the record. In some cases, a reporter or editor may decide later, after a background interview has taken place, that we want to push for additional on-the-record quotes. In that situation, where the initiative is ours, this is acceptable. Again, quotes should not be submitted to press aides for approval or edited after the fact.

Ms. Abramson put it succinctly: When possible, it should be part of the same transaction. She also said she realizes and sympathizes with the concerns of reporters who dont want to lose one of their ways of getting information to readers.

As the memo states:

We know our reporters face ever-growing obstacles in Washington, on Wall Street and elsewhere. We want to strengthen their hand in pushing back against the quote-approval process, which all of us dislike. Being able to cite a clear Times policy should aid their efforts and insulate them from some of the pressure they face.

In the end, Ms. Abramson said, it is a control issue. The journalist shouldnt be a supplicant, she added.

The policy strikes me as both sensible and necessary.

Despite our reporters best efforts, we fear that demands for after-the-fact quote approval by sources and their press aides have gone too far. The practice risks giving readers a mistaken impression that we are ceding too much control over a story to our sources. In its most extreme forms, it invites meddling by press aides and others that goes far beyond the traditional negotiations between reporter and source over the terms of an interview.

So starting now, we want to draw a clear line on this. Citing Times policy, reporters should say no if a source demands, as a condition of an interview, that quotes be submitted afterward to the source or a press aide to review, approve or edit.

In that situation, where the initiative is ours, this is acceptable. Again, quotes should not be submitted to press aides for approval or edited after the fact.

We realize that at times this approach will make our push for on-the-record quotes even more of a challenge. But in the long run, we think resetting the bar, and making clear that we will not agree to put after-the-fact quote-approval in the hands of press aides, will help in that effort.

We know our reporters face ever-growing obstacles in Washington, on Wall Street and elsewhere. We want to strengthen their hand in pushing back against the quote-approval process, which all of us dislike.

THE lawyer David Coombs rarely speaks publicly outside the courtroom. He says that his client, Bradley Manning, the Army private accused of leaking secret documents to WikiLeaks, prefers it that way.









But last Monday night at a Unitarian Church in Washington, Coombs made an exception. He spoke to a crowd of Manning supporters, thanking those who were present, as well as a larger group: the 14,000 people who have contributed to Private Mannings defense fund, including Daniel Ellsberg, the Pentagon Papers whistle-blower, who has called the soldier a hero. Private Manning, charged with making public hundreds of thousands of secret documents, many of them related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, faces the possibility of life in prison.

It was part of a fascinating few days in the history of the Manning story  resonating with implications for free speech, national security and the American military at war  but you wouldnt have known much about it if your only source of information was The New York Times. The Times didnt cover Mr. Coombss remarks and, far more important, did not send a staff reporter to the first eight days of a pretrial hearing in the case, including riveting testimony by Private Manning.

As a matter of news judgment, giving so little coverage to the hearing is simply weird. This is a compelling story, and an important one.

It has human drama  a young soldier, accused of transferring state secrets to WikiLeaks and harshly imprisoned since the spring of 2010, speaking publicly about his case for the first time since his arrest  and it goes to the heart of contentious media issues in which The New York Times has played an important role, publishing much information revealed through Private Mannings act.

Why did readers of The Times have to turn to Ed Pilkington of The Guardian, or to one of the great number of other news organizations that sent reporters, to hear Private Manning tell of the Mordor into which he had been drawn  where he had to stand naked, in chains, in the maximum custody brig at Quantico, Va., imploring his prison guards for something as simple as toilet paper, or, earlier, in a cage in Kuwait?

The newspapers absence was noticed, and criticized, by many media watchers. Beyond the story itself, The Times, which considers itself the paper of record, had an obligation to be there  to bear witness  because, in a very real sense, Private Manning was one of its most important sources of the past decade.

The New York Times got amazing, fantastic, unparalleled material for news stories from Bradley Manning, Mr. Ellsberg told The New Republics Eliza Gray.

To its credit, The Times published article after article based on the very information that Private Manning provided to WikiLeaks, just as it had published the Pentagon Papers that Mr. Ellsberg leaked during the Vietnam War.

The situations arent equal: Private Manning may not have had the same clear-cut whistle-blowers motivation that Mr. Ellsberg had as an antiwar activist, and some are insistent in portraying him as a mentally unstable traitor to his military vows. But neither are the two situations unrelated, especially given The Timess role as a lead publisher of the leaked information in both cases.

Last Wednesday, puzzled by The Timess lack of coverage (it had run only an 11-paragraph article from The Associated Press), I asked senior editors why there had been no Times reporter at the hearing, held at Fort Meade, Md. Dean Baquet, a managing editor, referred me to David Leonhardt, the Washington bureau chief, who responded in an e-mail.

Mr. Leonhardt explained that The Times had already covered the most important aspects of the testimony, Mr. Mannings treatment in solitary confinement  referring to two articles that appeared 19 months ago.

Weve covered him and will continue to do so, Mr. Leonhardt wrote. But as with any other legal case, we wont cover every single proceeding. In this case, doing so would have involved multiple days of a reporters time, for a relatively straightforward story. The A.P. article, he said, conveyed fundamentally the same material as a staff story would have.

He added, Readers can definitely expect more coverage of Mr. Manning in the weeks to come.

I was glad that the Times got into the game, even if very late, with a reporter in the courtroom on Friday for the ninth day of the hearing, and a catch-up article on the front page on Saturday.

The Times sometimes plays down the importance of public events, believing more strongly in its own enterprising journalism. One such example was its coverage of the Congressional hearings on the consulate attack in Libya, which The Times chose not to put on Page 1  a decision I disagreed with, and wrote about in October. Such decisions seem to say: Its news when we say its news.

Sometimes it makes sense to favor exclusive, enterprise reporting over a public event. But the two are not mutually exclusive. If there had been a will to cover the Manning testimony, a staff reporter could have been found.

Whats more, the decision not to send a staff reporter to the hearing for so long also contained an interesting pre-calculation: that the early coverage would not be considered as front-page news. The Times, after all, does not use wire-service articles on its front page, except in highly unusual circumstances involving fast-breaking and unexpected news.

Perhaps, as Mr. Leonhardt suggested, his bureau is working on something better. The Timess Washington reporters do outstanding and groundbreaking investigative reporting. I hope that something significant is in the works. It might begin to make more sense of a decision that is otherwise hard to understand.",[]

Since when has the truth been a deterrent at this convention?

And at another juncture, that character, William Russell, observes to his opponent: Weve both gone beyond the truth now. Were in dangerous country.

Its strange to think that the play was written more than half a century ago. But looking around corners was something at which Mr. Vidal, who died in late July, excelled. The Timess Charles Isherwood, in his otherwise lukewarm review last April, gave Mr. Vidal props for just that: the playwrights undeniable prescience about future trends in American politicking.

Questions of truth  in the particular guise of fact-checking  are front and center just now, both on the presidential campaign trail generally and, more specifically, at the political conventions.

In the blogosphere and on Twitter, a debate is raging among prominent media critics. New York Universitys Jay Rosen is leading the charge for the importance of aggressive fact-checking, with Jack Shafer of Reuters playing his favorite role of contrarian, saying, in essence, politicians always lie  why get so worked up about this?

The reporter Michael Coopers story in The Times last weekend was very much in the discussion, seen by some as a sign that the mainstream media is taking the whole matter of truth-telling, truth-stretching and the pesky matter of factuality with a new level of seriousness.

It was a strong piece. And more like it would be welcome.

The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post have done some of the best fact-challenging work in recent days.

I caught up with Mr. Cooper on Tuesday morning to talk about the response his pieces on this topic have generated. In short: a lot.

My reader e-mail is exploding, he said. The takeaway is that readers are hungry for context.

They are looking to the press to point out misleading statements or the leaving out of key facts.

Im getting heat from both sides, Mr. Cooper said. Democrats thought that The Timess recent stories on this subject did not go far enough. Republicans thought they were unfair or too tough.

The shadow topic here is false balance, the equal and ultimately meaningless quoting of both sides in every story, on every subject.

Ive tried hard to avoid false equivalence, Mr. Cooper told me. It can be trickier than it looks.

A Times reader, Richard Joffe, chimes in by e-mail, on just this point. He wrote:

One reason fact-checking does nothing to limit the amount of political lying is because, as with all its coverage of politics, the media insists that both sides are equally to blame. According to the media, both sides are equally to blame for refusing to make compromises, both sides are equally to blame for threatening political violence, and both sides are equally to blame for lying. The Times article, with its headline, Campaigns Play Loose With Truth, is a perfect example of this fallacy. Although the Republican Party has grown increasingly indifferent to speaking truthfully, it has paid no price, just as it has paid no price for the violence of its language, and its refusal to compromise, because regarding each of these tendencies, the media continues to blame both parties equally.

My former paper, The Buffalo News, offered an analysis piece by its Washington bureau chief Jerry Zremski last weekend, which might have disturbed Mr. Joffe. It began: The Democrats have been lying. For months.

Whatever the conclusions, whatever the effectiveness, of challenging facts, the idea that we have to debate the necessity of doing so strikes me as absurd.

What is the role of the media if not to press for some semblance of reality amid the smoke and mirrors? Gore Vidal, I imagine, would agree.",[]

Private Lives: Personal essays on the news of the world and the news of our lives.

For some women, menopause is no big deal. Some say they barely notice it. My mother, long ago, described her menopause this way: My periods just started gettin lighter and lighter, and my harmones settled down, and then one day ... pfft! It was over.

Not me. Not only did menopause change my life, it changed me.

Before I was laid low by hot flashes, panic-inducing adrenaline rushes and the constant oscillation between morbid sadness and killer rage, Id prided myself on being fearless. Id screamed obscenities at the masochistic nuns at my Catholic school, kicked undercover cops in the groin and once threw a chair at my abusive fiances head while Allen Ginsberg read poetry in a room below.

And suddenly, I was a person to whom sitting quietly with hands folded, ideally in a dark room with the shades drawn and maybe The Lawrence Welk Show playing low on an old TV, seemed like the best plan ever.

I wish Id been better prepared. I wish Id properly celebrated the last time Id canceled plans to spend all morning soaking in a lavender-scented bathtub with a bottle of Advil. I wish Id noted down the date when Id dug that last extra tampon out of the bottom of my purse and thrown it away. I should have marked the event in some way, maybe even performed a personal rite-of-passage ritual: taken that tampon out to the woods, placed it upon an altar that Id fashioned out of ancient glacial rocks, and set it ablaze while I chanted an invocation to whoever the crone-goddess of menopause is.

I am now well acquainted with that goddess.

Its possible that I have the Worlds Worst Menopause. But how to quantify with hard data hot flashes that make me feel like Im staring into the mouth of an active volcano or the engine of a coal-burning locomotive on the hottest day in history? To what previous record could I compare panic-inducing adrenaline rushes that occur every hour on the hour and, while Im teaching, inspire concerned students to ask if Im having a heart attack? When I hear women use cutesy nicknames like power surges I want to rip their throats out.

If you are one of those women for whom the transition from periods to no periods was like the transition from walking to sitting down  congratulations. Everybody else: You are my tribe. And Ive come to believe that our tribe needs a ritual.

Ive heard menopause described as a second puberty. There are plenty of rites-of-passage for girls as they begin and complete puberty. Theres the bat mitzvah, the quinceanera and the Sweet 16. Ive read about a beautiful Apache ceremony called Naiiees, which usually takes place the summer after a girl has her first period and commemorates the story of Esdzanadehe, the first woman. It originally lasted a few days, during which a girl, covered with a golden mixture of cornmeal and clay, became imbued with the power of the first woman and received the ability to heal and bring blessings to her community.

I didnt have a Sweet 16 or a bat mitzvah. But I did have a First Holy Communion, which supposedly marked my ascent to the age of reason, as a 7-year-old. As rituals go, it was a good one.

First, there was the buying of the white dress, white fake fur jacket and white shoes. I recall my mother and me marching up and down Ashland Avenue, the main shopping street in our South Side Chicago neighborhood, in search of something that I would actually deign to wear. It couldnt be too ornate, according to Sister Eleanor, the principal of St. John of God grammar school, but according to me it had to be really, really pretty. (Twelve years ago I actually found the dress as I was cleaning out my moms house, and it really was pretty: sateen with sheer puffy sleeves and seed pearls all over the bodice.) As we shopped around, wed run into other girls and their mothers doing the same thing. Seeing them and comparing notes  Goldblatts aint got nothin good no more, I heard theyre gougin everybody over by 63rd  heightened the feeling of the rituals importance.

The ceremony, on a May morning in 1968, bordered on the pagan: All 60 kids marched slowly, piously, in a procession toward the church, led by the pastor and assistant priests, with altar boys shouldering a large statue of the Virgin Mary on a wooden pallet, her head wreathed in white roses. The streets were packed with our parents, grandparents, godparents, siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles and neighbors, all snapping photos from behind police barricades. We were told by the nuns not to talk to, or even look at, anyone  just keep our eyes focused on the kid directly in front of us, our hands folded in prayer. And yet at almost every step someone was yelling my name  Its Uncle Bob, honey! I wanna take your picture! Sharon! Look at your mother!

As we turned a corner, I could, for the first time, hear the booming sounds of the church organ and the choir. I remember thinking that that was a magical moment: all of us walking toward the thunderous organ playing just for us while the choir of adults sang us in to the tune of a hymn called This Is My Body.

A group of teenage boys stood with their arms folded, watching us; a young mother crouched, put her arm around her little boy, and pointed; an old man doffed his cap. As we walked up the steps of the church, the nuns, like security at a rock concert, waved back the mothers with flowers and dads with cameras. It felt like we were the Beatles.

Now I wonder: Why is it that were lauded and celebrated when weve only just embarked on the journey? Why do we stop marking, ritually, the accomplishments along the way? The hurdles that we overcome?

I think all of us women who are going through menopause should gather together and then two-by-two make a pious procession through streets clogged with our living loved ones and long-dead parents and grandparents (resurrected just for us and calling our names). Whoever we are, whether svelte and wafting Chanel or pouchy with pendulous breasts, I want us to be made much of, cheered, recognized. I want our procession to be led by a bunch of men our age with beer guts pushing their shirt buttons apart, shouldering a statue of whoever our appropriate goddess is  possibly Coatlicue, an Aztec Earth Goddess, or maybe Hillary Clinton.

I want us to be sung to by a choir as we march into a secular temple, possibly some combination of the old Fillmore and the Society for Ethical Culture. Once inside, we gather in a circle around a huge ring of fire and, at an appropriate moment, accompanied by chanting, we reach into our purses and toss into the flames that unused old tampon that weve been carrying around for five years. As we do, the fire changes from red to pure white, tongues of it leap into our hearts, and we receive the ability to heal and bring blessings to our community.

And then theres a party afterward that lasts four days, with enough ice-cold drinks, Ativan and LOccitane Verbena Refreshing Towelettes (chilling in hundreds of tiny personal refrigerators) for us all.

With a new TV mini-series debuting last week, everybody was talking about O.J. Simpson, the football star who fell from grace. The Times wanted in  so editors and writers quickly developed a list-like article that compiled the papers original coverage of the 1990s murder case, and offered it to readers on Facebook and other social media platforms.









A lot of people were too young to read our coverage then, or wanted to refresh their memories, Patrick LaForge, a senior editor here, told me.

Mr. LaForge, who is both steeped in Times practices and digitally savvy (he is often credited with coining the Twitter truism, Retweets do not equal endorsements) directs the newsrooms Express Team. The group of eight writers and editors quickly develops articles when a topic begins gathering steam on social media.

The team also jumps on breaking news, often rewriting other news sources (with credit where due) and adding original interviews and other research even as The Timess traditional news desks  national, business, metro or international  may still be evaluating whether an event merits dispatching a reporter.

In many cases, this results in coverage that The Times in the old days (and by that, I mean three or four years ago) would not have spent staff time on, and may not have even considered giving space to.

When Serena Williams chased down a cellphone thief, the Express Team was on it. Similarly, when Cecil the lion was killed by a dentist on safari, the team jumped in. Sometimes the articles are more serious or newsy, as when Sandra Blands death in a Texas jail cell captured social-media attention, or when the recent snowstorm hit the East Coast. Many of the stories appear in a right hand column on the home page that, until recently, was titled Watching. (It has no name at the moment.)

The team, Mr. LaForge said, is a response to a new reality: The Times can no longer just decide, high on its mountaintop, what is news. The reader controls the news agenda much more than 30 years ago, he told me.

Some readers object to this change, and Ive expressed concern on their behalf. When I wrote recently about The Timess failure to fully investigate the poisoned-water crisis in Flint, Mich., editors said they didnt have adequate resources to do that kind of reporting. I pointed out that The Times does manage to have the resources for endless political coverage and for lighter articles, some produced by the Express Team.

One reader, Janice Ewing of Yonkers, wrote, There is too much fluff and silliness in the so-called news.

Another, Brian Maniere of Brooklyn, expressed what many have told me. These stories, he wrote, are abundant on the web for free. I read the Times for information that matters. He had a plea for Times decision makers: Please dont join in an ignoble race to the bottom in the pursuit of clicks.

Mr. LaForge rejects the idea that his team produces clickbait. Clickbait is not a useful term here, he said. People use it when they think something is pandering or not truly newsworthy, in the same way people used to use the term tabloid, or say of TV news, If it bleeds, it leads.

That, he emphasized, is not his teams purpose, which is to be quickly responsive to a constantly changing  and global  online conversation.

Some of our competitors base their business model purely on traffic, Mr. LaForge noted. The Times, on the other hand, primarily wants to get more readers to pay for digital subscriptions  an important revenue source now that print advertising revenue has withered. So it is crucial to bring new readers to The Times, where they can discover all kinds of journalism, including foreign coverage and investigative projects.

Mr. LaForge said he was focused on engagement, not page views. That includes how many readers share a story, or comment on it, or how long they spend on it, and whether they go on to read other Times stories.

Dean Baquet, the executive editor, told me that the Express Teams primary purpose is journalistic: to make The Times an early part of what people are talking about and what they care about.

Theres an enormous international conversation going on, and we need to capture it, he said. Of course, there is no substitute for having reporters on the ground, but when a news story breaks, we cant wait to make the judgment about how consequential it is before we let readers know about it.

Mr. LaForge and Mr. Baquet admit occasional misjudgments. Its new, and we sometimes stumble, Mr. Baquet said.

Mr. LaForge gave two examples of Express Team articles that he would not assign now. One was about an Ikea opening in Indiana: In the end, we all agreed it was simply too local for us, and there was nothing significant about this particular Ikea, although the people of Indiana were pretty excited.

Another, that he described as too slight, was about a parenting debate. It began: A Facebook exchange between the owner of a Maine diner and the mother of a screaming young girl brought the wildfire capabilities of social media to a classic  and divergent  debate over parenting in public.

I understand readers unease. They wonder, justifiably, if some of these stories make the best use of limited resources, and they doubt whether they are worthy of attention in The New York Times. Occasionally, I cant help but agree: Some of this stuff has been cringe-worthy.

But much of it makes a valid contribution to the news report. And in an era when The Times has to reinvent itself to survive, experimentation is necessary. Yes, Times leadership must uphold the papers standards, credibility and higher purpose, but simply maintaining the status quo isnt nearly enough these days.",[]

(To dip a toe into troubled #OscarsSoWhite waters, Ryan Cooglers Creed probably deserved a nomination in this category more than Straight Outta Compton, whose spine was very biopic-conventional, notwithstanding its convention-smashing subjects.)

BRUNI: The winner should be Inside Out, for the sheer audacity of its imagination. It turns the human psyche into animation and makes observations about the delicate balance of the human ecosystem that graver, more somber movies havent managed half as well. Im hoping for a sequel focused exclusively on Trumps emotional ecosystem. Rated R and titled The Id of the Deal, it would play only in Imax-3D and never be dubbed or subtitled in Spanish.

DOUTHAT: In best adapted screenplay, Id bet on Charles Randolph and Adam McKay for The Big Short, which does an interesting job of translating Michael Lewiss complicated story to the screen. Interesting, but to my mind a little smug and showy, which is why Im rooting for the more modest but also nearly flawless Brooklyn. Yes, its hard to explain mortgage-backed securities in a screenplay, but adapting a Colm Toibin novel strikes me as a harder task over all than adapting Lewiss movie-friendly prose, and I think the (very un-Toibin like) Nick Hornby aced it.

BRUNI: Im glad you mentioned Nick Hornby because I think hes emerged as one of the nimblest, most assured screenwriters working today and because Brooklyn, interestingly, marks the third time in a short span that hes been the deft teller of a woman-centric story. He adapted the memoir Wild and, before that, An Education. All three screenplays reflect a brisk, unpretentious style. Hes efficient in the best possible way.

But Id give best adapted screenplay to the movie that I, like you, predict as the winner: The Big Short. You say that Lewiss prose is movie-friendly, and its certainly terrific prose, but Im struck by the way that his books had to be sliced, distilled and reconfigured very aggressively to become movies. Thats true not just of The Big Short but also of Moneyball (my favorite of these adaptations ) and even The Blind Side, which in book form was as much about the peculiarities of modern football as it was about the Southern-fried pluck of a woman later played by La Bullock gone blond.

Can we move to people much more interesting than writers? (That could include anyone, really  film editors, sound technicians, you name it.) Lets talk about best supporting actress and the absurdity of this years nominees. Rooney Mara (Carol) is a lead. Alicia Vikander (The Danish Girl) is a lead. Kate Winslet, a superb actress, has a now-you-hear-it, now-you-dont Polish accent in Steve Jobs. Rachel McAdams barely has a character to play in Spotlight. You mentioned Brooklyn, and Id vote for the spirited, perfect performance that Julie Walters gave in that movie, but she wasnt nominated. So Ill root for Jennifer Jason Leigh in The Hateful Eight, though I think Vikander will win, partly for her astonishing work in Ex Machina.

DOUTHAT: I, too, expect Vikander to win for supporting Eddie Redmaynes Bruce Jenner  er, sorry, Einar Wegener in the transition into womanhood. And if we can count it as a twofer for The Danish Girl and Ex Machina, I suppose we can pretend that its deserved. But the fact that Vikander was nominated for the mediocre period-transgender drama and not the great little sci-fi part is a good example of what drives so much discontent with the Oscars  some of the racial discontent included.

Sonny Bunch had a good piece about this recently for The Washington Post, in which he cited Redmayne  an almost-automatic winner as Stephen Hawking last year, an automatic nominee as a sex-change pioneer this year  as a case study in how so many Oscar nominees just feel, well, engineered, to the point where you can guess who will be nominated for a supposedly merit-based award without having seen a second of that persons performance.

As Bunch notes, this squeezes out all sorts of interesting performances and movies (including many that his fellow conservatives, and mine, tend to favor). But for black actors, specifically, it means that Oscar glory can be theirs (and often is) only so long as theyre making a Very Serious Movie thats somehow about their race  and more ideally, about slavery, or Jim Crow, or both.

BRUNI: Im going to give you a pass on that unnecessary Jenner joke because I think you make some excellent points about the academys attitude toward performances by black actors. But the academy is a small part of a larger problem, which is that were still not seeing black actors nearly often enough in meaty roles that could be played by performers of any race. Denzel Washington has been cast in a few of those, but who else? I think the Internet buzzed with so much excitement about the suggestion of Idris Elba as the next James Bond because theres an ever more widespread recognition that Bond and Bond-style parts neednt always go to white actors. A Clancy protagonist, a Bourne analogue or an Indiana Jones could (and occasionally should) be played by a black actor. And the same goes for black women, who rarely get the sorts of roles reserved for the Bullocks, Anistons and Witherspoons of the movie world. #OscarsSoWhite because #BigPartsSoWhite.

Oscar Favorites vs. Predictions Should win Key: Will win Frank Bruni Ross Douthat Ex Machina Inside Out WRITING (ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY) Spotlight Spotlight Brooklyn The Big Short WRITING (ADAPTED SCREENPLAY) The Big Short The Big Short Alicia Vikander, Ex Machina (not nominated) Jennifer Jason Leigh, The Hateful Eight SUPPORTING ACTRESS Alicia Vikander, The Danish Girl Alicia Vikander, The Danish Girl Tom Hardy, The Revenant Mark Rylance, Bridge of Spies SUPPORTING ACTOR Mark Rylance, Bridge of Spies Sylvester Stallone, Creed Matt Damon, The Martian Matt Damon, The Martian LEAD ACTOR Leonardo DiCaprio, The Revenant Leonardo DiCaprio, The Revenant Brie Larson, Room Brie Larson, Room LEAD ACTRESS Brie Larson, Room Brie Larson, Room George Miller, Mad Max: Fury Road Adam McKay, The Big Short DIRECTING Alejandro G. Inarritu, The Revenant George Miller, Mad Max: Fury Road Room and Mad Max: Fury Road (tie) Spotlight BEST PICTURE The Big Short The Big Short

DOUTHAT: I agree, and I think thats a big part of why it frustrated so many people that Michael B. Jordan didnt get nominated for Creed, or Elba for Beasts of No Nation. Here were actors in movies  one of them a big hit  that were about black people as people, good or bad, not just as martyrs under white oppression, and the academy apparently didnt have time for them.

Anyway, onward to best supporting actor, where Creed has its one nominee  Sylvester Stallone, an underrated actor, and the betting favorite. Im not going to bet on him, though, because I suspect the controversy will make voters wary of rewarding the white star of a movie whose African-American lead and director were snubbed.

BRUNI: I think youre wrong about Stallone, and hell get the statuette because Oscar voters sentimentalism will prevail.

DOUTHAT: Maybe! But Ill bet on Mark Rylance, the oddsmakers second choice, even though (confession!) Bridge of Spies looked like a Spielbergian snooze, and I havent even seen it. And then my pick for the rightful winner is Tom Hardy in The Revenant.

BRUNI: I did see Rylance in Bridge of Spies, which had a great first half and a ho-hum second half, and in my opinion hes the rightful winner, not Hardy, who, in The Revenant, gives a performance like those he did in The Drop (which was terrific and underrated) and Warrior (which is even more terrific and underrated). Its technically and formally dazzling, but its also mannered and somewhat inaccessible.

Lets take a short break from the acting awards and look at best director. Some Oscar pundits are persuaded that George Miller will win for Mad Max: Fury Road, in what would be a combined recognition of career achievement and the difficulty of choreographing action sequences this busy. Others predict a second trophy in a row for Alejandro G. Inarritu, for The Revenant, while there are still others who believe Tom McCarthy (Spotlight) will take home the prize.

DOUTHAT: Now that the Oscars allow more than five nominations for best picture, you can usually use best director snubs to figure out which best picture nominees dont have a chance  which is bad news for The Martian, Brooklyn and Bridge of Spies. (I liked The Martian less than most people, for reasons we kicked around last fall, but I did think highly of Scotts work.) And then, of course, the actual winner of the best director statue is usually a big, fat indicator of which movie will actually take home the biggest prize.

In this case, though, it wouldnt be a complete surprise if the two awards diverged, because giving the ancient Miller the statue for his insane and insanely impressive choreography in Fury Road would be a good way to garland that movie without stooping (as academy voters might think of it) to giving a post-apocalyptic chase movie best picture.

BRUNI: I remain stunned that Ridley Scott wasnt nominated for The Martian, which is some of the best work hes ever done, and without him in the category, I cast my personal vote for Adam McKay, who contrived the right tempo, tone and camera angles to turn arcane financial shenanigans into populist comedy and drama in The Big Short. My best guess, though, is that Miller notches this victory.

DOUTHAT: As I say I wouldnt be surprised if Miller won, and I hope he will, since I think Oscars should go whenever possible to filmmakers who show us something extraordinary, unexpected, new. But the safe money is still on Inarritu, because The Revenant has a clearer shot at best picture and because (like most of his films) its directed within an inch of its life, with all kinds of complicated set pieces and unexpected camera angles. For better or worse, you can always feel him working, even sweating, to set up every shot  and I suspect that sweat will be rewarded.

Which brings us to best actor, where Inarritus star, Leonardo DiCaprio, is about to follow in the footsteps of his frequent mentor, Martin Scorsese, and finally win an Oscar for a role that isnt even close to his best work (or the best work in the movie, where hes overshadowed by Hardy). Its not the most impressive roster of nominees, so his winning doesnt bother me that much, but its still a little disappointing to see Leo finally rewarded for yet another entry in his grunting, scowling, (in this case) bearded attempts to bury his boy-wonder good looks and prove that hes a Grown-Up Actor. When the reality is that while hes ... fine in these kind of roles, his greatness lies elsewhere, in movies like Catch Me If You Can, The Great Gatsby and The Wolf of Wall Street, where he plays the charming man-child to the hilt.

BRUNI: I think this naysaying about DiCaprio has gone too far. Is The Revenant the pinnacle of his career and of the best actor category this year? Probably not. A little grunting in the snow and grimacing in a shallow grave go a long way. I was exhausted and exasperated by him and the movie in the end.

Photo

Still, when he wins this Oscar  which he will  Ill be fine with that, though Id actually prefer, and vote for, Matt Damon. Its so easy to be impressed by showy suffering like DiCaprios, but what Damon does in those many scenes in The Martian when hes creating a video diary from Mars  and talking directly to the camera  is arguably trickier. How to make it persuasive, natural? How to weave that comic touch into a desperate situation? Hes tonally perfect and preternaturally engaging. The movie not only depends on him, it works as well as it does because of him.

DOUTHAT: Id probably vote for Matt Damon, too, since he had to sell that story almost single-handedly. But if you want the Oscar, it seems, you need to grow a beard and fight a bear.

BRUNI: I dont know about that. Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin spent nearly an entire movie  much longer than the one (incredible) sequence in The Revenant  fleeing and fighting a bear in The Edge, and they didnt even get nominations. But maybe thats because they grow their beards only as the movie proceeds and as their time in the wilderness lengthens. Its some hairy-come-lately disqualification.

The best actress category this year includes three performances that are magnificent and deserving of Oscars: Cate Blanchett in Carol, Saoirse Ronan in Brooklyn and Brie Larson in Room. You and I havent talked previously about Carol, which had a few glaring and puzzling flaws, chief among them the inscrutability of Maras thinly drawn character. But Carol was, for me, immensely moving. It avoided the issue-movie trap of sententiousness while communicating the sadness and injustice of a bigoted culture standing in the way of two womens happiness. And it had a stirring romantic spirit that so many other movies labor and fail to achieve.

DOUTHAT: If the best actor crop seemed thin to me, the best actress field is incredibly rich. I share your take on the quality of Blanchetts and Ronans work.

BRUNI: But Blanchett will rightly lose to Larson, who has been given the meatiest role in this category and takes full, harrowing advantage of it.

Photo

DOUTHAT: I also really enjoyed Jennifer Lawrence in the unjustly underrated Joy  that was a star-quality turn, whatever you thought of the story that surrounded it. And I rather wish that Charlize Theron had been nominated for carrying Mad Max and putting every other lady action hero in her shade.

But in the end I agree: It has to be Larson, who gave the rawest performance of the year in its darkest fairy tale.

And Theron and Larson together provide a pivot to the final prize, best picture, because their movies were this years yin and yang for me  Therons big and wild and better than just about every other overhyped blockbuster put together, Larsons claustrophobic and intimate and shot through with terrible emotion. Neither one is likely to win the Oscar: The race, everyone seems to agree, is between The Revenant, The Big Short and Spotlight.

BRUNI: This is a fascinating year in terms of the mixed signals sent over the pre-Oscar period. The Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture (Drama) went to The Revenant. But the Screen Actors Guild gave the equivalent of its best picture award to Spotlight. The Producers Guild went for The Big Short.

I think the race is really between Spotlight and The Big Short, because The Revenant would be a second-year-in-a-row win for a movie directed by Inarritu, and its just not good enough for that. Plus Spotlight and The Big Short both do two things Oscar voters love: They employ lots of actors in talky, meaty parts, and they appeal to Hollywoods liberal moral vanity. Spotlight does this by justly flogging the Catholic Church, and the fact that the movie was recently screened at the Vatican could give it the decisive edge over The Big Short.

DOUTHAT: Ill go out on a limb and predict that The Big Short will steal it, in a directing/best picture split.

BRUNI: I am so angry at you, Ross. I am livid! Because I was waiting to shock our readers with my own pick of The Big Short to win best picture, and now youve stolen my thunder. Bad Ross!

DOUTHAT: Well, if I had my way it would be a dead heat, a shared statue, for Room and Mad Max: Fury Road. No matter who wins, thats the pair that Ill remember.

BRUNI: Im as much a fan of Room as you are, but if I had my way, the statue would go to Spotlight, just because it fires so perfectly on all cylinders: storytelling, acting, worthy subject matter. But Im sticking with The Big Short as my prediction. Income inequality and Wall Street shenanigans are issues much more of this exact moment than is sexual abuse in the church; you could argue that The Big Short is a companion piece to Bernie Sanderss populist uprising. Never mind that The Big Short turns the very financial speculators who profited from other peoples lost homes into underdog heroes  nifty trick, that! It concludes on a shaming note, with sweeping observations about the ways in which the stock market and the banking system are corrupt and rigged, eventually victimizing middle-class Americans. I think right now, in the midst of an intensifying presidential campaign, Hollywood voters will find that message as irresistible as New Hampshire and South Carolina voters found Trump. There you go, Ross. One more, last mention of your political hero.

DOUTHAT: Thanks for nothing, Frank.

BRUNI: Youre welcome.",[]
nytimes.com,2012-09-24 00:00:00,"Is ""Illegal Immigrant"" the Right Description?","['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","For Debate Readers debate a Times journalistic decision.

Jose Antonio Vargas is a man on a mission. The journalist turned immigration activist wants news organizations to stop using the term illegal immigrants, which he finds disparaging and inaccurate. Hes particularly focusing on The Times and The Associated Press to change their policies.

Mr. Vargas has approached me about it by e-mail, and Ive said I would be happy to hear him out. I should note that, as public editor, I dont make Times policy on such things. However, I could, at some point, take a stand.

At this point, I dont know enough.

I do know what Mr. Vargas  who revealed that he is an undocumented immigrant in a Times Magazine piece last year  told the Online News Assocation in a speech there last Friday.

And I talked about it Monday morning with Philip B. Corbett, the associate managing editor for standards at The Times. We do think about this, and we talk about it all the time, he said.

Asked about the matter by Poynter.orgs Mallary Tenore on Monday, he responded as follows:

Obviously we know this is a sensitive area, one that we continue to struggle with. As my colleague Julia Preston, who covers immigration, has suggested, were trying hard to be neutral on an issue where there isnt much neutral ground. For one thing, we dont reduce our coverage of this complicated issue to a single label. Julia and other Times reporters try to be detailed, descriptive and as accurate as possible in writing about immigrants in a whole range of different situations. But in referring in general terms to the issue of people living in the United States without legal papers, we do think the phrases illegal immigrants and illegal immigration are accurate, factual and as neutral as we can manage under the circumstances. It is, in fact, illegal to enter, live or work in this country without valid documents. Some people worry that we are labeling immigrants as criminals  but were not. Illegal is not a synonym for criminal. (One can even park illegally, though its not a criminal offense.) Proposed alternatives like undocumented seem really to be euphemisms  as though this were just a bureaucratic mix-up that can easily be remedied. Often those phrases seem deliberately chosen to try to soften or minimize the significance of the lack of legal status. We avoid those euphemisms just as we avoid phrases that tend to cast a more pejorative light on immigrants. For example, we steer clear of the shorthand illegals and also the word aliens, both of which we think have needlessly negative connotations.

So, in keeping with my promise to make this blog a continuing conversation about journalism and journalistic practices, Ill put the question out there for discussion.

In the meantime, I also hope to talk with Julia Preston. Here are her comments last week in an ABC/Univision story.

What do you think? You can respond in comments to this blog, e-mail me at public@nytimes.com or reply on Twitter, where my handle is @sulliview.

Ill aggregate the discussion and comment more substantively soon.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-02-12 00:00:00,Is Global Expansion Good for Times Readers?,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","If all goes well for The Times in its latest incarnation  a Spanish-language site, The New York Times en Espanol, that officially began this week with a base in Mexico City  readers may benefit twice.

The first benefit is obvious enough. The Times is trying to expand its digital readership around the world, which will help it stay afloat as a profitable business. Sustainable financial health, if it comes, means that the company can continue to pay for its large news-gathering and news-producing operation. (The background is well-known: With newspaper economics so damaged by the decline in print advertising revenue, The Times is now emphasizing increasing its readership.)

Publishing in languages other than English  first Chinese, now Spanish, with others to come  vastly expands the pool of possible Times readers.

These new readers will help attract new digital advertising, and may eventually pay for subscriptions. (At the moment, there is no pay wall for the Spanish-language site, which offers 10 to 15 translated Times articles a day  culled from hundreds of possible articles  and also produces some original journalism, which may be reverse-translated for English-speaking readers.)

But there is a second, less obvious benefit: a deepening of the papers reporting strength in various regions of the world. The Times has hired six experienced Spanish-speaking reporters and editors in Mexico. That hiring has been made easier because Mexico has become a very difficult and dangerous place to do hard-hitting journalism, and working under the umbrella of The Times can mean a little more protection.

They are all very ambitious journalists in their own right, with a reputation for digging and asking tough questions, the International editor, Joseph Kahn, told me. (Among them, for example, is Alberto Arce, formerly of The Associated Press.)

The new staff amounts to an impressive force multiplier for The Timess enterprise journalism in Latin America  something that should benefit all readers, he said.

And this will be replicated in other parts of the world as The Times starts other, similar efforts  probably at least two more this year, according to Lydia Polgreen, the deputy International editor in charge of the global-growth effort. She declined to say where they might be.

The hope, though, is for substantial readership growth over the next two or three years. There are signs of considerable interest: The Spanish site quickly garnered 250,000 likes on Facebook and 25,000 Twitter followers, Ms. Polgreen said.

Mr. Kahn described the readership goal in terms of engaged readers who are regular digital visitors. The Times has an audience that includes 30 million unique visitors a month outside the United States; of that number, about 1.5 million are the sought-after engaged readers.

We want to significantly more than double that number of engaged readers in the next few years, Mr. Kahn said.

The companys international growth has had its troubles. The Chinese-language site started out strong, with 10 million page views a month. But after The Times wrote uncomplimentary articles about the Chinese government, the site was blocked in October 2012. It remains blocked, but he said that the page views  which took a sharp dive  are now back at close to that initial level because the site is being read in other Chinese-speaking parts of the world, and even in China through various backdoor methods.

Such problems are unlikely in Mexico but, Ms. Polgreen said, there are plenty of other challenges. Translating Times journalism so that it is not only accurate but also has the right idioms, phrasing and tone  while still remaining true to The Timess style  is tricky.

Weve wrestled a lot with that, she said, Theres a literary art to translation, and weve had some spirited debates.

As for which stories are offered to Spanish-speaking readers, its a collaboration, she said, that takes place throughout the day. Some of the most successful selections might seem surprising: The long story of George Bell, the man who died alone in his Queens apartment, was extremely popular, she said.

People want to read beautifully told stories, and have a hunger for deep, immersive journalism, she said. Fashion, culture, books are part of the mix. The culture staffs dialogue about Beyonces new video was one recent offering  and so is coverage of American politics and Latin American news.

As The Times tries to reach the goal, set last year, of doubling its digital revenue by 2020 (to $800 million), it is moving fast on many different fronts. Times readers often tell me that they arent happy with what they see as a result.

Sometimes, the incessant drive for new readers seems inconsistent with core Times values. This global expansion, though, may well prove helpful to the journalism as well as to the bottom line.",[]

Photo

There is a photograph of my father and grandfather, taken on Sunday, Aug. 27, 1939, at a spot overlooking the Rhine above the Lorelei Rock, where the chasm of the river tightens and the quickened flow makes a murmuring sound, which has mystical resonance for the Germans.

My dad had emigrated to Canada in 1934. He was in Germany that summer visiting his parents for the first time in five years. His name was Hermann, but even his German friends called him Billy. My grandfather was Heinrich, but his Anglo-Irish wife called him Bobs.

They had come out from Frankfurt, on a Sunday jaunt, in a little car that my father had borrowed from a friend. Their lives were insecure, jangled by history, and dressing well was very important to them. They always had to be perfectly tailored and groomed, as they are in the photo. Bobs ordered suits he really couldnt afford from his English tailor in Hamburg. The American soft-collared shirt hes wearing in the picture was a present from his son, who had made a quick stop at Brooks Brothers on Madison Avenue between getting off his train from Montreal and boarding the New York, a Hamburg-American liner.

Five days after the photograph was taken the German Army invaded Poland and the Second World War began. When I look at the photo, it seems to me my grandfather is seeing the war coming down the river. Billy has a hand on his fathers shoulder, as if to reassure him  but Bobs sees what he sees. Or maybe hes listening to the Lorelei. In some legends the rivers murmur is a bewitching sound made by a beautiful woman, luring men to their death in a dangerous place.

Maybe shes whispering, War.

They were Catholics, not Jews, not socialists, so not especially vulnerable. Bobs had been scolded by a febrile shopkeeper, a local Nazi Party boss, for declining to return the German greeting, the Heil Hitler gesture, but that was nothing compared with the insults and terror that others experienced.

My grandparents had met and were married in London. They were living in a seaside villa on the Isle of Wight when World War I began in August 1914. Bobs was arrested and interned as an enemy alien for four and a half grim years, then deported. His health was shattered. Their savings were exhausted. English Quakers gave them enough money to pay for their tickets and food on the journey to Germany. Along the way their trunks of clothes and household goods were looted by French occupation troops.

When they stepped off the train in Frankfurt in January 1919, neither my grandmother nor my father spoke a word of German. She never learned, but Billy taught himself by reading and rereading the novels of Karl May, romantic tales of German adventurers and noble Apaches on the high plains of Texas and New Mexico. May was Einsteins favorite writer. Hitlers, too.

That summer of 1939 Billy had hoped to persuade his parents to leave Germany. But applying for exit visas meant posting bonds and paying an extortionate flight tax, with no guarantee the visa would even be granted. And my grandfather doubted that England, Ireland or Canada would welcome him, well-dressed or not, any more than they welcomed German Jews. He was a deportee. If they did let him in, he was sure to be interned if another war began.

Five days after that moment on the Rhine, with the war underway, Billy received a telegram from the British consul in Cologne, warning of strained relations between His Majestys Government and Germany and suggesting he leave the country immediately.

He had booked his return on another Hamburg-American liner sailing for New York in the first week of September. But waiting that long was risky. And he couldnt afford to be caught aboard a German-flagged ship if England declared war (which it did on Sept. 3). According to the Nuremberg racial laws he was a German. The Nazis wouldnt recognize his British passport in time of war; he would owe the same duty to the Fatherland as anyone else. Which meant military service or a one-way ticket to Dachau.

He decided to aim for Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, and a Holland America ship. His train from Frankfurt was oversold. The mood on the platform was near hysteria: In a few hours Britain would declare war on Germany. He said goodbye to his parents, in English. Bobs was concerned the German border police would board the train as it approached the frontier and take Billy off, but he reached Rotterdam safely. After three fraught weeks, he was able to get passage on a ship for New York. Reaching Montreal, he immediately applied for a commission in the Royal Canadian Navy. He was turned down for being too German.

My father did not hear from his parents for years, didnt know they were still alive until a friend serving in the Canadian Army found them living in the rubble of Frankfurt in 1945.

My grandparents were not Jews. Nothing else in their story probably mattered more than this: They werent Jews. Theyd bartered their English shoes and silver picture frames for potatoes, their city had fallen down around them, but they were alive.

Decades later I was with my father in a hospital room in Montreal. He was dying, and slipping in and out of a coma. No one had shaved him or combed his hair in a couple of days and he wore one of those demeaning hospital johnnies. He looked pretty wild. Every now and then hed start climbing out of bed. Then hed calm down and, sounding very lucid, ask me to fetch his suit out of the closet, and his shoes, and help him get dressed, quickly. Properly dressed, because the last train was leaving for Rotterdam, and he had to get himself aboard, and across the frontier.

The Stone is a forum for contemporary philosophers and other thinkers on issues both timely and timeless.

I.

Art is often the subject of philosophy. But every now and then, a work of art  something other than a lecture or words on a page  can function as philosophy. Son of Saul, a film set in Auschwitz-Birkenau during the Holocaust, is such a work of art. It engages with a profound set of problems that also occupied the 19th-century Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard.

Written and directed by the Hungarian filmmaker Laszlo Nemes, Son of Saul won awards at Cannes, the Golden Globes and elsewhere before making its way to the Oscars to win the award for best foreign language film. It follows a day in the life of Saul, a member of the Sonderkommando, a group of mostly Jewish prisoners the Nazis forced to assist with herding people to the gas chambers, burning the bodies and collecting gold and valuables from the corpses. The film creates a direct, experiential and visceral engagement with these events by maintaining a relentless focus on the minute-to-minute unfolding of Sauls world.

In long, unbroken shots, we see the reality of the death camp revealed, its textures made tangible. By using close-ups and shallow focus images throughout, Nemes gives viewers no opportunity to disengage from Sauls point of view. It is as though we are shadowing him in hell. In immersing the viewer this way, Nemes places us there with Saul. This seems to be a moral imperative as well as an aesthetic choice. By eliciting a full, visceral engagement from the viewer, the film embodies the respect for the singular events of the Holocaust that more commercial treatments of the subject fail at. The film is a thoroughly personal, subjective account of the Holocaust.

The movies central theme is Sauls inner world, the loss and recovery of his soul. In scene after scene we see his face unmoved, his eyes watching but remote; there is a repellent sense of his  and our own  indifference. But then he witnesses a young boy briefly surviving the gas, only to be put to death a few minutes later by a Nazi doctor, possibly Josef Mengele. From this moment, he becomes consumed by the idea of giving the boy a proper Jewish burial. He claims the boy is his son. Sauls backstory is entirely missing from the film  we dont even learn if he really had a son  but that is beside the point. What matters, to him and to us is that he is able to feel again.

II.

Much of Kierkegaards philosophy is a warning against the tendency  greatly accelerated in modern times  to take an increasingly objective, abstract perspective on the world. While the paradigm example of this is science, it is most problematic when applied to ones own life and existence. To identify life with its abstractions is, in Kierkegaards view, a dangerous but all too common error.

There are generally two, radically different ways to relate to the world: objective and subjective. Objectivity is an orientation towards reality based on abstracting away, in various degrees, from subjective experience, and from individual points of view. A subjective orientation, on the other hand, is based on an attunement to the inner experience of feeling, sensing, thinking and valuing that unfolds in our day-to-day living. This distinction has been brought into contemporary philosophical discourse most notably by Thomas Nagel, in a number of his essays, most famously in What Is It Like to Be a Bat?

Now in print The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments An anthology of essays from The Timess philosophy series, published by Liveright.

The spectacular success of science in the past 300 years has raised hopes that it also holds the key to guiding human beings towards a good life. Psychology and neuroscience has become a main source of life advice in the popular media. But philosophers have long held reservations about this scientific orientation to how to live life. The 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume, for instance, famously pointed out, no amount of fact can legislate value, moral or otherwise. You cannot derive ought from is. But there is another, in some way more radical concern, expressed in Western philosophy most forcefully by Kierkegaard, and in literature by Dostoyevsky  two religiously inspired thinkers  namely that our experience of life matters in ineffable ways that no objective understanding of the world can capture.

Wittgenstein, in a well-known letter to Ludwig von Ficker, the publisher of the Tractatus, claimed that the whole point of the book is to show that what is important lies in what cannot be expressed in a scientific language. Suppose there was a super-intelligent organism  in a twist on Frank Jacksons knowledge argument  that lacked any feeling or experience, a creature of pure thought. Such a creature could, for example, know everything about the brain, even everything about the world at large, all in scientific terms; but it would know nothing of human significance. (An interesting video depicting Jacksons argument can be found here.)

This line of thought holds that human significance comes from subjective experience and that human beings cannot thrive without an orientation towards, and engagement with, the subjective experience of their lives, and that, as a matter of fact, a predominantly objective, conceptual orientation to oneself is detrimental to well being. As Kierkegaard put it, Science and scholarship want to teach that becoming objective is the way. Christianity teaches that the way is to become subjective, to become a subject.

Science is the best method we have for approaching the world objectively. But in fact it is not science per se that is the problem, from the point of view of subjectivity. It is objectivizing, in any of its forms. One can frame a decision, for example, in objective terms. One might decide between career choices by weighing differences in workloads, prestige, pay and benefits between, say, working for an advanced technology company versus working for a studio in Hollywood. We are often encouraged to make choices by framing them in this way. Alternatively, one might try to frame the decision more in terms of what it might be like to work in either occupation; in this case, one needs to have the patience to dwell in experience long enough for ones feelings about either alternative to emerge. In other words, one might deliberate subjectively.

This is, of course, a crude opposition. We hardly ever deliberate purely objectively or purely subjectively. And there are built-in limits to subjective decision-making. Often, as the philosopher Laurie Paul has argued (as explained in an essay here by the psychologist Paul Bloom last year), we are not even in a position to imagine what our lives will be like after a life-altering decision.

The bottom line is, what Kierkegaard pointed out is a steady push in society toward more objectivity, and less engagement with subjectivity, with what is  sometimes derisively  called inwardness. There is less of a tendency for modern humans to live thoroughly immersed in life, experiencing it, and more of a tendency of being mostly distracted by its abstractions, by all the ways our culture conceptually frames our existence as individuals, Democrats and Republicans, man and women, one percenters, workers, consumers, and so on. And here, as a result, is the problem: by becoming less subjective, we become more cut off from sources of meaning and value.

III.

One does not have to agree with Kierkegaards single-minded, hostile rejection of objective thought and objectivity to still consider what he has to say about the cultivation of subjectivity, because that is where his major insights lie. So what about his exhortation to become subjective? Why is there even a need for this? Isnt it true that, given our experience of life, we already are? It seems that one cannot fail to be a subject, to be subjective. However, as Kierkegaard points out, the mind can flee its own subjectivity; instead of dwelling in the presence of ones experience, one can escape into alienation; into theorizing about needs, goals and happiness, and live by abstract principles and objective measures. As Freud has described, there are various ways of doing this: by repressing experience, dissociating from it, numbing it, turning away from it.

Most commonly, we turn our back on subjectivity to escape from pain. Suffering, ones own, or others, might become bearable, one hopes, when one takes a step back and views it objectively, conceptually, abstractly. And when it comes to something as monumental as the Holocaust, ones mind cannot help but be numbed by the sheer magnitude of it. How could one feel the pain of all those people, sympathize with millions? Instead one is left with the facts, the numbers.

Son of Saul approaches its stupefying subject in a way that echoes Kierkegaards imperative. The audience is not given any space to distance from Sauls reality or turn it into an abstraction of suffering, innocence, or goodness; the film doesnt depict the story of the Holocaust in generic ways that would encourage getting lost in a historical account. Rather, it allows viewers to feel its textures, and perceive the sights and sounds that make up individual experience. In this way, the film depicts what many critics have argued could not be depicted.

It achieves this by not letting the viewer off the hook, by demanding participation, as far as it is possible in the imagination, in the experience of the Holocaust. As Kierkegaard puts it in Either/Or, For one may have known a thing many times and acknowledged it ... and yet it is only by the deep inward movements, only by the indescribable emotions of the heart, that for the first time you are convinced that what you have known belongs to you ... for only the truth that edifies is truth for you.

In addition to employing a subjective approach visually, Nemes also makes subjectivity the theme of the film. It depicts the loss of subjectivity both at the larger societal level, as well as at the level of the individual. It is this double engagement of subjectivity that makes the film so effective.

The death camp is the absurd end point of technological thinking, of the objectification of human beings. Totalitarian regimes the world over know the value and power of subjectivity  that is why they work so hard to destroy it. Murdered Jews are referred to as pieces in the movie by the German camp administrators. The victims are denied the status of subjects  they are mere physical objects to be dealt with. In this world of mechanized objectivity, the Nazis industrial brutality is considered entirely normal. Any individual not obeying its construct of proper behavior only has their own conscience to rely on.

Imre Kertesz, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature for his autobiographical novel about a Hungarian boy taken to Auschwitz, explained this vividly in his acceptance speech when he describes a crucial experience that contributed to writing the novel: The experience was about solitude, a more difficult life ... the need to step out of the mesmerizing crowd, out of history, which renders you faceless and fateless.

At a yet deeper level, it is the subjectivity of its protagonist that is the main theme of the movie. Through his encounter with the boy Saul gains back his soul. At the moment that Saul witnesses the killing of the boy, he becomes  in Kierkegaards beautiful expression  a Knight of Faith, someone who made a commitment, and who can pursue it with passion, as if it was the surest thing, even in the face of overwhelming odds. Saul is finally able to experience the death and destruction around him by committing to this one, dead boy; not unlike the film nudges the viewers to relate to the Holocaust as real, by committing them to this one, near dead protagonist. Having seen it you will remember, deliriously, having been there, in some small part of your body. It is a duty created by the Holocaust, suggests the movie. It is a dark counterpart of the imperative for Jews to relive the experience of deliverance from bondage into freedom each year at Passover.

At the same time that it depicts Sauls conversion, Son of Saul also directly engages the viewers subjectivity by its style and mode of presentation; its achievement is to embody the dynamic that is its very subject matter. Kierkegaard called such communication  the only sort he thought befitting a subjective thinker  double reflection. He thought this is the only way that the authenticity of the message can be guarded  the only way to avoid being a town crier of subjectivity. In this way, Son of Saul is both art and philosophy: It makes inwardness visible. Through its depiction of death and destruction it reminds us how to live.

nytimes.com,2014-06-27 00:00:00,Inequality Is Not Inevitable,"['The End', 'The Great Divide', 'The Conversation', 'Joseph E', 'Errol Morris', 'All Contributors']","The Great Divide is a series about inequality.

AN insidious trend has developed over this past third of a century. A country that experienced shared growth after World War II began to tear apart, so much so that when the Great Recession hit in late 2007, one could no longer ignore the fissures that had come to define the American economic landscape. How did this shining city on a hill become the advanced country with the greatest level of inequality?

One stream of the extraordinary discussion set in motion by Thomas Pikettys timely, important book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, has settled on the idea that violent extremes of wealth and income are inherent to capitalism. In this scheme, we should view the decades after World War II  a period of rapidly falling inequality  as an aberration.

This is actually a superficial reading of Mr. Pikettys work, which provides an institutional context for understanding the deepening of inequality over time. Unfortunately, that part of his analysis received somewhat less attention than the more fatalistic-seeming aspects.

Over the past year and a half, The Great Divide, a series in The New York Times for which I have served as moderator, has also presented a wide range of examples that undermine the notion that there are any truly fundamental laws of capitalism. The dynamics of the imperial capitalism of the 19th century neednt apply in the democracies of the 21st. We dont need to have this much inequality in America.

Our current brand of capitalism is an ersatz capitalism. For proof of this go back to our response to the Great Recession, where we socialized losses, even as we privatized gains. Perfect competition should drive profits to zero, at least theoretically, but we have monopolies and oligopolies making persistently high profits. C.E.O.s enjoy incomes that are on average 295 times that of the typical worker, a much higher ratio than in the past, without any evidence of a proportionate increase in productivity.

If it is not the inexorable laws of economics that have led to Americas great divide, what is it? The straightforward answer: our policies and our politics. People get tired of hearing about Scandinavian success stories, but the fact of the matter is that Sweden, Finland and Norway have all succeeded in having about as much or faster growth in per capita incomes than the United States and with far greater equality.

So why has America chosen these inequality-enhancing policies? Part of the answer is that as World War II faded into memory, so too did the solidarity it had engendered. As America triumphed in the Cold War, there didnt seem to be a viable competitor to our economic model. Without this international competition, we no longer had to show that our system could deliver for most of our citizens.

Ideology and interests combined nefariously. Some drew the wrong lesson from the collapse of the Soviet system. The pendulum swung from much too much government there to much too little here. Corporate interests argued for getting rid of regulations, even when those regulations had done so much to protect and improve our environment, our safety, our health and the economy itself.

But this ideology was hypocritical. The bankers, among the strongest advocates of laissez-faire economics, were only too willing to accept hundreds of billions of dollars from the government in the bailouts that have been a recurring feature of the global economy since the beginning of the Thatcher-Reagan era of free markets and deregulation.

The American political system is overrun by money. Economic inequality translates into political inequality, and political inequality yields increasing economic inequality. In fact, as he recognizes, Mr. Pikettys argument rests on the ability of wealth-holders to keep their after-tax rate of return high relative to economic growth. How do they do this? By designing the rules of the game to ensure this outcome; that is, through politics.

So corporate welfare increases as we curtail welfare for the poor. Congress maintains subsidies for rich farmers as we cut back on nutritional support for the needy. Drug companies have been given hundreds of billions of dollars as we limit Medicaid benefits. The banks that brought on the global financial crisis got billions while a pittance went to the homeowners and victims of the same banks predatory lending practices. This last decision was particularly foolish. There were alternatives to throwing money at the banks and hoping it would circulate through increased lending. We could have helped underwater homeowners and the victims of predatory behavior directly. This would not only have helped the economy, it would have put us on the path to robust recovery.

OUR divisions are deep. Economic and geographic segregation have immunized those at the top from the problems of those down below. Like the kings of yore, they have come to perceive their privileged positions essentially as a natural right. How else to explain the recent comments of the venture capitalist Tom Perkins, who suggested that criticism of the 1 percent was akin to Nazi fascism, or those coming from the private equity titan Stephen A. Schwarzman, who compared asking financiers to pay taxes at the same rate as those who work for a living to Hitlers invasion of Poland.

Our economy, our democracy and our society have paid for these gross inequities. The true test of an economy is not how much wealth its princes can accumulate in tax havens, but how well off the typical citizen is  even more so in America where our self-image is rooted in our claim to be the great middle-class society. But median incomes are lower than they were a quarter-century ago. Growth has gone to the very, very top, whose share has almost quadrupled since 1980. Money that was meant to have trickled down has instead evaporated in the balmy climate of the Cayman Islands.

With almost a quarter of American children younger than 5 living in poverty, and with America doing so little for its poor, the deprivations of one generation are being visited upon the next. Of course, no country has ever come close to providing complete equality of opportunity. But why is America one of the advanced countries where the life prospects of the young are most sharply determined by the income and education of their parents?

Among the most poignant stories in The Great Divide were those that portrayed the frustrations of the young, who yearn to enter our shrinking middle class. Soaring tuitions and declining incomes have resulted in larger debt burdens. Those with only a high school diploma have seen their incomes decline by 13 percent over the past 35 years.

Where justice is concerned, there is also a yawning divide. In the eyes of the rest of the world and a significant part of its own population, mass incarceration has come to define America  a country, it bears repeating, with about 5 percent of the worlds population but around a fourth of the worlds prisoners.

Justice has become a commodity, affordable to only a few. While Wall Street executives used their high-retainer lawyers to ensure that their ranks were not held accountable for the misdeeds that the crisis in 2008 so graphically revealed, the banks abused our legal system to foreclose on mortgages and evict people, some of whom did not even owe money.

More than a half-century ago, America led the way in advocating for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948. Today, access to health care is among the most universally accepted rights, at least in the advanced countries. America, despite the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, is the exception. It has become a country with great divides in access to health care, life expectancy and health status.

In the relief that many felt when the Supreme Court did not overturn the Affordable Care Act, the implications of the decision for Medicaid were not fully appreciated. Obamacares objective  to ensure that all Americans have access to health care  has been stymied: 24 states have not implemented the expanded Medicaid program, which was the means by which Obamacare was supposed to deliver on its promise to some of the poorest.

We need not just a new war on poverty but a war to protect the middle class. Solutions to these problems do not have to be newfangled. Far from it. Making markets act like markets would be a good place to start. We must end the rent-seeking society we have gravitated toward, in which the wealthy obtain profits by manipulating the system.

The problem of inequality is not so much a matter of technical economics. Its really a problem of practical politics. Ensuring that those at the top pay their fair share of taxes  ending the special privileges of speculators, corporations and the rich  is both pragmatic and fair. We are not embracing a politics of envy if we reverse a politics of greed. Inequality is not just about the top marginal tax rate but also about our childrens access to food and the right to justice for all. If we spent more on education, health and infrastructure, we would strengthen our economy, now and in the future. Just because youve heard it before doesnt mean we shouldnt try it again.

We have located the underlying source of the problem: political inequities and policies that have commodified and corrupted our democracy. It is only engaged citizens who can fight to restore a fairer America, and they can do so only if they understand the depths and dimensions of the challenge. It is not too late to restore our position in the world and recapture our sense of who we are as a nation. Widening and deepening inequality is not driven by immutable economic laws, but by laws we have written ourselves.

nytimes.com,2016-02-29 00:00:00,Ideas Help No One on a Shelf. Take Them to the World.,"['The End', 'The Great Divide', 'The Conversation', 'Tina Rosenberg', 'Errol Morris', 'All Contributors']","Fixes looks at solutions to social problems and why they work.

Have you thought of a clever product to mitigate climate change? Did you invent an ingenious gadget to light African villages at night? Have you come up with a new kind of school, or new ideas for lowering the rate of urban shootings?

Thanks, but we have lots of those.

Whatever problem possesses you, we already have plenty of ways to solve it. Many have been rigorously tested and have a lot of evidence behind them  and yet theyre sitting on a shelf.

So dont invent something new. If you want to make a contribution, choose one of those ideas  and spread it.

Spreading an idea can mean two different things. One is to take something thats working in one place and introduce it somewhere else. If you want to reduce infant mortality in Cleveland, why not try whats working in Baltimore?

Well, you might not know about whats working because theres no quick system for finding it.

Even when a few people do search out the answer, innovative ideas dont spread by themselves. To become well known, they require effort from their originators. For example, a Bogota, Colombia, maternity hospital invented Kangaroo Care  a method of keeping premature babies warm by strapping them 24/7 to Moms chest. It saved a lot of lives in Bogota. But what allowed it to save lives around the world was a campaign to spread it to other countries.

The Colombians established Fundacion Canguro and got grants from wealthy countries to bring groups of doctors and nurses from all over to visit Bogota for two or three weeks. Once the visitors had gone back and set up a program in their hospital, the foundation loaned them a doctor and nurse to help get them started. Save the Children now leads a global partnership to spread Kangaroo Care, with the goal of reaching half the world.

In short, this work requires dedicated organizations, a smart program and lots of money.

The other meaning of spreading an idea is creating ways to get new inventions out to people who need them.

When I talk to college students or anyone whos thinking about entrepreneurship or targeting global poverty, the gadget is where 99 percent of people start thinking, said Nicholas Fusso, the director of D-Prize (its slogan: Distribution is development). Thats important  but the biggest problems in the poverty world arent a lack of gadgets or new products. Its figuring out how people can have access to them. So D-Prize gives seed money, in chunks of $10,000 to $20,000, to tiny new organizations that have good ideas for how to distribute useful things.

This analysis may be familiar to regular readers of Fixes. Indeed, the first Fixes column, more than five years ago, focused on distribution: getting health care to people in rural Africa by putting health care workers on motorcycles and keeping the bikes running.

Fusso likes to use the example of malaria. The modern insecticide-treated bed net was invented in 1980, when one million people a year  the vast majority small children  were dying. What impact did the invention itself have? None at all, at first. Deaths each year rose gradually, and then rose sharply  to a peak of 1.8 million in 2004, when they began to fall.

What happened then? The world finally started putting money into fighting malaria, including distributing bed nets. Today, deaths from malaria are one third of what they were in 2004.

The invention was crucial, of course  but it was distribution that gave it impact.

Also in 2004, a French researcher named Pascaline Dupas, working in Kenya, was talking to a Kenyan colleague who was running to give some money to her high school-age sister. These girls have no money, and I dont want her to end up with a sugar daddy, the colleague said.

But thats crazy! Dupas replied. Doesnt she know she could get H.I.V.?

Perhaps she did know, but the vast majority of girls in Kenya did not. The assumption was widespread that someone relatively wealthy and established was unlikely to have the virus. Three quarters of 15-year-old Kenyans surveyed thought teenage boys were more likely to be infected than men over 25.

This was very wrong. H.I.V. rates were six times higher in men aged 20-24 than they were in boys 15-19, and the rates rose with each additional year of sexual activity.

Across the world, but especially in high-poverty countries, many high school girls look for boyfriends who are five to 10 years older, because those men have sophistication, stability and money. These sugar daddies give the girls gifts, pick them up from school in nice cars, pay their school fees and even help their families.

Moreover, girls are much more likely to have unprotected sex with a sugar daddy than with boys their own age. The power imbalance in the relationship makes it difficult to insist on condom use. And avoiding pregnancy is less important to them, as wealthier and more stable men make better husbands and are more likely to marry them than teen boys are.

Sugar daddies were one big reason that the H.I.V. rate for teenage girls in Kenya was five times higher than for teenage boys. Dupas wondered if simply providing the girls with correct information about the relative risks could change things.

She designed a 40-minute lesson to help girls in eighth grade (average age: 15) to understand the H.I.V. risks associated with sugar daddies. It started with a 10-minute video. Then a facilitator from a local civic group showed statistics about actual infection rates by age and gender. The class discussed the reasons for these patterns, and gradually came around to talking about sugar daddies.

This training was tested in 328 schools in western Kenya against the countrys standard school anti-AIDS curriculum, which promoted abstinence. Dupass message was very different: Your risks are far less if you choose a partner your own age.

It made us very popular with the young boys in the class, she said.

The next year, Dupas counted how many girls had become pregnant, and recorded the fathers ages. The group that heard Dupass lesson had a pregnancy rate 28 percent lower than those who received the standard abstinence-based curriculum. And their rate of child bearing with men five years or more their senior was 61 percent less.

Dupas didnt have money to do H.I.V. testing, so she didnt study the effects on H.I.V. incidence. But pregnancy is likely a good stand-in for unprotected sex, and therefore H.I.V. infections.

For a 40-minute single intervention at negligible cost, it was a stunning impact.

And then  nothing happened. One organization tried to replicate the study in Cameroon, but didnt collect the right data. Dupas submitted the paper to various journals, finally publishing it in the American Economic Journal in 2011. Still, nothing happened  perhaps because people who design anti-AIDS programs dont usually read economics journals, she said.

Related More From Fixes Read previous contributions to this series.

Finally, someone ran with it. But it was only because a young American, Noam Angrist, had studied at M.I.T. with Esther Duflo, a professor who was Dupass mentor. Angrist had also worked at J-PAL, a laboratory Duflo helped to establish to carry out scientific studies of anti-poverty programs.

In 2013 Angrist was living in Botswana, which has the second-highest H.I.V prevalence of any nation  45 percent of 40-year-old men. With some friends, he did some small experiments to see whether the same misconceptions about sugar daddies existed in Botswana as in Kenya. They did. When we showed them the actual graph, they would physically gasp, he said. Young1ove was in business.

The new organization quickly won $20,000 from D-Prize and formed a partnership with Evidence Action, a new organization that seeks to scale up proven inventions. So far Young1ove has taught the mini-course  adapted for Botswana  to 35,000 youths, operating in a third of Botswanas schools. As the program grows, a study is comparing schools that have it  taught two different ways  to schools that dont yet, to test both the programs impact and whether teachers or youth facilitators get better results. The organization is also carrying out small pilot programs in South Africa and Zimbabwe.

Earlier this month, Young1ove and Evidence Action won a $700,000 grant from the new Global Innovation Fund, whose donors are the overseas development agencies of the United States, Britain, Sweden and Australia, and the Omidyar Network. The prize money will go to finishing the study and, if the results are good, rapid growth.

Young1ove is the largest of at least three groups trying to distribute Dupass curriculum. Jeunes Braves is working in Togo, and Power2Girls is starting in Ghana. Both won D-Prizes as well.

Organizations like J-PAL and Evidence Actions parent, Innovations for Poverty Action, are sometimes called the Randomistas, because they do randomized control trials. Theyve led a shift in anti-poverty work toward using scientific studies to see whats effective. In the last seven, eight years, weve moved away from its all about the talented individual to its all about the impact, said Gabriel Broadbar, director of the New York University Reynolds program in social entrepreneurship (which runs its own mini D-Prize).

The Randomistas have identified programs that work well and cheaply: bed nets, school-based deworming to rid children of parasites, installing chlorine dispensers at village taps, among others. The logical step now is to scale them up.

This is what Evidence Action tries to do. Karen Levy, the groups director of global innovation and beta, said that the challenges differ greatly from those of inventing something new: How do you fit the program into a countrys policy and regulatory framework? Whats a sustainable business model? How do you make it easy for lots of people  not just your original staff  to do well?

She used the example of deworming. Rather than send people to every single school, how do you design trainers of trainers in a cascade so it can be delivered by tens of thousands of teachers with the same results? she said.

Philanthropists and government aid agencies are only starting to get interested in the challenges of distribution  one new philanthropy that does have this focus is Good Ventures. As for academia, it still rewards invention almost exclusively. Theres a lot of attention and award-giving and prize-giving and credit to people who come up with fancy new ideas instead of reaching people and having impact, said Brodbar. The incentives arent aligned. The culture of social entrepreneurship needs to change.

Recognizing the true value of spreading an idea would also allow people who arent inventors (which is most of us) to get involved in social change. The notion that if you want to engage in [social entrepreneurship] you have to have the big idea does a disservice to this space and people who want to play a role in it, said Brodbar. Its a much wider front door.

nytimes.com,2016-01-27 00:00:00,Should The Times Have Been a Tougher Watchdog in Flint?,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Updated, 4 p.m.

Almost a year ago, last March, The Times published a frightening article about the drinking water in Flint, Mich.

Heres an excerpt:

When fecal coliform bacteria showed up in parts of the city last summer, residents were told to boil their water before using it. Officials addressed the issue by pumping extra chlorine into the system, but in solving one problem, they created another. The high chlorine levels led to elevated levels of total trihalomethanes or T.T.H.M., which required another public notice in January. Residents will again receive a notice of elevated T.T.H.M. levels in the mail later this month, Mayor Dayne Walling has said. Long-term consumption of water with high T.T.H.M. levels can lead to liver or kidney troubles and an increased risk of cancer, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

The article appeared on Page A16 in print. Then, more than six months went by. In October, The Times ran one brief and two articles about Flint.

Then, nothing of substance until this month, when a state of emergency was declared in Flint.

Since then, the nation has been up in arms about what happened in Flint, and more to the point, what didnt happen. The Times published a highly critical editorial last week (Outrage is the only sensible response to this man-made disaster, it said). And some presidential candidates have hammered away at it.

Issues of race and class are on everyones minds. Would this have happened in a rich, white community? Many, quite reasonably, doubt it.

And some Times readers are wondering why the news media, The Times included, didnt do more, earlier, when it might have made a real difference.

Donald Brandshaft wrote to me about it:

The media coverage of the Flint water problems strikes as somewhat hypocritical. One of the reasons that this could not happen in a white community is that every newspaper in the country would have reported it by May. The people of Flint were severely hurt by their governor and let down by the E.P.A., but they were also let down by the news media. I didnt notice any media self-examination resulting from this lapse.

I asked a deputy executive editor, Matt Purdy, about The Timess coverage. He reviewed it on Tuesday and spoke to the national editor, Alison Mitchell.

After doing so, Mr. Purdy told me that he was proud that The Times had written the March article, and had returned to the subject in October. He praised the quality of recent reporting work that landed two related Flint articles on the front page.

If The Times had dug in and devoted investigative resources to the situation, Mr. Purdy said, the results certainly could have had impact and been important. But the same few Chicago-based reporters have been covering a wide range of stories in the middle of the country  the Tamir Rice case in Cleveland, problems in the Detroit schools, the aftermath of racial unrest in Ferguson, Mo., and Rahm Emanuels re-election in Chicago, among others. Mr. Purdy wrote to me:

The Midwest is one of the busiest regions of the country in terms of news, from Ferguson to police shootings to political unrest in Chicago. If we had poured more of the valuable time of reporters into Flint, we would not have gotten other stories.

He added: The resources of regional and national outlets are stretched increasingly thin. We are fortunate to have a robust and talented national staff, but we certainly cant get to every important story and we cant go deep on every one we get to. Perhaps most disturbing is that there are likely hundreds of troubling events unfolding around the country at any time that are getting very little if any attention from the media.

As Columbia Journalism Review wrote, some of the most important watchdog work in Flint was done by a dogged investigative reporter, Curt Guyette, who no longer works for a news organization at all but for an arm of the American Civil Liberties Union. C.J.R. also cited the Detroit and Flint newspapers for their work. (After this post was published, a number of readers pointed out that Rachel Maddow of MSNBC has been a strong and persistent voice on the Flint story for weeks.)

My take: The Times got off to a strong start with its initial Flint story in March. It was good to return to the subject in October; and this months coverage has been thorough. But there could have been, and should have been, much more. If  for example  the March article had been followed up with some serious digging, and if the resulting stories had been given prominent display, public officials might have been shamed into taking action long before they did.

I understand the argument that The Times  which covers the whole nation and the globe  cant be responsible for investigating every local problem. With only a few Midwestern reporters, pulled in many directions, editors must make tough decisions about how to spend their time and energy.

The counterargument is this: Imagine if The Times really had taken on the Flint outrage with energy and persistence many months ago. With its powerful pulpit and reach, The Times could have held public officials accountable and prevented human suffering. Thats what journalistic watchdogs are supposed to do. As traditional local investigative reporting withers, The Timess role becomes ever more important.

Yes, that takes journalistic resources. Investigative reporting is notoriously time-consuming and expensive. The Times, to its credit, does a great deal of it.

But were such resources really unavailable in this case?

After all, enough Times firepower somehow has been found to document Hillary Clintons every sneeze, Donald Trumps latest bombast, and Marco Rubios shiny boots. There seem to be plenty of Times resources for such hit-seeking missives as breadfacing, or for the Magazines thorough exploration of buffalo plaid and lumbersexuals. And staff was available to produce this weeks dare-you-not-to-click video on the rising social movement known as Free the Nipple.

Isnt it a matter of choosing how to deploy the 1,300 members of the newsroom staff? Call it a question of priorities. Given all thats happened, especially on issues involving race, maybe its time to beef up that talented Midwest staff.

If The Times had kept the pressure on the Flint story, the resulting journalism might not have made the trending list  but it would have made a real difference to the people of Flint, who were in serious need of a powerful ally.",[]

Hes talking about Nate Silver, the statistics wizard whose FiveThirtyEight blog is licensed by The New York Times, and who writes for The Times frequently online as well as in print. Mr. Silver also has a desk in The Timess newsroom.

As the presidential campaign veers around the clubhouse turn and zooms into the homestretch, Mr. Silver is very much in the public eye.

For months now, he has been predicting that President Obama has about a 75 percent probability, give or take a few points, of winning re-election on Tuesday. He uses an algorithm  some call it a secret sauce  that combines the numbers in public opinion polls and produces a result that he then turns into a prediction.

That has endeared him to liberals and Democrats, just as it has infuriated conservatives and Republicans. Mr. Silver himself has said that he supported Mr. Obama in 2008 but his work tends to focus on numbers, not policy and politics.

He has been out there promoting his book, The Signal and the Noise, which has increased his visibility further. In short, hes everywhere and his name is on everyones lips.

As Brendan Nyhan noted in Columbia Journalism Review, some pundits resent him because his methods represent a mortal threat to traditional horse race political commentary.

His skirmish with Mr. Scarborough is especially high profile. Mr. Scarborough, as noted above, disagrees with Mr. Silvers prediction, calling the race a dead heat and saying that Mr. Silver is a fool to say otherwise.

Mr. Silver is quite accurate in his argument against Mr. Scarborough. He clearly says that the closeness of the popular vote does not affect the probability that Mr. Obama will win. They are, simply, two very different things.

So on Thursday, frustrated and irritated, Mr. Silver challenged Mr. Scarborough to a wager in a Twitter message  $1,000 to the Red Cross. (The offer later climbed to $2,000.)

If Mr. Obama wins, Mr. Scarborough pays up; if Mitt Romney wins, Mr. Silver does the same. So far, Mr. Scarborough isnt biting on the offer and I could not reach him for comment Thursday.

In a phone conversation, Mr. Silver described the wager offer as half playful and half serious.

Hes been on a rant, calling me an idiot and a partisan, so Im asking him to put some integrity behind it, he said. I dont stand to gain anything from it; its for charity.

He added that he is feeling the strain of being under attack and vulnerable to criticism as Election Day approaches.

Its a high-stress time, he said.

I can understand and sympathize with that.

But whatever the motivation behind it, the wager offer is a bad idea  giving ammunition to the critics who want to paint Mr. Silver as a partisan who is trying to sway the outcome.

Its also inappropriate for a Times journalist, which is how Mr. Silver is seen by the public even though hes not a regular staff member.

I wouldnt want to see it become newsroom practice, said the associate managing editor for standards, Philip B. Corbett. He described Mr. Silvers status as a blogger  something like a columnist  as a mitigating factor.

Granted, Mr. Silver isnt covering the presidential race as a political reporter would.

But he is closely associated with The Times and its journalism  in fact, hes probably (and please know that I use the p-word loosely) its most high-profile writer at this particular moment.

When he came to work at The Times, Mr. Silver gained a lot more visibility and the credibility associated with a prominent institution. But he lost something, too: the right to act like a free agent with responsibilities to nobodys standards but his own.",[]

BAMAKO, Mali  The cash filled three suitcases: 5 million euros.









The German official charged with delivering this cargo arrived here aboard a nearly empty military plane and was whisked away to a secret meeting with the president of Mali, who had offered Europe a face-saving solution to a vexing problem.

Officially, Germany had budgeted the money as humanitarian aid for the poor, landlocked nation of Mali.

In truth, all sides understood that the cash was bound for an obscure group of Islamic extremists who were holding 32 European hostages, according to six senior diplomats directly involved in the exchange.

The suitcases were loaded onto pickup trucks and driven hundreds of miles north into the Sahara, where the bearded fighters, who would soon become an official arm of Al Qaeda, counted the money on a blanket thrown on the sand. The 2003 episode was a learning experience for both sides. Eleven years later, the handoff in Bamako has become a well-rehearsed ritual, one of dozens of such transactions repeated all over the world.

Kidnapping Europeans for ransom has become a global business for Al Qaeda, bankrolling its operations across the globe.

While European governments deny paying ransoms, an investigation by The New York Times found that Al Qaeda and its direct affiliates have taken in at least $125 million in revenue from kidnappings since 2008, of which $66 million was paid just last year.

In news releases and statements, the United States Treasury Department has cited ransom amounts that, taken together, total around $165 million over the same period.

These payments were made almost exclusively by European governments, which funneled the money through a network of proxies, sometimes masking it as development aid, according to interviews conducted for this article with former hostages, negotiators, diplomats and government officials in 10 countries in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The inner workings of the kidnapping business were also revealed in thousands of pages of internal Qaeda documents found by this reporter while on assignment for The Associated Press in northern Mali last year.

In its early years, Al Qaeda received most of its money from deep-pocketed donors, but counterterrorism officials now believe the group finances the bulk of its recruitment, training and arms purchases from ransoms paid to free Europeans.

Put more bluntly, Europe has become an inadvertent underwriter of Al Qaeda.

The foreign ministries of Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland denied in emails or telephone interviews that they had paid the terrorists. The French authorities have repeatedly stated that France does not pay ransoms, said Vincent Floreani, deputy director of communication for Frances Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Several senior diplomats involved in past negotiations have described the decision to pay ransom for their countries citizens as an agonizing calculation: Accede to the terrorists demand, or allow innocent people to be killed, often in a gruesome, public way?

Yet the fact that Europe and its intermediaries continue to pay has set off a vicious cycle.

Kidnapping for ransom has become todays most significant source of terrorist financing, said David S. Cohen, the Treasury Departments under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, in a 2012 speech. Each transaction encourages another transaction.

And business is booming: While in 2003 the kidnappers received around $200,000 per hostage, now they are netting up to $10 million, money that the second in command of Al Qaedas central leadership recently described as accounting for as much as half of his operating revenue.

Kidnapping hostages is an easy spoil, wrote Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which I may describe as a profitable trade and a precious treasure.

The stream of income generated is so significant that internal documents show that as long as five years ago, Al Qaedas central command in Pakistan was overseeing negotiations for hostages grabbed as far afield as Africa. Moreover, the accounts of survivors held thousands of miles apart show that the three main affiliates of the terrorist group  Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, in northern Africa; Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, in Yemen; and the Shabab, in Somalia  are coordinating their efforts and abiding by a common kidnapping protocol.

To minimize the risk to their fighters, the terror affiliates have outsourced the seizing of hostages to criminal groups that work on commission. Negotiators take a reported 10 percent of the ransom, creating an incentive on both sides of the Mediterranean to increase the overall payout, according to former hostages and senior counterterrorism officials.

Their business plan includes a step-by-step process for negotiating, starting with long periods of silence aimed at creating panic back home. Hostages are then shown on videos begging their government to negotiate.

Although the kidnappers threaten to kill their victims, a review of the known cases revealed that only a small percentage of hostages held by Qaeda affiliates have been executed in the past five years, a marked turnaround from a decade ago, when videos showing beheadings of foreigners held by the groups franchise in Iraq would regularly turn up online. Now the group has realized that it can advance the cause of jihad by keeping hostages alive and trading them for prisoners and suitcases of cash.

Only a handful of countries have resisted paying, led by the United States and Britain. Although both of these countries have negotiated with extremist groups  evidenced most recently by the United States trade of Taliban prisoners for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl  they have drawn the line when it comes to ransoms.

It is a decision that has had dire consequences. While dozens of Europeans have been released unharmed, few American or British nationals have gotten out alive. A lucky few ran away or were rescued by special forces. The rest were executed or are being held indefinitely.

The Europeans have a lot to answer for, said Vicki Huddleston, the former United States deputy assistant secretary of defense for African affairs, who was the ambassador to Mali in 2003 when Germany paid the first ransom. Its a completely two-faced policy. They pay ransoms and then deny any was paid. She added, The danger of this is not just that it grows the terrorist movement, but it makes all of our citizens vulnerable.

A Letter Under a Rock

On Feb. 23, 2003, a group of four Swiss tourists, including two 19-year-old women, woke up in their sleeping bags in southern Algeria to the shouts of armed men. The men told the young women to cover their hair with towels, then commandeered their camper van and took off with them.

Over the coming weeks, seven more tour groups traveling in the same corner of the desert vanished. European governments scrambled to find their missing citizens.

Weeks passed before a German reconnaissance plane sent to scan the desert floor returned with images of their abandoned vehicles. More weeks passed before a scout sent on foot spotted something white through his binoculars.

It was a letter left under a rock.

In messy handwriting, it laid out the demands of a little-known jihadist group calling itself the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat.

Armed with a few hunting rifles and old AK-47s, the kidnappers succeeded in sweeping up dozens of tourists over several consecutive weeks, mostly from Germany, but also from Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Though they planned the first few ambushes, they appear to have grabbed others by chance, like a pair of hapless 26-year-olds from Innsbruck, Austria, who were spotted because of the campfire they had lit to cook spaghetti.

The ransom amounts were then adjusted for inflation so that they are in 2014 dollars.

Beyond the initial grab, the kidnappers did not seem to have a plan. The only food they had was the canned goods the tourists had brought with them. The only fuel was what was in each gas tank. They abandoned the cars one by one as they ran out of fuel, forcing their hostages to continue on foot.

A 47-year-old Swedish hostage, Harald Ickler, remembers being so hungry that when he found a few leftover Danish butter cookie crumbs, he carefully scooped them into the palm of his hand and then let them melt in his mouth.

Once they had us, they didnt seem to know what to do with us, said Reto Walther of Untersiggenthal, Switzerland, who was in one of the first groups to be grabbed. They were improvising.

Despite the operations amateur nature, the jihadists had hit a soft spot. Almost none of the hostages had resisted, simply putting up their hands when they saw the gunmen. And although the Europeans outnumbered their captors, the hostages never tried to run away during what turned into a six-month captivity for some of them, and described the foreboding desert surrounding them as an open-air prison.

Crucially, although the European nations had firepower superior to that of the scrappy mujahedeen, they deemed a rescue mission too dangerous.

The jihadists asked for weapons. Then for impossible-to-meet political demands, like the removal of the Algerian government. When a 45-year-old German woman died of dehydration, panicked European officials began considering a ransom concealed as an aid payment as the least-bad option.

The Americans told us over and over not to pay a ransom. And we said to them: We dont want to pay. But we cant lose our people,'  said a European ambassador posted in Algeria at the time, who was one of six senior Western officials with direct knowledge of the 2003 kidnapping who confirmed details for this article. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information remains classified.

It was a very difficult situation, he said, but in the end we are talking about human life.

Not Just Normal Criminals

The exploits of the band of fighters in the Sahara did not go unnoticed.

A year later, in 2004, a Qaeda operative, Abdelaziz al-Muqrin, published a how-to guide to kidnapping, in which he highlighted the successful ransom negotiation of our brothers in Algeria. Yet at the same time, he also praised the execution of Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was grabbed in Pakistan in 2002 and beheaded nine days later by Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a senior Qaeda member believed to be one of the architects of the Sept. 11 attacks.

Within a few years, there was a split within Al Qaeda, with the groups affiliate in Iraq grabbing foreigners specifically to kill them.

In Algeria, the kidnappers of the European tourists followed a different path.

Photo

They used the 5 million, about $6.2 million in todays dollars, as the seed money for their movement, recruiting and training fighters who staged a series of devastating attacks. They grew into a regional force and were accepted as an official branch of the Qaeda network, which baptized them Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. As kidnapping revenue became their main lifeline, they honed and perfected the process.

By Feb. 2, 2011, when their lookouts in southern Algeria spotted a 53-year-old Italian tourist, Mariasandra Mariani, admiring the rolling dunes through a pair of binoculars, they were running a sleek operation.

Her tour guide was the first to spot them, and screamed at her to run. As their cars sped toward her, she sprinted to her nearby desert bungalow and locked herself inside. She could do nothing but sit frozen on the mattress as they broke down the door. They threw her in a waiting car, handcuffing her to the dashboard. Before they sped off, they made sure to place a rolled-up blanket next to her, so that the jihadist sitting next to her would not accidentally make contact with a woman.

Who are you? she asked them.

We are Al Qaeda, they replied.

If previous kidnapping missions did not seem to have a thought-out plan, the gunmen who seized Ms. Mariani drove for days on what appeared to be a clearly delineated route. Whenever they were low on fuel, they would make their way to a spot that to her looked no different in the otherwise identical lunar landscape.

Under a thorn bush, they would find a drum full of gasoline. Or a stack of tires to replace a punctured one. They never ran out of food.

Ms. Mariani would later learn they had an infrastructure of supplies buried in the sand and marked with GPS coordinates.

One afternoon they stopped just above the lip of a dune. The fighters got down and unfastened a shovel. Then she heard the sound of a car engine. Suddenly a pickup truck roared out. They had buried an entire vehicle in the mountain of sand.

It was then that I realized, these arent just normal criminals, Ms. Mariani said.

The Sounds of Silence

Weeks passed before Ms. Marianis captors announced that they were going to allow her to make a phone call. They drove for hours until they reached a plateau, a flat white pan of dirt.

Years earlier, their strategy for broadcasting their demands had been to leave a letter under a rock. Now they had satellite phones and a list of numbers. They handed her a script and dialed the number for Al Jazeera.

My name is Mariasandra Mariani. I am the Italian who was kidnapped, she said. I am still being detained by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.

The Italian government scrambled to create a crisis unit, including a 24-hour hotline for the kidnappers.

During her 14-month captivity, whenever the kidnappers felt that attention had flagged, they erected a tent in the desert and forced Ms. Mariani to record a video message, showing her surrounded by her armed captors.

Eleven former hostages grabbed by Qaeda units in Algeria, Mali, Niger, Syria and Yemen who agreed to be interviewed for this article reported a similar set of steps in the negotiations, beginning with an imposed period of silence. Video messages and telephone calls were infrequent, often months apart. The silence appeared purposeful, intended to terrorize the families of the captives, who in turn pressured their respective governments.

In the Italian village of San Casciano in Val di Pesa, Ms. Marianis 80-year-old mother stopped sleeping in her bedroom, moving permanently to the couch in front of the television. Her aging father would burst into tears for no reason. In France, the frantic brother of a hostage held for a year in Syria developed an ulcer.

All over Europe, families rallied, pressuring governments to pay. Ms. Mariani was ultimately released, along with two Spanish hostages, for a ransom that a negotiator involved in her case said was close to 8 million.

Qaeda Supervision

The bulk of the kidnappings-for-ransom carried out in Al Qaedas name have occurred in Africa, and more recently in Syria and Yemen. These regions are thousands of miles from the terror networks central command in Pakistan.

Yet audio messages released by the group, as well as confidential letters between commanders, indicate that the organizations senior leaders are directly involved in the negotiations.

As early as 2008, a commander holding two Canadian diplomats angered his leaders by negotiating a ransom on his own.

In a letter discovered by this reporter in buildings abandoned by the jihadists in Mali last year, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb blamed the commander, Mokhtar Belmokhtar, for securing only the meager sum of 700,000  around $1 million  saying the low amount was a result of his unwillingness to follow the instructions of the groups leadership in Pakistan.

In his last broadcast before his death in 2011, Osama bin Laden spoke at length about the case of four French citizens held by Al Qaeda in Mali, making clear that he was keeping close tabs on individual kidnappings.

Hostages held as recently as last year in Yemen say it was clear the negotiations were being handled by a distant leadership.

Weve all heard the argument that philosophy is isolated, an ivory tower discipline cut off from virtually every other progress-making pursuit of knowledge, including math and the sciences, as well as from the actual concerns of daily life. The reasons given for this are many. In a widely read essay in this series, When Philosophy Lost Its Way, Robert Frodeman and Adam Briggle claim that it was philosophys institutionalization in the university in the late 19th century that separated it from the study of humanity and nature, now the province of social and natural sciences.

This institutionalization, the authors claim, led it to betray its central aim of articulating the knowledge needed to live virtuous and rewarding lives. I have a different view: Philosophy isnt separated from the social, natural or mathematical sciences, nor is it neglecting the study of goodness, justice and virtue, which was never its central aim.

The idea that philosophy was and still is isolated from other disciplines ignores much of its history.

The authors claim that philosophy abandoned its relationship to other disciplines by creating its own purified domain, accessible only to credentialed professionals. It is true that from roughly 1930 to 1950, some philosophers  logical empiricists, in particular  did speak of philosophy having its own exclusive subject matter. But since that subject matter was logical analysis aimed at unifying all of science, interdisciplinarity was front and center.

This was followed (in Britain) by two decades in which leading philosophers identified philosophy with informal linguistic analysis. Fortunately, this narrow view didnt stop them from contributing to the science of language and the study of law. Now long gone, neither movement defined the philosophy of its day and neither arose from locating it in universities.

The idea that philosophy was and still is isolated from other disciplines ignores much of its history. From 1879 to 1936 the philosopher-mathematicians Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, Kurt Godel, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing invented symbolic logic, helped establish the set-theoretic foundations of mathematics, and gave us the formal theory of computation that ushered in the digital age.

In the field of linguistics, from roughly 1945 to 1975, the philosophers Rudolf Carnap, Saul Kripke, Richard Montague and David Kaplan developed ideas relating logic to linguistic meaning that provided a framework for studying meaning in all human languages. Others, including Paul Grice and J.L. Austin, explained how linguistic meaning mixes with contextual information to enrich communicative contents and how certain linguistic performances change social facts. Today a new philosophical conception of the relationship between meaning and cognition adds a further dimension to linguistic science.

Decision theory  the science of rational norms governing action, belief and decision under uncertainty  was developed by the 20th-century philosophers Frank Ramsey, Rudolph Carnap, Richard Jeffrey and others. It plays a foundational role in political science and economics by telling us what rationality requires, given our evidence, priorities and the strength of our beliefs. Today, no area of philosophy is more successful in attracting top young minds.

Far from fostering isolation, specialization in philosophy makes communication and cooperation among disciplines possible. This has always been so.

Philosophy also assisted psychology in its long march away from narrow behaviorism and speculative Freudianism. The mid-20th-century functionalist perspective pioneered by Hilary Putnam was particularly important. According to it, pain, pleasure and belief are neither behavioral dispositions nor bare neurological states. They are interacting internal causes, capable of very different physical realizations, that serve the goals of individuals in specific ways. This view is now embedded in cognitive psychology and neuroscience.

Philosophy also played a role in 20th-century physics, influencing the great physicists Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. The philosophers Moritz Schlick and Hans Reichenbach reciprocated that interest by assimilating the new physics into their philosophies. Today, leading philosophers  including David Albert, Hans Halvorson, Laura Ruetsche, Hilary Greaves and David Wallace  explain quantum physics to outsiders, while conceptualizing issues in ways physicists find useful. Philosophy of biology is following a similar path. Todays philosophy of science is less accessible than Aristotles natural philosophy chiefly because it systematizes a larger, more technically sophisticated body of knowledge.

Philosophys interaction with mathematics, linguistics, economics, political science, psychology and physics requires specialization. Far from fostering isolation, this specialization makes communication and cooperation among disciplines possible. This has always been so. William of Ockham, Descartes, Leibniz and Kant were heavily informed by the science and mathematics of their day. Locke and Hume responded to Newton not with envy and a sense of inferiority (which Frodeman and Briggle wrongly attribute to philosophers responding to 20th-century science), but with a desire to apply Newtons lessons to their natural philosophies of mind, which were then psychology-in-the-making.

Nor did scientific progress rob philosophy of its former scientific subject matter, leaving it to concentrate on the broadly moral. In fact, philosophy thrives when enough is known to make progress conceivable, but it remains unachieved because of methodological confusion. Philosophy helps break the impasse by articulating new questions, posing possible solutions and forging new conceptual tools. Sometimes it does so when sciences are born, as with 17th-century physics and 19th-century biology. But it also does so as they mature. As science advances, there is more, not less, for it to do.

Our knowledge of the universe and ourselves expands like a ripple surrounding a pebble dropped in a pool. As we move away from the center of the spreading circle, its area, representing our secure knowledge, grows. But so does its circumference, representing the border where knowledge blurs into uncertainty and speculation, and methodological confusion returns. Philosophy patrols the border, trying to understand how we got there and to conceptualize our next move. Its job is unending.

Although progress in ethics, political philosophy and the illumination of lifes meaning has been less impressive than advances in some other areas, it is accelerating. After an erosion of faith in ethical theory in the first third of the 20th century, and calls for its abolition in the middle third, John Rawls and Robert Nozick revived theories of justice in the early 1970s. Comprehensive ethical theories, including Thomas Scanlons and Stephen Darwalls, have also reappeared. Even discussions of death and the meaning of life have returned, led by Thomas Nagel, Samuel Scheffler, Shelly Kagan, Susan Wolf and others. As my colleague Jake Ross observes, the advances in our understanding because of careful formulation and critical evaluation of theories of goodness, rightness, justice and human flourishing by philosophers since 1970 compare well to the advances made by philosophers from Aristotle to 1970.

The knowledge required to maintain philosophys continuing task, including its vital connection to other disciplines, is too vast to be held in one mind. Despite the often-repeated idea that philosophys true calling can only be fulfilled in the public square, philosophers actually function best in universities, where they acquire and share knowledge with their colleagues in other disciplines. It is also vital for philosophers to engage students  both those who major in the subject, and those who do not. Although philosophy has never had a mass audience, it remains remarkably accessible to the average student; unlike the natural sciences, its frontiers can be reached in a few undergraduate courses.

Far from being years of enduring failure, the last 150 years have been philosophys best.

nytimes.com,2016-02-26 00:00:00,Bruni and Douthat Agree: #OscarsSoPolitical,"['The End', 'Frank Bruni', 'The Conversation', 'Ross Douthat', 'The Great Divide', 'Errol Morris', 'All Contributors']","ROSS DOUTHAT: Frank, its a pleasure to once again be together to talk about the glorious silliness of the Oscars, and a special pleasure to engage in some prognostication that doesnt involve the outcome of either presidential primary. (It wont be Trump it wont be Trump la la la la la la I cant heaaar you.)

FRANK BRUNI: The prognostication, as you put it, may not involve Donald Trump, but before the Oscar ceremony is over, it will involve him  somehow, some way. Hes shown a knack for hijacking every news cycle, every conversation. Maybe he goes on the attack against the statuette, says its too little, a loser, low energy. He promises not only to make America great again, but to upsize Oscar and make it gleam again.

DOUTHAT: In our own quest for greatness, lets start at the bottom, with the lowest form of Hollywood life  our fellow writers. The Oscar for best original screenplay seems guaranteed to go to Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer for Spotlight. Thats a worthy enough choice.

BRUNI: I agree that it will win, and I agree that its worthy.

DOUTHAT: But if I had a vote, I would give it to Alex Garland for Ex Machina  a knotty, twisty little dose of sci-fi/war-between-the-sexes poison thats more genuinely original than its competition. (To dip a toe into troubled #OscarsSoWhite waters, Ryan Cooglers Creed probably deserved a nomination in this category more than Straight Outta Compton, whose spine was very biopic-conventional, notwithstanding its convention-smashing subjects.)

BRUNI: The winner should be Inside Out, for the sheer audacity of its imagination. It turns the human psyche into animation and makes observations about the delicate balance of the human ecosystem that graver, more somber movies havent managed half as well. Im hoping for a sequel focused exclusively on Trumps emotional ecosystem. Rated R and titled The Id of the Deal, it would play only in Imax-3D and never be dubbed or subtitled in Spanish.

DOUTHAT: In best adapted screenplay, Id bet on Charles Randolph and Adam McKay for The Big Short, which does an interesting job of translating Michael Lewiss complicated story to the screen. Interesting, but to my mind a little smug and showy, which is why Im rooting for the more modest but also nearly flawless Brooklyn. Yes, its hard to explain mortgage-backed securities in a screenplay, but adapting a Colm Toibin novel strikes me as a harder task over all than adapting Lewiss movie-friendly prose, and I think the (very un-Toibin like) Nick Hornby aced it.

BRUNI: Im glad you mentioned Nick Hornby because I think hes emerged as one of the nimblest, most assured screenwriters working today and because Brooklyn, interestingly, marks the third time in a short span that hes been the deft teller of a woman-centric story. He adapted the memoir Wild and, before that, An Education. All three screenplays reflect a brisk, unpretentious style. Hes efficient in the best possible way.

But Id give best adapted screenplay to the movie that I, like you, predict as the winner: The Big Short. You say that Lewiss prose is movie-friendly, and its certainly terrific prose, but Im struck by the way that his books had to be sliced, distilled and reconfigured very aggressively to become movies. Thats true not just of The Big Short but also of Moneyball (my favorite of these adaptations ) and even The Blind Side, which in book form was as much about the peculiarities of modern football as it was about the Southern-fried pluck of a woman later played by La Bullock gone blond.

Can we move to people much more interesting than writers? (That could include anyone, really  film editors, sound technicians, you name it.) Lets talk about best supporting actress and the absurdity of this years nominees. Rooney Mara (Carol) is a lead. Alicia Vikander (The Danish Girl) is a lead. Kate Winslet, a superb actress, has a now-you-hear-it, now-you-dont Polish accent in Steve Jobs. Rachel McAdams barely has a character to play in Spotlight. You mentioned Brooklyn, and Id vote for the spirited, perfect performance that Julie Walters gave in that movie, but she wasnt nominated. So Ill root for Jennifer Jason Leigh in The Hateful Eight, though I think Vikander will win, partly for her astonishing work in Ex Machina.

DOUTHAT: I, too, expect Vikander to win for supporting Eddie Redmaynes Bruce Jenner  er, sorry, Einar Wegener in the transition into womanhood. And if we can count it as a twofer for The Danish Girl and Ex Machina, I suppose we can pretend that its deserved. But the fact that Vikander was nominated for the mediocre period-transgender drama and not the great little sci-fi part is a good example of what drives so much discontent with the Oscars  some of the racial discontent included.

Sonny Bunch had a good piece about this recently for The Washington Post, in which he cited Redmayne  an almost-automatic winner as Stephen Hawking last year, an automatic nominee as a sex-change pioneer this year  as a case study in how so many Oscar nominees just feel, well, engineered, to the point where you can guess who will be nominated for a supposedly merit-based award without having seen a second of that persons performance.

As Bunch notes, this squeezes out all sorts of interesting performances and movies (including many that his fellow conservatives, and mine, tend to favor). But for black actors, specifically, it means that Oscar glory can be theirs (and often is) only so long as theyre making a Very Serious Movie thats somehow about their race  and more ideally, about slavery, or Jim Crow, or both.

BRUNI: Im going to give you a pass on that unnecessary Jenner joke because I think you make some excellent points about the academys attitude toward performances by black actors. But the academy is a small part of a larger problem, which is that were still not seeing black actors nearly often enough in meaty roles that could be played by performers of any race. Denzel Washington has been cast in a few of those, but who else? I think the Internet buzzed with so much excitement about the suggestion of Idris Elba as the next James Bond because theres an ever more widespread recognition that Bond and Bond-style parts neednt always go to white actors. A Clancy protagonist, a Bourne analogue or an Indiana Jones could (and occasionally should) be played by a black actor. And the same goes for black women, who rarely get the sorts of roles reserved for the Bullocks, Anistons and Witherspoons of the movie world. #OscarsSoWhite because #BigPartsSoWhite.

Oscar Favorites vs. Predictions Should win Key: Will win Frank Bruni Ross Douthat Ex Machina Inside Out WRITING (ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY) Spotlight Spotlight Brooklyn The Big Short WRITING (ADAPTED SCREENPLAY) The Big Short The Big Short Alicia Vikander, Ex Machina (not nominated) Jennifer Jason Leigh, The Hateful Eight SUPPORTING ACTRESS Alicia Vikander, The Danish Girl Alicia Vikander, The Danish Girl Tom Hardy, The Revenant Mark Rylance, Bridge of Spies SUPPORTING ACTOR Mark Rylance, Bridge of Spies Sylvester Stallone, Creed Matt Damon, The Martian Matt Damon, The Martian LEAD ACTOR Leonardo DiCaprio, The Revenant Leonardo DiCaprio, The Revenant Brie Larson, Room Brie Larson, Room LEAD ACTRESS Brie Larson, Room Brie Larson, Room George Miller, Mad Max: Fury Road Adam McKay, The Big Short DIRECTING Alejandro G. Inarritu, The Revenant George Miller, Mad Max: Fury Road Room and Mad Max: Fury Road (tie) Spotlight BEST PICTURE The Big Short The Big Short

DOUTHAT: I agree, and I think thats a big part of why it frustrated so many people that Michael B. Jordan didnt get nominated for Creed, or Elba for Beasts of No Nation. Here were actors in movies  one of them a big hit  that were about black people as people, good or bad, not just as martyrs under white oppression, and the academy apparently didnt have time for them.

Anyway, onward to best supporting actor, where Creed has its one nominee  Sylvester Stallone, an underrated actor, and the betting favorite. Im not going to bet on him, though, because I suspect the controversy will make voters wary of rewarding the white star of a movie whose African-American lead and director were snubbed.

BRUNI: I think youre wrong about Stallone, and hell get the statuette because Oscar voters sentimentalism will prevail.

DOUTHAT: Maybe! But Ill bet on Mark Rylance, the oddsmakers second choice, even though (confession!) Bridge of Spies looked like a Spielbergian snooze, and I havent even seen it. And then my pick for the rightful winner is Tom Hardy in The Revenant.

BRUNI: I did see Rylance in Bridge of Spies, which had a great first half and a ho-hum second half, and in my opinion hes the rightful winner, not Hardy, who, in The Revenant, gives a performance like those he did in The Drop (which was terrific and underrated) and Warrior (which is even more terrific and underrated). Its technically and formally dazzling, but its also mannered and somewhat inaccessible.

Lets take a short break from the acting awards and look at best director. Some Oscar pundits are persuaded that George Miller will win for Mad Max: Fury Road, in what would be a combined recognition of career achievement and the difficulty of choreographing action sequences this busy. Others predict a second trophy in a row for Alejandro G. Inarritu, for The Revenant, while there are still others who believe Tom McCarthy (Spotlight) will take home the prize.

DOUTHAT: Now that the Oscars allow more than five nominations for best picture, you can usually use best director snubs to figure out which best picture nominees dont have a chance  which is bad news for The Martian, Brooklyn and Bridge of Spies. (I liked The Martian less than most people, for reasons we kicked around last fall, but I did think highly of Scotts work.) And then, of course, the actual winner of the best director statue is usually a big, fat indicator of which movie will actually take home the biggest prize.

In this case, though, it wouldnt be a complete surprise if the two awards diverged, because giving the ancient Miller the statue for his insane and insanely impressive choreography in Fury Road would be a good way to garland that movie without stooping (as academy voters might think of it) to giving a post-apocalyptic chase movie best picture.

BRUNI: I remain stunned that Ridley Scott wasnt nominated for The Martian, which is some of the best work hes ever done, and without him in the category, I cast my personal vote for Adam McKay, who contrived the right tempo, tone and camera angles to turn arcane financial shenanigans into populist comedy and drama in The Big Short. My best guess, though, is that Miller notches this victory.

DOUTHAT: As I say I wouldnt be surprised if Miller won, and I hope he will, since I think Oscars should go whenever possible to filmmakers who show us something extraordinary, unexpected, new. But the safe money is still on Inarritu, because The Revenant has a clearer shot at best picture and because (like most of his films) its directed within an inch of its life, with all kinds of complicated set pieces and unexpected camera angles. For better or worse, you can always feel him working, even sweating, to set up every shot  and I suspect that sweat will be rewarded.

Which brings us to best actor, where Inarritus star, Leonardo DiCaprio, is about to follow in the footsteps of his frequent mentor, Martin Scorsese, and finally win an Oscar for a role that isnt even close to his best work (or the best work in the movie, where hes overshadowed by Hardy). Its not the most impressive roster of nominees, so his winning doesnt bother me that much, but its still a little disappointing to see Leo finally rewarded for yet another entry in his grunting, scowling, (in this case) bearded attempts to bury his boy-wonder good looks and prove that hes a Grown-Up Actor. When the reality is that while hes ... fine in these kind of roles, his greatness lies elsewhere, in movies like Catch Me If You Can, The Great Gatsby and The Wolf of Wall Street, where he plays the charming man-child to the hilt.

BRUNI: I think this naysaying about DiCaprio has gone too far. Is The Revenant the pinnacle of his career and of the best actor category this year? Probably not. A little grunting in the snow and grimacing in a shallow grave go a long way. I was exhausted and exasperated by him and the movie in the end.

Still, when he wins this Oscar  which he will  Ill be fine with that, though Id actually prefer, and vote for, Matt Damon. Its so easy to be impressed by showy suffering like DiCaprios, but what Damon does in those many scenes in The Martian when hes creating a video diary from Mars  and talking directly to the camera  is arguably trickier. How to make it persuasive, natural? How to weave that comic touch into a desperate situation? Hes tonally perfect and preternaturally engaging. The movie not only depends on him, it works as well as it does because of him.

DOUTHAT: Id probably vote for Matt Damon, too, since he had to sell that story almost single-handedly. But if you want the Oscar, it seems, you need to grow a beard and fight a bear.

BRUNI: I dont know about that. Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin spent nearly an entire movie  much longer than the one (incredible) sequence in The Revenant  fleeing and fighting a bear in The Edge, and they didnt even get nominations. But maybe thats because they grow their beards only as the movie proceeds and as their time in the wilderness lengthens. Its some hairy-come-lately disqualification.

The best actress category this year includes three performances that are magnificent and deserving of Oscars: Cate Blanchett in Carol, Saoirse Ronan in Brooklyn and Brie Larson in Room. You and I havent talked previously about Carol, which had a few glaring and puzzling flaws, chief among them the inscrutability of Maras thinly drawn character. But Carol was, for me, immensely moving. It avoided the issue-movie trap of sententiousness while communicating the sadness and injustice of a bigoted culture standing in the way of two womens happiness. And it had a stirring romantic spirit that so many other movies labor and fail to achieve.

DOUTHAT: If the best actor crop seemed thin to me, the best actress field is incredibly rich. I share your take on the quality of Blanchetts and Ronans work.

BRUNI: But Blanchett will rightly lose to Larson, who has been given the meatiest role in this category and takes full, harrowing advantage of it.

Photo

DOUTHAT: I also really enjoyed Jennifer Lawrence in the unjustly underrated Joy  that was a star-quality turn, whatever you thought of the story that surrounded it. And I rather wish that Charlize Theron had been nominated for carrying Mad Max and putting every other lady action hero in her shade.

But in the end I agree: It has to be Larson, who gave the rawest performance of the year in its darkest fairy tale.

And Theron and Larson together provide a pivot to the final prize, best picture, because their movies were this years yin and yang for me  Therons big and wild and better than just about every other overhyped blockbuster put together, Larsons claustrophobic and intimate and shot through with terrible emotion. Neither one is likely to win the Oscar: The race, everyone seems to agree, is between The Revenant, The Big Short and Spotlight.

BRUNI: This is a fascinating year in terms of the mixed signals sent over the pre-Oscar period. The Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture (Drama) went to The Revenant. But the Screen Actors Guild gave the equivalent of its best picture award to Spotlight. The Producers Guild went for The Big Short.

I think the race is really between Spotlight and The Big Short, because The Revenant would be a second-year-in-a-row win for a movie directed by Inarritu, and its just not good enough for that. Plus Spotlight and The Big Short both do two things Oscar voters love: They employ lots of actors in talky, meaty parts, and they appeal to Hollywoods liberal moral vanity. Spotlight does this by justly flogging the Catholic Church, and the fact that the movie was recently screened at the Vatican could give it the decisive edge over The Big Short.

DOUTHAT: Ill go out on a limb and predict that The Big Short will steal it, in a directing/best picture split.

BRUNI: I am so angry at you, Ross. I am livid! Because I was waiting to shock our readers with my own pick of The Big Short to win best picture, and now youve stolen my thunder. Bad Ross!

DOUTHAT: Well, if I had my way it would be a dead heat, a shared statue, for Room and Mad Max: Fury Road. No matter who wins, thats the pair that Ill remember.

BRUNI: Im as much a fan of Room as you are, but if I had my way, the statue would go to Spotlight, just because it fires so perfectly on all cylinders: storytelling, acting, worthy subject matter. But Im sticking with The Big Short as my prediction. Income inequality and Wall Street shenanigans are issues much more of this exact moment than is sexual abuse in the church; you could argue that The Big Short is a companion piece to Bernie Sanderss populist uprising. Never mind that The Big Short turns the very financial speculators who profited from other peoples lost homes into underdog heroes  nifty trick, that! It concludes on a shaming note, with sweeping observations about the ways in which the stock market and the banking system are corrupt and rigged, eventually victimizing middle-class Americans. I think right now, in the midst of an intensifying presidential campaign, Hollywood voters will find that message as irresistible as New Hampshire and South Carolina voters found Trump. There you go, Ross. One more, last mention of your political hero.

DOUTHAT: Thanks for nothing, Frank.

BRUNI: Youre welcome.",[]

The Democratic Presidential Race

1. I am so disappointed in the Sanders supporters. All votes matter. Black votes, Latino votes, White votes, Southern votes. Older voters. Mrs. Clinton is winning the popular votes. The delegates votes. And yet the Sanders supporters sneer at these votes, and almost in a racist and patronizing way suggest these voters do [not] know what is good for them. Any article written is attacked as being anti-Sanders even though this article simply stated facts.

Should we get rid of the black votes, Southern votes and anyone who dares not to vote for Sanders? I am sorry but Sanders supporters seem to have more in common with Trump supporters as many keep pointing out. No grace in defeat.

2. Frankly, Donald Trump is going to put an end to the Republican Party and Hillary Clinton is going to put an end to the Democratic Party. The working class and the middle class are not going to take the wholly owned candidate of the oligarchs dished out by the party machines any more. Bernie Sanders has made it safe to espouse socialism in America again and that is going to make a big difference.

FDR staved off socialism in the 1930s with the New Deal; it is not going to happen again. This time Bernie Sanders and the Greens are going to build a new coalition that is going to change the landscape of politics in this country.

 Richard wrote in response to NS in Virginias comment.

3. What I find missing in so many of the articles regarding the Trump candidacy is the failure to acknowledge the egregious lack of qualifications in the major Republican alternatives to the Donald. Rubio is massively inexperienced, overly ambitious (even for a politician...), and severely lacking in leadership characteristics, while Cruz is at best a very dangerous man who so far resembles Nixon more than anyone else (though without the redeeming qualities of the latter...). The other candidates still standing are hardly worth discussing at this point. The result? The pathway (or lane in current parlance) was left wide open for someone like Trump.

4. I will vote for a man who stands on his own abilities...smart, principled and determined. Yes, there are details missing, as there always are. Yes, there are contradictions, as there always are. Yes, there are assailants (Mitt, et al), as there always are. None of this concerns me  or Mr. Trump. Mrs. Clinton will do her best to look like a strong female alternative, and Mr. Trump will do what he does best  tell it like it is. Ive had too many years of what politicians tell me it looks like. I want to hear it  know it  for what it actually is.

They are the Captains of the boat in the operating room. ONE person needs to be in charge, needs a huge ego in making immediate life and death decisions. They are horrible in committees and at compromise ...

Testing for Joy and Grit

6. When I was in school, oh so many years ago, there were clear behavioral expectations both at home and school. I dont remember anyone being too concerned about how I felt. No one was constantly praising me, encouraging me, or propping me up. My parents saw my brother and me as a part of the family, not the center of their world (which was how all the families I knew operated). I dont remember disruptions in the classroom, other than occasionally passing notes or whispering to a friend seated at a nearby desk. We didnt get rewards for doing what we were supposed to do, but we knew wed feel the consequences of not doing it.

 Debra Jay in Grosse Point, Mich., wrote in response to an article detailing a nationwide push to measure students emotional skills.

7. What a terrible idea.

There are a lot of introverts in the world, bullying us into pretending to be extroverts is a disgusting habit of the extroverts, who think that everyone should act like them.

Judging a person for wanting to stay quietly in the corner is a horrible way to treat children.

Whether its Jewish men demanding that their personal religious views take precedence over the right of women airline passengers to enjoy their flights in peace, or Christian men in legislatures and courts demanding that their personal religious views take precedence over the right of women in their childbearing years to control their own bodies, or Islamic men demanding that their personal religious views take precedence over the right of their wives and daughters to shake hands with male business acquaintances, or men in a hundred other religions demanding that their personal religious views be given precedence in order to oppress women in a thousand other ways, its all the same: Oppression of women masquerading as religious piety, and always demanding that the world accommodate and enable the oppression.

9. Imagine if ISIS or some other terrorist group (or illegal immigrants) was poisoning our water supply throughout the country. We would be moving heaven and earth to fight that threat. However, it seems as if years of underfunding of our infrastructure and the fact that this more heavily affects the poor has made us as a nation oblivious to the enormous human and financial cost today and in the future. When we have spent the last 36 years demonizing government and cutting at every opportunity, we should not be surprised that the chickens are coming home to roost on this vital issue.

10. And what to do with the millions of poorly educated immigrants who arrive here? Set them to work with all those manufacturing jobs that have left the country? There is a point when idealistic humanitarian instincts become just plain suicidal, especially when that agenda is pushed by people who wont live in areas inhabited by the hordes of immigrants (initially) and who expect somebody else to take care of the problem. And, above all, who essentially are advocating making life even worse for the millions upon millions of poverty stricken people already in our country.

In December 2008, The New York Times Magazine reported on the emerging science of genopolitics.

For years, Emily Biuso wrote,

scholars have assumed that a voter pulls the lever because she grew up in a voting household or perhaps sat through a lot of civics classes. But this year two political scientists published studies claiming that in addition to environment, genes may be a primary influence on political engagement.

Biuso was among the first to talk about what has become a bitter dispute within the study of politics, a dispute in which the stakes are high and the potential consequences significant.



On one side of the debate are those like James Fowler, a professor of medical genetics and political science at the University of California, San Diego, and Darren Schreiber, a political scientist at U.C.L.A who point out, in a 2008 article in Science, that

In the past 50 years, biologists have learned a tremendous amount about human biology and its genetic basis. At the same time, political scientists have been intensively studying the effect of the social and institutional environment on political attitudes and behaviors. However, biologists and political scientists have been working largely in isolation of one another. Little cross-disciplinary work has been done.

The authors go on to argue:

This must change for two important reasons. First, recent evidence is making it increasingly clear that genetic variation plays an important role in explaining variation in human political behavior. Second, additional evidence in neuroscience indicates that the human brain may be adapted particularly to solve social problems that are explicitly political. Much of this evidence is associational, and we therefore should be cautious in using it to build causal theories. However, if the need for sophisticated social cognition drove the evolution of the human brain then a new science of human nature will require comprehending human biology in a sociopolitical context.

Representing the other side of the debate are Evan Charney at Duke and William English at Harvard, who contend that genopolitical analyses produce absurdly high estimates of heritability of behavior.

In an e-mail, Charney wrote:

Genopolitics, uninformed by some of the most important developments in molecular genetics and evolutionary biology over the past fifty years, is the modern day equivalent of phrenology.

Working somewhere between the two extremes are political scientists who are engaged in innovative, if more traditional, research. In the spirit of inquiry, I e-mailed a few more mainstream professors of government to get their opinion about this new line of scholarship.

Alan Abramowitz of Emory responded cautiously:

Im sure genetics is a factor in shaping our political and social views but I think that its very difficult to separate the influence of genes from that of the family, the community and the social environment in general.

Gary Jacobson, of the University of California, San Diego, wrote in an e-mail:

These are serious, competent, careful researchers, and they are engaged in a valid research enterprise. The evidence that there is a genetic influence on some attitudes and behaviors seems quite strong.

Peter K. Hatemi, a professor of political science, microbiology and biochemistry at Penn State, is a leader in the field of genopolitics. Writing with 16 colleagues in a forthcoming paper, Hatemi summarizes results from analyses of a combined sample of over 12,000 twins pairs, ascertained from nine different studies conducted in five Western democracies (Australia, Hungary, Denmark, Sweden, and the U.S.A.), sampled over the course of four decades:

We provide definitive evidence that heritability plays a role in the formation of political ideology, regardless of how ideology is measured, the time period or population sampled.

In a carefully worded conclusion, Hatemi and his collaborators make it clear that their findings should not be over-interpreted or used to draw causal linkages.

The findings suggest that while genes undoubtedly matter in the aggregate development of political attitudes, individual common variants will have small effects on ideology. Hunting for a single political gene is a fruitless endeavor, and we make no such attempt here. Rather, by attempting to identify the countless specific genetic variants of small effects, related to ideology, we hope to uncover and unite larger neurobiological pathways which account for a substantial portion of how ideologies are formed and maintained in a world where both genes and environment interact and remain in continuous dialogue to guide human behavior.

Some of the outcomes of genopolitical research are intriguing. Late last year Hatemi and Rose McDermott of Brown University published The Genetics of Politics: Discovery, Challenges and Progress. Their paper includes a chart  Summary of relative genetic and environmental influences on political traits, reproduced here in Figure 1  which is based on findings from all reported twin and kinship studies which provided estimates of genetic and environmental influences on political traits from 1974-2012. The chart illustrates the authors estimate of the relative proportion of genetic (purple) and environmental (green) influences, and the level of combined (brown) genetic and environmental influences.

How much does the question of whether our political leanings might be underpinned by our biology really matter?

In an e-mail to The Times, John Alford of Rice and John Hibbing of the University of Nebraska make the argument that genetically inherited political predispositions are reinforcing contemporary polarization between Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives.

Fissures in the polity now match divisions in peoples biology, Alford and Hibbing write, noting that the shift

from New Deal economic issues to race, sex, and cultural issues means many central political divisions in society follow the differences in peoples biologically based predispositions.

Alford and Hibbing argue that

it is not so much that people are becoming more in tune with their genetics as that the nature of modern American politics, with ideologically based news outlets and open discussion of hot button social issues, now is free to reflect bedrock divisions. Fissures in the polity now match divisions in peoples biology.

Hatemi and McDermott, working with Lindon Eaves of the departments of human genetics and psychiatry at Virginia Commonwealth, see a substantially greater degree of complexity. In their 2012 paper, Its the End of Ideology as We Know It, they write:

Typically scholars, politicians and the media identify a cluster of attitudes that combine opposition to such issues as gay rights and abortion. It is also assumed that these positions accompany opposition to logically unrelated topics such as immigration and taxation and relative support for capital punishment and military strength. Together, these attitudes help constitute a conservative ideology. However, it seems that genes may have other ideas. It appears that individuals who are genetically inclined toward attitudes typically considered liberal on matters of sexual behavior and reproduction tend, if anything, toward attitudes understood to be more conservative in relation to a broad range of other issues including the draft, capital punishment, taxation, immigration and segregation.

While genopolitics is in its infancy, proponents have succeeded in getting articles published in highly respected, peer-reviewed journals including the American Journal of Political Science, Science, Political Behavior and the Journal of Theoretical Politics. At least five journals have devoted entire issues to the subject.

Much of the debate over the legitimacy of genopolitics has been conducted in the pages of the American Political Science Review, which as early as 2005 published one of the first articles on the subject: Are Political Orientations Genetically Transmitted? by Alford, Hibbing and Carolyn L. Funk of Virginia Commonwealth University.

In seeking to answer questions regarding the balance of environmental versus gene-based influences, a bit of eye-glazing prose is in order. The 2005 Alford-Hibbing-Funk paper used twin studies to estimate the heritability of political traits. They describe their methodology as follows:

MZ twins develop from a single egg, fertilized by a single sperm, and share an identical genetic inheritance. DZ twins develop from two separate eggs, fertilized by two separate sperm, and are in effect simply two siblings that happen to be born simultaneously. As such, DZ twins share the same average of 50% of genetic material as do any two biological siblings. It is this fixed ratio (two to one) of genetic similarity between MZ and DZ twins, and the contrasting average equivalence of environment influence, that provides most of the power of twin designs.

The American Psychological Association separately describes twin studies in more user-friendly language:

The classical twin study design relies on studying twins raised in the same family environments. Monozygotic (identical) twins share all of their genes, while dizygotic (fraternal) twins share only about 50 percent of them. So, if a researcher compares the similarity between sets of identical twins to the similarity between sets of fraternal twins for a particular trait, then any excess likeness between the identical twins should be due to genes rather than environment.

Twin studies notwithstanding, biologically underpinned approaches to the study of politics are hardly going unchallenged. Charney and English published a major critique of genopolitics, Candidate Genes and Political Behavior, in the February 2012 issue of the American Political Science Review. In an e-mail, Charney listed some of the weaknesses he sees in this particular experimental arena. First, he writes:

The high heritability of political traits found in twin studies are disputed by a new analytic technique  genome wide complex trait analysis (G.C.T.A.)  which derives heritability estimates by utilizing scans of large sections of the genomes of thousands of unrelated persons. When the G.C.T.A.-based estimates and twin studies are compared, the G.C.T.A. estimates are consistently lower and in many cases statistically insignificant.

Charney goes on to argue:

It is not our claim that genes do not affect behavior. Of course they do. It is, rather, that there are not genes, whether one gene or 10,000, that predispose to being a 21st century American liberal or conservative, or to voting in an American political election, and that these behaviors are not heritable. A gene (whether 1 or 10,000) can only play a causal role because the environment  cells, tissues, organisms  uses genes to create proteins and ranks (which are then used to create more cells, tissues, and organisms). DNA is one resource among others used by cells. Development is not the running of a preexisting genetic program.

Hatemi, one of the objects of Charneys criticism, is aware of the issues English and Charney raise, and continues to wrestle with them. In his e-mail to me, Hatemi wrote:

We know genes and experience continually interact, and they do not operate independently of our social world. Parenting style, resources, education, friends, weather, and all the things we experience growing up, or in adulthood, have a phenomenal role in why we differ. But everyone reacts slightly different even to the most extreme experiences, and this difference in reaction is partly due to our differences in DNA, partly to how we grew up and partly to our experiences in adult life and the infinite interactions between those forces. The problem is science is never that nuanced, and we pretty much have caveman tools to explain a phenomenally complex process, so we use statistics that result in point estimates, knowing the real world is much more complex.

Jacobson of the University of California, who believes that the work of Hatemi, McDermott, Fowler, Alford, Hibbing and others is producing valid results, poses the key question:

What we do with this knowledge is another matter. How do we look at public opinion differently knowing that some of what we measure has a genetic basis? I am not sure what the answer is.

If genopolitical analysis holds up under continued scrutiny, its explanatory potential is enormous. Not only can the field add to the understanding of polarization and the sources of conflicts that have now shut down the federal government, but analyses like these might also shed light on the logic of, say, supporting abortion rights while opposing the death penalty, or opposing food stamps giveaways while supporting subsidies to agribusiness.

With so much riding on political outcomes  from default on the national debt to an attack on Syria to attitudes toward climate change  understanding key factors contributing to the thinking of elected officials and voters becomes crucial. Every avenue for understanding human behavior should be on the table: How do we evaluate our goals? How should we judge trade offs? And just how do we actually make decisions?",[]

FRANK BRUNI: Its that time of year, Ross: Conservatives grieve the death of Christmas, liberals rue the commercialization of all holidays and the director David O. Russell and the megastars Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper storm Americas multiplexes with a movie timed for awards-season glory. Three years ago it was Silver Linings Playbook. Two years ago, American Hustle.

This year they seek to sweep up Oscar nominations with a mop  literally. And you and I bring our readers tidings of Joy.

ROSS DOUTHAT: A Merry Christmas movie season to you as well, Frank! So what did you make of the latest Russell-Lawrence-Cooper (though mainly Russell and Lawrence, this time) paean to eccentric Northeastern white ethnics?

BRUNI: Joy struck me as something of a dare that Russell issued to himself: Are my skills so potent and my leading ladys charms so prodigious that the two of us can win audiences over with a two-hours-plus biopic about a better way to clean the kitchen floor?

Of course Joy isnt really about that. In telling the tale, loosely rooted in real events, of Joy Mangano, who invented the self-wringing Miracle Mop, it means to accomplish a whole lot else. Its a parable of pluck. Its a meditation on the overburdened, underappreciated roles that so many women have played in their families and the quickness with which the men around them belittled their dreams.

DOUTHAT: Its a movie that reminded me in certain ways of the Diane Keaton vehicle Baby Boom  one of the first grown-up movies I remember seeing in the theaters, way back in 1987, which also gave us the mom-as-entrepreneur, peddling a product (baby food then, the self-wringing mop now) that promises the partial relief of the maternal estate.

BRUNI: Its also an oddly paced mess. In its frenetic first act, its constantly missing its screwball-comedy marks. But I think its relationship to the current political moment is fascinating.

Although its set more than a quarter century ago, around the birth of the QVC cable TV channel (where Coopers character works), its preoccupations are entirely of-the-moment: the way the economic deck is stacked against the little guy (or gal); the frequently false promise of upward mobility; the perfidies of unchallenged, unchecked corporations. Russell is betting that Joy, as inhabited by Lawrence, will be a proxy for many frustrated Americans.

DOUTHAT: Yes, Joy does seem intended to resonate with our own eras mix of blue-collar anxiety and can women have it all? agita among the well-to-do. And thats another parallel to Baby Boom, which belongs with 9 to 5 and Working Girl in the 80s-era museum case of women: now theyre in WORKPLACE! comedies.



Photo

But where Baby Boom stayed low and broad in its humor and satire, Joy is a more ambitious and bizarre  this is David O. Russell, after all. The characters talk in speeches; the storytelling is rich with artifice; there are flashbacks and dream sequences and narration from beyond the grave. A lot of this doesnt really work. But I kind of loved it, flaws and all.

And at the very least its worth seeing, as you say, because Jennifer Lawrence is a Movie Star, and that holds true even when the movie around her threatens to become a Mess.

Also, better Russells mess than J.J. Abramss machine-like efficiency. Or maybe you liked Star Wars: The Force Awakens more than I did?

BRUNI: Its funny that you use the word machine for the latest Star Wars, because it did seem to me a carefully rigged, painstakingly wired delivery system for the highest dose imaginable of pharmaceutical-grade nostalgia. I experienced it as a pastiche of all of the most beloved themes, sequences, plot lines and visual tropes that appeared in one or more of the first three Star Wars movies.

DOUTHAT: Ive already subjected my poor readers to one over-long rant about The Force Awakens, but I think youve captured the key difference between the new movie and the originals.

Lucass trilogy was a pastiche of the entirety of cinematic history: Everything from Flash Gordon to Akira Kurosawa to Leni Riefenstahl to Casablanca found its way into those movies, and it was the combination that made everything old seem new, strange and alive.

But The Force Awakens is, as you say, just a pastiche of ... the original trilogy. And even thats being a little kind, since it borrows only a couple of elements from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi and mostly hews so closely to the 1977 Star Wars: Episode IV  A New Hope script that its almost just a straight remake or reboot.

Where Lucas gave us all of cinematic history in a galaxy far, far away, in other words, Abrams has just given us a handsome, well-acted George Lucas fan film.

BRUNI: As I watched it, I was struck by how many myths  whether they come from the ancient Greeks, William Shakespeare or George Lucas  revolve around the estrangement of fathers and sons. Where would literature, film and all of storytelling be without daddy issues? (For that matter, where would politics and the modern presidency be without them?)

But The Force Awakens never made clear to me precisely what drove Han Solos and Princess Leias child away and why he despises Han in particular so much. Han and Leia do come across as distracted, overcommitted parents, what with the fate of the galaxy constantly on the line and in their hands. Were they a two-career, two-planet couple who outsourced too much of the child rearing to Chewbacca?

Whatever the movies accomplishments and limitations, its a monster hit on a scale beyond even the most optimistic predictions, and the vacation that it offers Americans from a period of gloom, fear and campaign-trail grotesqueness has to be one reason. Of late there havent been many places where a baffled voter can escape the inexcusable tirades and inexplicable tresses of Donald Trump. The distant cosmos inhabited by R2-D2 and C-3P0 is one of them.

DOUTHAT: I dont object to people enjoying a Lucas fan film, or escaping into it! (Although you may be underestimating how much of Trumps reality-TV showboating is likewise a form of escapism for his fans, a different way of escaping the Mos Eisley cantina of politics-as-usual.) But I do think its a little strange how fully movie critics embraced the hype, especially just a month after the Hunger Games saga  a genre pastiche whose originality puts Abramss flick to shame  wrapped up to more indifferent or dutiful reviews. Nostalgia is the real Force, it turns out.

Even with all those plaudits, though, it seems safe to say that Star Wars wont dominate awards season. So what will? Which of the falls prestige offerings struck you as the best this season had to offer?

BRUNI: Well, I think Spotlight is a serious contender for the best picture Oscar  and rightly so.

Your relationship to the Catholic Church is much different from mine, so Im very curious for your take on that movie. What most impressed and pleased me about it  and I mentioned this in a column last month  is its depiction of the forces in American society that colluded to allow so many instances of child sexual abuse by Catholic priests and such an infuriating lag before any adequate, just response to it. There was a reluctance to think ill of men of God, to take on a powerful religious institution, to peer into it. Spotlight nails that.

Photo

DOUTHAT: Ill play against my reactionary-Catholic type, Frank, and say that in general Ive been impressed with Hollywoods treatments of the sex abuse scandal. The movie industry is not exactly known for its fondness for my church (at least these days; the Hays Code era was a different matter), but where Catholicisms greatest recent shame is concerned its mostly resisted the impulse to just go all in for stereotypes and sensationalism and anti-papist tropes.

I have in mind movies like Doubt and the slightly-more-obscure Calvary, which you touted in an earlier go-round. The former is an evenhanded examination of the scandals tangled roots, the latter a look  through the eyes of a genuinely heroic priest  at the spiritual devastation wrought by the crisis and its aftermath. And Spotlight fits neatly in between them: Its harsher on the institutional church than either, but thats as it should be, since it deals with the cover-up and its exposure, and the cover-up is the most damnable part of the scandal. There will always be abusive priests, as there will always be abusers in any position of authority, but the bishops who protected predators instead of kids are the ones most in need of millstones.

I thought the movie was impressive, if maybe just a touch too pious about its journalistic heroes, and I had only modest quibbles with its portrayal of the scandal itself.

BRUNI: I was also deeply moved by Room, whose lead, Brie Larson, is pretty much guaranteed a best actress nomination, while a best supporting actor nod could well go to her co-star, Jacob Tremblay, whos only 9 years old.

DOUTHAT: Yes, precisely because Spotlight didnt stoop to sensationalism, it also didnt get under my skin in anything remotely like the way Room did.

Indeed Im a little hesitant in even passing judgment on Room, because my reaction was so visceral, and so hard to separate emotionally from my current father-of-young-children state in life. I literally writhed and shuddered in my seat during the tensest moments, and the waterworks opened easily thereafter. Was that reaction a testament to the movies craft, its great performances (Larson in particular), or just a case of its primal fairy-tale conceit exploiting my rubbed-raw emotional state?

Maybe it doesnt matter, because exploitation is itself a form of craft.

Photo

BRUNI: It haunts me, and it haunts me because of something that comes through even more clearly in this screen version than in the novel on which its based. Room is about the brutal conundrums of parenting.

On its harrowing, attention-getting surface, its the story of a woman whos a sexual prisoner and has given birth to, and reared, her son in the backyard shed to which shes been confined for over five years.

But its really about one of any and every parents most profound challenges: to paint a childs world, no matter how small and grim, in colors of hope and wonder, so that its endurable. Its also about one of any and every parents trickiest decisions: how much truth to let in.

And theres a surprising, gut-punching moment in the movies last half-hour when you realize that it has yet one more big theme up its sleeve, which is the impossibility of knowing, in full honesty, which decisions youve made solely for your child and which youve made in significant measure for yourself.

DOUTHAT: It would probably have a claim on my best picture vote if I had one, but I sometimes felt more like its hostage than its fan.

BRUNI: Youre not the first person whos told me that Room was hard to watch, almost traumatic, and thats fascinating because its not explicit at all. Theres no gore. The sexual violence isnt directly shown. That it nonetheless feels as raw to viewers as it does is, I think, a testament to the skill with which its been made.

And I was grateful for it, because I saw it right after Suffragette, which was so noble but so ordinary, and Our Brand Is Crisis, which was close to unwatchable, despite Sandra Bullocks and Billy Bob Thorntons best efforts. We wait all year for the promised cinematic bounty of November and December, and the stocking often has as many lumps of coal as it does candy canes.

DOUTHAT: And we havent even managed to assign some pretty big movies (ahem, Mr. Tarantino) to the naughty or the nice list. But well have time for that when reconvene for the Oscars; until then, fellow Moviegoer, a very happy New Year.",[]

The Pope and Donald Trump

1. How one-sided, political and unfair this Pope is. When will the Pope also reach out to the millions of Americans who suffer from illegal immigration? For example, those millions of Americans who are out of work because illegal immigrants have taken their jobs and driven their wages down? Or those Americans who now walk into an ER and find its overfilled because illegal immigrants have flooded ERs throughout the U.S.?

 Emmanuel S in Charleston, S.C., reacting to Pope Francis suggestion that Donald Trump is not Christian because of his stance against illegal immigration.

More than 2,400 reader comments were published in response to the article.



2. I respect the Pope so want to give his opinions some consideration. Maybe enforcing borders is in fact anti-Christian. But then again, maybe so is capitalism and private property. I suppose thats why its best to keep religion beliefs out of politics, because religion has been used for so long to justify horrible deeds by the state.

 MMm in New York

3. What this comment from the Pope shows is just how provincial and purely domestic to the U.S. is Trumps vision. [Like] many other influential people outside this country, the Pope is rightly concerned about Trumps views on foreigners. Someone running for the presidency of the U.S.A. should keep in mind that the rest of the world is watching, even if the rest of the world wont vote in this election.

Justice Antonin Scalia

4. Truly objective legal interpretation is mostly a myth (personal preferences always inform decisions), but Scalia was atypical in his willingness to disregard any legal principle he had previously enunciated if it conflicted with his own partisan agenda, and uniquely rude and offensive in the language he used to do so. My condolences to his loved ones, but his presence on the Court will not be missed.

 Sean C. in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.

His comment received more than 3,600 recommendations from Times readers.

5. Whether or not you agree with his judicial philosophy, Scalia was by far the most intelligent Justice on the Court. If Scalia happened to come out on your side of a particular issue, you would feel vindicated, because he would write the most eloquent, impassioned, and brilliant defense of that legal position.

Policing

6. This story is a revelation. Nearly every aspect of it gives us a window into why police departments are losing trust with the communities they are meant to protect. Sadly, when the opportunity to build a bridge presents itself, the police appear to double down on putting an intractable wall between themselves and what has become a justifiably wary public.

As long as they just keep digging that trench, nothings going to change.

7. I am a young American who moved to Europe a few years ago, and Im not even a rabid Bernie supporter but feel obliged to comment. I came to Europe because opportunities in my career as a scientist did not exist in the U.S.A. anymore. Everyone asks when Im going back, but Im hesitant to return because my home country strikes me as a frog in a pot of increasingly boiling water who doesnt know to jump out.

People are so afraid at home, that they will lose their jobs, or that their children will lose at life because of not getting the education they need, or that one medical bill will ruin them. And I suspect both anti-establishment candidates this time are tapping into that feeling.

8. Over the past 5 years, my family has had to sign up for free identity theft protection offered after a major hacking scandal on three separate occasions.

Why? Because we shopped at a big box retailer, applied to a major university, and have health insurance. All of which were hacked because of lax security standards.

The personal data of over 4 million federal employees was hacked this summer. Just the latest example of the governments inability to safeguard its own data. Now the government wants to create a backdoor for every smartphone on earth.

9. Thank you, Ms. Lee, for your masterpiece To Kill A Mockingbird. One of the greatest American novels of all time. Atticus Finch is timeless and wonderful, illustrating so eloquently that one need not have super powers to be a person of character and integrity who helps others  one simply needs to choose to do so.

Rest in peace, Ms. Lee. Your work will live on forever.

 mjy in Seattle, on the death of Harper Lee, author of To Kill a Mockingbird.

10. The timing of the publication of her first novel was critical to the success of the Civil Rights Movement and a window to enlightenment for millions of young white people in the 1960s and beyond. It was the lens through which we watched the Movement creep, then walk, then trot forward on our TV sets during the evening news broadcasts. It inspired tolerance and courage and sacrifice in the generations that lived it and read it and saw it.

So what happened? What have we become? Where has our tolerance, courage and sacrifice gone?

nytimes.com,2016-01-31 00:00:00,A Chance to Reset the Republican Race,['The Editorial Board'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The battle to be the Republican choice for president has been nasty, brutish and anything but short. The hope among some Republicans is that the Iowa caucuses on Monday and the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9 will promote a candidate who can appeal to the half of their electorate that doesnt support the two current front-runners.









Those two, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, are equally objectionable for different reasons. Mr. Trump has neither experience in nor interest in learning about national security, defense or global trade. Even unemployment figures, which hes pegged at 23 or 42 percent (the correct number is 5 percent) dont merit his attention.

From deporting Mexican immigrants and barring Muslims to slapping a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, Mr. Trump invents his positions as he goes along. His supporters say they dont care. What they may not know is how deliberately he is currying their favor. At a meeting with The Timess editorial writers, Mr. Trump talked about the art of applause lines. You know, he said of his events, if it gets a little boring, if I see people starting to sort of, maybe thinking about leaving, I can sort of tell the audience, I just say, We will build the wall! and they go nuts.

Ted Cruzs campaign isnt about constitutional principles; its about ambition. In his three years in the Senate, he has helped to engineer a shutdown of the government and has alienated virtually the entire chamber, both of which he bills as accomplishments since he lacks real ones. Now, whether hes threatening to carpet bomb Syrian villages or pitching a phony flat tax that would batter middle-class consumers, Mr. Cruz will say anything to win. The greater worry is that hed follow words with action.

More than a half-dozen other candidates are battling for survival. Jeb Bush has failed to ignite much support, but at least he has criticized the bigotry of Mr. Trump and the warmongering of Mr. Cruz. Senator Marco Rubio, currently embracing the alarmist views of the front-runners, seems to have forgotten his more positive New American Century campaign, based on helping the middle-class. The terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino exposed Ben Carsons inability to grasp the world. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has said he would shoot down Russian planes, engage with the dead king of Jordan and bar refugees, including orphaned Syrian toddlers.

Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, though a distinct underdog, is the only plausible choice for Republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race. And Mr. Kasich is no moderate. As governor, hes gone after public-sector unions, fought to limit abortion rights and opposed same-sex marriage.

Still, as a veteran of partisan fights and bipartisan deals during nearly two decades in the House, he has been capable of compromise and believes in the ability of government to improve lives. He favors a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants, and he speaks of governments duty to protect the poor, the mentally ill and others in the shadows. While Republicans in Congress tried more than 60 times to kill Obamacare, Mr. Kasich did an end-run around Ohios Republican Legislature to secure a $13 billion Medicaid expansion to cover more people in his state.

I am so tired of my colleagues out here on the stage spending all their time talking about Barack Obama, he told a town hall crowd in New Hampshire. His term is over. Mr. Kasich said recently that he had raised the bar in this election. Ive talked about hope and the future and positive things. In this race, how rare that is.",[]
nytimes.com,2012-12-05 00:00:00,The Times Should Have a Reporter at the Bradley Manning Hearing,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","In failing to send its own reporter to cover the fascinating and important pretrial testimony of Bradley Manning, The New York Times missed the boat.

Over the past several days, as compelling testimony over the harsh treatment of this 24-year-old Army private turned whistle-blower (or illegal informant, depending on your point of view) flooded the media zone, The Times was notably absent.

Accused of giving hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables and classified reports about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the dealings of the United States State Department to WikiLeaks  which later released them to the world via its Web site and through news organizations including The Times  Mr. Manning could be sentenced to life in prison. He has been held as a maximum custody detainee at Quantico, Va., for the past nine months, and this hearing is the first time he has given public testimony.

The Times has not ignored the event entirely  it published one story on the subject, a brief piece from The Associated Press, on Friday. But it has not sent a staff reporter  the national security reporters Scott Shane or Charlie Savage would have been great choices, but certainly not the only ones  to the hearing at Fort Meade, Md.



Why?

David Leonhardt, the Washington bureau chief, explained in an e-mail that, in essence, The Times did not think the hearing itself demanded coverage.

Weve covered him and will continue to do so. But as with any other legal case, we wont cover every single proceeding. In this case, doing so would have involved multiple days of a reporters time, for a relatively straightforward story. The A.P. article recounting the main points of Mr. Mannings testimony about his conditions of confinement that ran on page A3 of The Times conveyed fundamentally the same material as a staff story would have. And Charlie Savage covered his conditions of confinement, as they were being debated, in two previous articles: http://goo.gl/dvFV0, http://goo.gl/gYTX7. Again, though, readers can definitely expect more coverage of Mr. Manning in the weeks to come.

The New Republics Eliza Gray bashes The Times in her piece on Wednesday, and a Times reader, David Morf  one of many readers who wrote to me about this  was highly critical. He wrote, in part:

The N.Y. Times is the paper of record that published and stood behind the Penagon Papers. Where are you now on the brutal prison treatment and studied legalities being visited on U.S. Army Private Bradley Manning? All he did was reveal to us what the rest of the world actually experiences of us as an actor-in-fact whenever we apparently feel we can get away with it. Mr. Obama has run a long, low, and mean campaign when it comes to prosecuting the exposure of wrongful behavior by U.S. operatives. I voted for him as a decent voice of liberal values in a world where the lights are going out, and this is what we get  Private Manning naked in chains? Is this the behavior the U.S. chooses to condone, while posturing itself as the home of the free and the brave? I do not really understand Mr. Obamas silence and prosecutions. I truly do not understand your silence. Its bad enough that Private Manning has been badly maltreated for revealing truth to power. Its unconscionable and sad if The Times sits quietly by saying nothing  even worse, simply running AP wire copy to let the story bury itself.

One doesnt have to agree with either of those viewpoints or interpretations of events to see the news value of the Manning testimony at Fort Meade. The testimony is dramatic and the overarching issues are important.

The Times should be there.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Perfectly Reasonable Question: Must 'Best Comments' Be True?,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Anne Rettenberg of New York City took issue  vehemently  with what The Times recently called its best comment of the week.

Starting last month, a new Times feature began identifying the top 10 comments of the week on our digital platforms, as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment.

Last weeks No. 1 comment read as follows:

I am so disappointed in the Sanders supporters. All votes matter. Black votes, Latino votes, White votes, Southern votes. Older voters. Mrs. Clinton is winning the popular votes. The delegates votes. And yet the Sanders supporters sneer at these votes, and almost in a racist and patronizing way suggest these voters do [not] know what is good for them. Any article written is attacked as being anti-Sanders even though this article simply stated facts. Should we get rid of the black votes, Southern votes and anyone who dares not to vote for Sanders? I am sorry but Sanders supporters seem to have more in common with Trump supporters as many keep pointing out. No grace in defeat.

Ms. Rettenberg, a Sanders supporter, called this a defamatory lie. She wrote: Neither I nor any Sanders supporter I know sneers at votes by voters who are black, Latino, white Southern or anything else. And she added, This type of almost nonsensical, shrieking broadside is apparently the best tactic Hillary supporters can muster, which is sad.

I asked The Timess community editor, Bassey Etim, to respond. He said that moderators had noticed the growing disagreement among commenters between Sanders and Clinton supporters.

We just wanted to capture a bit of that interchange with the top two comments on the list, he said. (The second of the best comments was a reply to the first, but didnt address the point Ms. Rettenberg brings up.)

And, more generally, Mr. Etim explained the selections of best comments:

Editorially, were also trying to find comments on popular stories or stories where the comments really strike a personal chord. But those comments need to be excerpt-able in 100-150 words and also make sense absent any other context. So we cant always just include the most popular comment, but we always lean toward the most popular ones. And we also make an effort to include a few of the top 10 most recommended comments across the site each week. Recommendations alone, though, arent the best indicator of comments quality, because you have to balance that against the number of total visitors to the article and the time of the comments publication vs. the time of the articles peak visits. So basically, being #1 is a function of:

 How well the exchange represents the wider nytimes.com conversation.

 How popular was the comment among readers?

 Is this in reaction to a major news item?

 Did moderators think the comment was high quality.

The Times does not make a practice of fact-checking reader comments, which would be an overwhelming task. But moderators do make many judgments about whats appropriate for publication.

As for the question of accuracy, Mr. Etim didnt find that to be a salient issue in this case. I didnt think there was really a factual issue  the comment referred to previous comments from Sanders supporters in the article and made a subjective argument against them.

In this occasional series of Perfectly Reasonable Questions, I ask a Times editor to respond to a readers question, and I present the question and answer, usually without comment. Feel free to submit questions to public@nytimes.com. (As always, I reserve the right to determine what is perfectly reasonable.)",[]
nytimes.com,2013-01-10 00:00:00,"In the Spirit of Ada Louise Huxtable, a Times Critic Reinvents His Role","['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","On Criticism Looking at the impact of New York Times cultural criticism.

Michael Kimmelmans piece on Ada Louise Huxtable , who died this week at age 91 , in Tuesdays Arts section is tagged An Appraisal, but it could easily have been called something more enthusiastic: an appreciation. For by his own eager admission, Mr. Kimmelman  who took over as architecture critic in September 2011  owes much to Ms. Huxtable, whom he calls a role model.

If Ms. Huxtable invented the role of newspaper architecture critic in the 1960s and 1970s, then Mr. Kimmelman has spent the last year or so inventing it anew  with more than a nod to the woman whose work he grew up reading and admiring.

Shes been a role model and an inspiration, Mr. Kimmelman told me Tuesday. I exist in her shadow as somebody who aspires to see both the art and the social and political role of the built environment, and to treat this job as a bully pulpit for making better places to live.

Unlike many of the other culture critics at The Times, the architecture critic has considerable freedom to choose his own assignments and areas of interest  not bound, as others are, by the equivalent of the blockbuster movie, the big Broadway premiere, or the major exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The role is an outlier among the critics, he said.



In his first 16 months on the job, Mr. Kimmelman, by design, has taken on architecture (broadly defined) in all of New York Citys five boroughs, as well as farther afield  going to Medellin, Colombia, to write about urban planning, to Louisville, Ky., to write about highways, and to Oakland, Calif., to write about housing projects.

Rather than lavishing attention on the world of starchitects and what he calls buildings as baubles, he has defined his role more broadly: writing, for example, about the importance of place to the Occupy Wall Street movement, and about the implications of Hurricane Sandy.

Why is it intrinsically more interesting to write about a museum wing instead of a library or a hospital? he asked.

He has also shown himself more than willing to take a big swing at a fat pitch, as he did in his Christmas Eve takedown of the new Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. (The piece qualifies as one of those all guns blazing reviews I wrote about in a recent Sunday column.) It begins:

Offhand I cant recall seeing a more ridiculous looking building than the new Stedelijk Museum, which recently opened here. Shaped like a bathtub, of all things, it arrives years behind schedule at the tail end of the money-fueled, headline-hungry, erratically ingenious era of indulgent museum design that began to peter out with the global economy.

Later: Entering an oversize plumbing fixture to commune with classic modern art is like hearing Bach played by a man wearing a clown suit.

Like Ms. Huxtable, Mr. Kimmelman is attuned to the democracy of this art form. In that context, he told me that he admired her ability to speak truth to power and to express  and stand by  an unpopular point of view as she did when she wrote approvingly of Bostons new and widely deplored city hall in 1969.

Maybe that came partly from being a woman, having a distance from the traditional seats of power, he said, calling her incorruptible.

In his appraisal, Mr. Kimmelman wrote that Ms. Huxtable had that rare journalistic opportunity to pioneer something of her own, to fill a yawning gap in the public discourse, to carve a path with moral dimensions...

Its heartening to see him honor his role model by bringing that same mission into The Times again, reinvented for the 21st century.",[]

WHO buys the print edition of the newspaper? Just a few Luddites who wouldnt know a smartphone if their horse-drawn buggy crushed it on the cobblestones? Octogenarians and their older brothers?









That seems to be the conventional wisdom. On Twitter, Chris Boutet had a funny line recently. The following is a list of people who still subscribe to newspapers: Journalists, their parents.

It reminded me of a joke about the weather in my beloved hometown. There are two seasons in Buffalo: the Fourth of July and everything else. Not quite true, of course  May to November is pretty great  but then neither is Mr. Boutets joke.

Theres no doubt about the downward trajectory of print. But where, exactly, are we on that path? And how do younger people fit into that picture? I thought it would be worthwhile to find out, since its bound to affect The Times and its readers. And some of the answers may be surprising.

But, first, I want to say something clearly. Although this particular column is about the printed newspaper, I am a fervent believer in the need to move ahead on the digital front with a sense of urgency, which is what The Times is doing.

I read The Times in many forms every day  first through what arrives on social media, then on the web site, then in print at my desk, and later in the day back to the first two. I probably read more news, of all kinds, on my phone than anywhere else.

But for those who might say who cares? about the printed newspaper, theres reason to pause. Try these tidbits:

 More than 70 percent of all revenue at The Times came from print last year. The biggest share of that is consumer revenue from print  almost exclusively, thats from people who buy the newspaper either with a home-delivery subscription or on the newsstand. But print advertising revenue is very important, too.

 More than a million people still buy the Sunday paper each week. The number has declined to about 1.1 million from 1.8 million at its height in 1993. And about 645,000 people still pay for the daily paper, which has taken the biggest hit. (The daily numbers fell by about 6 percent last year; on Sunday, the number fell by about 3.5 percent.)

 A lot of younger people buy and read the paper in print. Of all subscribers, 23 percent are in their 20s, 30s and 40s  thats hundreds of thousands each week. They cant all be journalists.

 And on the opposite side of the spectrum, the typical digital Times subscriber is decidedly not a millennial, wielding her selfie stick and heading off to Coachella. No, the median age of the digital subscriber is a graying (but no doubt Pilates-practicing) 54, not much younger than the median age of the print subscriber, which is 60.

Whats more, this substantial print crowd, young and old, loves its Times passionately. Roland Caputo, the Times executive in charge of print (Its important that somebody carry the torch for the unsexy part of the operation), describes the readers passion in simple terms. Print readers love print, he told me. The affinity they have for it is astronomical. A major Times research project on readership last summer made that clear.

That sentiment wont change, Mr. Caputo said, and we have print readers of all ages.

Given that these print readers are paying most of the bills, with their advertiser-pleasing buying habits and their expensive subscriptions (some pay more than $800 a year for a seven-day subscription), The Times wants to keep them happy. That takes many forms  from making sure the paper maintains standards of journalistic excellence to getting the paper delivered on time. The strategy is to keep print readers contented and engaged because once theyre gone, it will be hard to replace them. Finding lots of new print subscribers is a job nobody wants, not even Sisyphus.

One more fact: The print readers are among the most engaged with The Timess digital offerings; these are not two separate categories of readers.

Still, theres no escaping the big question: How long will print be around? At a Loyola University gathering in New Orleans last week, the executive editor, Dean Baquet, noted that he has as much of a romance with print as anyone. But he also admitted, according to a Times-Picayune report, that no one thinks there will be a lot of print around in 40 years.

Mr. Caputo, for one, is willing to make a shorter-range prediction: There will be a print New York Times for the foreseeable future. Will it be around in 10 years? Absolutely.

For those who love the look and feel of the printed newspaper  the power of a dramatic front-page photograph, the serendipitous journey through the Sunday paper, the appreciation of editors judgments  this is good news.

The Times is rightly putting a great deal of energy into attracting new mobile-device readers, launching an Instagram presence and expanding its interactive journalism. Its working intently to make a new business model that is viable for the long haul.

And its trying to keep costs under control, which has meant cutting some newsroom jobs and, with that, eliminating some longstanding sections like Automobiles and Home. Ive fielded many complaints from readers who dont like some of the specific decisions.

This is a difficult balancing act and one that, in general, is being done thoughtfully. As The Times crosses the bridge to a fully digital future, its important to remember that todays passionate print readers are more varied, more numerous and more valuable than conventional wisdom might suggest.",[]

nytimes.com,2013-02-18 00:00:00,"Problems With Precision and Judgment, but Not Integrity, in Tesla Test","['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","As promised, Ive spent the past several days looking into the reporter John M. Broders test drive of the celebrated electric car known as the Tesla Model S. The article, which focused on two new superchargers on the East Coast, was understandably disturbing to the company and to the cars many admirers. The test drive, its safe to say, did not go well. In fact, its publication was accompanied by a startling photograph of the Model S on a flatbed truck, onto which it was loaded after depleting its battery charge on the last leg of the trip.

Teslas chief executive, Elon Musk, has charged that the story was faked, that Mr. Broder intentionally caused his car to fail, and that issues of journalistic integrity are at stake. On his Tesla blog, he released graphs and charts, based on driving logs, that contest many of the details of Mr. Broders article.

Mr. Broder and The Times have maintained that the article was done in good faith, and that it is an honest account of what happened. They have gone to some lengths to respond to the charges, point by point, on The Timess Wheels blog.

But Mr. Musk, and many readers, remain dissatisfied. Its not an exaggeration to say that Ive heard from hundreds of them, either in e-mails or comments to my blog. (Some readers have also expressed their support for Mr. Broder and his article.)

One reader, Roger Wilson of Falls Church, Va., a Model S owner himself, expressed his opinion in more moderate fashion than many:

In his article (and follow-ups), Mr. Broder states that he followed Teslas advice during his drive. But, if he had taken time to read the owners manual beforehand (which, at 30-or-so well-written pages, would have taken an hour), he would have known about:  The Max Range setting, which would have charged the battery beyond the standard range and given him 20-30 miles more range;

 The Range Mode setting, which would have conserved battery during the drive;

 The section entitled Driving Tips for Maximum Range';

 And, the concept of plugging the vehicle in (especially during his overnight stop): Tesla strongly recommends leaving Model S plugged in when not in use. and The most important way to preserve the Battery is to LEAVE YOUR MODEL S PLUGGED IN when youre not using it. Had he employed at least one of these tidbits, he probably wouldnt have been stalled on the EV highway. But, then again, it wouldnt be nearly as interesting a story if he made the trip successfully (and could have only complained about the inconveniences of staying at the charging station longer than he cared to or having to plug in the car overnight). In follow-ups, he claims that he was only testing the supercharger network. If this had been the case, the story wouldnt have focused on him driving 45 m.p.h. and being cold (and the infamous picture of the Tesla on the flatbed), but would have simply stated that the two current supercharger stations (which just opened recently) are too far apart and that one might have to rely on non-Tesla public charging stations until more supercharger stations are installed. Unlike Mr. Musk, I dont claim that Mr. Broder faked the story, but he certainly didnt seem to employ the least bit of care or responsibility in fuel management (required of any vehicle, regardless of fuel type). One can only assume that Mr. Broders irresponsibility in fuel management was in hope that something beyond inconvenience would happen to make the story more interesting. (Otherwise, no one, including me, would have paid much attention to his article.) Tesla is not faultless in this, especially since it suggested the test drive. Tesla should have made it very clear that the 200-mile stretch between the two supercharger stations approaches the maximum distance and that all range maximization strategies should be employed.

Over the past several days, I have questioned and listened to Mr. Broder, Mr. Musk, two key Tesla employees, other Times journalists, the tow-truck driver and his dispatcher, and a Tesla owner in California, among others. I am aware of other, much more successful test drives in recent days by Model S owners and media organizations that are intended to show that the charging stations work perfectly well (although those tests lacked an element of Mr. Broders drive: one of the coldest days of the year). And Ive read hundreds of e-mails and reader comments. Ive also had a number of talks with my brother, a physician, car aficionado and Tesla fan, who has helped me balance what might have been a tendency to unconsciously side with a seasoned and respected journalist  my own confirmation bias.

My own findings are not dissimilar to the reader I quote above, although I do not believe Mr. Broder hoped the drive would end badly. I am convinced that he took on the test drive in good faith, and told the story as he experienced it.

Did he use good judgment along the way? Not especially. In particular, decisions he made at a crucial juncture  when he recharged the Model S in Norwich, Conn., a stop forced by the unexpected loss of charge overnight  were certainly instrumental in this sagas high-drama ending.

In addition, Mr. Broder left himself open to valid criticism by taking what seem to be casual and imprecise notes along the journey, unaware that his every move was being monitored. A little red notebook in the front seat is no match for digitally recorded driving logs, which Mr. Musk has used, in the most damaging (and sometimes quite misleading) ways possible, as he defended his vehicles reputation.

I could recite chapter and verse of the test drive, the decisions made along the way, the cabin temperature of the car, the cruise control setting and so on. I dont think thats useful here.

People will go on contesting these points  and insisting that they know what they prove  and thats understandable. In the matter of the Tesla Model S and its now infamous test drive, there is still plenty to argue about and few conclusions that are unassailable.",[]

nytimes.com,2013-02-06 00:00:00,The Times Was Right to Report -- at Last -- on a Secret Drone Base,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","The media and national-security worlds, internationally, are abuzz over an important story on the front page of Wednesdays New York Times that describes a drone strike in Yemen last August. The article reveals a great deal about the secret drone program, the architect of which is John O. Brennan, who has been nominated to head the Central Intelligence Agency.

One of its revelations is the location of a drone base in Saudi Arabia. The Times and other news organizations, including The Washington Post, had withheld the location of that base at the request of the C.I.A., but The Times decided to reveal it now because, according to the managing editor, Dean Baquet, it was at the heart of this particular article and because examining Mr. Brennans role demanded it.

It was central to the story because the architect of the base and drone program is nominated to head the C.I.A., Mr. Baquet told me on Wednesday. In past stories, he said, the location of the base was a footnote.

The governments rationale for asking that the location be withheld was this: Revealing it might jeopardize the existence of the base and harm counterterrorism efforts. The Saudis might shut it down because the citizenry would be very upset, he said.

Mr. Baquet added, We have to balance that concern with reporting the news. The need to tell this particular story accurately trumped the governments concerns.

Mr. Baquet said he had a conversation with a C.I.A. official about a month ago and, at that time, agreed to continue withholding the location, as it had done for many months. More recently, though, one of the reporters working on the story told the government that The Times would reveal the location and said officials should contact Mr. Baquet if they wanted to discuss it further.

They didnt call this time, Mr. Baquet said. He said it is The Timess practice to give a heads up.

But, he emphasized: We dont ask for permission. We tell them what were going to do.

Some readers of The Times expressed dismay at the revelation. One reader, Brian Leary, wrote to me on Wednesday:

I am outraged that The Times is apparently disclosing a military secret like the location of the drone base. I actually support the premise of the story, and it is something that needs to be told. But the location itself was superfluous to the story line, and is potentially a threat to our national security. Im very disappointed The Times chose to be so cavalier about such an important thing, with no tangible benefit to the actual story itself. What interest was served by this disclosure?

I respect Mr. Learys point of view, which I know some other readers also share. But I feel quite differently. Given the governments undue secrecy about the drone program, which it has never officially acknowledged the existence of, and that programs great significance to Americas foreign policy, its national security, and its influence on the tumultuous Middle East, The Times ought to be reporting as much and as aggressively as possible on it.

The Times reacted quickly to NBCs obtaining of a white paper that describes the legal rationale for the claim that President Obama has the power to order the killing of American citizens who are thought to be part of Al Qaeda. Scott Shane and Charlie Savage, Washington reporters for The Times, wrote a strong analytical story, rightly crediting NBC, and editors and reporters moved quickly to complete and publish the front-page story, with its Yemen dateline. That story, Mr. Baquet said, had been in the works for several weeks.

Ill be writing more about this, including how The Times is trying in court to obtain an important, classified memo on the killing of an American, Anwar al-Awlaki, in a drone strike. His teenage son, also an American citizen, was also killed by a drone. The lack of due process and government accountability in those deaths are worthy of the attention The Times is giving it  and more  in articles from Washington, in reporters on the ground in the region of the strikes, and in court.

If it was ever appropriate to withhold the information, that time was over. The drone program needs as much sunlight as possible. This is another crucial step in the right direction.",[]

The hostages were taken out of their cell one by one.









In a private room, their captors asked each of them three intimate questions, a standard technique used to obtain proof that a prisoner is still alive in a kidnapping negotiation.

James Foley returned to the cell he shared with nearly two dozen other Western hostages and collapsed in tears of joy. The questions his kidnappers had asked were so personal (Who cried at your brothers wedding? Who was the captain of your high school soccer team?) that he knew they were finally in touch with his family.

It was December 2013, and more than a year had passed since Mr. Foley vanished on a road in northern Syria. Finally, his worried parents would know he was alive, he told his fellow captives. His government, he believed, would soon negotiate his release.

What appeared to be a turning point was in fact the start of a downward spiral for Mr. Foley, a 40-year-old journalist, that ended in August when he was forced to his knees somewhere in the bald hills of Syria and beheaded as a camera rolled.

His videotaped death was a very public end to a hidden ordeal.

The story of what happened in the Islamic States underground network of prisons in Syria is one of excruciating suffering. Mr. Foley and his fellow hostages were routinely beaten and subjected to waterboarding. For months, they were starved and threatened with execution by one group of fighters, only to be handed off to another group that brought them sweets and contemplated freeing them. The prisoners banded together, playing games to pass the endless hours, but as conditions grew more desperate, they turned on one another. Some, including Mr. Foley, sought comfort in the faith of their captors, embracing Islam and taking Muslim names.

Their captivity coincided with the rise of the group that came to be known as the Islamic State out of the chaos of the Syrian civil war. It did not exist on the day Mr. Foley was abducted, but it slowly grew to become the most powerful and feared rebel movement in the region. By the second year of Mr. Foleys imprisonment, the group had amassed close to two dozen hostages and devised a strategy to trade them for cash.

It was at that point that the hostages journeys, which had been largely similar up to then, diverged based on actions taken thousands of miles away: in Washington and Paris, in Madrid, Rome and beyond. Mr. Foley was one of at least 23 Western hostages from 12 countries, a majority of them citizens of European nations whose governments have a history of paying ransoms.

Their struggle for survival, which is being told now for the first time, was pieced together through interviews with five former hostages, locals who witnessed their treatment, relatives and colleagues of the captives, and a tight circle of advisers who made trips to the region to try to win their release. Crucial details were confirmed by a former member of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, who was initially stationed in the prison where Mr. Foley was held, and who provided previously unknown details of his captivity.

The ordeal has remained largely secret because the militants warned the hostages families not to go to the news media, threatening to kill their loved ones if they did. The New York Times is naming only those already identified publicly by the Islamic State, which began naming them in August.

Officials in the United States say they did everything in their power to save Mr. Foley and the others, including carrying out a failed rescue operation. They argue that the United States policy of not paying ransoms saves Americans lives in the long run by making them less attractive targets.

Inside their concrete box, the hostages did not know what their families or governments were doing on their behalf. They slowly pieced it together using the only information they had: their interactions with their guards and with one another. Mostly they suffered, waiting for any sign that they might escape with their lives.

The Grab

It was only a 40-minute drive to the Turkish border, but Mr. Foley decided to make one last stop.

In Binesh, Syria, two years ago, Mr. Foley and his traveling companion, the British photojournalist John Cantlie, pulled into an Internet cafe to file their work. The two were no strangers to the perils of reporting in Syria. Only a few months earlier, Mr. Cantlie had been kidnapped a few dozen miles from Binesh. He had tried to escape, barefoot and handcuffed, running for his life as bullets kicked up the dirt, only to be caught again. He was released a week later after moderate rebels intervened.

They were uploading their images when a man walked in.

He had a big beard, said Mustafa Ali, their Syrian translator, who was with them and recounted their final hours together. He didnt smile or say anything. And he looked at us with evil eyes.

The man went to the computer and sat for one minute only, and then left directly, Mr. Ali said. He wasnt Syrian. He looked like he was from the Gulf.

Mr. Foley, an American freelance journalist filing for GlobalPost and Agence France-Presse, and Mr. Cantlie, a photographer for British newspapers, continued transmitting their footage, according to Mr. Ali, whose account was confirmed by emails the journalists sent from the cafe to a colleague waiting for them in Turkey.

More than an hour later, they flagged a taxi for the 25-mile drive to Turkey. They never reached the border.

The gunmen who sped up behind their taxi did not call themselves the Islamic State because the group did not yet exist on Nov. 22, 2012, the day the two men were grabbed.

But the danger of Islamic extremism was already palpable in Syrias rebel-held territories, and some news organizations were starting to pull back. Among the red flags was the growing number of foreign fighters flooding into Syria, dreaming of establishing a caliphate. These jihadists, many of them veterans of Al Qaedas branch in Iraq, looked and behaved differently from the moderate rebels. They wore their beards long. And they spoke with foreign accents, coming from the Persian Gulf, North Africa, Europe and beyond.

A van sped up on the left side of the taxi and cut it off. Masked fighters jumped out. They screamed in foreign-accented Arabic, telling the journalists to lie on the pavement. They handcuffed them and threw them into the van.

They left Mr. Ali on the side of the road. If you follow us, well kill you, they told him.

Over the next 14 months, at least 23 foreigners, most of them freelance journalists and aid workers, would fall into a similar trap. The attackers identified the locals whom journalists hired to help them, like Mr. Ali and Yosef Abobaker, a Syrian translator. It was Mr. Abobaker who drove Steven J. Sotloff, an American freelance journalist, into Syria on Aug. 4, 2013.

We were driving for only 20 minutes when I saw three cars stopped on the road ahead, he said. They must have had a spy on the border that saw my car and told them I was coming.

The kidnappings, which were carried out by different groups of fighters jousting for influence and territory in Syria, became more frequent. In June 2013, four French journalists were abducted. In September, the militants grabbed three Spanish journalists.

Checkpoints became human nets, and last October, insurgents waited at one for Peter Kassig, 25, an emergency medical technician from Indianapolis who was delivering medical supplies. In December, Alan Henning, a British taxi driver, disappeared at another. Mr. Henning had cashed in his savings to buy a used ambulance, hoping to join an aid caravan to Syria. He was kidnapped 30 minutes after crossing into the country.

The last to vanish were five aid workers from Doctors Without Borders, who were plucked in January from the field hospital in rural Syria where they had been working.

The Interrogation

At gunpoint, Mr. Sotloff and Mr. Abobaker were driven to a textile factory in a village outside Aleppo, Syria, where they were placed in separate cells. Mr. Abobaker, who was freed two weeks later, heard their captors take Mr. Sotloff into an adjoining room. Then he heard the Arabic-speaking interrogator say in English: Password.

It was a process to be repeated with several other hostages. The kidnappers seized their laptops, cellphones and cameras and demanded the passwords to their accounts. They scanned their Facebook timelines, their Skype chats, their image archives and their emails, looking for evidence of collusion with Western spy agencies and militaries.

They took me to a building that was specifically for the interrogation, said Marcin Suder, a 37-year-old Polish photojournalist kidnapped in July 2013 in Saraqib, Syria, where the jihadists were known to be operating. He was passed among several groups before managing to escape four months later.

They checked my camera, Mr. Suder said. They checked my tablet. Then they undressed me completely. I was naked. They looked to see if there was a GPS chip under my skin or in my clothes. Then they started beating me. They Googled Marcin Suder and C.I.A., Marcin Suder and K.G.B. They accused me of being a spy.

Mr. Suder  who was never told the name of the group holding him, and who never met the other hostages because he escaped before they were transferred to the same location  remarked on the typically English vocabulary his interrogators had used.

During one session, they kept telling him he had been naughty  a word that hostages who were held with Mr. Foley also recalled their guards using during the most brutal torture.

It was in the course of these interrogations that the jihadists found images of American military personnel on Mr. Foleys laptop, taken during his assignments in Afghanistan and Iraq.

In the archive of photographs he had personally taken, there were images glorifying the American crusaders, they wrote in an article published after Mr. Foleys death. Alas for James, this archive was with him at the time of his arrest.

A British hostage, David Cawthorne Haines, was forced to acknowledge his military background: It was listed on his LinkedIn profile.

The militants also discovered that Mr. Kassig, the aid worker from Indiana, was a former Army Ranger and a veteran of the Iraq war. Both facts are easy to find online, because CNN featured Mr. Kassigs humanitarian work prominently before his capture.

The punishment for any perceived offense was torture.

You could see the scars on his ankles, Jejoen Bontinck, 19, of Belgium, a teenage convert to Islam who spent three weeks in the summer of 2013 in the same cell as Mr. Foley, said of him. He told me how they had chained his feet to a bar and then hung the bar so that he was upside down from the ceiling. Then they left him there.

Mr. Bontinck, who was released late last year, spoke about his experiences for the first time for this article in his hometown, Antwerp, where he is one of 46 Belgian youths on trial on charges of belonging to a terrorist organization.

At first, the abuse did not appear to have a larger purpose. Nor did the jihadists seem to have a plan for their growing number of hostages.

Mr. Bontinck said Mr. Foley and Mr. Cantlie had first been held by the Nusra Front, a Qaeda affiliate. Their guards, an English-speaking trio whom they nicknamed the Beatles, seemed to take pleasure in brutalizing them.

Later, they were handed over to a group called the Mujahedeen Shura Council, led by French speakers.

Mr. Foley and Mr. Cantlie were moved at least three times before being transferred to a prison underneath the Childrens Hospital of Aleppo.

It was in this building that Mr. Bontinck, then only 18, met Mr. Foley. At first, Mr. Bontinck was a fighter, one of thousands of young Europeans drawn to the promise of jihad. He later ran afoul of the group when he received a text message from his worried father back in Belgium and his commander accused him of being a spy.

The militants dragged him into a basement room with pale brown walls. Inside were two very thin, bearded foreigners: Mr. Foley and Mr. Cantlie.

For the next three weeks, when the call to prayer sounded, all three stood.

An American Named Hamza

Mr. Foley converted to Islam soon after his capture and adopted the name Abu Hamza, Mr. Bontinck said. (His conversion was confirmed by three other recently released hostages, as well as by his former employer.)

I recited the Quran with him, Mr. Bontinck said. Most people would say, Lets convert so that we can get better treatment. But in his case, I think it was sincere.

Former hostages said that a majority of the Western prisoners had converted during their difficult captivity. Among them was Mr. Kassig, who adopted the name Abdul-Rahman, according to his family, who learned of his conversion in a letter smuggled out of the prison.

Only a handful of the hostages stayed true to their own faiths, including Mr. Sotloff, then 30, a practicing Jew. On Yom Kippur, he told his guards he was not feeling well and refused his food so he could secretly observe the traditional fast, a witness said.

Those recently released said that most of the foreigners had converted under duress, but that Mr. Foley had been captivated by Islam. When the guards brought an English version of the Quran, those who were just pretending to be Muslims paged through it, one former hostage said. Mr. Foley spent hours engrossed in the text.

His first set of guards, from the Nusra Front, viewed his professed Islamic faith with suspicion. But the second group holding him seemed moved by it. For an extended period, the abuse stopped. Unlike the Syrian prisoners, who were chained to radiators, Mr. Foley and Mr. Cantlie were able to move freely inside their cell.

Mr. Bontinck had a chance to ask the prisons emir, a Dutch citizen, whether the militants had asked for a ransom for the foreigners. He said they had not.

He explained there was a Plan A and a Plan B, Mr. Bontinck said. The journalists would be put under house arrest, or they would be conscripted into a jihadist training camp. Both possibilities suggested that the group was planning to release them.

One day, their guards brought them a gift of chocolates.

When Mr. Bontinck was released, he jotted down the phone number of Mr. Foleys parents and promised to call them. They made plans to meet again.

He left thinking that the journalists, like him, would soon be freed.

A Terrorist State

The Syrian civil war, previously dominated by secular rebels and a handful of rival jihadist groups, was shifting decisively, and the new extremist group had taken a dominant position. Sometime last year, the battalion in the Aleppo hospital pledged allegiance to what was then called the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

Other factions of fighters joined forces with the group, whose tactics were so extreme that even Al Qaeda expelled it from its terror network. Its ambitions went far beyond toppling Bashar al-Assad, Syrias president.

Late last year, the jihadists began pooling their prisoners, bringing them to the same location underneath the hospital. By January, there were at least 19 men in one 20-square-meter cell (about 215 square feet) and four women in an adjoining one. All but one of them were European or North American. The relative freedom that Mr. Foley and Mr. Cantlie had enjoyed came to an abrupt end. Each prisoner was now handcuffed to another.

More worrying was the fact that their French-speaking guards were replaced by English-speaking ones. Mr. Foley recognized them with dread.

They were the ones who had called him naughty during the worst torture. They were the ones the hostages called the Beatles. They instituted a strict security protocol.

When they approached the cell holding Mr. Suder, the Polish photojournalist, they called out arbaeen: Arabic for the number 40.

That was his cue to face the wall so that when the guards entered, he would not see their faces. Several hostages were given numbers in Arabic, which appeared to be an effort to catalog them  not unlike the numbers American forces had assigned to prisoners in the detention facilities they ran in Iraq, including Camp Bucca, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, was briefly held.

When the Beatles took over, they wanted to bring a certain level of order to the hostages, said one recently freed European captive.

The jihadists had gone from obscurity to running what they called a state.

In areas under their control, they established an intricate bureaucracy, including a tribunal, a police force and even a consumer protection office, which forced kebab stands to close for selling low-quality products.

That focus on order extended to the hostages.

After months of holding them without making any demands, the jihadists suddenly devised a plan to ransom them. Starting last November, each prisoner was told to hand over the email address of a relative. Mr. Foley gave the address of his younger brother.

The group sent a blitz of messages to the families of the hostages.

Those who were able to lay the emails side by side could see they had been cut and pasted from the same template.

Triage

By December, the militants had exchanged several emails with Mr. Foleys family, as well as with the families of other hostages.

After the first proof-of-life questions, Mr. Foley was hopeful that he would be home soon. As his second Christmas away from home approached, he threw himself into organizing a jailhouse version of Secret Santa, a tradition in the Foley household.

Each prisoner gave another a gift fashioned out of trash. Mr. Foleys Secret Santa gave him a circle made from the wax of a discarded candle to cushion his forehead when he bowed down to pray on the hard floor.

As the weeks passed, Mr. Foley noticed that his European cellmates were invited outside again and again to answer questions. He was not. Nor were the other Americans, or the Britons.

Soon, the prisoners realized that their kidnappers had identified which nations were most likely to pay ransoms, said a former hostage, one of five who spoke about their imprisonment in the Islamic States network of jails on the condition that their names be withheld.

The kidnappers knew which countries would be the most amenable to their demands, and they created an order based on the ease with which they thought they could negotiate, one said. They started with the Spanish.

One day, the guards came in and pointed to the three Spanish captives. They said they knew the Spanish government had paid six million euros for a group of aid workers kidnapped by a Qaeda cell in Mauritania, a figure available online in articles about the episode.

As the negotiations for the Spanish prisoners progressed rapidly  the first was released this March, six months after he had been captured  the militants moved on to the four French journalists.

The European prisoners went from answering additional personal questions to filming videos to be sent to their families or governments. The videos became more and more charged, eventually including death threats and execution deadlines in an effort to force their nations to pay.

At one point, their jailers arrived with a collection of orange jumpsuits.

In a video, they lined up the French hostages in their brightly colored uniforms, mimicking those worn by prisoners at the United States facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

They also began waterboarding a select few, just as C.I.A. interrogators had treated Muslim prisoners at so-called black sites during the George W. Bush administration, former hostages and witnesses said.

With time, the 23 prisoners were divided into two groups. The three American men and the three British hostages were singled out for the worst abuse, both because of the militants grievances against their countries and because their governments would not negotiate, according to several people with intimate knowledge of the events.

Its part of the DNA of this group to hate America, one said. But they also realized that the United States and Britain were the least likely to pay.

Within this subset, the person who suffered the cruelest treatment, the former hostages said, was Mr. Foley. In addition to receiving prolonged beatings, he underwent mock executions and was repeatedly waterboarded.

Meant to simulate drowning, the procedure can cause the victim to pass out. When one of the prisoners was hauled out, the others were relieved if he came back bloodied.

It was when there was no blood, a former cellmate said, that we knew he had suffered something even worse.

As the negotiations dragged on, conditions became increasingly grim.

During one extended stretch, the hostages received the equivalent of a teacup of food per day.

They spent weeks in darkness. In one basement, their only illumination was the finger of sunlight that stretched under their locked door. After dusk, they could not see anything, spilling food on themselves until their guards eventually gave them a flashlight.

Most of the locations had no mattresses and few blankets. Some of the prisoners took discarded pants, tied one end and filled the trouser legs with rags to create makeshift pillows.

The prisoners turned on one another. Fights broke out.

Mr. Foley shared his meager rations. In the cold of the Syrian winter, he offered another prisoner his only blanket.

He kept the others entertained, proposing games and activities like Risk, a board game that involves moving imaginary armies across a map: another favorite pastime in the Foley family. The hostages made a chess set out of discarded paper. They re-enacted movies, retelling them scene by scene. And they arranged for members of the group to give lectures on topics they knew well.

Execution Deadlines

This spring, the hostages were moved from below the hospital in Aleppo to Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic States self-declared caliphate. They were incarcerated in a building outside an oil installation, where they were again divided by sex.

By March, the militants had concluded the negotiations for the three Spanish journalists.

When the first deliveries of cash arrived, the guards discovered that some of the bills were damaged. They complained to the remaining hostages that their governments did not even have the decency to send crisp notes.

By April, nearly half of the captives had been freed. There had been no progress, however, on the ransom demands the jihadists had made for their American and British hostages.

During the triage phase, the guards identified the single Russian hostage, a man known to the others as Sergey, as the least marketable commodity.

Identified in the Russian news media as Sergey Gorbunov, he was last seen in a video released in October 2013. Stuttering, he said that if Moscow failed to meet the kidnappers demands, he would be killed.

Sometime this spring, the masked men came for him.

They dragged the terrified prisoner outside and shot him. They filmed his body. Then they returned to show the footage to the surviving hostages.

This, they said, is what will happen to you if your government doesnt pay.

Goodbyes

Mr. Foley watched as his cellmates were released in roughly two-week increments.

As the number of people in the 20-square-meter cell in Raqqa grew smaller, it was hard to stay hopeful. Yet Mr. Foley, who had campaigned for President Obama, continued to believe his government would come to his rescue, said his family, who learned this from recently freed hostages.

On May 27, the few remaining hostages were reminded that different passports spelled different fates.

Those who had been taken together were, in most cases, released together. Not so for the Italian and British aid workers for the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development, a small French organization, who were grabbed less than a mile from the Turkish border after returning from a refugee camp where they had gone to deliver tents.

In late May, the Italian, Federico Motka, was told he could go, according to a fellow captive, allegedly after Italy paid a ransom. (The Italian government denied the claim.) But his co-worker, Mr. Haines, was left chained inside. Mr. Haines was beheaded in September after being forced to read a script blaming the British government for his death.

By June, the cellblock that had once held at least 23 people had been reduced to just seven. Four of them were Americans, and three were British  all citizens of countries whose governments had refused to pay ransoms.

In an article recently published in an official Islamic State magazine, the jihadists described the American-led airstrikes that began in August as the nail in those hostages coffins.

At the same time, they laid out the role European and American ransom policies had played in their decision to kill Mr. Foley.

As the American government was dragging its feet, reluctant to save Jamess life, they wrote in the magazine, Dabiq, negotiations were made by the governments of a number of European prisoners, which resulted in the release of a dozen of their prisoners after the demands of the Islamic State were met.

Fifteen hostages were freed from March to June for ransoms averaging more than two million euros, the former captives and those close to them said.

Among the last to go was a Danish photojournalist, Daniel Rye Ottosen, 25, released in June after his family cobbled together a multimillion-euro ransom, three people briefed on the negotiation said. He was one of several departing hostages who managed to smuggle out letters from his cellmates.

I am obviously pretty scared to die, Mr. Kassig wrote in a letter recently published by his family. The hardest part is not knowing  hoping, and wondering if I should even hope at all.

Mr. Foley seemed to sense the end was near. In his letter, amid expressions of love, he slipped in a sentence instructing his family on how to disburse the money in his bank account.

In August, when the militants came for him, they made him slip on a pair of plastic sandals. They drove him to a bare hill outside Raqqa. They made him kneel. He looked straight into the camera, his expression defiant. Then they slit his throat.

Two weeks later, a similar video surfaced on YouTube showing Mr. Sotloffs death. In September, the militants uploaded Mr. Hainess execution. In October, they killed Mr. Henning. Only three from the original group of 23 remain: two Americans, Mr. Kassig and a woman who has not been identified, as well as a Briton, Mr. Cantlie.

The militants have announced they will kill Mr. Kassig next.

Across Europe, those who had survived gasped when they saw the footage of their cellmates death: The cheap, beige-colored plastic flip-flops splayed next to Mr. Foleys body were the same pair the prisoners had shared.

They had all worn those sandals to the bathroom.

Those who survived had walked in the same shoes as those who did not.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-01-11 00:00:00,Story Approval by Drug Lord? Times Editors Discuss Rolling Stone Case,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Updated, 3:25 p.m.

With the media world abuzz over Sean Penns Rolling Stone interview with Joaquin Guzman Loera, the Mexican drug kingpin known as El Chapo  and the journalism ethics involved in that interview  I wasnt surprised at a question I got on Twitter over the weekend.

Josh Weinberger, who describes himself as a writer, editor, thinker and ruminator, put it this way:

.@NYTeileen @Sulliview Would @NYTimes *ever* agree to a set of conditions such as these? https://t.co/GK3uDlR6OB https://t.co/Q9gYiotp9Y  Josh Weinberger (@kitson) 10 Jan 16

I answered him confidently: In a word, no. After all, granting a source that kind of control over a story could seriously compromise the storys integrity and a news organizations all-important independence. From my point of view, it is clearly outside the norms of generally agreed-upon journalistic ethics.

But I dont make policy at The Times, or speak for the paper. And, after reading a number of journalists views on this  somewhat less black and white than my single word  I decided to ask The Timess executive editor, Dean Baquet, and its standards editor, Philip B. Corbett, how they would have handled this situation.



Both were clear: The Times would not agree to prepublication approval. And, by phone, both provided me with thoughtful answers that may be of interest to Times readers.

Mr. Baquet said flatly, Its hard for me to imagine giving a drug lord preapproval. He added that he didnt believe in preapproval in any case, but that in a situation in which a reporter, for example, was trying to do a story on a vulnerable person, someone with no power or guile who was not at all press-savvy, I wouldnt be outraged at the question.

In this situation, it would be an easy call: Yes, I would have walked away from the interview, if preapproval were the prerequisite.

Mr. Corbett agreed that we dont give prepublication approval to anyone. He said that the magazine world may  and probably does  have different standards and practices for sources approval. Some glossy magazines give celebrities the right to approve photographs or cover images as part of negotiations, he noted.

And even in Times interviews, there are all kinds of negotiations. For example, in some cases, The Times will agree to an embargo on an article that governs when it may be published.

Under some circumstances, Mr. Corbett said, reporters may agree to read quotations back to sources  not with the understanding that they will be changed, but so that there can be an opportunity to discuss inaccuracies or misperceptions. The Times has a policy banning after-the-fact quote approval, which was once a common practice.

Mr. Corbett agreed that the interview was a great get. (And there is no doubt that its generated extraordinary readership for Rolling Stone.) And given Mr. Guzmans obviously strong desire to tell his story, Mr. Corbett said, there might have been an opportunity to negotiate better terms.

Although Mr. Corbett was talking only about what The Times would do, and was not criticizing Rolling Stone, he did wonder whether the terms might have been improved with some pushback.

After all, he said, Mr. Guzman clearly wanted to get his story out, and he was taking huge risks to do so.

Update: Over the weekend, I also posed the question on Facebook. A number of people in the news business responded. Here are some samples.

Raju Narisetti, senior vice president for strategy at Newscorp: If outcomes matter then the story got what nobody has been able to get evera full confession from Guzman. The more interesting question for me, looking ahead, is will Sean Penn agree to testify in a court as to what he heard Guzman confess to.

Richard Tofel, president of ProPublica: I cant even understand what the argument in favor of giving pre-approval would be. We just dont do that. Is the argument that big enough stories should become exceptions to ethical rules?

James Asher, until recently Washington bureau chief of McClatchy News; soon to join Injustice Watch: Everything we know about El Chapo comes through the eyes of police and other law enforcement types. Not saying hes anything like an angel, but terror isnt his only weapon. And know more about him in a non-cop way is part of knowing what makes him tick....(Pre-approval) makes me uncomfortable but not because a non-journalist was involved. But Id rather see the interview and judge it rather than just be dependent on the official version of El Chapo.

Sarah Ellison, contributing editor at Vanity Fair: No journalist I know would jump at the chance to give El Chapo pre-publication approval. Id love to hear from any who would.

William Grueskin, a professor at Columbia Journalism School: Once you agree to pre-approval, the story is lost. It doesnt matter whether your source actually edits it or not; the thought invariably despoils the story, like Justice Frankfurters reference to the fruit of the poisonous tree.",[]
nytimes.com,,This Is How Hillary Clinton Gets the Coverage She Wants,['J K'],"Hillary Clintons supporters often argue that mainstream political reporters are incapable of covering her positivelyor even fairly. While it may be true that the political press doesnt always write exactly what Clinton would like, emails recently obtained by Gawker offer a case study in how her prodigious and sophisticated press operation manipulates reporters into amplifying her desired messagein this case, down to the very word that The Atlantics Marc Ambinder used to describe an important policy speech.

The emails in question, which were exchanged by Ambinder, then serving as The Atlantics politics editor, and Philippe Reines, Clintons notoriously combative spokesman and consigliere, turned up thanks to a Freedom of Information Act request we filed in 2012 (and which we are currently suing the State Department over). The same request previously revealed that Politicos chief White House correspondent, Mike Allen, promised to deliver positive coverage of Chelsea Clinton, and, in a separate exchange, permitted Reines to ghost-write an item about the State Department for Politicos Playbook newsletter. Ambinders emails with Reines demonstrate the same kind of transactional reporting, albeit to a much more legible degree: In them, you can see Reines blackmailing Ambinder into describing a Clinton speech as muscular in exchange for early access to the transcript. In other words, Ambinder outsourced his editorial judgment about the speech to a member of Clintons own staff.



On the morning of July 15, 2009, Ambinder sent Reines a blank email with the subject line, Do you have a copy of HRCs speech to share? His question concerned a speech Clinton planned to give later that day at the Washington, D.C. office of the Council on Foreign Relations, an influential think tank. Three minutes after Ambinders initial email, Reines replied with three words: on two conditions. After Ambinder responded with ok, Reines sent him a list of those conditions:

Advertisement

From: [Philippe Reines]

Sent: Wednesday, July 15 2009 10:06 AM

To: Ambinder, Marc

Subject: Re: Do you have a copy of HRCs speech to share? 3 [conditions] actually 1) You in your own voice describe them as muscular 2) You note that a look at the CFR seating plan shows that all the envoys  from Holbrooke to Mitchell to Ross  will be arrayed in front of her, which in your own clever way you can say certainly not a coincidence and meant to convey something 3) You dont say you were blackmailed!

One minute later, Ambinder responded:

From: Ambinder, Marc

Sent: Wednesday, July 15, 2009 10:07 AM

To: Philippe Reines

Subject: RE: Do you have a copy of HRCs speech to share? got it

Ambinder made good on his word. The opening paragraph of the article he wrote later that day, under the headline Hillary Clintons Smart Power Breaks Through, precisely followed Reines instructions:

Sponsored

When you think of President Obamas foreign policy, think of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Thats the message behind a muscular speech that Clinton is set to deliver today to the Council on Foreign Relations. The staging gives a clue to its purpose: seated in front of Clinton, subordinate to Clinton, in the first row, will be three potentially rival power centers: envoys Richard Holbrooke and George Mitchell, and National Security Council senior director Dennis Ross.

Based on other emails released in the same batch we received, Ambinders warm feelings toward Clinton may have made him uniquely susceptible to Reines editing suggestions. On July 26, 2009, he wrote to Reines to congratulate his boss about her appearance on Meet the Press:

From: Ambinder, Marc

Sent: Sunday, July 26, 2009 12:05 PM

To: Philippe Reines

Subject: she kicked A on MTP

On November 29, 2010, he sent along another congratulatory note, apparently in regard to a press conference Clinton had held that day to address the publication of thousands of State Department cables by WikiLeaks:

From: Ambinder, Marc

Sent: Monday, November 29, 2010 12:05 PM

To: Philippe Reines

Subject: This is an awesome presser... She is PITCH f#$*& PERFECT on this stuff.

The emails quoted above are particularly remarkable given Ambinders understanding of Clintons press strategy, as he articulated in a column for The Week last year. Predicting how Clintons widely documented aversion to reporters would play out in the 2016 presidential race, Ambinder wrote, The Clinton campaign will use the press instrumentally. ... Good news for us, though: The reporters covering Clinton are going to find ways to draw her out anyway, because theyre really good, theyll give her no quarter, and theyll provide a good source of accountability tension [sic] until Walker (or whomever) emerges from the maelstrom.

When asked for comment about his correspondence with Reines, Ambinder wrote in an email to Gawker, I dont remember much about anything, but I do remember once writing about how powerful FOIA is, especially as a mechanism to hold everyone in power, even journalists, accountable. When asked to elaborate, he followed up with a longer message:

Advertisement

Philippe and I generally spoke on the phone and followed up by email. The exchange is probably at best an incomplete record of what went down. That said, the transactional nature of such interactions always gave me the willies.... Since I cant remember the exact exchange I cant really muster up a defense of the art, and frankly, I dont really want to. I will say this: whatever happened here reflects my own decisions, and no one elses.

In a subsequent phone exchange, Ambinder added:

It made me uncomfortable then, and it makes me uncomfortable today. And when I look at that email record, it is a reminder to me of why I moved away from all that. The Atlantic, to their credit, never pushed me to do that, to turn into a scoop factory. In the fullness of time, any journalist or writer who is confronted by the prospect, or gets in the situation where their journalism begins to feel transactional, should listen to their gut feeling and push away from that.

Being scrupulous at all times will not help you get all the scoops, but it will help you sleep at night. At no point at The Atlantic did I ever feel the pressure to make transactional journalism the norm.

Ambinder emphasized that the emails did not capture the totality of his communication with Reines, and said they were not indicative of his normal reporting techniques. When asked if the exchange was typical of the magazines reporting and editing process, a spokesperson for The Atlantic told Gawker: No, this is not typical, and it goes against our standards.

Reines didnt respond when we asked if he engaged in similar transactions with other reporters covering the State Department. But on the day of his trade with Ambinder, at least one other journalist used Reines preferred adjectivemuscularto describe the speech at the Council on Foreign Relations. That reporter was none other than Mike Allen of Politico:

Allen even took note of the seating arrangement, just as Reines had requested of Ambinder:



A look at the CFRs guest seating chart shows that arrayed in the front row will be top members of her team  the envoys she has called her force multipliers: Richard Holbrooke, George Mitchell, Dennis Ross, Philip Goldberg and Stephen Bosworth.

We cant say for sure that Reines implored Allen to describe Clintons speech as muscular and emphasize where particular audience members were seated, but that kind of request would hardly be out of the ordinary. As we noted above, Allen allowed Reines to ghost-write an item for his Playbook newsletter; and, in the course of attempting to secure an interview with Chelsea Clinton, told Reines he was prepared to submit interview questions to Clintons team in advance for their approval.

Allen referred our questions to Politicos spokesperson, who told Gawker via email: Mikes preview of this speech includes multiple aides say qualifiers and is transparent in that its based on prepared remarks and a seating chart. (If Allen and Reines did indeed email about Clintons speech, however, we expect to receive a copy of their correspondence in a subsequent batch as the State Department continues to process our request.)

In any case, Reines strategy worked out nicely. For an article aggregating Allens piece, New York magazine quoted his use of muscular in the headline, and even commissioned an illustration of Clinton wearing the arms of a body builder.

The most recent batch of emails revealed another notable sausage-making exchange between Reines and a prominent reporter. In several emails sent in early September 2009, Mark Halperinthen at Time, now at Bloomberg Newsappears to have arranged for a computer pre-configured with Microsofts Outlook calendaring software to be delivered to Reines house in Washington, D.C., so that Reines would be able to open particular documents in his possession, including Hillary Clintons travel schedules during the 2008 presidential campaign, and relay their contents to Halperin. In one email, the reporter writes to Reines:

the computer is ready to be delivered. I could have it there in 20-25 minutes It has a newly downloaded version of Outlook, which has not been installed, because it has to be done linked to an email. I am hoping/assuming you can do that. Is now a good time to have it brought over? Should it be left with a doorman or left upstairs?

Its unclear from the exchange whether Reines actually provided any documents to Halperin or simply relayed the information therein. But perhaps the more interesting aspect of Reines and Halperins correspondence is that, the day after Halperin had the computer delivered, Reines began asking Halperin whether he and his co-author John Heilemann would include him in Game Change, the book-turned-movie they were writing about the 2008 campaign: Do I have a big enough role to warrant a role in the movie, a la Jeremy Bash in Recount? To which Halperin responds: Well, the first response is, do you want that? The thread continued:

Reines: Yes, I want to be an amalgam like he was! Halperin: ok then. the book doesnt do amalgams. but the movie just might. let me puzzle on that. Reines: Theres gotta be a scene where I hand the phone to CVC: Thats good TV. Halperin: agreed, although hard to get your name in the film in said scene. Reines: True Halperin: we could make you the kennedy character or the mills character. going all postal on the wednesday call.

In the end, Reines rated only two mentions in the finished bookon pages 46-47 and page 52 in the paperbackand none in the movie. (Neither Reines nor Halperin responded to a request for comment.)

(The release from December 31 consisted of only 211 pages, so we consolidated it with the January release.) You can read and search through the rest of the emails on DocumentCloud.

Page 58  Reines emails Andy Alexander, then the ombudsman of The Washington Post, to complain about sexism in Howard Kurtzs profile of Chuck Todd What does it say when a papers ombudsman takes a paper to task for sexist writing and then only days later features a piece laced with so much blatant sexism that its laughable (profile of Chuck Todd)?

Page 75  After asking, on page 72, for quotes about Politicos newsroom culture, Jeremy Peters of The New York Times praises Reines response (If a lightbulb is out thats a story): Thats brilliant. You should totally let me use that on the record. ... Thats great. Anything else you can recall like thattheir greatest hits of non-newswould be great.

Page 79  Reines appears to flirt with a Miami-based media personality named Tara Gilani: How did I look in HD? To which Gilani responds: You look/are the same: cocky, smart ass. Dont take it as a complimentits not. To which Reines responds: Oh yeah it is.

Pages 110 through 111  Greta van Susteren emails Reines a photo of Reines laughing with the subject line: what is so funny?

Page 151  Van Susteren complains to Reines about a grudge she perceives Bill Clinton to be holding against her:



I think it weird  if bill clinton is holding a grudge against me that is really weird I think I may be the only one in media who has never been smarmy towards him or repeated stuff that I have heard from him or hugh or dorothy etc which I know was said off the record because they feel comfortable talking in front of me. I have always carefully drawn the line with the clintons (and others) because I hate the media trying to destroy. I admire people in public service and never do anything rotten to people in govt so it is stunning that bill clinton would hold a grudge against me. I will still be one hundred percent fair with him (bill richardson did something really dirty to me and I have never retaliated  I have continued to do my job fair) but I am curious if it is clinton or matt [Bill Clinton spokesperson Matt McKenna] thinking he is clinton and creating problems.

Pages 227 and 250  New York Times reporter David Kirkpatrick appears to engage inor deny engaging insome sort of quote approval protocol with Philippe Reines: I cant imagine I imagined a quote approval since I cleared them all, so as I said, Im puzzled.



Page 518 through 519  These pages contain an unusually large redaction, apparently based upon a personal privacy exemption, that appears to concern something Reines ate while aboard a State Department aircraft.



Page 551  Reines asks ABC News reporter Dana Hughes to add a line taking a small poke at BuzzFeed and others for getting this wrong to a story Hughes was writing about reports that a swarm of bees had attacked Hillary Clinton and her State Department entourage on a diplomatic trip to Malawi. Reines adds that he would be very appreciative of the favor. According to the finished story, Hughes appears to have complied with Reines request.

Page 667  Kimberly Dozier, then at the Associated Press (and now at The Daily Beast), appears to allude an interaction she had with Michael Hastings in an email to Reines: I just read the exchange you had with another member of the press, who shall remain nameless in this email. Ill tell you my run-in with the same person, over a drink sometime, if I run into you at State Dept. event.



Page 740  Tina Brown emails Reines about an upcoming forum called The Hero Summit, scheduled for November 14-15, 2012 and headlined by David Petraeus. However Petraeus does not appear to have attended the event, given that he resigned several days prior to it over his extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell.



Page 748  Here you can find the official copy of Reines infamous email exchange with Michael Hastings.

Pages 830 through 832  Reines emails with Maureen Dowd and her research assistant, and claims that he was fired that last time he helped Maureen Dowd with a column.



Pages 971 through 980  The State Department redacted the entirety of what appears to be ten pages of email correspondence between Reines and Carolyn Greenspan Rosen, a producer at Entertainment Tonight. The pages are marked with the exemption code B6, which is used to justify withhold information that, if disclosed, would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.



Page 1030  Greta van Susteren emails Reines: How come you ignore my emails?

Page 1082  Anne Kornblut of The Washington Post emails Reines: I know youre on the other side of the earth, but if you get bored in a meeting, want to send me some examples of politicos most flagrant stupidity or errors?



Page 1155  Tara Palmeri of the New York Post writes to Reines about Hillary Clintons plans to endorse a candidate in the 2013 New York City mayoral race: I wanted to reach out to you about Hillarys status on Weiner. Last time we chatted you said she would likely endorse him for Mayor of New York over Bill de Blasio. In light of recent events, will Hillary still endorse Weiner for Mayor?

About a week before he used the national political stage to ask viewers to think about Donald Trumps finger size, Marco Rubio told the audience during another recent Republican presidential debate to Google Donald Trump and Polish workers. They did.

The worry is no longer about who controls content. It is about who controls the flow of that content.

Rubio wanted voters to see news stories about Trump illegally hiring undocumented Polish workers more than 35 years ago to demolish a building to make way for Trump Tower. Searches for those terms, and the fraudulent Trump University, shot way up. It was like a public version of the now ubiquitous phenomenon of everyone whipping out smartphones to verify a disputed fact at a party or meeting. Not that it did much good in this case; as numerous commentators have noted, Trump and many of his supporters dont seem particularly worried about minor annoyances like facts. (For the record, PolitiFact, which checks the veracity of politicians statements, judged Rubios charge to be half true.)

Nonetheless, Rubios Google gambit and Trumps (non)reaction to it, reveals an interesting, and troubling, new change in attitude about a philosophical foundation of democracy: the ideal of an informed citizenry.

Political thinkers have long claimed with Jefferson that, An educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free people. The idea is obvious: If citizens are going to make even indirect decisions about policy, we need to know the facts about the problem the policy is meant to rectify, and to be able to gain some understanding about how effective that policy would be. In the larger sense, if we are going to decide who runs the country  and we are, if you think the electoral college allows for that  we need to know the facts about the candidates records.



This is one reason philosophers have always been worried about the ebb and flow of information, and who controls it. Plato argued in The Republic that the fact that democracies couldnt control that flow and point it toward truth was one reason they often dissolved into tyranny. In a different vein, Noam Chomsky argued in the 1980s that consent was being manufactured by Big Media  large consolidated content-delivery companies (like this newspaper) that could cause opinions to sway one way or the other at their whim. Knowledge is power; capture it and you capture power in a democracy.

Now in print The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments An anthology of essays from The Timess philosophy series, published by Liveright.

The political importance of information  and the fear that it can be manipulated  has not changed. What has changed is how we are informed about politics or anything else, or how we arent. The Big Media that worried Chomsky 30 years ago is largely a thing of the past; many of the largest newspapers are gone, and others are shadows of their former selves. In the halcyon early days of the Internet, when we began excitedly exploring the information Garden of Eden, still free of the shadow of social media, it was easy to think that knowledge itself had become democratic, and that Platos worry had at last been shown to be bankrupt. But the worry hasnt gone away  it has just changed form.

The worry is no longer about who controls content. It is about who controls the flow of that content. It is no coincidence that we are now seeing Big Data companies like Facebook sponsor presidential debates. Nor is it a coincidence that people are increasingly following the election on social media, using it both as the source of their information and as the way to get their view out. Consent is still being manufactured, but the manufacturing is being done willingly by us, usually intended for consumption by other people with whom we already agree, facts or no facts.

It really isnt a surprise that Rubio would ask us to Google for certain facts; thats how you and I know almost everything we know nowadays  it is a way of knowing that is so embedded into the very fabric of our lives that we dont even notice it. What else could Rubio ask us to do to fact-check Trump? We used to say that seeing is believing; now Googling is believing.

Of course, in many ways following that norm  Google it!  can help us realize the Jefferson ideal of an informed citizen I sketched above. That ideal, recall, emerges out of the simple fact that reasonable action requires knowledge, and reasonable political action requires political knowledge. And Google places more politically important information at our fingertips than ever before. So if the ideal of being informed means having more information available for uptake, there is a case for saying that we are now closer than ever to realizing that ideal. That is behind the thought, commonly voiced in the early part of this century, that the Internet has democratized knowledge.

The Internet is both the worlds best fact-checker and the worlds best bias confirmer  often at the same time.

The problem of course is that having more information available, even more accurate information, isnt what is required by the ideal. What is required is that people actually know and understand that information, and there are reasons to think we are no closer to an informed citizenry understood in that way than we ever have been. Indeed, we might be further away.

One reason for thinking so is that searching the Internet can get you to information that would back up almost any claim of fact, no matter how unfounded. It is both the worlds best fact-checker and the worlds best bias confirmer  often at the same time. Group polarization on the Internet is a fact of digital life. Liberals friend liberals and share liberal-leaning media stories and opinions with them; conservatives friend conservatives, and do the same.

And the flow of digital information is just as prone to manipulation as its content  even when that flow is directed at an audience larger than our own immediate circle. Take an example: Search for what really happened to the dinosaurs and one of the top results is likely to be from a site called answersingenesis.org  not, I suggest, a good source of information on the T-Rex. But it illustrates how canny use of search engine metrics can be used to push an agenda. No wonder Trump and his followers on Twitter immediately shrugged off Rubios inconvenient truths; there is nothing to fear from information when counterinformation is just as plentiful.

Thats why the real worry here isnt about the regrettable if obvious fact that citizens are less informed than our ideals demand. Nor is it simply the amusing specter of candidates shouting competing Googling instructions at the audience like so many carnival barkers. The real worry concerns our faith in the ideal of an informed citizenry itself. That worry, as I see it, has two faces.

First, as Jason Stanley and others have emphasized recently, appeals to ideals can be used to undermine those very ideals. People on both the left and the right tell one another that the information is right there; people just arent paying attention to the facts (Google it!). The very availability of information can make us think that the ideal of the informed citizen is more realized than it is  and that, in turn, can actually undermine the ideal, making us less informed, simply because we think we know all we need to know already.

Second, the danger is that increasing recognition of the fact that Googling can get you wherever you want to go can make us deeply cynical about the ideal of an informed citizenry  for the simple reason that what counts as an informed citizen is a matter of dispute. We no longer disagree just over values. Nor do we disagree just over the facts. We disagree over whose source  whose fountain of facts  is the right one.

And once disagreement reaches that far down, the daylight of reason seems very far away indeed.

nytimes.com,2012-09-27 00:00:00,Readers Have a Stake in Obama's Free-Speech Disconnect,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","President Obamas ode to free speech at the United Nations on Tuesday was welcome for those of us who put the First Amendment almost on par with our first-born children.

In a diverse society, efforts to restrict speech can quickly become a tool to silence critics and oppress minorities, Mr. Obama said, in the context of recent anti-American tumult in the Muslim world.

Speech, of course, is not just people shouting in a public square, not just a billboard, not just a violence-inducing film.

Its also a newspaper article, a book, a Web site. Its Keith Olbermann, its Rush Limbaugh and its everyone along the spectrum. The First Amendment protects these as well, and American journalists are grateful that it does.

New York Times readers, whom I represent as public editor, should be, too. Free speech allows journalists to do their jobs  getting information to the public so that they can be informed citizens.

Mr. Obamas speech seems to be in keeping with all of that. The Washington Post called it refreshingly clear. The Times said it was much needed.

But with all the praise Mr. Obama received for his protection of free speech on one of the worlds largest stages, its worth acknowledging that he has also authorized the federal government to engage in an unprecedented crackdown on journalists and whistle-blowers here in the United States, relentlessly pursuing and initiating new cases against journalists and their sources.

Consider the Times reporter James Risen  whose 2005 work with Eric Lichtblau on the federal governments use of warrantless wiretapping was perhaps the most important national security journalism of the last decade. Mr. Risen has been under constant pressure from the Justice Department to reveal his confidential sources. Federal prosecutors say one of those sources is the former C.I.A. official Jeffery Sterling, whom they accuse of leaking secrets about American efforts to sabotage Irans nuclear program to Mr. Risen for his 2006 book State of War. (Glenn Greenwald wrote powerfully about Mr. Obama and Mr. Risen last year in Salon.)

Just this month, according to the Web site Secrecy News, government lawyers continued their full-court press against Mr. Risen:

Government attorneys this week reiterated their argument that New York Times reporter James Risen does not have a reporters privilege to refuse to identify his source in the prosecution of former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling, who is accused of disclosing classified information to Risen. The attorneys cited a new ruling in another Circuit that rejected a similar claim of privilege, and they urged the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals to affirm their position.

Mr. Risen and Mr. Sterling are not the only two who have been pursued. There have been others.

Its worth noting that Mr. Obamas prosecution of whistle-blowers is not an isolated instance of the disconnect between words and actions on free speech.

The Post reported on Wednesday on the controversy surrounding the recently released book No Easy Day and the levels to which its description of the killing of Osama bin Laden can be discussed in the Department of Defense. (Whistleblower.org offers a good take on a similar topic.)

And lastly, who can forget when the Air Force blocked its employees access to The Timess Web site and those of more than 25 other news organizations that published diplomatic communications obtained by WikiLeaks.

Mr. Obamas notice to the world that efforts to restrict speech can quickly become a tool to silence critics and oppress minorities should also be employed at home.

So, yes, Im glad to hear Mr. Obamas words defending free speech. But in the context of First Amendment press rights  so important to readers  Id like to see his administrations actions keep pace with his rhetoric.

In the 1950s and 60s, governments in Africa and Asia started subsidizing the production of staple crops like rice and corn because it was the fastest way to fill bellies and reduce starvation in those regions. Today, needs have changed: The problem is no longer chronic hunger but malnutrition, and the solution is not more calories, but better calories.

Its a crucial difference. A diet of corn or rice may keep a person alive, but can result in myriad health issues from night-blindness to severe anemia. For decades, however, governments, agriculture companies and development organizations have focused so heavily on staple crop production that Africa and South Asia are now growing too much corn (or maize, as its widely known abroad) and rice, says Prabhu Pingali, director of the Tata-Cornell Agriculture and Nutrition Initiative at Cornell University. Most of the surpluses are used for animal feed, in some cases to drive the growth of industrial animal production.

These starchy foods are not only insufficient to combat malnutrition; they have also displaced crops that are more nutrient-rich but harder to produce. And while governments have undertaken significant efforts, particularly since the global food crisis of 2008, to control prices for staple crops, they have made little effort to support the production or affordability of more nutritious foods, says Pingali. (See his critique of food policies as published in a June 2015 report in the journal Food Security. At the site, click on Look Inside.)

Consider lentils, or dal, in India, a legume that is rich in protein, fiber and key nutrients. For decades, dal prices were rising relative to rice prices, but nobody said anything about it, said Pingali. Its only now that people are saying: Wait a minute. We need dal as much as we need rice. Wheres our dal strategy?

Governments around the world have long failed to promote the production or availability of a wide range of legumes, vegetables or fruits; in fact, just about every food other than corn, wheat or rice has been neglected. Like in many other countries, when you talk about food security, Kenyans are talking about how many bags of maize we have, said Mary Abukutsa-Onyango, a horticultural researcher at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology near Nairobi. She has a story to tell about how to start turning things around.

Ten years ago, vegetables that had been introduced during colonial times, mainly cabbage, collard greens and kale (sukuma wiki in Swahili), were standard fare in many parts of Kenya, particularly urban areas. Indigenous greens like African nightshade, jute mallow and spider plant had become associated with poverty, and many Kenyans chose not to eat them despite their greater nutritional value.

Abukutsa has published more than a dozen studies documenting the robust health benefits of the traditional vegetables, which are high in vitamin A, iron, zinc and other micronutrients often lacking in local diets. Moreover, she began working to encourage restaurants and supermarkets to serve or carry these vegetables; she and her students took field trips to help farmers grow them; and she helped to develop and publish recipes to make them more appealing and approachable, since preparation for some of the greens can be rather involved, and some traditional cooking knowledge had become less widespread as the vegetables popularity declined. Then she circulated her findings to other researchers, to get them interested in these nutritional powerhouses.

Today, restaurants throughout Nairobi serve greens like African nightshade to packed lunch crowds and supermarkets sell out of them while kale wilts on the shelf, a sign that the traditional vegetables have been taking over the exotic varieties. More farmers are growing the indigenous greens, and in the most convincing sign of increasing commercial interest, seed companies are breeding them.

Abukutsa has also worked to include the study and breeding of indigenous vegetables in university curriculums, because she knows that horticulture students often go on to become agriculture extension officers, the key source of farming advice for farmers around the country. Five universities now include the cultivation of indigenous fruits and vegetables in their syllabuses, she said. While the obvious goal was to ensure that knowledge about indigenous crops trickled down to farmers, there has also been a potentially more powerful result: The insights that drive these efforts have been trickling up as well, and are making their way into national policy.

Historically, Kenyas ministries of health and agriculture have operated in isolation from one another, but in 2012, they decided to collaborate on a new agricultural policy that emphasizes more diverse, underutilized and nutrient-dense crops, Abukutsa explained. The policy we had before had been focusing more on commercial crops for export and staples, she said. We needed a policy specifically addressing nutrition  not just talking about production.

The governments policy proposal has not been published yet because the draft text is not yet in final shape. But when it is, Abukutsa expects that it, like policy declarations before it, will affect the type of training available to farmers through the governments extension program and perhaps the types of crops for which research is funded.

The new policy will ensure that when we talk about food security, we are not just talking about maize  that we are talking about all that is available, she said. The resurgence in popularity of indigenous vegetables is too recent to show an impact on national health statistics, but Abukutsa is confident it will lead to improvement, especially in relation to malnutrition and degenerative diseases. Shell be tracking the results.

Other groups too are working to breed and improve the quality of indigenous crops in Kenya and around the globe. The Nairobi-based World Agroforestry Center has been leading a campaign to breed and conserve threatened varieties of indigenous fruits such as baobab, bush mango and African plum. It has a team working with small-scale farmers in Cameroon and other parts of Africa to domesticate fruit trees that have always grown in the wild. Largely because of deforestation, the fate of these trees in the wild is uncertain, so domestication may not only preserve them, it may also lead to the development of varieties of trees that will be more nutritious and resilient.

Elsewhere, the Taiwan-based World Vegetable Center has been breeding varieties of indigenous vegetables around the world, although its communications director, Maureen Mecozzi, said the work remains an uphill battle. Although many countries now recognize the need to encourage production of a more diverse set of crops, developing the policies, funding the research, and building the infrastructure to support that diversity is a big challenge, she said.

So far, there has been no research from which to quantify the changes in Kenyans consumption of indigenous fruits and vegetables, the impact of those crops on the nutritional status and overall health of populations. But researchers who work globally, like Pingali, and locally, like Abukutsa, are confident that the only path that makes sense is focusing more on vegetables and other nonstaple crops, whether they are indigenous or not.

Im now of the view that weve sort of beat the calorie problem, said Pingali. Even if you think towards 2050 horizons, weve got the tools and the mechanisms to support the demand for staple grains. Now, a lot of people will argue me on that. But I believe the same people who say we need to double the amount of rice, et cetera, should also be asked: Well, what about tomatoes? What about green beans?

As you think to the future and the demands for food in the future, he said, only focusing on staples puts us in this really funny situation of creating increased imbalance in our diets.

FLINT, Mich.  All along, through months of complaints from residents of this city about the peculiar colors and odors they said were coming from their faucets, the overriding message from the authorities here was that the water would be just fine.









Yes, there had been a boil order when fecal coliform bacteria turned up in some neighborhoods last year. And yes, the extra chlorine that was pumped in to solve that problem seemed to create another one  increased levels of a different contaminant.

Still, the guidance from Flint officials about the temporary water supply they switched to in 2014  partly to save money  sounded assuring. In a notice sent to residents in July, city officials declared: This is not an emergency. If a situation arises where the water is no longer safe to drink, you will be notified within 24 hours.

The soothing talk has vanished. In recent weeks, testing has shown increased levels of lead in the blood of some Flint children  and health officials pointed to the water as a possible source.

First, the city advised residents to run their water for five minutes before using it, to use only cold water for drinking and cooking, and to install lead-removing water filters. Then county officials issued an emergency advisory recommending that people not drink Flints water unless it is tested for lead or filtered.

And last Friday, after corroborating that lead levels had risen in some children, state officials called for the water to be tested at all Flint public schools and for stepped-up efforts to replace lead service lines; they also promised $1 million to provide filters.

Officials met here on Wednesday afternoon, and talks were underway, officials said, for additional solutions that could come as early as Thursday. Gov. Rick Snyder said on Twitter late Wednesday that he planned to make an announcement about the situation on Thursday morning.

Private groups have raced to donate bottled water to schools, where the water fountains are now shut off, as well as filters to families who cannot afford them. Saying were just in a heck of a bind, Robert J. Pickell, the Genesee County sheriff, began serving bottled water and food that need not be cooked in water to hundreds of inmates in the county jail. Some residents have begun washing their children and pets with bottled water.

And Flints mayor, Dayne Walling, who had attended a 2014 event to celebrate the switch to the new water supply, called for returning to the citys old water supply and urged state officials to provide millions of dollars to help pay for it.

The contaminated water was just the latest blow to Flint, an economically battered city that has struggled for years with factory closings, job losses and population decline.

Along Saginaw Street downtown, where at least one business had an un-leaded sign posted by a jug of water, residents had lingering questions: Would filters really do enough to make the water safe? What about unfiltered showers? Could they rely on the water at work and at restaurants? And why had it taken so long for leaders to figure out that there was a problem?

I dont think people know whats going on at all, said Chris Thornton, 49, who described the first blast of water from his faucets some days as looking like urine, smelling like bleach and tasting of metal. After his wife, Ronda, 50, felt sick to her stomach for months, the Thorntons began buying jugs of bottled water, though the price  on top of an already steep water bill  has been overwhelming.

As far as my family, Ronda Thornton said, weve just given up on the citys water.

Flints water problems are tied inextricably to its fiscal woes. In 1960, nearly 200,000 people lived here. But auto plants closed, and the population has dropped by half. By 2011, Flints shrunken tax base and seemingly intractable budget problems prompted Mr. Snyder to appoint an emergency manager for the city. Over the next four years, the city had four managers overseeing operations. Along the way, the city switched its water supply.

For decades, the city bought water from Detroit, which treated water from Lake Huron, then piped it here, 70 miles to the northwest. But with the costs mounting, Flints leaders decided they could save millions by joining a new regional authority that would draw and treat its own water from Lake Huron.

There was one complication: Flint needed an alternative water supply from April 2014 until the new regional system is ready, probably next year. In the interim, Flint switched to using water from the Flint River, which state officials say had been a backup source in the past.

Ask residents about the Flint River, and many of them roll their eyes. They say it was once as a dumping ground for car parts, grocery carts and refrigerators. There have been significant improvements and intensive restoration campaigns in recent years, though a Flint River Fest set for Friday has been postponed, organizers said, given the current drinking water crisis.

Even now, state officials say that treated Flint River water is safe and capable of meeting state and federal standards. Officials say the problem may be that some of the aging pipes and service lines that carry water into Flints homes and businesses contain lead and are being corroded by water. The water Flint used to receive from Detroit was treated with chemicals intended to prevent such corrosion.

For months, questions about lead and other risks multiplied. Everyone kept saying: Its safe! Its safe! Its safe!  recalled Melissa Mays, a Flint resident who says she was sickened by the water and has helped organize residents over the issue.

Then in September, a researcher from Virginia Tech released findings from the water in hundreds of Flint homes showing elevated lead levels. Blood tests released by a local pediatrician  and corroborated last week by state officials analyzing their own testing  showed an increase in lead levels in children in some neighborhoods since 2014, when the city began drawing water from the river.

We all have a concern about Flints drinking water in terms of what were seeing in terms of lead, Mr. Snyder said last week.

Mr. Walling said that the move to river water occurred when an emergency manager controlled the city, though the City Council did vote for the citys plans for a new, regional water system. He acknowledged supporting the move in a state of the city address, but said that he had not been given sufficient information about the safety risks.

I had to work with what I knew at the time, Mr. Walling, who is up for election next month, said in an interview.

But for many residents, the authorities failed the city by taking so long to react. Anytime you have to weigh money against the health and welfare of people, it always has to be the health and welfare you go with, said the Rev. Alfred Harris, a local pastor who has stopped conducting baptisms at his church because of concerns about the water. Weve been talking about this for the last 14 months, and they did not give a sincere ear to any of us. Shame on you!

LeeAnne Walters said her son, Gavin, 4, who has immune system issues, had suffered direct consequences. After the switch to river water, which sometimes looked brown in their house, Gavin dropped to 27 pounds, far below the weight of his twin brother, she said. He sometimes seemed unable to pronounce words he knew, she said, and then test results showed an elevated lead level in his blood.

He is going to deal with the side effects of this for the rest of his life, Ms. Walters said. I dont think theres a word angry enough to describe my anger. I trusted the city, and I helped the city poison my kid. Who thought this could happen in the United States?",[]
nytimes.com,2013-03-20 00:00:00,The Tale of a Transgender Six-year-old Raises Reader Concerns,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","In Mondays New York Times, an article by the national reporter Dan Frosch examined a Colorado case involving a 6-year-old child, who is biologically male but identifies as a female. The article used the childs name, Coy Mathis, and two color photographs that showed her face clearly.

A writer from Spain, William Christian, objected to how The Times handled the childs privacy, and raised some interesting and valid questions. He wrote:

I trust I am not the only person disturbed by the NYTs article on a transgender child featuring a 6-year-old with name and photograph. I have no doubt the NYT did so with permission of the parents, but the child will live with this the rest of her life, and it should be her decision, made in the fullness of time and the awareness of consequences, to make herself a public personage, not that of parents, a reporter, or newspaper editors. Children can be cruel, and this child will find no escape from what you all have done together. Please think twice and think hard about this.

I spoke with the national editor, Sam Sifton, about The Timess treatment of the childs identity. He confirmed that the parents were fully on board with how the situation was treated. Whats more, he said, The Times was not the first to use her name or image. She had already appeared on national television and been prominently featured at events promoting transgender rights.

We certainly think about these things, but in this case, there was no need for a vigorous discussion, he told me. We were not introducing this child to the world.

Coy had already become quite literally, the poster child for the issues that are cropping up in schools around the country, Mr. Sifton said.

He makes a good argument. Once a child has been on set with Katie Couric, privacy issues are pretty much moot, although The Times should always consider its own standards as well. A more intriguing case would arise if The Times was the first major news outlet to use her image and full name. Even so, my sense is that parental approval, along with the childs own willingness, should rule the day.

And I can envision other situations in which parents advocating for a child in this way  those with autism or Down syndrome, for example  would not raise these kinds of questions.

Many people presume that there is something negative about being transgender and thats not the case, said Jeff Perrotti, a Cambridge-based author and consultant (and close friend of mine) who works with schools to support transgender students and their families.

As Mr. Christian rightfully observes, sensitivity is crucially important when children are involved in news stories. I can imagine situations when The Times might have to make some tough decisions that balance news gathering priorities with privacy concerns, but I dont think the story about Coy Mathis was one of them.",[]

Of all the patients I have seen in my 40 years as a psychoanalyst, Daniel was the strangest. He was the most inaccessible, inwardly tormented and infuriating man I have ever known, and yet he stayed in therapy with me for over a decade, calling faithfully every week  he insisted that his work schedule precluded coming in person  even though he spent many of those sessions in silence or addressed me as if I were inanimate. He drove me crazy, he haunted me and he moved me, sometimes all in the same session.

The reason he came to me was simple. He wanted, as he put it, to become a participant in the human race, and to learn how to relate to others of his species. I was hired to teach him how to do it.

Daniel initially chose me for this job because he had read a book I wrote about problem siblings that resonated with his own childhood. He had been terrorized by his older brothers daily violent outbursts, which his parents had done nothing to contain, and had concluded early on that relationships offered no comfort or satisfaction, merely depletion and misery.

Needing or being needed by anyone seemed perilous to Daniel. He barely exchanged a word at work with colleagues whom hed known for years, and his home, which he shared with his extraordinarily longsuffering wife (who had problems of her own), had the air of a monastery, where words were exchanged only by necessity.

Daniel rarely followed through on anything I recommended: having brief conversations by appointment with his wife, going to the company cafeteria, keeping a journal of his thoughts, emailing me between sessions. He would always agree to try, and then find excuses or forget the assignment.

After nine years of this, I was at my wits end. The only thing that kept me going when I lost hope of ever getting through to Daniel was that occasionally he spoke with real feeling about the depth of his loneliness, and his dread that he would never find a way out of the bunker he had constructed to keep himself safe.

Then one day, I got an idea. There was another inhabitant of Daniels household  Jeff  whom I learned of only years after Daniel and I began therapy, because Jeff was so little a part of his consciousness. Jeff was a dog of an unusual breed that Daniels wife doted on and that he utterly ignored, never feeding, petting or walking.

My idea was to enlist Jeff as my co-therapist to help Daniel break through his isolation. I proposed to Daniel that he take some responsibility for Jeffs care, preparing and feeding him dinner daily  his wife would continue to do the morning shift while he was at work  and that he observe his emotions as he did so.

The plan actually piqued Daniels interest, since no talking was involved and the encounters would not require as much from him as human contact would. He agreed to make a serious effort.

Every session thereafter I asked for a progress report. Im doing O.K. with it, Daniel invariably said, but on closer examination it always turned out that there were gaps in his fulfillment of his obligation that he glossed over and then rationalized away. I didnt do it yesterday because there was a TV show around dinner time I didnt want to miss, he might say, or I was out of town or I went running.

The task itself, which seemed simplicity itself to me  at feeding time, open can, fill bowl, wash bowl  proved herculean for Daniel. The sticking point, as we both had anticipated, was reliability. Daniel would have to provide things for Jeff  consideration and support  that nobody had ever given him.

Still, I refused to let Daniel off the hook. You cant just assume that your wife will take up the slack, I cautioned him. Jeff still has to be fed every single night on schedule, just like you do. Now he depends on you for survival  you have to keep his needs in mind and provide for them.

He chafed at this, but he took it to heart.

Then one day, Daniel made an announcement that surprised me as much as it surprised him. Today I heard the dog eating, he said. I noticed it. I liked it. This was the first time that Daniel could recall having ever been pleased, rather than threatened, by being aware of the presence of another. For a man who by his own account rushed through every social interaction, unable to savor it, this was remarkable.

Jeff was more forgiving of Daniels derelictions than I was. And as Daniel became a more reliable, even if far from perfect, master, Jeff  whom Daniel never called by name  took notice, wagging his tail at Daniels approach. The dog just jumped up and laid down by my feet, he reported with unconcealed delight one session. Its a wonderful thing. I have an effect on others.

This was the first time I had heard joy in Daniels voice. Jeffs expression of gratitude, responsiveness and appreciation made Daniels efforts feel worthwhile to him. Feeding your dog is feeding your soul, feeding your humanity, I said, and Daniel responded with a striking reformulation of the same thought: Im only fed when Im feeding.

The next session, Daniel reported another milestone. Today, he said, the dog and I looked each other in the eye. I suggested that he start to call Jeff by his name, to indicate that they had a mutual relationship.

There were signs of real love developing between Daniel and Jeff. I miss it when I dont feed the dog, Daniel said one day. Hes so happy to see me. Im becoming part of his life. I pat his belly and stroke his head.

There were still limits to Daniels engagement. He had yet to take Jeff for a walk, for example. But I left the two of them alone to work out that issue at their own pace. I tried to be as patient with Daniel as Jeff was.

Finally, one night, unprompted, Daniel took a leap of faith. He turned to his wife after dinner and said: Im lonely. I havent treated you well or thought about you for all these years. I was too afraid to let myself care about anything or anybody, but I know you care about me. I want to make it up to you.

She reached for his hand.

Then he took her for a walk.

In a caustic debate on Thursday night, Hillary Clinton accused Senator Bernie Sanders of leveling attacks by insinuation and innuendo against her integrity and her credentials as a progressive by portraying her as beholden to wealthy interests and corporations.









Mrs. Clinton, lobbing her harshest assault yet in their race for the Democratic presidential nomination, said months of criticism by Mr. Sanders over her taking speaking fees from Wall Street banks amounted to a suggestion that she was corrupt  or, as she put it, a very artful smear. It was the sort of cutting remark she usually reserves for Republicans, and it drew boos from many in the audience at the University of New Hampshire.

There is this attack that he is putting out, which really comes down to, anybody who took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought, she said. And I just absolutely reject that, senator. And I really dont think these attacks by insinuation and innuendo are worthy of you. Enough is enough. If youve got something to say, say it directly.

Mr. Sanders, who largely kept his cool in the debate, ignored the broadside and instead reiterated his familiar critique that a super PAC supporting Mrs. Clinton is funded in part by banks.

There is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system, Mr. Sanders said. It is undermining American democracy and it is allowing Congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this country.

The ferocity of Mrs. Clintons remarks in the debate was risky, given that many voters, including some Democrats, already have an unfavorable opinion of her. She is also running far behind Mr. Sanders in the polls leading up to Tuesdays primary in New Hampshire, and her attacks  while geared toward undercutting his popularity here  might backfire with some undecided voters who have positive feelings about Mr. Sanders.

Mrs. Clinton, appearing tense and even angry at times, was particularly sensitive about receiving millions of dollars in speaking fees, including $675,000 for three speeches from Goldman Sachs. She downplayed her turn on the lecture circuit, noting that she had also addressed other groups such as the American Camping Association and that the banks merely wanted to hear her views on world affairs.

But she did acknowledge that she had not done the job I should in explaining my record about financial regulation, suggesting that is why she had been unable to beat back questions about her speaking fees. Yet when asked if she would release all the transcripts of her speeches to banks, she hedged.

I will look into it, she said. I dont know the status, but I will certainly look into it.

From its opening moments, the debate devolved into a series of searing exchanges over one overarching theme: which of the two Democrats was the most progressive, an issue that they have been fighting over in recent days as they compete in New Hampshire. On one level, the debate was over semantics: The candidates share a similar worldview about aggressive government support for universal health care, public education and aid to the poor, and both of them used the word rigged to describe the American economy.

But they kept putting their own personal spin on the word progressive, with Mrs. Clinton deriding Mr. Sanders as the self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism and accusing him of judging her unfairly. Rebutting Mr. Sanderss claim that she is a political moderate, Mrs. Clinton sought to align herself with some of the most popular names in Democratic politics to suggest that Mr. Sanders was impugning them, not just her, with what she described as a purity test.

The root of that word, progressive, is progress, but Ive heard Senator Sanderss comments and its really caused me to wonder whos left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, Mrs. Clinton said. Under his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street.

Mr. Sanders, asked if President Obama was a progressive, at first did not answer the question, instead bringing up a comment by Mrs. Clinton when she called herself a moderate. But he ultimately took on the question. Do I think President Obama is a progressive? Yeah, I do, Mr. Sanders said. I disagree with him on a number of issues, including the trade agreement, but, yes, I think he has done an excellent job.

Mrs. Clinton, who is leading in national polls and narrowly won the Iowa caucuses on Monday, departed from the approach she used at Democratic forums late last year when she largely ignored Mr. Sanders and focused her fire on Republicans. On Thursday, though, there was only a fleeting mention of Donald J. Trump as she went after Mr. Sanders with an intensity that reflected a nomination fight worthy of the name.

She portrayed herself as a veteran of the countrys political wars who is better equipped to enact a progressive agenda than her more uncompromising rival. It was not a message likely to resonate among Mr. Sanderss idealistic young legions in New Hampshire, but it presaged the one she is likely to carry when the primary moves to Nevada and South Carolina, more moderate states, later this month.

The debate was the first to feature only Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, and the narrower aperture revealed significant differences. Mrs. Clinton seemed more tense at times in their rapid-fire exchanges. Mr. Sanders seemed surprised at times by the level of Mrs. Clintons vitriol, but it never threw him off his central message.

Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process, and theyre giving up on the political process because they understand that the economy is rigged, he said. He zeroed in on wealthy Americans and Wall Street firms giving huge sums of money to candidates  an implicit criticism of Mrs. Clinton, though he did not say her by name.

Mr. Sanders twice let opportunities go by when he could have pressed Mrs. Clinton on her taking speaking fees from banks. Instead, he ignored her and presented his own well-honed lecture about what he described as a corrupt system in which the financial institutions have outsize political influence and are treated with kid gloves when they break the law.

One of the things we should do is not only talk the talk, but walk the walk, he said. We have raised 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 dollars apiece. That is what the political revolution means.

Mrs. Clinton repeatedly tried to frame Mr. Sanders as a politician who has had ambitious ideas for decades but little to show for it. The numbers just dont add up from what Senator Sanders is proposing, Mrs. Clinton said. A progressive is someone who makes progress. Thats what I intend to do.

Mr. Sanders dismissed the idea that his record in Congress showed he was unable to enact major changes. Well I havent quite run for president before, he said.

While their disagreements were more muted, the two also clashed over foreign policy. And, once again, it was Mrs. Clinton going on the offensive. She suggested the senator was naive for wanting to insert Iranian troops into Syria and suggested he would be too hasty to normalize relations with the government of Iran.

You are voting for both a president and a commander in chief, she said, speaking directly to voters.

Mr. Sanders responded by invoking her 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war to question her judgment and recalled that, in the 2008 Democratic primary, she had called Mr. Obama naive because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies.

Mrs. Clinton, asked if Mr. Sanders could win the general election, said she had great respect for the Sanders campaign but believed he would face the most withering onslaught from Republicans. She then tacitly suggested that Mr. Sanderss left-wing views would not be popular in some states in November.

It will put the nominee into the spotlight, she said. Ive been vetted. Theres hardly anything you dont know about me.

Mrs. Clinton said she was 100 percent confident that she did not face any legal threat from the federal investigations into her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Mr. Sanders, in turn, said he would stand by his past pledges not to politicize the issue.

The biting exchanges at the start of the debate, though, seemed long gone as the forum concluded.

If Im so fortunate as to be the nominee, the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Senator Sanders, Mrs. Clinton said.

Mr. Sanders returned the peace offering, noting that campaigns can get out of hand. But he said he respected Mrs. Clinton and that their shared views were far superior to those held by Republicans.

This prompted broad smiles from them both, an impromptu handshake and a loud ovation from appreciative Democrats in the audience.",[]

Since I was a kid, Ive loved story songs, history ballads and concept albums. Songs with well-drawn characters, a strong sense of time and place, a narrative arc and a cinematic quality are endlessly fascinating. I remember hearing The Battle of New Orleans by Jimmy Driftwood (a hit for the country artist Johnny Horton) for the first time, as a very young, prekindergarten child, and being mesmerized by the march of the bloody British, at whom we fired our guns all the way down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. At the time I didnt know who the British were, or why we wanted to kill them, or where the city of New Orleans might be, but the battle and the chase and the big river right in the center made an indelible imprint.

Johnny Cashs (Dads) concept albums Ballads of the True West and Bitter Tears were my favorites in early childhood. On Ballads of the True West, the stark Hardin Wouldnt Run is just about perfect. Its a melancholy paean to the 19th-century gunslinger John Wesley Hardin and is still in my top 10 personal favorites of all my dads songs. In the song, Hardin is a man of integrity who doesnt run away from his fate when he is caught after a series of justifiable murders, but jauntily kisses his girl, Jane Bowen, goodbye as he goes off to prison: So long, Janie, chin up, Ill be back again. (The historical Hardin was a much more hard-boiled and unsavory character and he spent the majority of his life running from the law.)

The song must have made an impact on Bob Dylan, already by that time a vocal fan of my dad, as two years after Ballads of the True West Dylan released the album John Wesley Harding. Coincidence? I think not. (The added g on the end of Hardin created a minor kerfuffle and caused some ridicule.)





The first thing my husband, John Leventhal, ever gave me, shortly after we met, was a cassette mix tape he had put together of some of his current favorite songs. On that tape was Paul Bradys eight-verse version of Arthur McBride, a gorgeous, lilting Irish folk song with roots in the 17th century. In the ballad, young Arthur and his pal are walking serenely down the road when three military recruiters try to persuade them to join the British Army. Arthur and his friend refuse, somewhat disrespectfully, and the soldiers threaten them with swords. (Again with the bloody British!) Arthur and his buddy pull out their shillelaghs and bash the recruiters heads in.

I must have listened to Arthur McBride a thousand times. It made me want to marry John Leventhal. I did marry him. A couple of years after that, we went together to Aberdeen, Scotland, to tape Transatlantic Sessions, a music show that puts American and Scottish and Irish musicians together to see what they will come up with. I sat on the floor in the corner of a little room at an inn where we were taping, a few feet from Paul Brady, with no one else in the room but him and the camera operators, and listened to him sing Arthur McBride. It remains one of the greatest live performances Ive ever seen, and a moment Ill never forget.

I had been utterly unable to crack the code of how to write these kinds of narrative ballads myself until I was writing the songs for my new album, The River and the Thread. In the past, I was intimidated. I felt self-conscious drawing characters out of thin air, or presuming to reassemble the life of a real historical person. I couldnt find my way in.

In the fall of 2012, my son was working on an eighth grade Civil War project. I mentioned to him that he had Cash ancestors on both sides of the Civil War, and I went to the Civil War database to research it with him. There materialized before us a photograph of one William Cash, lieutenant in the Massachusetts Eighth Infantry. He had enlisted on April 30, 1861. April 30 is my wedding anniversary. A little spark of an idea.

I looked further and found William Cashes in several Southern regiments as well: Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee. This all made sense, as my family genealogy records the arrival of the first Cash, also a William, in Salem, Mass., in the 17th century, and the next generation spilling down to Virginia, where my direct line begins.

A year before this stirring discovery, John had written a gorgeous melody that had the pristine quality and authenticity of the ancient ballads I so admired. Rodney Crowell, my ex-husband, had written a lyric for the melody. (Yes, my husband and my ex had written a song together.) Rodneys first four lines were lifted almost verbatim from a 19th-century personals ad he had come across:

Girl with hair of flaming red

seeking perfect lover

for to lie down on her feather bed

soft secrets to uncover.

It was written in an old vernacular. My own hair is flaming red. The spark ignited.

I asked him if he would be willing to rewrite the rest of the song with me as a Civil War ballad. He agreed. I was a little self-conscious about writing a song with my husband and my ex-husband, but there it was. The song was framed and ready for the painting to be completed. Werent we grown-up enough to do this? Hadnt enough water coursed under the bridge, bubbling ever more gently over the years? And we are, by definition, songwriters.

When Rodney and I made the plan to get together to work on the lyrics, I looked deeper into my family history for a woman who was around 20 years old at the start of the Civil War, and who appeared to have no children, perhaps indicating a husband or fiance killed in the war. I found Mary Ann Cash, and I put her together with William.

William and Mary Ann started to possess me. I thought of them all day long, every day, for the several weeks it took Rodney and me to complete the lyrics. I didnt know if he was a Massachusetts Union Cash or a Virginia Confederate Cash, but I didnt give it any thought. I sensed he was Confederate, but it didnt matter. It was his union with Mary Ann that infused his soul and gave him heroic qualities. It illuminated and emboldened me as well. I could see them, I knew what he had in his hand as he went to battle, I saw her dress and the ringlets in her hair and her tears, I saw the river that he crossed to go to war. I felt his fear.

I was standing in the shower one day and the last four lines of the last verse came to me in a rush:

Oh, Virginia, whence I came

Ill see you when Im younger

And Ill know you by your hills again

This time from six feet under.

I wept. He was from Virginia. And he was writing his own eulogy.

When my daughter Chelsea, who wrote a superb Civil War ballad herself called Where the Hell is Robert E. Lee?

heard her mother, father and stepfathers collective song, she reminded me, Mom, you know Virginia was divided. It was both Union and Confederate. I was startled. I hadnt remembered. William had been keeping his allegiance a secret, even from me.

The song is called When the Master Calls the Roll.

I dont usually revisit my songs after being immersed in writing, recording, mixing and mastering them for an album and hearing them dozens of times while doing so, but I still listen to Master every couple of weeks to remind me of the unpredictable sources of inspiration, of long-cherished goals finally achieved, of the importance of the ballad tradition, of time travel, family and, of course, the Unions: with our pasts, with people we once loved and those we love forever, between our singular attachment to home and our mutual devotion to realm, and the wrenching, magnificent union between who we were and who we are.

In the 1950s and 60s, governments in Africa and Asia started subsidizing the production of staple crops like rice and corn because it was the fastest way to fill bellies and reduce starvation in those regions. Today, needs have changed: The problem is no longer chronic hunger but malnutrition, and the solution is not more calories, but better calories.

Its a crucial difference. A diet of corn or rice may keep a person alive, but can result in myriad health issues from night-blindness to severe anemia. For decades, however, governments, agriculture companies and development organizations have focused so heavily on staple crop production that Africa and South Asia are now growing too much corn (or maize, as its widely known abroad) and rice, says Prabhu Pingali, director of the Tata-Cornell Agriculture and Nutrition Initiative at Cornell University. Most of the surpluses are used for animal feed, in some cases to drive the growth of industrial animal production.

These starchy foods are not only insufficient to combat malnutrition; they have also displaced crops that are more nutrient-rich but harder to produce. And while governments have undertaken significant efforts, particularly since the global food crisis of 2008, to control prices for staple crops, they have made little effort to support the production or affordability of more nutritious foods, says Pingali. (See his critique of food policies as published in a June 2015 report in the journal Food Security. At the site, click on Look Inside.)

Consider lentils, or dal, in India, a legume that is rich in protein, fiber and key nutrients. For decades, dal prices were rising relative to rice prices, but nobody said anything about it, said Pingali. Its only now that people are saying: Wait a minute. We need dal as much as we need rice. Wheres our dal strategy?

Governments around the world have long failed to promote the production or availability of a wide range of legumes, vegetables or fruits; in fact, just about every food other than corn, wheat or rice has been neglected. Like in many other countries, when you talk about food security, Kenyans are talking about how many bags of maize we have, said Mary Abukutsa-Onyango, a horticultural researcher at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology near Nairobi. She has a story to tell about how to start turning things around.

Ten years ago, vegetables that had been introduced during colonial times, mainly cabbage, collard greens and kale (sukuma wiki in Swahili), were standard fare in many parts of Kenya, particularly urban areas. Indigenous greens like African nightshade, jute mallow and spider plant had become associated with poverty, and many Kenyans chose not to eat them despite their greater nutritional value.

Abukutsa has published more than a dozen studies documenting the robust health benefits of the traditional vegetables, which are high in vitamin A, iron, zinc and other micronutrients often lacking in local diets. Moreover, she began working to encourage restaurants and supermarkets to serve or carry these vegetables; she and her students took field trips to help farmers grow them; and she helped to develop and publish recipes to make them more appealing and approachable, since preparation for some of the greens can be rather involved, and some traditional cooking knowledge had become less widespread as the vegetables popularity declined. Then she circulated her findings to other researchers, to get them interested in these nutritional powerhouses.

Today, restaurants throughout Nairobi serve greens like African nightshade to packed lunch crowds and supermarkets sell out of them while kale wilts on the shelf, a sign that the traditional vegetables have been taking over the exotic varieties. More farmers are growing the indigenous greens, and in the most convincing sign of increasing commercial interest, seed companies are breeding them.

Abukutsa has also worked to include the study and breeding of indigenous vegetables in university curriculums, because she knows that horticulture students often go on to become agriculture extension officers, the key source of farming advice for farmers around the country. Five universities now include the cultivation of indigenous fruits and vegetables in their syllabuses, she said. While the obvious goal was to ensure that knowledge about indigenous crops trickled down to farmers, there has also been a potentially more powerful result: The insights that drive these efforts have been trickling up as well, and are making their way into national policy.

Historically, Kenyas ministries of health and agriculture have operated in isolation from one another, but in 2012, they decided to collaborate on a new agricultural policy that emphasizes more diverse, underutilized and nutrient-dense crops, Abukutsa explained. The policy we had before had been focusing more on commercial crops for export and staples, she said. We needed a policy specifically addressing nutrition  not just talking about production.

The governments policy proposal has not been published yet because the draft text is not yet in final shape. But when it is, Abukutsa expects that it, like policy declarations before it, will affect the type of training available to farmers through the governments extension program and perhaps the types of crops for which research is funded.

The new policy will ensure that when we talk about food security, we are not just talking about maize  that we are talking about all that is available, she said. The resurgence in popularity of indigenous vegetables is too recent to show an impact on national health statistics, but Abukutsa is confident it will lead to improvement, especially in relation to malnutrition and degenerative diseases. Shell be tracking the results.

Other groups too are working to breed and improve the quality of indigenous crops in Kenya and around the globe. The Nairobi-based World Agroforestry Center has been leading a campaign to breed and conserve threatened varieties of indigenous fruits such as baobab, bush mango and African plum. It has a team working with small-scale farmers in Cameroon and other parts of Africa to domesticate fruit trees that have always grown in the wild. Largely because of deforestation, the fate of these trees in the wild is uncertain, so domestication may not only preserve them, it may also lead to the development of varieties of trees that will be more nutritious and resilient.

Elsewhere, the Taiwan-based World Vegetable Center has been breeding varieties of indigenous vegetables around the world, although its communications director, Maureen Mecozzi, said the work remains an uphill battle. Although many countries now recognize the need to encourage production of a more diverse set of crops, developing the policies, funding the research, and building the infrastructure to support that diversity is a big challenge, she said.

So far, there has been no research from which to quantify the changes in Kenyans consumption of indigenous fruits and vegetables, the impact of those crops on the nutritional status and overall health of populations. But researchers who work globally, like Pingali, and locally, like Abukutsa, are confident that the only path that makes sense is focusing more on vegetables and other nonstaple crops, whether they are indigenous or not.

Im now of the view that weve sort of beat the calorie problem, said Pingali. Even if you think towards 2050 horizons, weve got the tools and the mechanisms to support the demand for staple grains. Now, a lot of people will argue me on that. But I believe the same people who say we need to double the amount of rice, et cetera, should also be asked: Well, what about tomatoes? What about green beans?

As you think to the future and the demands for food in the future, he said, only focusing on staples puts us in this really funny situation of creating increased imbalance in our diets.

Should articles that appear in the news sections ever contain opinion?

If so, should they be clearly labeled as columns or commentary?

Is the line between opinion and straight news blurring more and more each day, and is this a bad thing?

These are questions that I hear from readers all the time.

And then, once in a while, something comes along to sharpen and focus the discussion.

Consider the first few paragraphs of an article that ran in the Texas edition of The Times, as well as in the news sections of the Web site.

From Mitt Romneys slap at 47 percent of the population that he says mooches off the government to President Obamas heavily mocked quote about businesses that take too much credit for their success, gaffes are all the rage on the presidential campaign trail these days. Invariably we are told these verbal boo-boos are bad enough to bring a presidential campaign to its knees, that somehow the blunder in question has set a new low, a dubious milestone. Two words: Rick Perry. I am not making light of the fallout from the nominees recent gaffes. They surely have incurred  or will incur  a political cost. The point is that, having covered the Texas governors botched presidential campaign from mid-August 2011 through mid-January 2012, I have witnessed the birth of a whole new level of faux pas. Think of it as the political equivalent of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Super-Gaffe, if you will. It is not just the magnitude of Perrys face plants that make them so different from what we are seeing out of the Romney and Obama camps. It is the reasons they happened in the first place. Despite the grass-roots enthusiasm and financial support that greeted Perry when he joined the race last year, he was not anywhere near ready for the presidential campaign spotlight. His late entry and lack of debate experience clearly hurt him.

It certainly sounds like something other than straight news coverage, doesnt it?

Heres another section from the same article, which was produced by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit news organization that provides local coverage for Times readers in the Texas area.

I hate Orlando, by the way. Its like Vegas without gambling or scantily clad women. Sprawling hotel complexes. Flip-flop-wearing Disney-goers. I shudder. But Ill say this: The Fox News-Google debate there on Sept. 22, 2011 had the best press filing center Ive ever been in. The decor screamed Google: multicolored beanbag chairs, plush white wall-to-wall carpet, leather furniture with Google-colored pillows, modular plastic chairs and plexiglass tables. They had a popcorn machine. A huge smoothie bar. Hamburgers with bacon strips. Pasta. All kinds of drinks and candy.

This is what the article looked like when it appeared in the Texas edition of The Times:

(To see the layout of the entire article including the author identification at the end of the first column of type, click here.)

So its easy enough to see why a reader, Michael Thaddeus, wrote to me as follows:

I am an Upper-West-Side liberal and no defender of Rick Perry. But I am appalled that The Times would run an article like this. Does The Times draw any distinction between news and opinion pieces any more? Are its news reporters expected to strive for objectivity, or are snide and snarky comments fair game? Is their reporting supposed to consist of facts or spin? Are they asked to avoid the first person, or may they freely inject a breezy personal narrative? For this story consists almost entirely of snark, spin, and prattle. Instead of leading off with factual statements, as a news story ought to do, it begins with an extended smackdown of Rick Perry that could have been lifted from Jon Stewart. It is an embarrassment to see it under The Timess name. The historic shift from newsprint to the Internet has led the Times to many new initiatives, like its alliance with The Texas Tribune. Why should it abandon its journalistic standards in the process? The Times has a venerable tradition of precision and rigor; why is it steering in the direction of the British press, preferring invective and anecdote to serious news?

I spoke with The Timess managing editor, Dean Baquet, about the article. He saw two problems: one about placement and layout; one about labeling.

The layout was too much like a normal news story, he said. That was misleading in the print edition, which the reader above never saw. The online version presented a different issue: labeling a story clearly.

We needed a way to signal to the reader that this is a little bit different, Mr. Baquet said.

After we spoke, he arranged for the authors identifier to be placed at the beginning of the article, making it clear that this was an excerpt from a book. (You can view it here.)

As for the broader issues about news and opinion, we have a constant discussion about this. We dont want them blended, Mr. Baquet said. Even columnists who appear in the news pages ought to be less opinion and more analysis, he said. They dont have the same license as a Brooks, a Dowd or a Krugman.

Mr. Baquet said he appreciated the readers response. Hes right to hold us accountable and tell us to be vigilant, he said.

Theres nothing wrong with opinion, analysis and commentary in The Times. They are part of what makes it interesting.

But readers ought to know what theyre getting. A book excerpt (or a column, for that matter) shouldnt masquerade as news.

Newspapers are sometimes criticized as having the view from nowhere. And thats a big discussion, something for another day.

But when the view is as clearly from somewhere as this, readers ought to know just where that somewhere is.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-02 00:00:00,How Trump's 'Off the Record' Remarks Crept Out,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Updated, Friday, March 4, 2016.

A reader, Ken Fitzpatrick, read about what has been called a secret recording of Donald Trumps meeting in January with the Times editorial board. On that recording, an article by Buzzfeeds editor in chief Ben Smith suggests, Mr. Trump says that his extreme position on deporting immigrants is not anything he would necessarily carry out in real, postelection life, but rather might be a starting point for negotiation.

Mr. Fitzpatrick writes:

Can you please elucidate why the NYT is conducting any part of an interview with a Presidential candidate off the record? Obviously if you have informed someone that part of the interview is off the record, going back on that would be unethical. But why, oh why, would you ever agree to that in the first place? Youre not interviewing someone whose cat was rescued from a tree. These are candidates for PRESIDENT. Youve created a situation where a candidate may have told NYT editors something that is illuminating and worth reporting on, but they are restrained from doing so.

I asked the editorial page editor, Andrew Rosenthal, to address the question. He told me that the editorial boards meetings with presidential candidates are often done on an off-the-record basis, at the candidates request. These meetings with candidates are not for the purpose of writing news articles, he emphasized, but are intended as informational sessions for the board so that board members can make observations, challenge the candidate on his or her positions, and eventually consider an endorsement.



The editorial board, an 18-member group that writes The Timess editorial positions, is a distinct entity from the reporters and editors in the newsroom.

Often, the sessions are recorded so that the board members can refer to the conversations as they make their considerations.

The endorsement interview with Mr. Trump on Jan. 5 was different for two reasons. One, it was attended by Dean Baquet, The Timess executive editor, who runs the newsroom staff. He is an occasional guest of the editorial board, he told me Tuesday.

Two, it was partly on the record because that was Mr. Trumps preference. This made it fair game for news coverage, particularly after a question arose about Mr. Trumps stance on tariffs. (The tariff portion of the meeting was on the record.)

So that the news side could check that on-the-record information, Mr. Rosenthal sent a digital copy of the recording to a newsroom editor whom he declined to name, with the reminder that there had been an agreement to treat portions of it as off the record.

These sessions are not about news gathering for stories, he told me. And, responding to those who are calling for the recording to be released publicly, he said: Its not as if we are sitting on a news story here, or holding something back from publication.

Is there a big story here? I dont know what Mr. Trump said in the meeting, nor do I have access to the recording. If Mr. Trumps statements are as Buzzfeed describes them, they may not be all that new. Mr. Trump has made similar comments before, including in an on-the-record interview with the Washington Examiner in January. (The Intercepts Glenn Greenwald made reference to this in a piece published Tuesday.)

Mr. Baquet told me that he didnt know who had spoken to Buzzfeed to describe the off-the-record portion of the session, and that he didnt intend to pursue it.

I dont know how it got out, but Im certainly not going to do a leak investigation, Mr. Baquet told me. He also said that he found the idea of an off-the-record agreement when there are 30 people in the room to be difficult to enforce and probably impractical.

Update: Mr. Baquet elaborated on what happened and his reaction in an interview with CBS This Morning on Thursday.

After Buzzfeeds report, many others followed, often with criticism of The Timess practices. The Times itself published an article that mentioned the dust-up later Monday.

My take: Having agreed to an off-the-record conversation, The Times (both editorial department and news side) was and is obligated to honor that arrangement, as Mr. Fitzpatrick rightly notes. The trouble here had to do with the mixing of editorial and news side, the mixing of on- and off-the-record, and the well-intentioned but hazardous sharing of a recording that involved off-the-record information.

Should The Times continue to host off-the-record sessions with candidates, so that the editorial board can consider endorsements? Im certainly no fan of The Times taking information from politicians or government officials that cannot be used or attributed, as Ive written endlessly. But this opinion-side practice for pre-endorsement meetings is a long-established one that can serve a worthwhile end, if everybody observes the rules.

What got The Times in trouble was the mixing of purposes (opinion and news), the blending of on- and off-the-record material in a single candidate session and the sharing of the recording  including among those who evidently didnt care much about an off-the-record agreement. All of that amounted to an accident waiting to happen.",[]

And while governments have undertaken significant efforts, particularly since the global food crisis of 2008, to control prices for staple crops, they have made little effort to support the production or affordability of more nutritious foods, says Pingali. (See his critique of food policies as published in a June 2015 report in the journal Food Security. At the site, click on Look Inside.)

Consider lentils, or dal, in India, a legume that is rich in protein, fiber and key nutrients. For decades, dal prices were rising relative to rice prices, but nobody said anything about it, said Pingali. Its only now that people are saying: Wait a minute. We need dal as much as we need rice. Wheres our dal strategy?

Governments around the world have long failed to promote the production or availability of a wide range of legumes, vegetables or fruits; in fact, just about every food other than corn, wheat or rice has been neglected. Like in many other countries, when you talk about food security, Kenyans are talking about how many bags of maize we have, said Mary Abukutsa-Onyango, a horticultural researcher at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology near Nairobi. She has a story to tell about how to start turning things around.

Ten years ago, vegetables that had been introduced during colonial times, mainly cabbage, collard greens and kale (sukuma wiki in Swahili), were standard fare in many parts of Kenya, particularly urban areas. Indigenous greens like African nightshade, jute mallow and spider plant had become associated with poverty, and many Kenyans chose not to eat them despite their greater nutritional value.

Abukutsa has published more than a dozen studies documenting the robust health benefits of the traditional vegetables, which are high in vitamin A, iron, zinc and other micronutrients often lacking in local diets. Moreover, she began working to encourage restaurants and supermarkets to serve or carry these vegetables; she and her students took field trips to help farmers grow them; and she helped to develop and publish recipes to make them more appealing and approachable, since preparation for some of the greens can be rather involved, and some traditional cooking knowledge had become less widespread as the vegetables popularity declined. Then she circulated her findings to other researchers, to get them interested in these nutritional powerhouses.

Today, restaurants throughout Nairobi serve greens like African nightshade to packed lunch crowds and supermarkets sell out of them while kale wilts on the shelf, a sign that the traditional vegetables have been taking over the exotic varieties. More farmers are growing the indigenous greens, and in the most convincing sign of increasing commercial interest, seed companies are breeding them.

Abukutsa has also worked to include the study and breeding of indigenous vegetables in university curriculums, because she knows that horticulture students often go on to become agriculture extension officers, the key source of farming advice for farmers around the country. Five universities now include the cultivation of indigenous fruits and vegetables in their syllabuses, she said. While the obvious goal was to ensure that knowledge about indigenous crops trickled down to farmers, there has also been a potentially more powerful result: The insights that drive these efforts have been trickling up as well, and are making their way into national policy.

Historically, Kenyas ministries of health and agriculture have operated in isolation from one another, but in 2012, they decided to collaborate on a new agricultural policy that emphasizes more diverse, underutilized and nutrient-dense crops, Abukutsa explained. The policy we had before had been focusing more on commercial crops for export and staples, she said. We needed a policy specifically addressing nutrition  not just talking about production.

The governments policy proposal has not been published yet because the draft text is not yet in final shape. But when it is, Abukutsa expects that it, like policy declarations before it, will affect the type of training available to farmers through the governments extension program and perhaps the types of crops for which research is funded.

The new policy will ensure that when we talk about food security, we are not just talking about maize  that we are talking about all that is available, she said. The resurgence in popularity of indigenous vegetables is too recent to show an impact on national health statistics, but Abukutsa is confident it will lead to improvement, especially in relation to malnutrition and degenerative diseases. Shell be tracking the results.

Other groups too are working to breed and improve the quality of indigenous crops in Kenya and around the globe. The Nairobi-based World Agroforestry Center has been leading a campaign to breed and conserve threatened varieties of indigenous fruits such as baobab, bush mango and African plum. It has a team working with small-scale farmers in Cameroon and other parts of Africa to domesticate fruit trees that have always grown in the wild. Largely because of deforestation, the fate of these trees in the wild is uncertain, so domestication may not only preserve them, it may also lead to the development of varieties of trees that will be more nutritious and resilient.

Elsewhere, the Taiwan-based World Vegetable Center has been breeding varieties of indigenous vegetables around the world, although its communications director, Maureen Mecozzi, said the work remains an uphill battle. Although many countries now recognize the need to encourage production of a more diverse set of crops, developing the policies, funding the research, and building the infrastructure to support that diversity is a big challenge, she said.

So far, there has been no research from which to quantify the changes in Kenyans consumption of indigenous fruits and vegetables, the impact of those crops on the nutritional status and overall health of populations. But researchers who work globally, like Pingali, and locally, like Abukutsa, are confident that the only path that makes sense is focusing more on vegetables and other nonstaple crops, whether they are indigenous or not.

Im now of the view that weve sort of beat the calorie problem, said Pingali. Even if you think towards 2050 horizons, weve got the tools and the mechanisms to support the demand for staple grains. Now, a lot of people will argue me on that. But I believe the same people who say we need to double the amount of rice, et cetera, should also be asked: Well, what about tomatoes? What about green beans?

As you think to the future and the demands for food in the future, he said, only focusing on staples puts us in this really funny situation of creating increased imbalance in our diets.

The Stone is a forum for contemporary philosophers and other thinkers on issues both timely and timeless.

I.

Art is often the subject of philosophy. But every now and then, a work of art  something other than a lecture or words on a page  can function as philosophy. Son of Saul, a film set in Auschwitz-Birkenau during the Holocaust, is such a work of art. It engages with a profound set of problems that also occupied the 19th-century Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard.

Written and directed by the Hungarian filmmaker Laszlo Nemes, Son of Saul won awards at Cannes, the Golden Globes and elsewhere before making its way to the Oscars to win the award for best foreign language film. It follows a day in the life of Saul, a member of the Sonderkommando, a group of mostly Jewish prisoners the Nazis forced to assist with herding people to the gas chambers, burning the bodies and collecting gold and valuables from the corpses. The film creates a direct, experiential and visceral engagement with these events by maintaining a relentless focus on the minute-to-minute unfolding of Sauls world.

In long, unbroken shots, we see the reality of the death camp revealed, its textures made tangible. By using close-ups and shallow focus images throughout, Nemes gives viewers no opportunity to disengage from Sauls point of view. It is as though we are shadowing him in hell. In immersing the viewer this way, Nemes places us there with Saul. This seems to be a moral imperative as well as an aesthetic choice. By eliciting a full, visceral engagement from the viewer, the film embodies the respect for the singular events of the Holocaust that more commercial treatments of the subject fail at. The film is a thoroughly personal, subjective account of the Holocaust.

The movies central theme is Sauls inner world, the loss and recovery of his soul. In scene after scene we see his face unmoved, his eyes watching but remote; there is a repellent sense of his  and our own  indifference. But then he witnesses a young boy briefly surviving the gas, only to be put to death a few minutes later by a Nazi doctor, possibly Josef Mengele. From this moment, he becomes consumed by the idea of giving the boy a proper Jewish burial. He claims the boy is his son. Sauls backstory is entirely missing from the film  we dont even learn if he really had a son  but that is beside the point. What matters, to him and to us is that he is able to feel again.

II.

Much of Kierkegaards philosophy is a warning against the tendency  greatly accelerated in modern times  to take an increasingly objective, abstract perspective on the world. While the paradigm example of this is science, it is most problematic when applied to ones own life and existence. To identify life with its abstractions is, in Kierkegaards view, a dangerous but all too common error.

There are generally two, radically different ways to relate to the world: objective and subjective. Objectivity is an orientation towards reality based on abstracting away, in various degrees, from subjective experience, and from individual points of view. A subjective orientation, on the other hand, is based on an attunement to the inner experience of feeling, sensing, thinking and valuing that unfolds in our day-to-day living. This distinction has been brought into contemporary philosophical discourse most notably by Thomas Nagel, in a number of his essays, most famously in What Is It Like to Be a Bat?

Now in print The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments An anthology of essays from The Timess philosophy series, published by Liveright.

The spectacular success of science in the past 300 years has raised hopes that it also holds the key to guiding human beings towards a good life. Psychology and neuroscience has become a main source of life advice in the popular media. But philosophers have long held reservations about this scientific orientation to how to live life. The 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume, for instance, famously pointed out, no amount of fact can legislate value, moral or otherwise. You cannot derive ought from is. But there is another, in some way more radical concern, expressed in Western philosophy most forcefully by Kierkegaard, and in literature by Dostoyevsky  two religiously inspired thinkers  namely that our experience of life matters in ineffable ways that no objective understanding of the world can capture.

Wittgenstein, in a well-known letter to Ludwig von Ficker, the publisher of the Tractatus, claimed that the whole point of the book is to show that what is important lies in what cannot be expressed in a scientific language. Suppose there was a super-intelligent organism  in a twist on Frank Jacksons knowledge argument  that lacked any feeling or experience, a creature of pure thought. Such a creature could, for example, know everything about the brain, even everything about the world at large, all in scientific terms; but it would know nothing of human significance. (An interesting video depicting Jacksons argument can be found here.)

This line of thought holds that human significance comes from subjective experience and that human beings cannot thrive without an orientation towards, and engagement with, the subjective experience of their lives, and that, as a matter of fact, a predominantly objective, conceptual orientation to oneself is detrimental to well being. As Kierkegaard put it, Science and scholarship want to teach that becoming objective is the way. Christianity teaches that the way is to become subjective, to become a subject.

Science is the best method we have for approaching the world objectively. But in fact it is not science per se that is the problem, from the point of view of subjectivity. It is objectivizing, in any of its forms. One can frame a decision, for example, in objective terms. One might decide between career choices by weighing differences in workloads, prestige, pay and benefits between, say, working for an advanced technology company versus working for a studio in Hollywood. We are often encouraged to make choices by framing them in this way. Alternatively, one might try to frame the decision more in terms of what it might be like to work in either occupation; in this case, one needs to have the patience to dwell in experience long enough for ones feelings about either alternative to emerge. In other words, one might deliberate subjectively.

This is, of course, a crude opposition. We hardly ever deliberate purely objectively or purely subjectively. And there are built-in limits to subjective decision-making. Often, as the philosopher Laurie Paul has argued (as explained in an essay here by the psychologist Paul Bloom last year), we are not even in a position to imagine what our lives will be like after a life-altering decision.

The bottom line is, what Kierkegaard pointed out is a steady push in society toward more objectivity, and less engagement with subjectivity, with what is  sometimes derisively  called inwardness. There is less of a tendency for modern humans to live thoroughly immersed in life, experiencing it, and more of a tendency of being mostly distracted by its abstractions, by all the ways our culture conceptually frames our existence as individuals, Democrats and Republicans, man and women, one percenters, workers, consumers, and so on. And here, as a result, is the problem: by becoming less subjective, we become more cut off from sources of meaning and value.

III.

One does not have to agree with Kierkegaards single-minded, hostile rejection of objective thought and objectivity to still consider what he has to say about the cultivation of subjectivity, because that is where his major insights lie. So what about his exhortation to become subjective? Why is there even a need for this? Isnt it true that, given our experience of life, we already are? It seems that one cannot fail to be a subject, to be subjective. However, as Kierkegaard points out, the mind can flee its own subjectivity; instead of dwelling in the presence of ones experience, one can escape into alienation; into theorizing about needs, goals and happiness, and live by abstract principles and objective measures. As Freud has described, there are various ways of doing this: by repressing experience, dissociating from it, numbing it, turning away from it.

Most commonly, we turn our back on subjectivity to escape from pain. Suffering, ones own, or others, might become bearable, one hopes, when one takes a step back and views it objectively, conceptually, abstractly. And when it comes to something as monumental as the Holocaust, ones mind cannot help but be numbed by the sheer magnitude of it. How could one feel the pain of all those people, sympathize with millions? Instead one is left with the facts, the numbers.

Son of Saul approaches its stupefying subject in a way that echoes Kierkegaards imperative. The audience is not given any space to distance from Sauls reality or turn it into an abstraction of suffering, innocence, or goodness; the film doesnt depict the story of the Holocaust in generic ways that would encourage getting lost in a historical account. Rather, it allows viewers to feel its textures, and perceive the sights and sounds that make up individual experience. In this way, the film depicts what many critics have argued could not be depicted.

It achieves this by not letting the viewer off the hook, by demanding participation, as far as it is possible in the imagination, in the experience of the Holocaust. As Kierkegaard puts it in Either/Or, For one may have known a thing many times and acknowledged it ... and yet it is only by the deep inward movements, only by the indescribable emotions of the heart, that for the first time you are convinced that what you have known belongs to you ... for only the truth that edifies is truth for you.

In addition to employing a subjective approach visually, Nemes also makes subjectivity the theme of the film. It depicts the loss of subjectivity both at the larger societal level, as well as at the level of the individual. It is this double engagement of subjectivity that makes the film so effective.

The death camp is the absurd end point of technological thinking, of the objectification of human beings. Totalitarian regimes the world over know the value and power of subjectivity  that is why they work so hard to destroy it. Murdered Jews are referred to as pieces in the movie by the German camp administrators. The victims are denied the status of subjects  they are mere physical objects to be dealt with. In this world of mechanized objectivity, the Nazis industrial brutality is considered entirely normal. Any individual not obeying its construct of proper behavior only has their own conscience to rely on.

Imre Kertesz, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature for his autobiographical novel about a Hungarian boy taken to Auschwitz, explained this vividly in his acceptance speech when he describes a crucial experience that contributed to writing the novel: The experience was about solitude, a more difficult life ... the need to step out of the mesmerizing crowd, out of history, which renders you faceless and fateless.

At a yet deeper level, it is the subjectivity of its protagonist that is the main theme of the movie. Through his encounter with the boy Saul gains back his soul. At the moment that Saul witnesses the killing of the boy, he becomes  in Kierkegaards beautiful expression  a Knight of Faith, someone who made a commitment, and who can pursue it with passion, as if it was the surest thing, even in the face of overwhelming odds. Saul is finally able to experience the death and destruction around him by committing to this one, dead boy; not unlike the film nudges the viewers to relate to the Holocaust as real, by committing them to this one, near dead protagonist. Having seen it you will remember, deliriously, having been there, in some small part of your body. It is a duty created by the Holocaust, suggests the movie. It is a dark counterpart of the imperative for Jews to relive the experience of deliverance from bondage into freedom each year at Passover.

At the same time that it depicts Sauls conversion, Son of Saul also directly engages the viewers subjectivity by its style and mode of presentation; its achievement is to embody the dynamic that is its very subject matter. Kierkegaard called such communication  the only sort he thought befitting a subjective thinker  double reflection. He thought this is the only way that the authenticity of the message can be guarded  the only way to avoid being a town crier of subjectivity. In this way, Son of Saul is both art and philosophy: It makes inwardness visible. Through its depiction of death and destruction it reminds us how to live.

TO TAKE up the topic of how The Times has covered the Islamic State kidnappings of Western journalists and aid workers is to venture into a journalistic minefield.









The memorable stories of recent months bring up strong and conflicting feelings among journalists, former hostages, family members of past hostages, and certainly Times readers.

The Times stories were riveting to read; they broke new ground and served the public interest by opening a hidden subject to the light of public scrutiny and debate.

But some say that such coverage may give brutal killers the publicity they seek or that it could even put hostages in worse danger. And, in two different ways, the accuracy and sourcing of some of these stories have been challenged.

The stories are among the most striking work in the career of the Times reporter who wrote them, Rukmini Callimachi. They began appearing soon after she arrived at The Times from The Associated Press early last year.

I was drawn into this subject when I received a letter in February from Michael Foley, the younger brother of James Foley, an American journalist in Syria kidnapped in 2012. Last summer, he was the first of the Americans held hostage by ISIS to be murdered, his beheading recorded in a horrific video seen worldwide.

Michael Foley contends that Times articles portrayed his brother inaccurately  particularly when they depicted him as an enthusiastic convert to Islam and as someone who had been repeatedly waterboarded and routinely beaten. He also takes issue with the description of American and British hostages being singled out for extra abuse. Those things arent true, he says, and The Times should correct the record.

Michael Foley said that his own inquiry, which included his speaking to former ISIS hostages, had found that his brother, a Catholic, did not truly convert but acted under pressure from his captors; and also that he had been waterboarded only once and not singled out for excessive abuse.

In addition to Mr. Foleys complaints, several journalists, inside and outside The Times, told me they doubted the reliability of one of Ms. Callimachis sources, a Syrian journalist and former hostage.

Joseph Kahn, the ranking international editor, told me that The Times had gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure the stories were accurate, both before publication and afterward, when complaints arose.

The stories were very deeply reported from multiple sources, he said. Rukmini traveled widely and took many weeks to persuade individuals with direct knowledge of what happened to open up to us.

After complaints came, The Times re-reported some aspects of the stories, including re-interviewing the Syrian journalist, Mr. Kahn said. He remains convinced that the stories are first-rate examples of quality reporting.

The Times comes to this topic laden with baggage. In 2008, one of the papers reporters, David Rohde, was kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan and, after seven months of captivity, managed to escape. The Times kept his kidnapping quiet for those months  asking other media organizations to cooperate in a news blackout  and worked with the F.B.I. to try to free him.

Mr. Rohde  a two-time Pulitzer winner, one of them for The Times, who is now at Reuters  declined to be interviewed for this column. The Atlantics Matt Schiavenza in November wrote that one of Mr. Rohdes observations (which had been made earlier to The Intercepts Ryan Devereaux) differed with an element of The Timess reporting last year.

A groundbreaking story by Ms. Callimachi in July reported that the American government refuses to negotiate with hostage takers or pay ransom, while many European governments have allowed tens of millions of dollars to be paid through intermediaries. As a result, it said, more Europeans than Americans are being abducted.

Ive seen no clear evidence that groups are grabbing more Europeans and fewer Americans, Mr. Rohde wrote. They take any foreigners they can get and use the Europeans for ransom and the Americans for publicity.

At least two major journalistic issues arise here. First, in the dangerous environment of the past year, with many hostages still being held, was it appropriate to shine one of the worlds brightest spotlights on these kidnappings and their aftermath? And, second, has the reporting been held to the highest standards?

After editors heard Mr. Foleys complaint, The Times did a deeper dive into the question of religious conversions. A resulting story, by Jim Yardley, was not intended as a corrective, Mr. Kahn said, but as an amplification of the intriguing topic of religious conversions of Western hostages. Mr. Foley told me Mr. Yardleys piece did not satisfy him.

It didnt get to the heart of my issue, which is that the original reporting wasnt accurate, he told me.

After hearing complaints from others about the reliability and motivation of a major source in a December story about American policy on hostage negotiations, The Times re-interviewed that source, a Syrian journalist, Louai Abo Aljoud. Afterward, Mr. Kahn told me, he saw no need for correction, other than a minor one about the Syrian journalists use of an assumed name.

To some extent in articles like this, uncontested truth is bound to be elusive. Did a hostage in fear for his life make a genuine religious conversion or was he simply under duress? And was he singled out for unusually cruel treatment? Its impossible to know. Given that, the stories pervasive tone of certainty  reporting, for example, that Mr. Foley was captivated by Islam  may have been unwarranted.

On the broader point, I think The Times was right to push for aggressive reporting on this often hidden subject. That has to be done with sensitivity, but its right to pull away the cover of darkness.

Probably more than anyone, I pushed Rukmini to do these stories, the executive editor, Dean Baquet, told me, and he is proud of them.

This is something we can no longer leave in the shadows, as painful as it is, he said. What ISIS has done has made hostage-taking a front-and-center foreign policy issue.

Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, told me that in the summer of 2013, as many as 30 international journalists were missing, and there was almost no coverage because of blackouts. (Since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, more than 90 journalists have been abducted while covering it, an unprecedented number since C.P.J.s founding in 1981. Today, about 20 journalists are missing in Syria.)

Although he supported the blackout on the coverage of Mr. Rohdes abduction at that time, Mr. Simon has changed his mind. I support more coverage, he said, offering particular praise for Ms. Callimachis July article on disparate ransom policies, which brought the debate out into the open.

But, he added, this work presents a major responsibility for journalists. Not only may individual lives hang in the balance but also, with the Islamic State, youre dealing with a group thats looking to publicize as broadly and widely as possible their horrific actions.

News articles can advance their propaganda efforts and can be incredibly painful for the families of hostages. But trumping that, Mr. Simon said, is that lack of public attention can increase danger, and that governments tend to act when issues are getting media attention.

Whats more, media organizations run the risk of adhering to a double standard when journalists are involved if they black out the news: silence when colleagues are in trouble, but news value otherwise ruling the day.

In general, The Times tries to respect the wishes of family members. I asked Mr. Baquet what would happen if a prominent corporate executive were kidnapped. Would The Times observe a news blackout at the familys request?

I dont think there is a yes or no to that one, Mr. Baquet said by email. If it is the head of General Motors, how could we not report? But its complex.

None of this is easy. There are no good answers to some of the questions that arise.

But given the emotional and moral minefield, and the terribly high stakes, this much is certain: Reporting must be done with particular caution, and with as much journalistic rigor as can be mustered.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-01-27 00:00:00,Should The Times Have Been a Tougher Watchdog in Flint?,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Updated, 4 p.m.

Almost a year ago, last March, The Times published a frightening article about the drinking water in Flint, Mich.

Heres an excerpt:

When fecal coliform bacteria showed up in parts of the city last summer, residents were told to boil their water before using it. Officials addressed the issue by pumping extra chlorine into the system, but in solving one problem, they created another. The high chlorine levels led to elevated levels of total trihalomethanes or T.T.H.M., which required another public notice in January. Residents will again receive a notice of elevated T.T.H.M. levels in the mail later this month, Mayor Dayne Walling has said. Long-term consumption of water with high T.T.H.M. levels can lead to liver or kidney troubles and an increased risk of cancer, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

The article appeared on Page A16 in print. Then, more than six months went by. In October, The Times ran one brief and two articles about Flint.

Then, nothing of substance until this month, when a state of emergency was declared in Flint.

Since then, the nation has been up in arms about what happened in Flint, and more to the point, what didnt happen. The Times published a highly critical editorial last week (Outrage is the only sensible response to this man-made disaster, it said). And some presidential candidates have hammered away at it.

Issues of race and class are on everyones minds. Would this have happened in a rich, white community? Many, quite reasonably, doubt it.

And some Times readers are wondering why the news media, The Times included, didnt do more, earlier, when it might have made a real difference.

Donald Brandshaft wrote to me about it:

The media coverage of the Flint water problems strikes as somewhat hypocritical. One of the reasons that this could not happen in a white community is that every newspaper in the country would have reported it by May. The people of Flint were severely hurt by their governor and let down by the E.P.A., but they were also let down by the news media. I didnt notice any media self-examination resulting from this lapse.

I asked a deputy executive editor, Matt Purdy, about The Timess coverage. He reviewed it on Tuesday and spoke to the national editor, Alison Mitchell.

After doing so, Mr. Purdy told me that he was proud that The Times had written the March article, and had returned to the subject in October. He praised the quality of recent reporting work that landed two related Flint articles on the front page.

If The Times had dug in and devoted investigative resources to the situation, Mr. Purdy said, the results certainly could have had impact and been important. But the same few Chicago-based reporters have been covering a wide range of stories in the middle of the country  the Tamir Rice case in Cleveland, problems in the Detroit schools, the aftermath of racial unrest in Ferguson, Mo., and Rahm Emanuels re-election in Chicago, among others. Mr. Purdy wrote to me:

The Midwest is one of the busiest regions of the country in terms of news, from Ferguson to police shootings to political unrest in Chicago. If we had poured more of the valuable time of reporters into Flint, we would not have gotten other stories.

He added: The resources of regional and national outlets are stretched increasingly thin. We are fortunate to have a robust and talented national staff, but we certainly cant get to every important story and we cant go deep on every one we get to. Perhaps most disturbing is that there are likely hundreds of troubling events unfolding around the country at any time that are getting very little if any attention from the media.

As Columbia Journalism Review wrote, some of the most important watchdog work in Flint was done by a dogged investigative reporter, Curt Guyette, who no longer works for a news organization at all but for an arm of the American Civil Liberties Union. C.J.R. also cited the Detroit and Flint newspapers for their work. (After this post was published, a number of readers pointed out that Rachel Maddow of MSNBC has been a strong and persistent voice on the Flint story for weeks.)

My take: The Times got off to a strong start with its initial Flint story in March. It was good to return to the subject in October; and this months coverage has been thorough. But there could have been, and should have been, much more. If  for example  the March article had been followed up with some serious digging, and if the resulting stories had been given prominent display, public officials might have been shamed into taking action long before they did.

I understand the argument that The Times  which covers the whole nation and the globe  cant be responsible for investigating every local problem. With only a few Midwestern reporters, pulled in many directions, editors must make tough decisions about how to spend their time and energy.

The counterargument is this: Imagine if The Times really had taken on the Flint outrage with energy and persistence many months ago. With its powerful pulpit and reach, The Times could have held public officials accountable and prevented human suffering. Thats what journalistic watchdogs are supposed to do. As traditional local investigative reporting withers, The Timess role becomes ever more important.

Yes, that takes journalistic resources. Investigative reporting is notoriously time-consuming and expensive. The Times, to its credit, does a great deal of it.

But were such resources really unavailable in this case?

After all, enough Times firepower somehow has been found to document Hillary Clintons every sneeze, Donald Trumps latest bombast, and Marco Rubios shiny boots. There seem to be plenty of Times resources for such hit-seeking missives as breadfacing, or for the Magazines thorough exploration of buffalo plaid and lumbersexuals. And staff was available to produce this weeks dare-you-not-to-click video on the rising social movement known as Free the Nipple.

Isnt it a matter of choosing how to deploy the 1,300 members of the newsroom staff? Call it a question of priorities. Given all thats happened, especially on issues involving race, maybe its time to beef up that talented Midwest staff.

If The Times had kept the pressure on the Flint story, the resulting journalism might not have made the trending list  but it would have made a real difference to the people of Flint, who were in serious need of a powerful ally.",[]

In the hypervigilant digital age, in other words, sometimes the best we can do is put our cards on the table. Toward that end, I want to tell Times readers about my plans for the next few months.

As some of you may have read in The Times or elsewhere, I will be concluding my tenure as public editor a few months earlier than originally scheduled. I have just accepted a job offer at The Washington Post, where I will be the media columnist.

I will move from New York City to Washington to start work there in May, and will finish up at The Times in April. (My four-year contract with The Times was due to expire in August; and, although I am leaving early, I have been in the role longer than any of my predecessors, most of whom stayed for two years or less.)

In the weeks ahead, Ill still be doing the job of representing Times readers to the best of my ability. Some of that involves responding individually to the large amount of reader email that my assistant and I receive every day. And Ill write a few more columns, as well, though perhaps not at quite the same pace Ive been keeping. There are some subjects on my ever-changing list that I want to get to before leaving, and a few that I will want to revisit.

If an issue arises involving The Washington Post, my plan is to inform The Timess publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., and to recuse myself, handing the matter off to The Timess standards editor and other top editors.

Im glad that Ill be able to continue writing about the issues that I care so much about  the crucial role of the press in our democracy, journalistic standards and ethics, and more. Ive been very touched by some of the comments from readers in recent weeks that encouraged me to keep writing about these issues in my next professional chapter. Im planning to do just that.

Here is Mr. Sulzbergers memo to staff announcing my departure, and the plans for selecting a new Times public editor. The Times has affirmed its commitment to continuing the position. And here is a memo from The Washington Post describing my new job.

Please know what a privilege it has been to represent Times readers, who feel passionately and communicate eloquently about their newspaper, and want it held to the highest possible standards.",[]
nytimes.com,2013-03-05 00:00:00,"For Times Environmental Reporting, Intentions May Be Good but the Signs Are Not","['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Judging by appearances, things are not looking good for environmental reporting at The Times.

In January, The Times dismantled its environmental reporting pod  a group of reporters and editors solely devoted to that subject who worked with one another to develop stories and projects.

Then, on Friday, The Timess Green blog ended after more than four years (initially as Green Inc.).

Many readers are unhappy and disillusioned about the changes, believing that they speak to declining interest on the part of top editors in this important subject. And in the case of the blog, they miss having a single online destination for environmental developments that may not be big enough to make it into the paper and for other voices from freelance contributors.

John Tuxill of Bellingham, Wash., expressed the disappointment of many in an e-mail to me, writing that the blog had been a major source of news for him in recent years:

Environmental issues are not becoming any less important or prevalent in our lives. On the contrary, I believe that climate change, water resources depletion, food production trends and other environmental challenges are the defining issues of our times. So why on earth is The Times closing the blog? I teach environmental studies classes to college students in Washington State. I make a point of telling my students that The Times is one of their best sources for environmental news and staying up-to-date on the events affecting our nation and our planet. I cannot in good conscience tell my students that anymore. Im not even sure where to tell them to look now for environmental news in The Times. Youll forgive me for being highly skeptical that The Times will find other ways to cover environmental news as efficiently. I believe this decision is as shortsighted and nonsensical as they come.

The moves have been criticized in the journalism press, as well. Curtis Brainard, writing in Columbia Journalism Review online, called it terrible news, and was harshly critical of Times management:

Theyve made a horrible decision that ensures the deterioration of The Timess environmental coverage at a time when debates about climate change, energy, natural resources and sustainability have never been more important to public welfare ...

Andrew Revkin, who writes the Dot.Earth opinion blog on NYTimes.com, mourned the Green blogs demise in a post, calling it an excellent aggregator of environmental news and analysis that didnt fit in the flow of conventional articles. And he said that he would list, on his blog, the Green blogs former freelance contributors, so that his readers could continue to follow their work.

I talked with a number of writers and editors at The Times, including the blogs editor, Nancy Kenney, who has been reassigned to the Culture department, and to the managing editor, Dean Baquet, who made the decision in consultation with other top editors.

Mr. Baquet said the move was done, in part, for cost-cutting reasons, as The Times eliminated 30 management positions, but more for coverage reasons.

I think our environmental coverage has suffered from the segregation  it needs to be more integrated into all of the different areas, like science, politics and foreign news, he said.

He agreed that environmental coverage is of great importance, and said that having The Timess environmental reporters working on other desks is the best way to drive more of these important stories onto the home page and the front page.

The thinking used to be that youve got to have a blog for every subject you care about, Mr. Baquet said. That thinking has changed, he said, and now readers can find environmental news on the Caucus blog, the Bits blog and in other places.

(Some readers also noted unhappily that the news of the Green blogs demise was announced at 5 p.m. on Friday, a convenient time for an inconvenient truth. Mr. Baquet agreed that, in retrospect, we could have handled that better.)

As for the complaint that readers with a particular interest in the environment can no longer go to a single online destination, I acknowledge that criticism, he said. He said, though, that he hopes that a continuing Web site redesign may make it easier for readers to locate the topics that they are particularly interested in.

Ms. Kenney described the blogs strengths. When there was an overriding issue or event, the blog was a locus and a magnet, attracting tens of thousands of readers to a particular post, she said, with the Deepwater Horizon spill as a great example.

She added, Id be the first to admit that the blog was uneven because of a shortage of resources. It needed a dedicated editor, she said; as deputy environment editor, she was able to give it only a few hours a day, given her other duties.

Heres my take: Im not convinced that The Timess environmental coverage will be as strong without the team and the blog. Something real has been lost on a topic of huge and growing importance.

Especially given The Timess declared interest in attracting international readers and younger readers, I hope that Times editors  very soon  will look for new ways to show readers that environmental news hasnt been abandoned, but in fact is of utmost importance. So far, in 2013, they are not sending that message.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-02-29 00:00:00,Ideas Help No One on a Shelf. Take Them to the World.,"['The End', 'The Great Divide', 'The Conversation', 'Tina Rosenberg', 'Errol Morris', 'All Contributors']","Fixes looks at solutions to social problems and why they work.

Have you thought of a clever product to mitigate climate change? Did you invent an ingenious gadget to light African villages at night? Have you come up with a new kind of school, or new ideas for lowering the rate of urban shootings?

Thanks, but we have lots of those.

Whatever problem possesses you, we already have plenty of ways to solve it. Many have been rigorously tested and have a lot of evidence behind them  and yet theyre sitting on a shelf.

So dont invent something new. If you want to make a contribution, choose one of those ideas  and spread it.

Spreading an idea can mean two different things. One is to take something thats working in one place and introduce it somewhere else. If you want to reduce infant mortality in Cleveland, why not try whats working in Baltimore?

Well, you might not know about whats working because theres no quick system for finding it.

Even when a few people do search out the answer, innovative ideas dont spread by themselves. To become well known, they require effort from their originators. For example, a Bogota, Colombia, maternity hospital invented Kangaroo Care  a method of keeping premature babies warm by strapping them 24/7 to Moms chest. It saved a lot of lives in Bogota. But what allowed it to save lives around the world was a campaign to spread it to other countries.

The Colombians established Fundacion Canguro and got grants from wealthy countries to bring groups of doctors and nurses from all over to visit Bogota for two or three weeks. Once the visitors had gone back and set up a program in their hospital, the foundation loaned them a doctor and nurse to help get them started. Save the Children now leads a global partnership to spread Kangaroo Care, with the goal of reaching half the world.

In short, this work requires dedicated organizations, a smart program and lots of money.

The other meaning of spreading an idea is creating ways to get new inventions out to people who need them.

When I talk to college students or anyone whos thinking about entrepreneurship or targeting global poverty, the gadget is where 99 percent of people start thinking, said Nicholas Fusso, the director of D-Prize (its slogan: Distribution is development). Thats important  but the biggest problems in the poverty world arent a lack of gadgets or new products. Its figuring out how people can have access to them. So D-Prize gives seed money, in chunks of $10,000 to $20,000, to tiny new organizations that have good ideas for how to distribute useful things.

This analysis may be familiar to regular readers of Fixes. Indeed, the first Fixes column, more than five years ago, focused on distribution: getting health care to people in rural Africa by putting health care workers on motorcycles and keeping the bikes running.

Fusso likes to use the example of malaria. The modern insecticide-treated bed net was invented in 1980, when one million people a year  the vast majority small children  were dying. What impact did the invention itself have? None at all, at first. Deaths each year rose gradually, and then rose sharply  to a peak of 1.8 million in 2004, when they began to fall.

What happened then? The world finally started putting money into fighting malaria, including distributing bed nets. Today, deaths from malaria are one third of what they were in 2004.

The invention was crucial, of course  but it was distribution that gave it impact.

Also in 2004, a French researcher named Pascaline Dupas, working in Kenya, was talking to a Kenyan colleague who was running to give some money to her high school-age sister. These girls have no money, and I dont want her to end up with a sugar daddy, the colleague said.

But thats crazy! Dupas replied. Doesnt she know she could get H.I.V.?

Perhaps she did know, but the vast majority of girls in Kenya did not. The assumption was widespread that someone relatively wealthy and established was unlikely to have the virus. Three quarters of 15-year-old Kenyans surveyed thought teenage boys were more likely to be infected than men over 25.

This was very wrong. H.I.V. rates were six times higher in men aged 20-24 than they were in boys 15-19, and the rates rose with each additional year of sexual activity.

Across the world, but especially in high-poverty countries, many high school girls look for boyfriends who are five to 10 years older, because those men have sophistication, stability and money. These sugar daddies give the girls gifts, pick them up from school in nice cars, pay their school fees and even help their families.

Moreover, girls are much more likely to have unprotected sex with a sugar daddy than with boys their own age. The power imbalance in the relationship makes it difficult to insist on condom use. And avoiding pregnancy is less important to them, as wealthier and more stable men make better husbands and are more likely to marry them than teen boys are.

Sugar daddies were one big reason that the H.I.V. rate for teenage girls in Kenya was five times higher than for teenage boys. Dupas wondered if simply providing the girls with correct information about the relative risks could change things.

She designed a 40-minute lesson to help girls in eighth grade (average age: 15) to understand the H.I.V. risks associated with sugar daddies. It started with a 10-minute video. Then a facilitator from a local civic group showed statistics about actual infection rates by age and gender. The class discussed the reasons for these patterns, and gradually came around to talking about sugar daddies.

This training was tested in 328 schools in western Kenya against the countrys standard school anti-AIDS curriculum, which promoted abstinence. Dupass message was very different: Your risks are far less if you choose a partner your own age.

It made us very popular with the young boys in the class, she said.

The next year, Dupas counted how many girls had become pregnant, and recorded the fathers ages. The group that heard Dupass lesson had a pregnancy rate 28 percent lower than those who received the standard abstinence-based curriculum. And their rate of child bearing with men five years or more their senior was 61 percent less.

Dupas didnt have money to do H.I.V. testing, so she didnt study the effects on H.I.V. incidence. But pregnancy is likely a good stand-in for unprotected sex, and therefore H.I.V. infections.

For a 40-minute single intervention at negligible cost, it was a stunning impact.

And then  nothing happened. One organization tried to replicate the study in Cameroon, but didnt collect the right data. Dupas submitted the paper to various journals, finally publishing it in the American Economic Journal in 2011. Still, nothing happened  perhaps because people who design anti-AIDS programs dont usually read economics journals, she said.

Finally, someone ran with it. But it was only because a young American, Noam Angrist, had studied at M.I.T. with Esther Duflo, a professor who was Dupass mentor. Angrist had also worked at J-PAL, a laboratory Duflo helped to establish to carry out scientific studies of anti-poverty programs.

In 2013 Angrist was living in Botswana, which has the second-highest H.I.V prevalence of any nation  45 percent of 40-year-old men. With some friends, he did some small experiments to see whether the same misconceptions about sugar daddies existed in Botswana as in Kenya. They did. When we showed them the actual graph, they would physically gasp, he said. Young1ove was in business.

The new organization quickly won $20,000 from D-Prize and formed a partnership with Evidence Action, a new organization that seeks to scale up proven inventions. So far Young1ove has taught the mini-course  adapted for Botswana  to 35,000 youths, operating in a third of Botswanas schools. As the program grows, a study is comparing schools that have it  taught two different ways  to schools that dont yet, to test both the programs impact and whether teachers or youth facilitators get better results. The organization is also carrying out small pilot programs in South Africa and Zimbabwe.

Earlier this month, Young1ove and Evidence Action won a $700,000 grant from the new Global Innovation Fund, whose donors are the overseas development agencies of the United States, Britain, Sweden and Australia, and the Omidyar Network. The prize money will go to finishing the study and, if the results are good, rapid growth.

Young1ove is the largest of at least three groups trying to distribute Dupass curriculum. Jeunes Braves is working in Togo, and Power2Girls is starting in Ghana. Both won D-Prizes as well.

Organizations like J-PAL and Evidence Actions parent, Innovations for Poverty Action, are sometimes called the Randomistas, because they do randomized control trials. Theyve led a shift in anti-poverty work toward using scientific studies to see whats effective. In the last seven, eight years, weve moved away from its all about the talented individual to its all about the impact, said Gabriel Broadbar, director of the New York University Reynolds program in social entrepreneurship (which runs its own mini D-Prize).

The Randomistas have identified programs that work well and cheaply: bed nets, school-based deworming to rid children of parasites, installing chlorine dispensers at village taps, among others. The logical step now is to scale them up.

This is what Evidence Action tries to do. Karen Levy, the groups director of global innovation and beta, said that the challenges differ greatly from those of inventing something new: How do you fit the program into a countrys policy and regulatory framework? Whats a sustainable business model? How do you make it easy for lots of people  not just your original staff  to do well?

She used the example of deworming. Rather than send people to every single school, how do you design trainers of trainers in a cascade so it can be delivered by tens of thousands of teachers with the same results? she said.

Philanthropists and government aid agencies are only starting to get interested in the challenges of distribution  one new philanthropy that does have this focus is Good Ventures. As for academia, it still rewards invention almost exclusively. Theres a lot of attention and award-giving and prize-giving and credit to people who come up with fancy new ideas instead of reaching people and having impact, said Brodbar. The incentives arent aligned. The culture of social entrepreneurship needs to change.

Recognizing the true value of spreading an idea would also allow people who arent inventors (which is most of us) to get involved in social change. The notion that if you want to engage in [social entrepreneurship] you have to have the big idea does a disservice to this space and people who want to play a role in it, said Brodbar. Its a much wider front door.

nytimes.com,2016-02-02 00:00:00,'A Very Heated Reaction' to The Timess Endorsement of Hillary Clinton,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Updated, 10:30 a.m.

In what surely qualifies as understatement, The Timess top opinion editor calls The Timess recent endorsement of Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary the source of plenty of reaction.

Theres been a lot of readership, a lot of reader comments, the editorial page editor, Andrew Rosenthal, told me on Monday.

Thats for sure. Over 5,600 comments have been posted on the editorial, which was published online Saturday and in Sundays paper. A vast majority of those comments came from Bernie Sanders supporters, who vehemently disagreed with the editorial boards conclusion. (The Times also expressed a preference, within the Republican field of candidates, for John Kasich, the Ohio governor. That, however, is not an endorsement; the Clinton editorial is one.)

A typical comment, and one gathering one of the highest number of recommends, or reader agreement, came from Daniel Ricketti of New Jersey, who wrote:

Disappointed in this pick. NYT never even gave Bernie a shot. Straight from the beginning basically no attention.

Many readers have complained to me that Mr. Sanderss campaign and viability has been underplayed in the pages of The Times  and Ive written about this numerous times. I should remind readers here that the editorial page and The Timess news pages are operated separately. There is no involvement by the news editors or reporters in any editorial or endorsement, nor does the editorial board influence the news coverage.

As weve seen throughout the campaign, the reaction had a weird and hard-to-calculate Bernie-Sanders-enthusiasm factor, because his supporters are particular skilled at getting people to speak out publicly, and make use of social media, Mr. Rosenthal told me.

I asked him (because a reader had pointed it out to me) why there were no Times Picks within the comments. Mr. Rosenthal said that comments on Times editorials were never awarded the gold emblems because its illogical. It makes no sense for The Times to give extra points to those who agree or disagree with the papers own institutional voice, he said.

He added that he doesnt like Times Picks anywhere: I think we should re-evaluate that practice. (This blog also does not award Times Picks. While its undoubtedly true that some comments are more incisive than others, I like to let readers judge that.)

The editorial also prompted an unusual number of letters to the editor, about 200, according to Thomas Feyer, the letters editor.

The letters were fairly split between agreeing and disagreeing with our editorial  probably slightly more anti-Hillary than pro-, Mr. Feyer said. And there was the usual mix between the thoughtful and well-reasoned letters, and the vitriolic and over the top.

The Times published a sampling of letters on Monday that covers most of the main ideas in what we received, he said. They will appear Tuesday in print.

I heard from one reader, Tom Mullaney of Chicago, who wrote: I cannot recall an endorsement coming so early and not once the race was between the nominees. He added, To me, it makes the paper too much of a player rather than observer of the campaign.

One can certainly make a case against newspaper candidate endorsements  and some papers have stopped making them  but Mr. Rosenthal told me that The Times is following its usual practice of making endorsements during primaries, including mayoral and gubernatorial races, as well as presidential.

There was a time, he said, when the paper genteelly waited until before the New York primary, but that no longer makes sense, if it ever did, he said.

Despite the negative reaction, Mr. Rosenthal said he was not perturbed.

Voting is about choosing, he said. You cant take a strong position without getting a very heated reaction. Its what I expected.

The editorial was the result of a robust discussion, by the board, which includes 17 members as well as himself. Mr. Rosenthal reports to Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the Times publisher. (The publisher is not a member of the editorial board, as an earlier version of this post stated.)

But we came to a very strong agreement very quickly, he said. He declined to say what the precise vote was, but said that it was an easier decision than in 2008s Democratic primary. The Times endorsed Mrs. Clinton over Barack Obama.

That was about two to one, Mr. Rosenthal said. This one was more definitive.

Leaving aside the matter of who The Times endorsed (that is definitely outside my brief), heres my take: A well-argued newspaper endorsement has value for readers because it can synthesize issues and promote informed discussion. As for the timing, The Times is a national newspaper, so if the purpose of an endorsement editorial is to influence voting, it only makes sense to publish it before that voting has begun anywhere in the country.",[]
nytimes.com,2015-06-13 00:00:00,Birds of New York: A Soundscape,"['All Contributors', 'The Great Divide', 'The Conversation', 'Errol Morris', 'Jeff Talman', 'The End']","Menagerie: Just between us species.

When I was studying music composition at Columbia University in the 1980s and began work on a series of chamber ensemble pieces with bird-inspired titles, I was doing something that many musicians before me had done. Birds were undoubtedly an inspiration at the dawn of human music making: Bird-bone flutes date back some 42,000 years. In later times, Handel, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, Stravinsky, Respighi and Messiaen all embraced bird song in their music. And of course the natural, soaring musicality of the avian species was not lost on players like Charlie Parker or bands like the Byrds, the Yardbirds and Wings.

The metaphor available in bird flight is equally important, as sounds soar through the air no less than a flying bird does. Flight and music both represent freedom from earthbound restraint. But music is even more intangible; music is made of the air, the medium of flight, the ether between us. Music is made of the sky.

I gave these early pieces titles like Kestrels, Raptors, Of Being Is a Bird and With the Wind. Rather than imitating bird song, that music tried to evoke a sense of play in the freedom, dynamism and ecstasy available in skyborne hovering, diving and soaring.

In the mid-1990s I struggled with traditional European instruments as a means of modern cultural expression. The standard orchestral instruments are wonderful culminations of generations of inspiration and craft. Still, theyre from other, older cultures with deep histories. They seemed to me perfect, but ancient; beautiful, but nostalgic; wondrous, but the voices of an increasingly distant past.



I soon realized the musical instruments of Mozarts time were not necessary to my own path as an artist simply because I had worked with them previously.

Over time I moved from traditional compositions to sound installations: creating composed sonic environments in particular places. Last year, after a nasty, long winter, using resonant signals from pulsar stars, I created Rhythms of Stars, an installation for the chapel at Columbia. I noticed that when the doors of the chapel were open, the birds singing outside made a tremendous impact on the interior space and the installation sound. It was compelling, and I knew immediately that I would make an installation with the sounds of the birds themselves.

From that came When Soaring Sings, an installation that features the sounds of 102 species of birds  songs, calls, choruses and drumming  kindly made available by the Macaulay Library of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, which holds the largest collection of wildlife sounds in the world. The piece is, in a way, a portrait of New York State  the calls of the birds in the piece are made only by species that return to nest in the state in spring. This multichannel sound field emulates the experience of hearing birds in three-dimensional space, just as we hear birds in a forest on all sides of us, singing, flitting and moving. But more than a sound field is intended in this composition.

Video

When listening to a flute we identify the instrument and also perceive the specific music being played. But as bird song is recognized as a birds sound rather than as extended musical thought, the installation presents a challenge. In composing with bird song, I noticed that the sounds seemed to flip continually  as charming bird sounds, or instead as part of the larger textures and forms of the music that I was composing. So the reaction of a visitor who said that it was a great idea to put nature recordings in a church was understandable, but it didnt fully capture the compositional nature of the work.

The birdcalls function as melodic fragments, counterpoint, textures, rhythm, color effects and other music elements of the work. By slightly time-stretching birdcall samples, or extending passages with extra tweets, peeps and other song elements, I made them fit with one another musically to create phrases, harmonies and orchestrations. By extreme time dilation I could create drones, arching glissandos, mighty fanfarelike brassy sounds and other dramatic space-filling effects.

As I worked on the sound it struck me that I was composing a kind of spatial chamber music as performed by virtuosos and sung by some of the worlds greatest sopranos. I also realized that I already knew these sounds  they are around us constantly in the city and are a major, astounding part of our soundscape.

Jeff Talman is a sound artist based in New York. His installations have been presented at sites in several countries.

nytimes.com,2012-09-12 00:00:00,Was Photo of Dead Ambassador Acceptable?,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Where is the line between good taste and important journalism? And did The Times cross it when it used, in a Wednesday afternoon online photo gallery, an image of an unconscious J. Christopher Stevens, the ambassador, who was killed in an attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi, Libya?

One reader, Catherine Ehr, was appalled, as she was a few weeks ago when The Times used a photograph of a bloodied man who died in the shooting at the Empire State Building. She expressed the views of many readers when she wrote to me:



For the second time in a few weeks, in the wake of a horrific event, the NY Times has stepped beyond the boundaries of good taste in publishing photos. First, there was the photo of a man bleeding/dying on the sidewalk after his former co-worker shot him in NYC which precipitated a police shootout that injured 9. Now, theres the photo of a man identified as Christopher Stevens, unconscious and clearly shortly before his death. If either of those men were your friend, or your family member, how would seeing those images make you feel? The other images that accompany the articles or appear in slide shows are enough to give the reader/viewer a clear idea of what happened. Showing identifiable photos of people dead or dying, and identifying the people in them, is disgusting and unnecessary. I hope The Times steps back from this and does a more rigorous job of editing/choosing the photos it publishes. Where is the common decency?

Ian Fisher, the associate managing editor who runs The Timess Web site during the day, said the decision was a carefully considered one by the papers top editors who met in the morning to discuss it.

They chose to use the Agence France-Presse photograph in question, he said, because of its journalistic significance.

Its horrifying but there is a journalistic imperative, he said. Its news.

Its notable that the caption stopped short of saying it was a photo of Mr. Stevenss dead body. The caption reads, A man, reportedly unconscious, identified as Mr. Stevens.

Mr. Fisher added: We dont hesitate to run pictures of Iraqis, Syrians and Qaddafi dead. Weve been at war for years. Weve shown a lot of bodies.

But he realized why the reaction was so fast and harsh to this photograph.

I can understand why people feel its more disturbing to see a photo of an American, particularly an American diplomat, he said.

For that reason, he said, editors chose a relatively distant image of Mr. Stevens, and placed it in the last position in the frequently updated gallery, where it would be less prominent. If only an extremely graphic photograph had been available, it might not have been used, Mr. Fisher said.

Other major newspapers, including The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, were not using similar photographs by midafternoon. At this writing, The Times had not made a decision about whether to use the photograph of Mr. Stevens in its print edition on Thursday.

Whos right  the readers who are protesting, or the editors? Its a tough call, and its an area in which sensibilities have changed over the years.

But if you accept the idea that each human life has the same value and dignity, and there is no consistent objection to seeing images of the dead from other countries, its hard to mount a reasonable argument against what editors here chose to do. To put it clearly: They made the right call.

Having said that, I would not want to see a similar photograph on the front page of Thursdays print edition, where its prominence and permanence would give it a different weight.",[]

The 274 pages of emails released under pressure on Wednesday by Gov.

There is little doubt that an affluent, predominantly white community  say Grosse Pointe or Bloomfield Hills  would never face such a public health catastrophe, and if it had, the state government would have rushed in to help.









At every juncture when state officials could have avoided or reduced the harm in Flint, they ignored public pleas and made every effort to dismiss the truth.

The newly released emails show that members of Mr. Snyders administration consistently mocked and belittled the complaints of Flint residents and the evidence gathered by independent researchers. Outrage is the only sensible response to this man-made disaster, in which inexcusable decisions, by the state and emergency managers appointed by Mr. Snyder to oversee the citys finances, led to corrosion of the water pipes and high levels of lead in the water and the blood of city residents. Thousands of children were exposed to water with lead, which could cause long-term health and developmental problems.

As President Obama said during a visit to Detroit on Wednesday, I know that if I was a parent up there, I would be beside myself that my kids health could be at risk. He called the fiasco a reminder of why you cant shortchange basic services that we provide to our people.

The emails are only those sent to or from the governor, not those sent between members of his administration. That is unacceptable. He needs to release every email that might shed light on how this calamity developed, and who was responsible. Even Wednesdays limited release shows an appalling lack of urgency in responding to Flints water problems and a determination to blame the city for the crisis.

For example, various emails showed that state officials dismissed one group of critics as being an anti-everything group and accused others of trying to turn the issue of childrens exposure to lead into a political football. Virtually everyone in the city knew that there were problems with the Flint River water, which smelled bad, was an odd color, caused skin rashes in some people and led to several advisories from the state to boil the water before drinking it.

Flints City Council voted 7 to 1 in March 2015 to do all things necessary to return to purchasing clean water from Detroit, only to have the emergency manager at the time veto the measure as incomprehensible because he considered the water safe and believed it was more important to save money than to respond to the pleas of Flint residents.

Although state officials insisted that their data showed no serious lead problems in Flint, the released emails suggest otherwise. They reveal that the states Department of Environmental Quality ignored warnings from an expert from the federal Environmental Protection Agency, who said in early 2015 that the state was testing the water in a way that could profoundly understate the lead levels.

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and demonstrators in Michigan have called for Mr. Snyder to resign. Several state officials have already resigned, including the director of the state Department of Environmental Quality and his chief spokesman, and the governors chief of staff and chief spokeswoman.

State and federal investigations are underway to dig more deeply into how this disaster happened and those responsible for it. Once more is known, other resignations are likely to be in order.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-01-27 00:00:00,Should The Times Have Been a Tougher Watchdog in Flint?,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Updated, 4 p.m.

Almost a year ago, last March, The Times published a frightening article about the drinking water in Flint, Mich.

Heres an excerpt:

When fecal coliform bacteria showed up in parts of the city last summer, residents were told to boil their water before using it. Officials addressed the issue by pumping extra chlorine into the system, but in solving one problem, they created another. The high chlorine levels led to elevated levels of total trihalomethanes or T.T.H.M., which required another public notice in January. Residents will again receive a notice of elevated T.T.H.M. levels in the mail later this month, Mayor Dayne Walling has said. Long-term consumption of water with high T.T.H.M. levels can lead to liver or kidney troubles and an increased risk of cancer, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

The article appeared on Page A16 in print. Then, more than six months went by. In October, The Times ran one brief and two articles about Flint.

Then, nothing of substance until this month, when a state of emergency was declared in Flint.

Since then, the nation has been up in arms about what happened in Flint, and more to the point, what didnt happen. The Times published a highly critical editorial last week (Outrage is the only sensible response to this man-made disaster, it said). And some presidential candidates have hammered away at it.

Issues of race and class are on everyones minds. Would this have happened in a rich, white community? Many, quite reasonably, doubt it.

And some Times readers are wondering why the news media, The Times included, didnt do more, earlier, when it might have made a real difference.

Donald Brandshaft wrote to me about it:

The media coverage of the Flint water problems strikes as somewhat hypocritical. One of the reasons that this could not happen in a white community is that every newspaper in the country would have reported it by May. The people of Flint were severely hurt by their governor and let down by the E.P.A., but they were also let down by the news media. I didnt notice any media self-examination resulting from this lapse.

I asked a deputy executive editor, Matt Purdy, about The Timess coverage. He reviewed it on Tuesday and spoke to the national editor, Alison Mitchell.

After doing so, Mr. Purdy told me that he was proud that The Times had written the March article, and had returned to the subject in October. He praised the quality of recent reporting work that landed two related Flint articles on the front page.

If The Times had dug in and devoted investigative resources to the situation, Mr. Purdy said, the results certainly could have had impact and been important. But the same few Chicago-based reporters have been covering a wide range of stories in the middle of the country  the Tamir Rice case in Cleveland, problems in the Detroit schools, the aftermath of racial unrest in Ferguson, Mo., and Rahm Emanuels re-election in Chicago, among others. Mr. Purdy wrote to me:

The Midwest is one of the busiest regions of the country in terms of news, from Ferguson to police shootings to political unrest in Chicago. If we had poured more of the valuable time of reporters into Flint, we would not have gotten other stories.

He added: The resources of regional and national outlets are stretched increasingly thin. We are fortunate to have a robust and talented national staff, but we certainly cant get to every important story and we cant go deep on every one we get to. Perhaps most disturbing is that there are likely hundreds of troubling events unfolding around the country at any time that are getting very little if any attention from the media.

As Columbia Journalism Review wrote, some of the most important watchdog work in Flint was done by a dogged investigative reporter, Curt Guyette, who no longer works for a news organization at all but for an arm of the American Civil Liberties Union. C.J.R. also cited the Detroit and Flint newspapers for their work. (After this post was published, a number of readers pointed out that Rachel Maddow of MSNBC has been a strong and persistent voice on the Flint story for weeks.)

My take: The Times got off to a strong start with its initial Flint story in March. It was good to return to the subject in October; and this months coverage has been thorough. But there could have been, and should have been, much more. If  for example  the March article had been followed up with some serious digging, and if the resulting stories had been given prominent display, public officials might have been shamed into taking action long before they did.

I understand the argument that The Times  which covers the whole nation and the globe  cant be responsible for investigating every local problem. With only a few Midwestern reporters, pulled in many directions, editors must make tough decisions about how to spend their time and energy.

The counterargument is this: Imagine if The Times really had taken on the Flint outrage with energy and persistence many months ago. With its powerful pulpit and reach, The Times could have held public officials accountable and prevented human suffering. Thats what journalistic watchdogs are supposed to do. As traditional local investigative reporting withers, The Timess role becomes ever more important.

Yes, that takes journalistic resources. Investigative reporting is notoriously time-consuming and expensive. The Times, to its credit, does a great deal of it.

But were such resources really unavailable in this case?

After all, enough Times firepower somehow has been found to document Hillary Clintons every sneeze, Donald Trumps latest bombast, and Marco Rubios shiny boots. There seem to be plenty of Times resources for such hit-seeking missives as breadfacing, or for the Magazines thorough exploration of buffalo plaid and lumbersexuals. And staff was available to produce this weeks dare-you-not-to-click video on the rising social movement known as Free the Nipple.

Isnt it a matter of choosing how to deploy the 1,300 members of the newsroom staff? Call it a question of priorities. Given all thats happened, especially on issues involving race, maybe its time to beef up that talented Midwest staff.

If The Times had kept the pressure on the Flint story, the resulting journalism might not have made the trending list  but it would have made a real difference to the people of Flint, who were in serious need of a powerful ally.",[]

There were ants crawling on my grandmothers feet in the hospital. My mother and I slapped towels at the insects, scoured the rusted metal legs of the bed, moved my unconscious grandmothers limbs to search every wrinkle of the dingy sheets. The ants were a portent, I thought. This was all my fault. My grandmother was going to die in this filthy hospital, far from everything she knew and loved, because of me and my insistence on medical intervention.

A few days before Christmas of 2013, my mother called me in New York from Kerala in India to tell me my 90-year-old grandmother, Laxmi, had fallen on her way to the bathroom. By New Years Eve my grandmother wasnt eating or talking. To my increasingly panicked questions about why she hadnt been admitted to a hospital yet, I got vague answers.

What can they do for her? We can look after her here. Anyway, shes afraid of hospitals, my mother said into the telephone when I nagged her.

I had moved to America in 1997 and missed the deaths of everyone I loved. A penniless grad student, I had lived the immigrant nightmare  first my father, then my grandfather had died without me beside them. Their passing had been reported to me from 8,000 miles away, over the phone.

This time around, I was determined to be there. On the flight over I thought of the ritual we had. Every time I came back to what my grandmother liked to grandly call our ancestral house, I would drop my bags on the hot concrete of the courtyard and shout Ammamma. She would answer from inside, her voice clear and calm, as if I had never been gone. I always felt as if she had been waiting in that precise spot for the years it had taken me to come back.

But when I arrived at the house after 26 hours of travel, my grandmother stared up at me from her bed as if shed never seen me before. Her pupils hardly moved. Thats when I realized that she could slip out of the world without ever knowing that I had come back to be with her.

I had ordered the rickety ambulance that brought my grandmother to the hospital. Let her be, my mother said, but I overrode her objections. As I watched the ants scatter, I wondered at my own motives. Was I hoping that the doctors would revive her enough so that she would know I had come? That I loved her enough to fly halfway across the world? Had my guilt at missing those other deaths led me to make such drastic amends? I had no answers.

At least she didnt know where she was. She would have been mortified. I had never seen my grandmother appear in public in anything other than a cotton voile sari in her favorite pale blue or lavender, her knee-length hair in a soft bun. She had the classical beauty one saw in the faces of the goddesses in the vivid calendars that hang in Indian stores. In the hospital they had her in a cheap nightie, purple with garish pink flowers, its neckline gaping.

The next 12 hours are crucial, the doctor had said, pointing to a smudge on the CT scans of my grandmothers brain. Her fall had made a vein burst deep inside. What he was really saying was that it was possible that she would never open her eyes again, never see my face again.

When we complained about the ants, the nurse shrugged. She nodded toward the cloth screen that divided our narrow room. There was a family on the other side of the partition. Their patient was an eight-month-old baby with meningitis. The relatives who came to see him brought food in giant tiered stainless steel tiffins. We were assailed at all hours by the smell of chicken curry or the sound of a visiting cousin crunching potato chips. Blame them, the nurse said.

My grandmother had kept house for her headmaster husband in small villages until they had retired to our remote farm. I had always thought of her as pure, someone apart from our world, untouched by our chaos. Growing up, she had played hostess for her famous father who worked for the British Raj. She had mastered tennis in long skirts, played the violin for guests. She had an old-fashioned notion of hospitality; I couldnt be rude to people who shared the room with her.

The baby screamed through the day and night. His mother, barely 17 years old, stuck her nipple despairingly into his mouth. When he turned his head violently away she broke down sobbing.

You are lucky to get even this room, the ward matron said, smug and indifferent behind the Plexiglas of the nurses station when I begged for a private room, insisted we could pay.

I imagined my grandmother falling out of the world, her leaving accompanied only by the endless wail of the child. It was a version of purgatory, a very specific karmic punishment devised by a witty god who liked contrasts and paradoxes, the old being sent off by babes in arms.

I stood beside my grandmothers bed and willed her to wake up. I am sorry, I said, hoping she would hear. This was a mistake and we would go home soon, to her room on the farm, with its murmuring radio and the cool green light from the trees in the courtyard pouring in through the windows.

Through all the commotion in the hospital room, my grandmother continued unconscious, alone, hidden deep. The bottles of saline and blood, the expensive injections didnt pull her out. Outside the window, the red dust of the parking lot sifted over the car that would take me to the airport. I had five days before I had to leave to start teaching my semester at New York University. Pray, my mother said.

The doctors recommended an operation to relieve the pressure on my grandmothers brain. They called my mother in to take possession of my grandmothers dentures. Without them, her chin was longer and more prominent; her mouth fallen in. It was unsettling: Suddenly, my grandmother was an old woman.

Hours after the operation and with 16 hours to go before my flight, my grandmother defied the auguries and woke up. The babys relatives from the other side of the screen joined us as we circled her bed. My grandmother looked up at us as the babys mother, swept up in the general jubilation, patted my grandmothers shoulder. So nice of you to visit, my grandmother assured the girl. Tell your mother I asked after her, she said.

When my grandmother finally turned to look at me, she gave me her brand-new toothless-baby grin. When did you come from America? she said, lucid for a moment. Then she sailed off again: Child, ask your grandfather to come downstairs, she said of her husband who had been dead for 14 years. Tell him dinner is ready.

If only that was the happy ending to this story. After her brief flare, my grandmother slipped back into the dark. Bedridden, unable to move her hands or legs, barely sentient, she lived on for another year. My mother nursed her day and night at home, spooning water into her mouth. Once I got back to New York, I couldnt find another $1,500 to visit her again.

So I called instead, every day. I made my mother tell me every painful detail about my grandmothers condition. Unable to swallow anything but rice and vegetables ground into a mush, her skin flaking from dehydration, her bent limbs curling into themselves, her end was relayed to me inch by suffering inch. I had been upset when the doctors removed her dentures, but now everything that made her familiar was gone. Her soft glowing skin, her love of Cadbury chocolate, her keen interest in news stories of gruesome murders  everything fell away.

I never brought it up with my mother, but I kept circling back to the same question: What if I hadnt insisted we take her to the hospital? She could have died whole, intact, still the person she was. I had prolonged her suffering and my mothers pain with my stubborn belief in the power of medicine to fix things.

My grandmother died last January, more than a year after I had said goodbye in that hospital room. I felt a terrible grief and then relief. It was over. For all of us.

It was only later, thinking about that day when I had seen my grandmother for the last time, I remembered how I had walked to the bed and bent down to touch her feet in the traditional Hindu way. We touch the feet of our elders on important life occasions like a wedding day or at the beginning of long journeys. Even in her muddled state, she had remembered the gesture she had used all her life. Her hand had rested on my head for an instant. I can still feel the weight of it. She must have forgotten the ritual benediction, Long life.

Instead she said, Come back soon. Tell everyone in America I asked after them. I have my guilt and regret, but I also have this. Her last touch, to take into the years with me. I like to think she knew, somewhere deep inside, that I had come back.

In the fall of 2014 the author decided to quit the prescription medications she has been taking to treat her anxiety, depression and insomnia, and began the process of gradually reducing her dosages. In Going Off, a series of Anxiety posts that began in February, she has chronicled the challenges she has faced from both the drugs and the withdrawal. This is the final installment.

Tell everyone close to you that youre tapering off your meds. Tell them that if they think you seem down, they should speak up; you wont get defensive. Yes, youve been defensive in the past. You used to think depression meant you were weak, or at least, you interpreted expressions of concern as accusations of weakness. But its time to change. Let your skin become not thicker, but more porous, so love can seep in. Let your friends stop by unannounced to make sure you havent spent the last three days in your blue fleece bathrobe, the one you gave an ex-boyfriend for his birthday a decade ago. Its weird that you have that bathrobe.

You might need to taper more gradually than your doctor thinks. Reduce one medication at a time, just a sliver, every couple of weeks at the most. Be gentle. For example, if youre planning to cut your benzo on a Friday night, but youre still having withdrawal symptoms from your last cut, or you see the aftermath of yet another shooting on the news, take your usual dose. You can always cut on Monday. Or next Monday. Or the next. It will take you seven months to get off of three drugs. Thats fine. Thats good. You got this. Mid-taper, you can always go back to your previous dose. Medicate if thats what helps you make it through a day without hiding in the bathroom. The goal is to feel O.K., not to prove that you are O.K. without meds.

There will be a period of hell for two to three days after each cut  dizziness, nausea, panic attacks, headaches, crying jags, strange symptoms like aching teeth. Some people experience extreme symptoms for months. For some people, the withdrawal proves impossible. You will be one of the lucky ones: Your teeth will stop aching. Your panic will subside. You wont faint or vomit even once.

Everyone has an opinion about depression. Everyone has an opinion about psychiatric medication. If you tell people who dont know you that youre on medication, or that youre trying to get off of medication, some might shout their opinions. At times, youll feel like you must have wronged them, if all this vitriol is landing on your head. But their reactions have little to do with you. You are all products of a society with arbitrary taboos, a society that has made mental health a fraught topic, that hasnt learned how to talk about mental health without worrying about what others will think. Let them shout. They need to shout. Dont be afraid. You have a right to voice your experience. Maybe its not just a right but an obligation  to fight this collective shame with your clearest, most honest words.

The time will come when you wake each morning not woozy with dread, but excited that the sun is shining. It will be summer, your favorite season, and you will be 20 days med-free, eating only whole foods, stepping back into the world, a yoga mat strapped to your shoulder. Can you believe it? Youre going to be that person with the yoga mat strapped to her shoulder. You will greet yourself, the person you almost forgot, the person under the bandages. Before peeling back bandages, you have no way of knowing if the wounds are still open. You are so lucky: Your healing was done, as you suspected it was. Youre back, the person who is usually barefoot despite a hideous bunion, the person who cant handle concerts or Saint Marks Place, the person who wishes she didnt have under-eye circles, who wishes she spent less time thinking about her under-eye circles, the person who trembles visibly when she meets someone exciting, who cant stop smiling at the subway dancers, even though youre supposed to hate the subway dancers if you want to be deemed a real New Yorker. Say hello to that person. She was missing. She was depressed and then she was recovering from depression. She was pinned to her furniture. She was counting calories. She was horrified that her hair was falling out in her hands. She was drawing her curtains closed. Hello! Embrace your feelings of gratitude, for everything, for everyone, for the way people need other people, for the way they avoid eye contact and open their arms and lend books and coats and eat the baked ziti you make them for dinner. Yes, ordinarily, your gag reflex would activate at the mention of gratitude, but not anymore. Go outside. Feel sun on the soles of your feet. Buy broccoli from the outdoor produce stand. Why havent you ever done that before? Why did you think you had to go inside to buy broccoli? And then maybe youll be 40 days off meds, or 50, or it will be winter, and youll skip a week of yoga or youll cry for two hours or youll drink too many beers and thats fine, youre fine. Thats life. Youre letting go.

David Carr, who held the spot until his sudden death last February, was popular with readers and revered in the news business generally. Times editors understandably took their time  nearly a year  to name his replacement.

Not long after Mr. Carr died, the executive editor, Dean Baquet, told me that one doesnt really replace someone like him. But he also noted that Mr. Carr had grown a great deal in the job, becoming a star along the way.

Mr. Rutenberg is a strong choice. An experienced media and political journalist, he is a reporter first. Hes less likely, I think, to opine, or rely heavily on writing style, than to dig and understand.

Something else that readers may like about him is his longtime aversion to the use of anonymous sources in his work. My first encounter with Mr. Rutenberg was shortly after a major political piece of his ran on the front page. Written with Sam Tanenhaus, it was lengthy and detailed and  unlike many a similar story  had nary a blind quote or unnamed source.

I asked him about it then, and on Wednesday morning, asked him to expand on the subject for this post. He wrote to me:

I think I havent had an anonymous quote since then, and by then Id avoided having any for a while. Admittedly its easier to avoid anonymity in long-range pieces, because one has the time to either press people to come onto the record or to find ways around the anonymity they are insisting upon. My main nit is that the reader just cant know how seriously to take the anonymous person who is being quoted; cant divine his or her motives and therefore cant know how credible he or she is on the matter at hand. I also think in general anonymity is granted too freely too often to people who simply want to forward their own agendas without fingerprints  often in ways that dont necessarily help the story in question anyway. I fear that important people on the media beat have come to expect anonymity automatically, so I dont know how well my ban will hold up as I move forward with the column, but Im going to do everything I can to keep anonymity at a minimum. And, of course, there are plenty of cases in which anonymity is rightfully unavoidable  intel sources, law enforcement sources, people endangering themselves or their families or their jobs by talking to reporters, etc.

Mr. Rutenberg paid tribute to Mr. Carr in a Times article, telling Ravi Somaiya: Its an honor and beyond daunting to be granted the space that David filled in such a special way, which touched so many people. There can never be another David Carr, so I can only hope to do his legacy, and the paper, proud.

And he told Erik Wemple of the Washington Post that hes not quite sure of the direction of the column. Im still going to take some time to develop a vision for it . . . I think Im going to get time to source up again and go out and talk to the smartest people I can find.

That sounds like a good plan.

Speaking of reporting chops, Michael Calderone of The Huffington Post, mentioned last November that Mr. Rutenberg was a possible candidate. To my knowledge, he was the first (and perhaps the only) one to report that.

Mr. Rutenbergs columns, like those of Mr. Carr, will appear in Mondays Business Day section. In the past, those columns set the media agenda for the beginning of the week. I wouldnt be at all surprised to see that continue.",[]

The Stone is a forum for contemporary philosophers and other thinkers on issues both timely and timeless.

I.

Art is often the subject of philosophy. But every now and then, a work of art  something other than a lecture or words on a page  can function as philosophy. Son of Saul, a film set in Auschwitz-Birkenau during the Holocaust, is such a work of art. It engages with a profound set of problems that also occupied the 19th-century Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard.

Written and directed by the Hungarian filmmaker Laszlo Nemes, Son of Saul won awards at Cannes, the Golden Globes and elsewhere before making its way to the Oscars to win the award for best foreign language film. It follows a day in the life of Saul, a member of the Sonderkommando, a group of mostly Jewish prisoners the Nazis forced to assist with herding people to the gas chambers, burning the bodies and collecting gold and valuables from the corpses. The film creates a direct, experiential and visceral engagement with these events by maintaining a relentless focus on the minute-to-minute unfolding of Sauls world.

In long, unbroken shots, we see the reality of the death camp revealed, its textures made tangible. By using close-ups and shallow focus images throughout, Nemes gives viewers no opportunity to disengage from Sauls point of view. It is as though we are shadowing him in hell. In immersing the viewer this way, Nemes places us there with Saul. This seems to be a moral imperative as well as an aesthetic choice. By eliciting a full, visceral engagement from the viewer, the film embodies the respect for the singular events of the Holocaust that more commercial treatments of the subject fail at. The film is a thoroughly personal, subjective account of the Holocaust.

The movies central theme is Sauls inner world, the loss and recovery of his soul. In scene after scene we see his face unmoved, his eyes watching but remote; there is a repellent sense of his  and our own  indifference. But then he witnesses a young boy briefly surviving the gas, only to be put to death a few minutes later by a Nazi doctor, possibly Josef Mengele. From this moment, he becomes consumed by the idea of giving the boy a proper Jewish burial. He claims the boy is his son. Sauls backstory is entirely missing from the film  we dont even learn if he really had a son  but that is beside the point. What matters, to him and to us is that he is able to feel again.

II.

Much of Kierkegaards philosophy is a warning against the tendency  greatly accelerated in modern times  to take an increasingly objective, abstract perspective on the world. While the paradigm example of this is science, it is most problematic when applied to ones own life and existence. To identify life with its abstractions is, in Kierkegaards view, a dangerous but all too common error.

There are generally two, radically different ways to relate to the world: objective and subjective. Objectivity is an orientation towards reality based on abstracting away, in various degrees, from subjective experience, and from individual points of view. A subjective orientation, on the other hand, is based on an attunement to the inner experience of feeling, sensing, thinking and valuing that unfolds in our day-to-day living. This distinction has been brought into contemporary philosophical discourse most notably by Thomas Nagel, in a number of his essays, most famously in What Is It Like to Be a Bat?

Now in print The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments An anthology of essays from The Timess philosophy series, published by Liveright.

The spectacular success of science in the past 300 years has raised hopes that it also holds the key to guiding human beings towards a good life. Psychology and neuroscience has become a main source of life advice in the popular media. But philosophers have long held reservations about this scientific orientation to how to live life. The 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume, for instance, famously pointed out, no amount of fact can legislate value, moral or otherwise. You cannot derive ought from is. But there is another, in some way more radical concern, expressed in Western philosophy most forcefully by Kierkegaard, and in literature by Dostoyevsky  two religiously inspired thinkers  namely that our experience of life matters in ineffable ways that no objective understanding of the world can capture.

Wittgenstein, in a well-known letter to Ludwig von Ficker, the publisher of the Tractatus, claimed that the whole point of the book is to show that what is important lies in what cannot be expressed in a scientific language. Suppose there was a super-intelligent organism  in a twist on Frank Jacksons knowledge argument  that lacked any feeling or experience, a creature of pure thought. Such a creature could, for example, know everything about the brain, even everything about the world at large, all in scientific terms; but it would know nothing of human significance. (An interesting video depicting Jacksons argument can be found here.)

This line of thought holds that human significance comes from subjective experience and that human beings cannot thrive without an orientation towards, and engagement with, the subjective experience of their lives, and that, as a matter of fact, a predominantly objective, conceptual orientation to oneself is detrimental to well being. As Kierkegaard put it, Science and scholarship want to teach that becoming objective is the way. Christianity teaches that the way is to become subjective, to become a subject.

Science is the best method we have for approaching the world objectively. But in fact it is not science per se that is the problem, from the point of view of subjectivity. It is objectivizing, in any of its forms. One can frame a decision, for example, in objective terms. One might decide between career choices by weighing differences in workloads, prestige, pay and benefits between, say, working for an advanced technology company versus working for a studio in Hollywood. We are often encouraged to make choices by framing them in this way. Alternatively, one might try to frame the decision more in terms of what it might be like to work in either occupation; in this case, one needs to have the patience to dwell in experience long enough for ones feelings about either alternative to emerge. In other words, one might deliberate subjectively.

This is, of course, a crude opposition. We hardly ever deliberate purely objectively or purely subjectively. And there are built-in limits to subjective decision-making. Often, as the philosopher Laurie Paul has argued (as explained in an essay here by the psychologist Paul Bloom last year), we are not even in a position to imagine what our lives will be like after a life-altering decision.

The bottom line is, what Kierkegaard pointed out is a steady push in society toward more objectivity, and less engagement with subjectivity, with what is  sometimes derisively  called inwardness. There is less of a tendency for modern humans to live thoroughly immersed in life, experiencing it, and more of a tendency of being mostly distracted by its abstractions, by all the ways our culture conceptually frames our existence as individuals, Democrats and Republicans, man and women, one percenters, workers, consumers, and so on. And here, as a result, is the problem: by becoming less subjective, we become more cut off from sources of meaning and value.

III.

One does not have to agree with Kierkegaards single-minded, hostile rejection of objective thought and objectivity to still consider what he has to say about the cultivation of subjectivity, because that is where his major insights lie. So what about his exhortation to become subjective? Why is there even a need for this? Isnt it true that, given our experience of life, we already are? It seems that one cannot fail to be a subject, to be subjective. However, as Kierkegaard points out, the mind can flee its own subjectivity; instead of dwelling in the presence of ones experience, one can escape into alienation; into theorizing about needs, goals and happiness, and live by abstract principles and objective measures. As Freud has described, there are various ways of doing this: by repressing experience, dissociating from it, numbing it, turning away from it.

Most commonly, we turn our back on subjectivity to escape from pain. Suffering, ones own, or others, might become bearable, one hopes, when one takes a step back and views it objectively, conceptually, abstractly. And when it comes to something as monumental as the Holocaust, ones mind cannot help but be numbed by the sheer magnitude of it. How could one feel the pain of all those people, sympathize with millions? Instead one is left with the facts, the numbers.

Son of Saul approaches its stupefying subject in a way that echoes Kierkegaards imperative. The audience is not given any space to distance from Sauls reality or turn it into an abstraction of suffering, innocence, or goodness; the film doesnt depict the story of the Holocaust in generic ways that would encourage getting lost in a historical account. Rather, it allows viewers to feel its textures, and perceive the sights and sounds that make up individual experience. In this way, the film depicts what many critics have argued could not be depicted.

It achieves this by not letting the viewer off the hook, by demanding participation, as far as it is possible in the imagination, in the experience of the Holocaust. As Kierkegaard puts it in Either/Or, For one may have known a thing many times and acknowledged it ... and yet it is only by the deep inward movements, only by the indescribable emotions of the heart, that for the first time you are convinced that what you have known belongs to you ... for only the truth that edifies is truth for you.

In addition to employing a subjective approach visually, Nemes also makes subjectivity the theme of the film. It depicts the loss of subjectivity both at the larger societal level, as well as at the level of the individual. It is this double engagement of subjectivity that makes the film so effective.

The death camp is the absurd end point of technological thinking, of the objectification of human beings. Totalitarian regimes the world over know the value and power of subjectivity  that is why they work so hard to destroy it. Murdered Jews are referred to as pieces in the movie by the German camp administrators. The victims are denied the status of subjects  they are mere physical objects to be dealt with. In this world of mechanized objectivity, the Nazis industrial brutality is considered entirely normal. Any individual not obeying its construct of proper behavior only has their own conscience to rely on.

Imre Kertesz, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature for his autobiographical novel about a Hungarian boy taken to Auschwitz, explained this vividly in his acceptance speech when he describes a crucial experience that contributed to writing the novel: The experience was about solitude, a more difficult life ... the need to step out of the mesmerizing crowd, out of history, which renders you faceless and fateless.

At a yet deeper level, it is the subjectivity of its protagonist that is the main theme of the movie. Through his encounter with the boy Saul gains back his soul. At the moment that Saul witnesses the killing of the boy, he becomes  in Kierkegaards beautiful expression  a Knight of Faith, someone who made a commitment, and who can pursue it with passion, as if it was the surest thing, even in the face of overwhelming odds. Saul is finally able to experience the death and destruction around him by committing to this one, dead boy; not unlike the film nudges the viewers to relate to the Holocaust as real, by committing them to this one, near dead protagonist. Having seen it you will remember, deliriously, having been there, in some small part of your body. It is a duty created by the Holocaust, suggests the movie. It is a dark counterpart of the imperative for Jews to relive the experience of deliverance from bondage into freedom each year at Passover.

At the same time that it depicts Sauls conversion, Son of Saul also directly engages the viewers subjectivity by its style and mode of presentation; its achievement is to embody the dynamic that is its very subject matter. Kierkegaard called such communication  the only sort he thought befitting a subjective thinker  double reflection. He thought this is the only way that the authenticity of the message can be guarded  the only way to avoid being a town crier of subjectivity. In this way, Son of Saul is both art and philosophy: It makes inwardness visible. Through its depiction of death and destruction it reminds us how to live.

IMAGINE if American citizens never learned about the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib. Imagine not knowing about the brutal treatment of terror suspects at United States government black sites. Or about the drone program that is expanding under President Obama, or the Bush administrations warrantless wiretapping of Americans.









This is a world without leaks.

And a world without leaks  the secret government information slipped to the press  may be the direction were headed in. Since 9/11, leakers and whistle-blowers have become an increasingly endangered species. Some, like the former C.I.A. official John Kiriakou, have gone to jail. Another, Pfc. Bradley Manning, is charged with aiding the enemy for the masses of classified information he gave to Julian Assanges WikiLeaks. He could face life in prison.

The government has its reasons for cracking down. Obama administration officials have consistently cited national security concerns and expressed their intention to keep prosecuting leakers.

The government has legitimate secrets that should remain secrets, Michael V. Hayden, the former C.I.A. director, said in a telephone interview.

Journalists tend to view the situation differently, and not just because they want, in the oft-heard phrase, to sell newspapers. They see leaks  which have many motivations, not all altruistic  as vital to news gathering.

Declan Walsh, a reporter who wrote many WikiLeaks-based stories for The Guardian before coming to The Times, calls leaks the unfiltered lifeblood of investigative journalism. He wrote in an e-mail from his post in Pakistan: They may come from difficult, even compromised sources, be ridden with impurities and require careful handling to produce an accurate story. None of that reduces their importance to journalism.

Readers whom I hear from on this topic tend to express one of two opposite viewpoints: 1) The Times should relentlessly find out and print whatever it can about clandestine government activities, and 2) The Times has no business determining what is in the best interest of national security, or pursuing classified information that is passed along illegally.

Whatever ones view, one fact is clear: Leakers are being prosecuted and punished like never before. Consider that the federal Espionage Act, passed in 1917, was used only three times in its first 92 years to prosecute government officials for press leaks. But the Obama administration, in the presidents first term alone, used it six times to go after leakers. Now some of them have gone to jail.

The crackdown sends a loud message. Scott Shane, who covers national security for The Times, says that message is being heard  and heeded.

Theres definitely a chilling effect, he told me. Government officials who might otherwise discuss sensitive topics will refer to these cases in rebuffing a request for background information.

And that, says Michael Leiter, is as it should be. Mr. Leiter, the former director of the United States National Counterterrorism Center, says the prosecutions are intended to have a deterrent effect. Weve come too far toward willy-nilly leaking of sensitive information.

Many observers, though, see a useful middle ground. This is often looked at as a battle of good versus evil, and both sides see it that way, Mr. Hayden said. But thats not the case. He believes that for a national security effort to succeed, it must not only be operationally effective, technologically possible and lawful, it must also be politically sustainable.

The latter requires public support, he said, which is only shaped by informed debate. You cant have debate without knowledge, and given the growing penchant for overclassification, thats where the press steps in.

Mr. Shane looks back on a Pentagon Papers affidavit written in 1971 by Max Frankel, then The Timess Washington bureau chief and later its executive editor, which described Washington reality: The government hides what it can, pleading necessity as long as it can, and the press pries out what it can, pleading a need and a right to know. When the government loses a secret or two, it simply adjusts to a new reality. When the press loses a quest or two, it simply reports (or misreports) as best it can.

David McCraw, the lawyer for The Timess newsroom, said, The system works because of restraint on both sides. Dean Baquet, the managing editor, agreed: Weve proven that we can be responsible with information. In fact, sometimes we even overdo it.

But the ramped-up prosecutions threaten this fragile ecosystem that has served the public pretty well.

Private Mannings extreme treatment, in particular, worries Mr. Walsh and others because of the example it sets. (That case is in a class by itself, of course, with the wholesale transfer of some 700,000 documents. The Times reported many articles from the material, as did others.)

Many observers are quick to note a double standard for leak prosecutions: tightly controlled leaks from the highest levels ruffle no feathers.

Chris Hedges, an author, columnist and former Times reporter, thinks powerful institutions like The Times ought to push back harder  showing solidarity, including legal common cause with Mr. Manning and Mr. Assange, providing more detailed coverage of leak prosecutions, and crusading in editorials. Beyond whats right, even enlightened self-interest should dictate it, he told me.

To its credit, The Times repeatedly has gone to court to seek material related to the drone program and other issues, has covered Mr. Kiriakous case heavily, and consistently has written editorials defending press rights.

Obviously, everybody in the industry could do more, Mr. McCraw said of legal efforts. Resources are limited, but were picking the best possible shots.

The Times needs to keep pressing on all these fronts, and with more zeal in print than it has so far. If news organizations dont champion press interests, who will?

In the meantime, the chilling effect continues apace. That is troubling for journalists, but even worse for citizens, who should not be in the dark about what their government is doing.",[]

Trying Not to Blur Language Lines,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Times coverage of the hostage crisis in Northern Africa has brought up some questions on the use of language.

A Manhattan reader, Moshe Adler, wrote to me questioning the use of the terms Islamists and extremists in an article on Jan. 15 by the reporters Adam Nossiter and Eric Schmitt.

He wrote: I do not understand what either term means and the authors do not explain. These terms, while meaningless, sound ominous and lull the reader into thinking that the war by the French government against the rebels and the support by the U.S. of this war are justified. These terms should not be used.

I agree with the reader that it is important to use such terms carefully and not interchangeably. I disagree, though, that the terms are meaningless. In fact, that is the crucial element here  each of these words has a specific meaning, as do words like militant and terrorist. The words do not, by any stretch of the imagination, all mean the same thing.

I asked Philip B. Corbett, associate managing editor for standards, to describe the way The Times uses each of these words.

People seem to think we should have a long list of approved words and another one of banned words, he said. We dont. For the most part, we use the dictionary like everyone else, and try to use language that is clear and accurate.

Mr. Corbett noted that the newsroom dictionary (Websters New World College) defines Islamist as an advocate or supporter of Islamic, esp. orthodox Islamic, political rule. And that, he said, reflects how it is typically used in The Times.

As for extremist, he said, opinions might differ on where exactly it applies, but I doubt many of our readers would object to applying it to people who kidnap and kill civilians, carry out public amputations, order floggings for smoking and playing music, stone people for sex outside marriage, etc.

As for militant, I think we use it pretty literally, to describe fighters in an insurgency, etc.

The terms have not been treated interchangeably, and editors acknowledge that it is good to be on guard against doing so. Some Islamists are extremists, as has been the case with those most recently in the news; other are not.

I appreciate Mr. Adlers e-mail because  although I find no fault with The Timess usage that I have seen in recent days  it serves as a good reminder that these kinds of distinctions matter.

Those who are interested in language issues might enjoy Mr. Corbetts After Deadline blog, his weekly critique of grammar, usage and style in The Times.

Of all the patients I have seen in my 40 years as a psychoanalyst, Daniel was the strangest. He was the most inaccessible, inwardly tormented and infuriating man I have ever known, and yet he stayed in therapy with me for over a decade, calling faithfully every week  he insisted that his work schedule precluded coming in person  even though he spent many of those sessions in silence or addressed me as if I were inanimate. He drove me crazy, he haunted me and he moved me, sometimes all in the same session.

The reason he came to me was simple. He wanted, as he put it, to become a participant in the human race, and to learn how to relate to others of his species. I was hired to teach him how to do it.

Daniel initially chose me for this job because he had read a book I wrote about problem siblings that resonated with his own childhood. He had been terrorized by his older brothers daily violent outbursts, which his parents had done nothing to contain, and had concluded early on that relationships offered no comfort or satisfaction, merely depletion and misery.

Needing or being needed by anyone seemed perilous to Daniel. He barely exchanged a word at work with colleagues whom hed known for years, and his home, which he shared with his extraordinarily longsuffering wife (who had problems of her own), had the air of a monastery, where words were exchanged only by necessity.

Daniel rarely followed through on anything I recommended: having brief conversations by appointment with his wife, going to the company cafeteria, keeping a journal of his thoughts, emailing me between sessions. He would always agree to try, and then find excuses or forget the assignment.

After nine years of this, I was at my wits end. The only thing that kept me going when I lost hope of ever getting through to Daniel was that occasionally he spoke with real feeling about the depth of his loneliness, and his dread that he would never find a way out of the bunker he had constructed to keep himself safe.

Then one day, I got an idea. There was another inhabitant of Daniels household  Jeff  whom I learned of only years after Daniel and I began therapy, because Jeff was so little a part of his consciousness. Jeff was a dog of an unusual breed that Daniels wife doted on and that he utterly ignored, never feeding, petting or walking.

My idea was to enlist Jeff as my co-therapist to help Daniel break through his isolation. I proposed to Daniel that he take some responsibility for Jeffs care, preparing and feeding him dinner daily  his wife would continue to do the morning shift while he was at work  and that he observe his emotions as he did so.

The plan actually piqued Daniels interest, since no talking was involved and the encounters would not require as much from him as human contact would. He agreed to make a serious effort.

Every session thereafter I asked for a progress report. Im doing O.K. with it, Daniel invariably said, but on closer examination it always turned out that there were gaps in his fulfillment of his obligation that he glossed over and then rationalized away. I didnt do it yesterday because there was a TV show around dinner time I didnt want to miss, he might say, or I was out of town or I went running.

The task itself, which seemed simplicity itself to me  at feeding time, open can, fill bowl, wash bowl  proved herculean for Daniel. The sticking point, as we both had anticipated, was reliability. Daniel would have to provide things for Jeff  consideration and support  that nobody had ever given him.

Still, I refused to let Daniel off the hook. You cant just assume that your wife will take up the slack, I cautioned him. Jeff still has to be fed every single night on schedule, just like you do. Now he depends on you for survival  you have to keep his needs in mind and provide for them.

He chafed at this, but he took it to heart.

Then one day, Daniel made an announcement that surprised me as much as it surprised him. Today I heard the dog eating, he said. I noticed it. I liked it. This was the first time that Daniel could recall having ever been pleased, rather than threatened, by being aware of the presence of another. For a man who by his own account rushed through every social interaction, unable to savor it, this was remarkable.

Jeff was more forgiving of Daniels derelictions than I was. And as Daniel became a more reliable, even if far from perfect, master, Jeff  whom Daniel never called by name  took notice, wagging his tail at Daniels approach. The dog just jumped up and laid down by my feet, he reported with unconcealed delight one session. Its a wonderful thing. I have an effect on others.

This was the first time I had heard joy in Daniels voice. Jeffs expression of gratitude, responsiveness and appreciation made Daniels efforts feel worthwhile to him. Feeding your dog is feeding your soul, feeding your humanity, I said, and Daniel responded with a striking reformulation of the same thought: Im only fed when Im feeding.

The next session, Daniel reported another milestone. Today, he said, the dog and I looked each other in the eye. I suggested that he start to call Jeff by his name, to indicate that they had a mutual relationship.

There were signs of real love developing between Daniel and Jeff. I miss it when I dont feed the dog, Daniel said one day. Hes so happy to see me. Im becoming part of his life. I pat his belly and stroke his head.

There were still limits to Daniels engagement. He had yet to take Jeff for a walk, for example. But I left the two of them alone to work out that issue at their own pace. I tried to be as patient with Daniel as Jeff was.

Finally, one night, unprompted, Daniel took a leap of faith. He turned to his wife after dinner and said: Im lonely. I havent treated you well or thought about you for all these years. I was too afraid to let myself care about anything or anybody, but I know you care about me. I want to make it up to you.

She reached for his hand.

Then he took her for a walk.

Its been a strange few weeks for the fashion critic Cathy Horyn. First, she was the subject of a critical full-page ad in Womens Wear Daily taken out by the legendary designer Oscar de la Renta.

Now Lady Gaga has attacked her in lyrics, and the designer Hedi Slimane decided not to invite her to the Paris show of Saint Laurent, where he is creative director.

I asked Stuart Emmrich, the Style editor, to respond. The situation is unusual, he acknowledged  so much so that The Times will run a reported story that mentions it in Thursdays paper by Eric Wilson.

I would say I find the situation (about being barred from the Slimane show) more perplexing than upsetting, Mr. Emmrich said. I think Cathy dealt very deftly with this issue in the blog post she wrote after the YSL show.

Related Article Hot Dogs and Hamburgers? How Declasse! The Public Editor looks at Ms. Horyns feud with the designer Oscar de la Renta.

As for Lady Gaga, Mr. Emmrich was dismissive: Gaga is Gaga, and being outrageous, even vulgar, seems to be one of the ways she keeps herself in the public eye. Im not going to concern myself with her opinions of our fashion coverage.

Ms. Horyn is among the preeminent fashion critics in the United States, if not the world, and there is no question her work sometimes has a sharp bite. The New York Observer described her recently as notoriously harsh.

Of Mr. Slimanes current work, which she saw online, she wrote this in Wednesdays Times: It was a nice but frozen vision of a bohemian chick at the Chateau Marmont. (Fashion criticism is a world unto itself. Consider that, in the same article, Ms. Horyn wrote of Karl Lagerfelds work for Chanel: The short, blown-out silhouette is self-evidently about air.)

I dont think theres any chance that this will change the way we approach our coverage of fashion shows, or impact Cathys work as a critic, Mr. Emmrich said. I will let her work speak for itself, even when it is being inaccurately described, such as in that quote by The Observer. My feelings can probably be summed up in a statement that I issued to W.W.D. after todays article ran: Were not going to get into an argument with anyone, but it goes without saying that we stand behind Cathys critiques, which are invariably insightful and completely fair. 

Mr. Emmrich noted that some members of the fashion press support Ms. Horyn adamantly.

Criticism, by its nature, cannot make its subjects happy at all times. And fashion designers are a temperamental lot. The combination is likely to result in a Parisian contretemps now and then  but not one that should change the critics approach.",[]

Did Adam Lanza, who authorities have identified as the gunman in Newtown, Conn., ever receive a diagnosis of Aspergers syndrome?

2. If so, would that be relevant?

3. And has The Times been scrupulously responsible in the way it has reported on this aspect of Fridays massacre at the Sandy Hook Elementary School?

In brief, here are my conclusions, based on my own reading and a number of interviews and conversations this week.

1. Possibly.

2. It would not matter to the killing; it would help in understanding the personality and experiences of the gunman.

3. The Timess early reporting and presentation of the information was well-intentioned but flawed. (It began to remedy those flaws in a blog post Monday afternoon but had not yet done so in print on Tuesday.)

This subject is important to many of those whose lives are affected by Aspergers or other forms of Autism Spectrum Disorder. They are troubled and angered by how the topic has been treated in The Times and other news organizations over the past several days.

Joe McGinniss, the well-known author and the father of a son who has Aspergers, is among the many who wrote to me.

The suggestion that Aspergers might be a clue to why this happened is offensive to me, he said in a telephone interview Tuesday. Its misleading to suggest that quiet people who dont pick up on social cues are more likely to become killers.

Dr. Ami Klin, an expert on autism at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, said that any tie between the Newtown shootings and Aspergers or autism is an enormous disservice to those whose lives are affected by these developmental disorders, which should not be confused with mental illness.

Any human condition can coexist with violence, he said, but no correlation should be drawn.

In fact, he said, those with Aspergers are much more likely to be victims rather than victimizers.

This is not about autism, Dr. Klin said. Its about mental illness and guns that those with mental illness should have no access to.

The Times was understated in its reporting on this subject and, if you were a casual reader, the reference might not have jumped out. But for those close to the situation  often because they are parents of autistic children  it certainly did.

This was the initial reference, in a Saturday print edition profile of Mr. Lanza, written on deadline:

Matt Baier, now a junior at the University of Connecticut, and other high school classmates recalled how deeply uncomfortable Mr. Lanza was in social situations. Several said in separate interviews that it was their understanding that he had a developmental disorder. They said they had been told that the disorder was Aspergers syndrome, which is considered a high functioning form of autism. Its not like people picked on him for it, Mr. Baier said. From what I saw, people just let him be, and that was that. Law enforcement officials said Friday that they were closely examining whether Mr. Lanza had such a disorder.

I interviewed David Halbfinger, a reporter who was the articles author. He told me that he did not write that reference to Aspergers, but approved it after it had been inserted by an editor. He also said that the idea behind this first-day story was to find out and communicate as much as possible about Mr. Lanza.

The fear thats being expressed is that theres an implied cause, but we didnt say they were investigating it as a cause, Mr. Halbfinger said. On the first day, law enforcement is investigating everything. To impute cause and effect is to make a giant leap that we didnt do.

The Metro editor, Carolyn Ryan, responded in an e-mail:

We were told Adam Lanza had Aspergers from so many people who knew him that it would have been irresponsible to withhold that from readers. However, we were very careful with the language, saying that people who knew him understood he had a developmental disorder and had been told it was Aspergers. I wanted to make sure readers understood where the information was coming from, and that law enforcement had not confirmed this or officially described him as having Aspergers. The closely examining language was not intended to suggest that Aspergers accounted for the motive or cause, but that law enforcement officials had been told he had Aspergers and were trying to understand his condition and his behavior.

Critics, though, say that if you want to understand how such a statement might be taken, try this hypothetical substitution: Law enforcement officials said they were closely examining whether Mr. Lanza is gay. There is, for a reasonable person, the suggestion of cause and effect. It is very unlikely that that sentence would have appeared in The Times without further explanation.

References to Aspergers have now appeared in several Times articles, all based on anonymous sources or on named sources who were reporting what they had heard from someone else. It has been, in short, repeated conjecture by those who dont know. On Monday, The Associated Press reported that a divorce mediator, who was named, was told by the Lanzas that their son had Aspergers, and The Times began reporting that on The Lede blog. The blog post did a great deal to explain the issue clearly and responsibly.

If there were solid sourcing last week of the Aspergers diagnosis, the issue of its relevance could have been handled in a clarifying follow-up sentence  for example: Autism and Aspergers are developmental disorders, not mental illnesses; and there is no connection between them and violent behavior.

Mr. Halbfinger protested when I suggested the idea of such an explanation, particularly in a first-day story. To me, it seems kind of ridiculous; thats the journalistic equivalent of a nanny state, he said. He added, though, that as a parent himself, he does understand how parents feel about this subject. And he sees that there may be a knowledge deficit  people may not know very much about autism and Aspergers.

The story by The A.P. did have such a sentence as its last paragraph.

I think that is helpful and necessary. Cause and effect had been suggested; and something should have been done  and still can be  to clear up that troubling misconception. And while this may be of greatest concern to those who have a family member with Aspergers or autism, its broader than that. These are questions of clarity and accuracy  and those affect everyone. But more optimistically, there is now an opportunity to do some educating. I hope that happens.",[]

These are extraordinary times. The depth and strength of voters conviction that their opponents are determined to destroy their way of life has rarely been matched, perhaps only by the mood of the South in the years leading up to the Civil War.

In a recent column for Bloomberg View, my friend Frank Wilkinson put together a concise explanation:

A lot of Americans were not ready for a mixed-race president. They werent ready for gay marriage. They werent ready for the wave of legal and illegal immigration that redefined American demographics over the past two or three decades, bringing in lots of nonwhites. They werent ready  who was?  for the brutal effects of globalization on working- and middle-class Americans or the devastating fallout from the financial crisis. Their representatives didnt stop Obamacare. And their side didnt take back America in 2012 as Fox News and conservative radio personalities led them to believe they would. They feel the culture is running away from them (and theyre mostly right). They lack the power to control their own government. But they still have just enough to shut it down.



Animosity toward the federal government has been intensifying at a stunning rate. In a survey released on Sept. 23, Gallup found that the percentage of Republicans saying the federal government has too much power  81 percent  had reached a record-setting level.

The movement to the right on the part of the Republican electorate can be seen in Gallup surveys calculating that the percentage of Republicans who identify themselves as conservative grew between 2002 and 2010 by 10 percentage points, from 62 to 72 percent. During the same period, the percentage of Republicans who identify themselves as moderates fell from 31 to 23 percent.

These trends date back to the 1970s. Surveys conducted by American National Election Studies found that the percentage of self-described conservative Republicans rose from 42 in 1972 to 65 percent in 2008, while the percentage of moderate Republicans fell from 26 to 16 percent. Liberal Republicans  remember them?  fell from 10 to 4 percent.

Take the findings of a Pew Research Center survey released four weeks ago. They show that discontent with Republican House and Senate leaders runs deep among Republican primary voters: two-thirds of them disapprove of their partys Congressional leadership  John Boehner, the speaker of the House, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader.

Sometimes you have to turn to the know-your-enemy people to understand whats going on. The Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner is one of the keenest observers of the contemporary Republican electorate. He is conducting an ongoing study called the The Republican Party Project for the liberal nonprofit organization Democracy Corps. Greenbergs premise is that you cannot understand the government shutdown unless you understand the G.O.P. from the inside.

Greenberg puts Republicans into three categories (Figure 1): evangelical and religiously observant voters (47 percent); libertarian-leaning Tea Party supporters (22 percent); and moderates (25 percent).

Photo

Last week Greenberg released the results of six focus groups conducted with evangelical and other religiously observant Republicans (in Roanoke, Va., and Colorado Springs, Colo.), Tea Party supporters who are not evangelicals (Raleigh, N.C., and Roanoke), and moderate Republicans (Raleigh and Colorado Springs).

One of the key factors pushing Republicans to extremes, according to Greenbergs report, is the intensity of animosity toward Obama. This animosity among participants in all six focus groups is reflected in Figure 2, which represents a word cloud of focus group references to the president, with the size of each word in the cloud proportional to the frequency with which it was used.

Photo

In the six focus groups of Republican voters, according to Greenbergs report, few explicitly talk about Obama in racial terms, but

the base supporters are very conscious of being white in a country with growing minorities. Their party is losing to a Democratic Party of big government whose goal is to expand programs that mainly benefit minorities. Race remains very much alive in the politics of the Republican Party.

Voters like this, according to the report, are convinced that they have lost the larger battle:

While many voters, including plenty of Democrats, question whether Obama is succeeding and getting his agenda done, Republicans think he has won. The country as a whole may think gridlock has triumphed, particularly in the midst of a Republican-led government shutdown, but Republicans see a president who has fooled and manipulated the public, lied, and gotten his secret socialist-Marxist agenda done. Republicans and their kind of Americans are losing.

In his report for the Democracy Corps, Greenberg describes the Republican base electorate as fearful of being strategically outmaneuvered:

They think they face a victorious Democratic Party that is intent on expanding government to increase dependency and therefore electoral support. It starts with food stamps and unemployment benefits; expands further if you legalize the illegals; but insuring the uninsured dramatically grows those dependent on government. They believe this is an electoral strategy  not just a political ideology or economic philosophy. If Obamacare happens, the Republican Party may be lost, in their view.

Conservative troops blame moderate Republican for what they see as Democratic victories. The Republican base

thinks they are losing politically and losing control of the country  and their starting reaction is worried, discouraged, scared, and concerned about the direction of the country  and a little powerless to change course. They think Obama has imposed his agenda, while Republicans in D.C. let him get away with it.

Figure 3 represents a second word cloud generated by Greenbergs data showing which words came up most often in all six focus groups:

Photo

Greenbergs study found that in the view of many, if not most, Republicans

the Democratic Party exists to create programs and dependency  the food stamp hammock, entitlements, the 47 percent. And on the horizon  comprehensive immigration reform and Obamacare. Citizenship for 12 million illegals and tens of million getting free health care is the end of the road.

These voters think they are losing the country, Greenberg said during an Oct. 3 conference call with reporters.

Among Greenbergs other findings from his focus groups:

The participants are very conscious of being white in a country that is increasingly minority.

Republican voters are threatened by Obama and the Democratic Party, but they are angry at their own party leaders. The problem in D.C. is not gridlock; Obama has won; the problem is Republicans failing to stop him.

Together, evangelicals and Tea Party supporters comprise more than half the party. Moderates, about a quarter of Republicans, are very conscious of being illegitimate within their own party.



The evangelical and Tea Party wings of the Republican Party combine into a clear majority of Republican voters, and according to Greenberg, they have a mutually reinforcing relationship:

Social issues are central for Evangelicals and they feel a deep sense of cultural and political loss. They believe their towns, communities, and schools are suffering from a deep culture rot that has invaded from the outside. The central focus here is homosexuality, but also the decline of homogenous small towns. They like the Tea Party because they stand up to the Democrats.

Tea Party supporters, according to Greenbergs research, have a more libertarian edge, but their worldview is compatible with the evangelical agenda:

Big government, Obama, the loss of liberty, and decline of responsibility are central to the Tea Party worldview. Obamas America is an unmitigated evil based on big government, regulations, and dependency. They are not focused on social issues at all. They like the Tea Party because it is getting back to basics and believe it has the potential to reshape the G.O.P.

John Boehner is just the kind of Republican leader the hard right dislikes  a deal maker, a compromiser. The Republican primary electorate, with its hold on a solid block of Republican representatives and its ability to recruit and promote challengers, now has Boehner trapped. Personally inclined to find his way out of the face-to-face confrontation  he is, after all, a career politician loath to shut down the government  Boehner has been forced into a confrontation, with less and less room for negotiation with his own partys warring flanks and with Democrats.

Two days after Obamas re-election, when Republicans lost eight seats but retained their House majority (232 to 200, with three vacancies), Boehner was asked by Diane Sawyer on ABC, You have said next year that you would repeal the health care vote. Thats still your mission? Boehner replied: Well, I think the election changes that. Its pretty clear that the president was re-elected, Obamacare is the law of the land.

That same day, Michael OBrien of NBC News suggested that

The speakers pronouncement, if nothing else, signifies a pivot away from Republicans efforts to showcase for conservatives their doggedness in looking to repeal Obamacare.

Nearly a year later, on Oct. 6, Boehner admitted that he had been forced to capitulate by constituent pressures on Republican members of the House. Appearing again on ABC, this time with George Stephanopoulos, Boehner said, I and my members decided the threat of Obamacare and what was happening was so important that it was time for us to take a stand.

Stephanopoulos asked, Did you decide it or was it decided for you? Boehners answer:

I, working with my members, decided to do this in a unified way. George, I have 233 Republicans in the House. And youve never seen a more dedicated group of people who are thoroughly concerned about the future of our country. They believe that Obamacare, all these regulations coming out of the administration, are threatening the future for our kids and our grandkids. It is time for us to stand and fight.

A determined minority can do a lot in our system. It has already won the battle for the hearts and minds of the Republican House caucus. That is not a modest victory.

nytimes.com,2016-02-02 00:00:00,'A Very Heated Reaction' to The Timess Endorsement of Hillary Clinton,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Updated, 10:30 a.m.

In what surely qualifies as understatement, The Timess top opinion editor calls The Timess recent endorsement of Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary the source of plenty of reaction.

Theres been a lot of readership, a lot of reader comments, the editorial page editor, Andrew Rosenthal, told me on Monday.

Thats for sure. Over 5,600 comments have been posted on the editorial, which was published online Saturday and in Sundays paper. A vast majority of those comments came from Bernie Sanders supporters, who vehemently disagreed with the editorial boards conclusion. (The Times also expressed a preference, within the Republican field of candidates, for John Kasich, the Ohio governor. That, however, is not an endorsement; the Clinton editorial is one.)

A typical comment, and one gathering one of the highest number of recommends, or reader agreement, came from Daniel Ricketti of New Jersey, who wrote:

Disappointed in this pick. NYT never even gave Bernie a shot. Straight from the beginning basically no attention.

Many readers have complained to me that Mr. Sanderss campaign and viability has been underplayed in the pages of The Times  and Ive written about this numerous times. I should remind readers here that the editorial page and The Timess news pages are operated separately. There is no involvement by the news editors or reporters in any editorial or endorsement, nor does the editorial board influence the news coverage.

As weve seen throughout the campaign, the reaction had a weird and hard-to-calculate Bernie-Sanders-enthusiasm factor, because his supporters are particular skilled at getting people to speak out publicly, and make use of social media, Mr. Rosenthal told me.

I asked him (because a reader had pointed it out to me) why there were no Times Picks within the comments. Mr. Rosenthal said that comments on Times editorials were never awarded the gold emblems because its illogical. It makes no sense for The Times to give extra points to those who agree or disagree with the papers own institutional voice, he said.

He added that he doesnt like Times Picks anywhere: I think we should re-evaluate that practice. (This blog also does not award Times Picks. While its undoubtedly true that some comments are more incisive than others, I like to let readers judge that.)

The editorial also prompted an unusual number of letters to the editor, about 200, according to Thomas Feyer, the letters editor.

The letters were fairly split between agreeing and disagreeing with our editorial  probably slightly more anti-Hillary than pro-, Mr. Feyer said. And there was the usual mix between the thoughtful and well-reasoned letters, and the vitriolic and over the top.

The Times published a sampling of letters on Monday that covers most of the main ideas in what we received, he said. They will appear Tuesday in print.

I heard from one reader, Tom Mullaney of Chicago, who wrote: I cannot recall an endorsement coming so early and not once the race was between the nominees. He added, To me, it makes the paper too much of a player rather than observer of the campaign.

One can certainly make a case against newspaper candidate endorsements  and some papers have stopped making them  but Mr. Rosenthal told me that The Times is following its usual practice of making endorsements during primaries, including mayoral and gubernatorial races, as well as presidential.

There was a time, he said, when the paper genteelly waited until before the New York primary, but that no longer makes sense, if it ever did, he said.

Despite the negative reaction, Mr. Rosenthal said he was not perturbed.

Voting is about choosing, he said. You cant take a strong position without getting a very heated reaction. Its what I expected.

The editorial was the result of a robust discussion, by the board, which includes 17 members as well as himself. Mr. Rosenthal reports to Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the Times publisher. (The publisher is not a member of the editorial board, as an earlier version of this post stated.)

But we came to a very strong agreement very quickly, he said. He declined to say what the precise vote was, but said that it was an easier decision than in 2008s Democratic primary. The Times endorsed Mrs. Clinton over Barack Obama.

That was about two to one, Mr. Rosenthal said. This one was more definitive.

Leaving aside the matter of who The Times endorsed (that is definitely outside my brief), heres my take: A well-argued newspaper endorsement has value for readers because it can synthesize issues and promote informed discussion. As for the timing, The Times is a national newspaper, so if the purpose of an endorsement editorial is to influence voting, it only makes sense to publish it before that voting has begun anywhere in the country.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-02-23 00:00:00,Notes From Psychiatry's Battle Lines,"['All Contributors', 'The Great Divide', 'The Conversation', 'Errol Morris', 'George Makari', 'The End']","Couch is a series about psychotherapy.

I have two offices, one for answers and another for questions. As a clinical psychiatrist, I begin my day in a room filled with soothing art and soft leather chairs, where my pharmaceutical prescriptions and psychological interventions are intended to meet the pressing needs of my patients. Here, Im supposed to have answers, or at least thats the hope.

Then, at some point near noon, I descend 12 floors, cross a cobblestone drive, pass into an old granite building and settle into a cubicle that overlooks Manhattans East River. Here, by a blackboard filled with arrows, scribbles and circles, and surrounded by hundreds of color-coded files and books, I do my work as a historian of psychiatry. It now becomes my job to critically pick apart the assumptions and beliefs of my own practice, my own field.

Two separate rooms, two different modes. Is that true? I was daydreaming recently, searching for a simple response to a question often asked of me  namely, how does my practice as a psychiatrist relate to my historical studies?  and that was what I first came up with.

Unfortunately, after but a moment of reflection, my neat division collapsed. In clinical psychiatry, perhaps more than in any other field, you incessantly ask questions, and the right question can often become an answer. Not good enough for what? may be all that is required from me to help a patient comprehend a sudden depressive turn. Likewise, historians, though driven by skeptical questioning, certainly can generate solid answers about what happened and why.

Better to say, then, that I inhabit two deeply related realms that have long been divided by mutual suspicion and conflict.

Consider this: Like most clinicians, I am eager for scientific progress, something new that will yield more clarity and provide my patients with faster or deeper relief. However, as I take stock of a new neuroenhancer, or the latest genetic correlation that may point to the cause of an illness, or a suddenly popular diagnosis, the historian in me senses ghosts beginning to stir.

Historians have shown that psychiatry has long suffered from the adoption of scientific-sounding theories and cures that turned out to be dogma. Perhaps the clearest example of such scientism was psychiatrys embrace, in the early 19th century, of Franz Joseph Galls phrenology, in which all mental attributes and deficiencies were assigned to specific brain locales, evidence be damned. During much of the 20th century, psychoanalysis proposed far more conclusive answers than it could support, and today, the same could be said for some incautious neurobiological researchers.

These exaggerations are not merely academic errors. Over the years, scientism has persuaded mental doctors to do bad, even terrible things. Ice-pick lobotomies, refrigerator mothers, insulin shock: The list is not short. The most notorious example involved the father of psychiatric genetics, Ernst Rudin, who during the Nazi era sought to cleanse the German population of so-called degenerative heredity through the sterilization and euthanasia of the mentally ill.

Much less extreme, everyday infiltrations of ideology can be discerned in the portraits that psychiatrists have drawn of their field. Most of these accounts have been self-serving affairs, in which the past was ravaged so as to justify present clinical certitudes. Nearly every generation has featured a proud practitioner who dismissed his predecessors and lifted the flag of victory, only to have it snatched away some years later. Since 1800, the end of history in psychiatry has come with the triumph of the asylum, followed by Romanic medicine, brain anatomy, genetics, psychoanalysis and, most recently, drugs like Prozac.

And so, as my morning sessions end and I cross over to my scholarly retreat, I am acutely aware that my present commitments as a doctor might undermine my capacity to fairly envision the past. Then I settle in before my archives and books and my troubles multiply.

For the past three decades, the reigning model among historians of my field has been dubbed antipsychiatric. Following the work of Michel Foucault, the fashion has been to argue that psychiatry emerged as a police arm of the modern state. Mental doctors were self-deluded or malevolent, their treatments cunning, at times barbaric, methods of control. Mental illness itself, they argued, was a false construct used to control dissidents, rebels and outcasts.

Some fine work along these lines has exposed the creation of bogus diseases that served to pathologize wrong behaviors, such as homosexuality. Researchers have shined light on the supposed madness of runaway slaves in antebellum America and political dissidents in the Soviet Union. They have also explored diagnostic fads, disappearing diseases like hysteria or sudden epidemics of ailments like attention deficit disorder.

However, this vein of research has been tarred by its own crude ideology. If scientism can falsely turn ethical and political issues into matters of disease, and grossly exaggerate what we know about the nature of mental illness, Foucault and his acolytes are prone to an antithetical failing: radical social constructionism. Madness, they would have us believe, whether it is schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder or anorexia, is not grounded in any biological reality. Greedy commercial interests and a repressive society, they claim, have falsely transformed human differences and personal choices into psychiatric disorders.

Arguments of this sort can be morally compelling, for they appeal to the liberal ideal of toleration and argue for the civil rights of stigmatized minorities. However, no one is a Foucauldian in an emergency room. I was a medical resident in psychiatry when I first studied Foucaults arguments, and I got the distinct impression that his madness was often just a metaphor with which to challenge authority, not much related to the shaking, hallucinating teenager that I would soon return to on the wards.

To me, Foucault and his followers seemed impossibly naive, even complacent. Had they ever encountered severe obsessive-compulsive disorder or suicidal depression? Had they ever seen a manic patient take lithium and be restored? Psychiatrists might be blinded by their commitments as insiders, but this academic view seemed sustainable only by remaining on the outside looking in.

Over the years, in my dual roles as practitioner and historian, I have watched each camp become more strident, thanks in part to a lack of dialogue. Too often, psychiatrists dismiss the disturbing lessons from the past, while historians roll their eyes at the very possibility of progress in psychiatry. In these isolated worlds, scientism and radical social constructionism flourish.

Perched as I am between the disputants, lucky to be supported by a unique interdisciplinary institute and a group of like-minded colleagues, I have sought to reconcile my quarreling loves. Its been a bit like marital therapy, in which profoundly intertwined partners mostly ignore each other, then occasionally pipe up to loudly dismiss each others perspective.

Amid such conflict, in my work with patients and in my writing, I do my best to explore contradictions, look for specifics amid abstractions, search for syntheses and, in the face of real uncertainty, advocate for polyphony, a multiplicity of explanatory perspectives. And I have come to distrust unstable dualities like mind or brain, artificial divisions like nature or nurture, and seductive dichotomies that should not end but merely begin an inquiry  such as having one office for answers and another for questions.

nytimes.com,2015-07-11 00:00:00,Writing Books Very Few Will Read,"['William Novak', 'The End', 'The Great Divide', 'The Conversation', 'Errol Morris', 'All Contributors']","Draft is a series about the art and craft of writing.

Authors are often asked where they get their ideas. As a writer for hire, my answer owes something to the songwriter Sammy Cahn. Asked which came first, the music or the lyrics, he said: The phone call.

One morning that call came from a rabbi in the Midwest who knew of my work as a ghostwriter. He asked if I had any interest in writing a memoir with the patriarch of a prominent and philanthropic family. There was a twist: This book would never be published.

It took time to absorb the oddness of the question. Was I really willing to write a book that wouldnt be seen (let alone read) by anyone I knew, or anyone who might want to hire me in the future? And was I prepared to forgo royalties, reviews and the assorted social and economic benefits that authors like to dream about and sometimes even experience? The clients family had an excellent reputation, so I flew out to see him.

I met J. and his wife for dinner in a downtown restaurant, and we liked one another immediately. We met again the next morning, and his son and I soon came to terms in a pattern I would see again. Members of the older generation are often reluctant to spend money on a memoir until a son or daughter points out that a private book is really for the grandchildren  and eventually for their children. Talk about legacy! In other words, Dad (or Mom), although this book is about you, its not really for you.

A few months into the project, J. had a fatal heart attack. When his widow asked me to keep writing, I began turning a memoir into a biography. By then I had learned that J.s father had also written a private memoir, and so had his father, so the book I was writing would serve as another link in a continuing and treasured family chain.

In most respects, writing for private clients is like working on any other book. One difference, though, is that instead of trying to imagine what my audience might find compelling, or debating some of the contents with editors and publishers, I now had a direct line to the readers. They were the same people I was interviewing  my clients family members and his close friends and associates, so I knew what mattered to them.

Another happy surprise was that private books dont demand complete structural consistency. When an occasional topic cries out for a different approach  a few pages of oral history, perhaps, or even an annotated list  I feel free to make the form fit the content, rather than the other way around. There are times, for example, when the best way to handle a complicated or controversial subject is to present an edited conversation that reflects several viewpoints. I dont take these liberties often, but its nice to have options.

After writing half a dozen books that cant be found in any library or bookstore, Ive found rewards that mean as much to me as seeing my name on the best-seller list. Often, publishers of commercial memoirs or biographies encourage the writer to pay special attention to the sordid elements of a life, because, lets face it, scandal, crime, addiction and other human failings are more compelling to most readers than the values Im likely to be writing about. But when a family or an organization commissions a book, theyre more interested in stories, personalities and lessons, rather than adversarial journalism or sensationalism. They assume the writer will focus on the subjects better nature, which is fine by me. St. Augustine notwithstanding, not every memoir has to be confessional, and no rule, heavenly or human, requires us to disclose every detail of our lives. Call me old-fashioned, but Id rather explore the qualities and actions that will inspire future generations. Chances are, they will also inspire me.

But isnt this just public relations? I dont think so  not when your book will be read by only a handful of readers. Call it private relations, if you like. In commercial memoirs, of course, I do my best to present a full picture of the person, which can be difficult when he or she has spent a lifetime avoiding certain topics.

Private books present a different set of challenges. My phone doesnt ring as often, and when it does, I cant show my past work to potential clients because private books are, by definition, confidential. I dont enjoy having little to say when somebody asks what Im working on, and when I run into problems, there is no editor to consult with. I miss the advice and friendship of publishers, editors and publicists, and the simple thrill of walking into a publishing house, where the walls are lined with shimmering new books and the offices are filled with people who love them.

Among my commercial books, two or three sold so poorly that they might as well have been issued privately. But Ive also been surprised in the other direction. I spent several years on a private book that ended in a print run of 100,000, which calls into question the very notion of private. I was asked to help the founder of a cable company write his memoirs, but he was so modest, so eager to give credit to others, that I soon approached his son with a different idea: What if I wrote a personal history of the company that will include as much about your father as hell tell me? This made it possible for the founders colleagues to describe his many accomplishments and acts of kindness. When the book was done, the company produced copies for its many employees.

But thats unusual, and the other private books Ive written have remained virtually invisible. Two of the most meaningful were memorials for cherished family members, both of whom were leaders in their community and powerful forces for good. Theres some truth to the notion that a biography can bring a person back to life. Neither of these memorials has even been printed, let alone distributed. But to the families, they mean the world.

Sounds crazy, doesnt it?

But it happened this month when Ron Lieber, the business reporter and columnist, wrote about a Web site that helps people organize their financial lives. It has a word in it that only in the rarest of occasions appears in The Times, both in print or online.

Because of The Timess style rules, which prohibit the use of such language except in the rarest of cases, the article carefully  coyly  wrote around the questionable word, in describing how a Seattle widow reacted to her husbands death:

In the many months of suffering after Mr. Hernandos death in July 2009, she beat herself up while spending dozens of hours excavating their financial life and slowly reassembling it. But then, she resolved to keep anyone she knew from ever again being in the same situation. The result is a Web site named for the scolding, profane exhortation that her inner voice shouted during those dark days in the intensive care unit. She might have called it getyouracttogether.org, but she changed just one word.

Many readers got it. Some did not.

Mr. Lieber said he heard from some readers that they were puzzled and couldnt find the site. He said he was frustrated.

I think if were going to devote an entire story to a company or service, we ought to be able to print its name once, he said.

Its hard to argue with that. What harm would it do?

I talked with Philip B. Corbett, associate managing editor for standards, who agreed that it was unfortunate that the article caused confusion but nevertheless said that keeping coarse language out of The Times is worthwhile.

And, he said, if The Times starts using the names of Web sites with that particular word in it, then there might be no end to it, since there are so many. Whats more, where do you draw the line? What if  let your imagination run wild  the Web site had a significantly more offensive word in it?

Because I abide by The Timess style rules, Ill rely on the links above to satisfy curious readers. (Of course, you cant do that from a printed page; thats part of the problem.)

Readers often complain about similar kinds of things in The Times. Last fall, The Times insisted on referring to a hit Off Broadway show as The Cockfight Play, though that was not its name. In November, Jane Brody wrote about a quit-smoking book without using its title or, in this case, linking to the book.

The books author, Richard Brunswick, put it this way: We are not living in the 1800s or early 1900s! The world has changed. Surely The Times can do better. I think you could use a policy that supports using words that people use every day, not genteel innuendos more appropriate for the set of Downton Abbey.'

I understand that The Times has conservative standards about language. Its style book makes that clear:

The Times virtually never prints obscene words, and it maintains a steep threshold for vulgar ones. In part the concern is for the newspapers welcome in classrooms and on breakfast tables in diverse communities nationwide. But a larger concern is for the newspapers character. The Times differentiates itself by taking a stand for civility in public discourse, sometimes at an acknowledged cost in the vividness of an article or two, and sometimes at the price of submitting to gibes.

However, it occasionally makes exceptions. I probably would have made a different call on the article about the business Web site. I also think the name of the play deserved to be used accurately.

Sometimes, clarity and accuracy trump matters of taste.

Meanwhile, the rules on language keep evolving, even at The Times. And this sort of close call may turn out to be a lost cause. As Mr. Corbett put it: Were definitely fighting a rear-guard action.",[]

Theres been a lot of readership, a lot of reader comments, the editorial page editor, Andrew Rosenthal, told me on Monday.

Thats for sure. Over 5,600 comments have been posted on the editorial, which was published online Saturday and in Sundays paper. A vast majority of those comments came from Bernie Sanders supporters, who vehemently disagreed with the editorial boards conclusion. (The Times also expressed a preference, within the Republican field of candidates, for John Kasich, the Ohio governor. That, however, is not an endorsement; the Clinton editorial is one.)

A typical comment, and one gathering one of the highest number of recommends, or reader agreement, came from Daniel Ricketti of New Jersey, who wrote:

Disappointed in this pick. NYT never even gave Bernie a shot. Straight from the beginning basically no attention.

Many readers have complained to me that Mr. Sanderss campaign and viability has been underplayed in the pages of The Times  and Ive written about this numerous times. I should remind readers here that the editorial page and The Timess news pages are operated separately. There is no involvement by the news editors or reporters in any editorial or endorsement, nor does the editorial board influence the news coverage.

As weve seen throughout the campaign, the reaction had a weird and hard-to-calculate Bernie-Sanders-enthusiasm factor, because his supporters are particular skilled at getting people to speak out publicly, and make use of social media, Mr. Rosenthal told me.

I asked him (because a reader had pointed it out to me) why there were no Times Picks within the comments. Mr. Rosenthal said that comments on Times editorials were never awarded the gold emblems because its illogical. It makes no sense for The Times to give extra points to those who agree or disagree with the papers own institutional voice, he said.

He added that he doesnt like Times Picks anywhere: I think we should re-evaluate that practice. (This blog also does not award Times Picks. While its undoubtedly true that some comments are more incisive than others, I like to let readers judge that.)

The editorial also prompted an unusual number of letters to the editor, about 200, according to Thomas Feyer, the letters editor.

The letters were fairly split between agreeing and disagreeing with our editorial  probably slightly more anti-Hillary than pro-, Mr. Feyer said. And there was the usual mix between the thoughtful and well-reasoned letters, and the vitriolic and over the top.

The Times published a sampling of letters on Monday that covers most of the main ideas in what we received, he said. They will appear Tuesday in print.

I heard from one reader, Tom Mullaney of Chicago, who wrote: I cannot recall an endorsement coming so early and not once the race was between the nominees. He added, To me, it makes the paper too much of a player rather than observer of the campaign.

One can certainly make a case against newspaper candidate endorsements  and some papers have stopped making them  but Mr. Rosenthal told me that The Times is following its usual practice of making endorsements during primaries, including mayoral and gubernatorial races, as well as presidential.

There was a time, he said, when the paper genteelly waited until before the New York primary, but that no longer makes sense, if it ever did, he said.

Despite the negative reaction, Mr. Rosenthal said he was not perturbed.

Voting is about choosing, he said. You cant take a strong position without getting a very heated reaction. Its what I expected.

The editorial was the result of a robust discussion, by the board, which includes 17 members as well as himself. Mr. Rosenthal reports to Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the Times publisher. (The publisher is not a member of the editorial board, as an earlier version of this post stated.)

But we came to a very strong agreement very quickly, he said. He declined to say what the precise vote was, but said that it was an easier decision than in 2008s Democratic primary. The Times endorsed Mrs. Clinton over Barack Obama.

That was about two to one, Mr. Rosenthal said. This one was more definitive.

Leaving aside the matter of who The Times endorsed (that is definitely outside my brief), heres my take: A well-argued newspaper endorsement has value for readers because it can synthesize issues and promote informed discussion. As for the timing, The Times is a national newspaper, so if the purpose of an endorsement editorial is to influence voting, it only makes sense to publish it before that voting has begun anywhere in the country.",[]

IF you only own a hammer, observed the psychologist Abraham Maslow, you tend to see every problem as a nail.









Similarly, when the governments only chance of keeping an inconvenient truth out of the news media is to warn of a national security threat, its amazing how these threats pop up.

This has turned out to be a powerfully effective tool. News organizations, after all, dont want to endanger the nations safety, or be accused of doing so, so editors often listen to government officials when they make their case for not publishing. And, after listening, editors occasionally consent.

But a countervailing force  peoples right to know what their government is doing and the news medias responsibility to find out and tell them  ought to rule the day.

We saw this play out last week when The Times, in an important story from Yemen, broke its long silence on the location of a base used for American drone strikes in the region. Like other major news organizations, including The Washington Post and The Associated Press, The Times agreed well over a year ago to keep that location  Saudi Arabia  quiet. Instead, it wrote at various times of a base on the Arabian Peninsula. (Other news outlets eventually did name the country, making the secrecy almost a moot point.)

Top editors at The Times changed their minds last week for several reasons. One was that, after monitoring the matter for months, we were not aware of any specific security threats, said David Leonhardt, the Washington bureau chief. In addition, the base location was at the heart of this article, according to Dean Baquet, the managing editor, while previously it had been a footnote. The most pressing reason, though, was that the drone programs architect, John O. Brennan, had been nominated to lead the Central Intelligence Agency and The Times had a responsibility to examine his record.

In short, it was time for the facts to come out.

High time, Id say.

Thats because the bigger and more troubling issue is whether the information should have been withheld to begin with. The reason offered  that naming the location would upset Saudi citizens to the point that the base might have to be closed, thus hampering Americas counterterrorism efforts  doesnt cut it. Keeping the governments secrets is not the news medias role, unless there is a clear, direct and life-threatening reason to justify it. The classic example is revealing troop movements in wartime. Such a specific threat doesnt exist now, and from all I can glean, it didnt exist many months ago either.

This discussion couldnt be more important, considering the context: the darkness in which Americas drone program has been operating and quickly growing.

In what a federal judge has described as an Alice in Wonderland situation, with a little Catch-22 added for good measure, the secrecy around the drone program is self-perpetuating. The government, until very recently, had not even acknowledged its existence, even though the unmanned aircraft have killed thousands of people in Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan  tragically including many civilians, some of them children, and even some American citizens. The government prefers to describe the dead, sometimes inaccurately, as militants or terrorists.

The Times, to its credit, is in court trying to get information on the drone program, and on the deaths of Anwar al-Awlaki and his teenage son, both American citizens. Also to its credit, The Times published an eye-opening drone-related article last May when the reporters Jo Becker and Scott Shane wrote about President Obamas list of individuals to be targeted for assassination. And it has published other strong pieces on the subject, despite the obstacles.

This administration, while vowing transparency and accountability, has actually become ever more secretive and punitive: stamping classified on everything in sight, pursuing whistle-blowers as never before, and prosecuting journalists for publishing leaked information.

All in the name of national security, the hammer of choice.

The real threat to national security is a government operating in secret and accountable to no one, with watchdogs that are too willing to muzzle themselves.

Top Times editors say that they are deeply committed to informing the public, but that they believe its only responsible to listen when government officials make a request. And, they emphasize, they often say no.

Fair enough. But the bar should be set very high for agreeing to honor those requests. This one didnt clear that bar.

Whats missing in the dark and ever-expanding world of drone warfare is a big helping of accountability, served up in the bright light of day.

WHEN it comes to covering the death of a sitting Supreme Court justice, what a difference a decade makes.









In the late summer of 2005, The Timess longtime Supreme Court reporter, Linda Greenhouse, found out about the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist when the courts press officer called her and said, Linda, the chief died.

She immediately huddled at her home with the Washington bureau chief, preparing an article for the mornings print edition. Her editor, Philip Taubman, brought along his technically savvy son to help with sending the story to New York for processing.

Now retired from The Times and teaching at Yale Law School (and still writing for the paper), Ms. Greenhouse found out about the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last week in quite a different way: Her husband saw the news on Facebook.

Meanwhile, The Times was gearing itself up for a huge wave of stories, all from a standing start. The newspaper did have an obituary prepared, but while Chief Justice Rehnquist had been ill for some time, Justice Scalias death was unexpected.

In general, the weeks coverage went well  impressive in terms of depth and scope  but not without a few bumps along the way, especially early on.

A few of the issues that arose brought reader mail. Some readers were upset that The Times was slow to announce the news on Saturday afternoon. Others were bothered by the fact that their Sunday print editions  some of which have Saturday afternoon deadlines  did not carry the Scalia news at all.

And some readers were disturbed by how quickly the focus went from the unexpected death of a major public figure to the unsavory political machinations of naming a new Supreme Court justice.

I was stupefied, disappointed and dismayed at how quickly nytimes.com posted news stories, analyses and an editorial about the upcoming succession fight, said Eliot Kieval, a lawyer in New York City. It seems to me that the first few hours after the announcement of the passing of a longtime public official are a time for remembering them personally and professionally.

On the matter of The Times being slower to send out an alert about the justices death, the executive editor, Dean Baquet, told me that he had believed unusual caution was called for. I was nervous about alerting it; there was something about what we had that worried me, he said. And thats one where if you get it wrong you can never come back.

Mr. Baquet first heard about the justices death from a senior editor, Marc Lacey, at 4:53. Around 10 minutes earlier, The San Antonio Express News had broken the story, and several other news organizations soon followed suit, some attributing the news to the Texas daily. The Guardian tweeted out the news at 5:04 p.m.; CNN at 5:20. The Times was among the latest, at 5:39 p.m.

Bob Swofford was one reader who was disappointed by that. I wanted to get an immediate, authoritative story from The Times in short order, he wrote, but had to rely on other sources.

Adam Liptaks fine obituary for Justice Scalia, written about two years ago, was a key element in the coverage, but it didnt appear in its entirety right away. A few paragraphs posted with the news alert. But even though the 4,700-word obit was essentially ready, because of the need for updates, it was about an hour before a full version was posted.

I breathed a sigh of relief knowing that we had pre-written an enormous Scalia obituary a couple of years ago, Mr. Liptak told me. (The Times often has obituaries in hand for public figures.)

Still, having a prepared obituary does not do much good for print readers if a prominent figure happens to die at the wrong time of day, and some subscribers were unhappy, among them Don Noel of Connecticut, a former newspaper editor who wrote to register his dissatisfaction.

At 5:44 Saturday afternoon, I got a breaking news notification from The Times on my iPhone reporting the death of Antonin Scalia, he wrote. More than 12 hours later, my Sunday Times was delivered to my doorstep in Hartford  with not a single word about Scalias death. He wrote: Maybe print journalism is deader than Id thought.

When The Times did get fully geared up, its deep reporting bench and institutional memory resulted in a full array of strong stories. As James Warren of Poynter.org noted early last week, The Times had a package of at least 14 news and opinion articles online by Monday morning, and a substantial package for its print readers in Mondays paper.

Mr. Liptak told me about a conference call run by the Washington bureau chief, Elisabeth Bumiller, with at least 12 reporters and editors taking part. When the institution springs to life, its really something to see, he said.

Heres my take on The Timess offerings in general, and on reader complaints: On the relatively late alert, it would be easy to say now that The Times was too cautious, but I think waiting awhile was smart. Readers often tell me they would prefer the paper wait longer and be sure its information is accurate. As a reader once put it, chiding The Times after a mistake was published because of haste after the Newtown school massacre in 2012: We believed that The New York Times was more interested in getting it right than in getting it first.

Given the fact that a lengthy obituary had already been prepared, it was unfortunate that it took so long to post it in full. And while early print deadlines for the Sunday edition are a fact of life, its regrettable that many print subscribers had no whiff of this huge news in their Sunday paper.

Finally, on Mr. Kievals complaint, I agree that, in an ideal world, the news media  and society in general  would be able take a few hours to reflect on a public figures life before delving into the process of finding (or delaying) his replacement. But we dont live in that world, and I dont fault The Times for jumping immediately into the fray. In fact, I think it was the only way to go.

That fray will not be over any time soon, as every sentient being knows by now. Nor should it be expected to be, since the stakes are so high. As Mr. Liptak put it, This has the potential to reshape American life for 30 years.",[]

Sometimes its the doctors, not the families, who cant let a patient go.

My elderly patient had lived much longer than seemed possible at the time of his cancer diagnosis. Ten years later, though, his relapsed lymphoma had become medically unstoppable.

The palliative care team was called in to manage his growing confusion and discomfort, and to discuss what we call goals of care. Thats what palliative care does: It focuses on keeping symptoms under control for the seriously ill and, for patients who cant be cured, addressing how they want to die, including the option of hospice care. Now that this patients disease could not be restrained, what did he want? He could no longer answer, but his wife and son, sad but cleareyed, chose to stop all treatment aimed at curing his cancer.

Hearing this, his oncologist, standing beside me at the nurses station, cried, heartbroken that her patient of so many years would not rally one more time.

That evening, though, the patients primary care doctor came to the hospital, seeing himself, it seemed, as the cavalry. There was hope yet, he said: The patient needed rehab to make him strong enough for more chemotherapy, not palliative care and hospice. So the patient  disoriented and unable to speak  went to an inpatient rehabilitation unit. He died there, a few weeks later.

Im sure the primary care doctor meant well, but theres no question that his actions made the situation worse because he deprived the patient and his family of comfort at the mans lifes end. And this was far from the first time Ive seen something like this happen. Such situations arise in part because modern health care still embraces a false dichotomy between curative treatment and palliation, between making a patient healthy and relieving his or her pain.

Palliative care itself suffers from an identity problem, in that many people equate palliation with hospice  i.e., end of life. This mistaken association can make a palliative care consultation feel like a death sentence to even the most open-minded clinicians, patients and family members. Striving for a cure is historically seen as a unique pathway that restores health; easing suffering is a separate, non-curative path that ends with the patient dying.

And its true that palliative care does offer symptom management to patients who are expected to die soon, as my lymphoma patient was. But it is more than that: It also helps patients with long-term illnesses like congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, people who are expected to live with their illness, but need careful managing of their symptoms. If it becomes clear that a patient receiving palliation along with curative treatment will not survive her illness, then the palliative care group works with the medical team to help her make the transition to hospice and help her decide how to spend the last of her time on earth.

Palliative care can extend life, too. A well-known 2010 New England Journal of Medicine paper co-written by Jennifer S. Temel, an oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, established that patients with a certain type of lung cancer who received early palliative care not only reported better quality of life and reduced symptoms of depression, but also lived longer than patients who received only traditional oncology care  a result that has since been found with other forms of cancer.

Often, though, the palliative care team is consulted late in the illness, as was the case with my patient. One reason is money: To put it in the crass language of hospital accounting, palliative care is de-incentivized. It saves hospitals money by reducing costly and often futile care at the end of patients lives, but earns little compared with the expensive drugs and scans used in curative treatment.

But another barrier is the attitude of physicians themselves. Many oncologists, focused on keeping patients alive for as long as possible and hoping, always, to beat the odds, find it hard to discuss what might happen if they dont.

It was the same with my patients oncologist. Hearing about the move away from palliation to rehabilitation, she sounded relieved. Well, if he goes to hospice hell just die, she said  as if there were another alternative. She knew better than anyone that our bag of chemotherapy tricks was empty, but facing that reality proved too hard.

Had the palliative care team been consulted earlier, it could have worked with the primary care doctor, the nurses on the floor and the oncologist to understand and communicate the patients wishes over a period of time, perhaps even when the patient could still speak for himself. Instead, the patient got lost in the back and forth, as did his family, caught between the rock of his imminent death and the hard place of arranging for rehabilitation that was presented as his salvation, but offered no real help or comfort.

Doctors face a difficult paradox: Their job is to keep patients alive, but part of that means keeping at bay the dark awareness that everyone dies. Because doctors are supposed to cure, efforts directed elsewhere, even palliative care, can feel like a surrender. But their job might actually be easier if they found a way to better use what palliative care can achieve for patients, and not only at the end of life.

Physicians also need to recognize that there are occasions when the patients fate is not, in the end, the doctors work. Every patient deserves care on his own terms, for each patients life, and death, is his own.

When Is a Critic a Scold?","['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Last week, The Times prominently displayed an analysis piece which explored the matter of sexist language and speech in the presidential campaign. Through interviews and other research, it showed how negative words such as shrill or shouting have been applied to Hillary Clinton, but not to her male rivals.

The piece was well reported and an interesting read. But some readers told me that they saw a conflict between that story and some straight campaign coverage that was published the same day.

An article on the fifth Democratic debate depicted Mrs. Clinton lobbing her harshest assault yet in the campaign. She appeared tense and even angry. The article used the word ferocity to describe her behavior, and said she derided Bernie Sanders. By contrast, Mr. Sanders kept his cool. His remarks were well-honed.

Teresa Kopec, a reader, wrote to me, objecting to the choice of words in the debate news coverage. She saw the debate as spirited but respectful on both sides, and found the language choice offensive.

Ms. Kopec wrote: Compare and contrast the words used to describe Mr. Sanders and Ms. Clinton. Sanders: cool, reiterated, well honed. Clinton: harshest, cutting, vitriol, deriding and tense. This is ridiculous. The NYT ought to be ashamed.

The journalist and author Rebecca Traister, who perceptively took up some of the gender issues in the presidential campaign in a recent New York magazine column, told me that she was struck by this, too.

There is no imaginative room for another read like she finally took the gloves off, or was forceful, or impassioned or drove home her point. Theres simply no room for this to have been anything other than a screwup that people will hate her for because she was unhinged. Meanwhile, our babysitter came in this morning and said, THAT was a relief! She finally told him off! I have been waiting for that! but the idea that anyone could have a positive reaction to a loud woman is beyond the scope of imagination.

And, Ms. Traister said, this depiction was especially irritating given Mr. Sanderss characteristic impassioned demeanor: He is always loud and combative.

A few days later, another gender-related issue brought reader mail. A headline on an article about two longtime feminists urging young women to support Mrs. Clinton read as follows: Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright Scold Young Women Backing Bernie Sanders. (The online headline has been changed and now reads, Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright Rebuke Young Women Backing Bernie Sanders.)

A reader, Dora OShaughnessy of Charlotte, N.C., wrote:

Scold? Nothing like treating these two amazing trailblazers like nagging old harpies. It feels like the person who wrote the headline is framing this like a catfight. The word criticize would not have been so offensive.

Another reader, Nadine Berrini, agreed: If the former secretary of state was a man, would your headline writer have chosen the word scold? I doubt it. Given the earlier article on gender and language, she observed: Right hand not talking to the left, it seems.

I took up the criticism with Philip B. Corbett, the standards editor, who writes the After Deadline blog on style and usage in The Times, and is the resident expert on language.

We have to be very aware of the perception of sexism and the impression that women are described differently, he said.

At times, Mr. Corbett said, it is more perception than reality. With a word like scold, we have many, many examples, he said, of the word being applied to men, including male candidates. However, he said, in describing women, it may carry a different tone and we really need to be sensitive to that. And, he said, perception matters; one cant simply blame readers for somehow reading it wrong.

Similarly, readers sometimes complain about descriptions of womens appearance in articles. In fact, Mr. Corbett noted, mens appearance is often noted, too, but the long history of defining and judging women by their appearance may mean that these descriptions are read differently.

As for the language in the debate story  derided for Mrs. Clinton, and reiterated for Mr. Sanders  he sees such reportorial interpretation as legitimate. But he had a caveat. Its largely what readers are paying us for, the ability of our reporters to be able to characterize what they are observing, he said. But, he said, We have to be aware that we gravitate to writing about conflict. That, he emphasized, can sometimes go too far.

Heres my take: The Times is obviously aware of the gender pitfalls, especially in a presidential campaign with a prominent female candidate, and generally avoids overtly sexist language or framing. (And yes, Bernie Sanders supporters, I know! I am well aware that Mrs. Clinton has nothing to complain about in terms of the relative amount of attention she has received in The Times; I happen to agree with you on that, and have pointed it out several times.)

But in articles where gender plays a role  just as in those involving race  unconscious framing needs attention, too. Cultural biases can creep in unannounced and should firmly be shown the door. Greater awareness (you could even call it consciousness-raising) would help.

Forceful, after all, doesnt have to equal ferocious. And a scold may just be someone whose passion is showing.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-02-10 00:00:00,Times Reporter: 'I Would Never Cut a Deal Like That',"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Heres an ugly term: Transactional journalism  also known as a quid pro quo.

Hardly an unfamiliar idea, it came up this week with the disclosure that a writer for The Atlantic made a deal to use a particular word  muscular  in describing a 2009 speech by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in order to get an advance copy of the speech. Her aide also required the writer, Marc Ambinder, to favorably mention a State Department delegation attending the speech.

In emails that were made public by Gawker, Mr. Ambinder agreed (got it, he wrote of the instructions from Philippe Reines of Mrs. Clintons staff) and received his advance copy. The practice rightly was termed corrupt by Erik Wemple of The Washington Post, though he gave Mr. Ambinder credit for appropriate contrition. (The Atlantic has appended an editors note to the article.)

A New York Times reporter, Mark Landler, whose article on the speech also used the word muscular and also mentioned the delegation, told me in the strongest terms on Wednesday that he had not made any sort of similar arrangement and would not do so. That would be a very serious breach of journalistic ethics, Mr. Landler told me by phone.

Earlier, in an email, he wrote: No, I would NEVER cut a deal like that. My use of the word muscular may have reflected a lack of originality, but it did not reflect collusion.

I asked Mr. Landler about it because I had heard from a reader, Ian Frazer, who saw an article in Breitbart, the conservative news and opinion website, that pointed out the use of the word and the description in Mr. Landlers article. Mr. Frazer wrote that the suggestion that any Times reporting was guided by its subject in order to gain access is very troubling and should be disclosed if true.

I agree that it would be very troubling  and possibly grounds for dismissal. Mr. Landler told me that he did not recall receiving an advance text of the speech (a common enough practice) but that he certainly had not cut such a deal, and would not ever do so.

Its worth noting that the word muscular came up often in a search of Mr. Landlers articles of that period. He told me that more recently, he has made an effort to use the word muscular far less often because it tends to equate a hawkish foreign policy with a good foreign policy. Its been reasonably criticized as a value-laden term and its a good idea to stay away from it, he said.

Mr. Landler also noted that the State Department wasnt happy with his article, which put the speech in the context of her trying to regain her relevancy in the administration, after a period in which she seemed to have been sidelined. He said he has seen an email from Anne-Marie Slaughter to that effect. And he said that Mrs. Clinton had mentioned the delegation during her speech, which is what drew his attention to it.

I have been critical of Washington reporting that functions as a government mouthpiece, especially through the use of unnamed government sources. And while the practice described in the emails is shocking in how blatant it is  at one point, Mr. Reines instructs Mr. Ambinder to write something, but in your own clever way  lets not be naive: this kind of deal cutting is not entirely surprising.

Having said that, I find Mr. Landler thoroughly credible about all of this. And I was glad to hear his condemnation of this practice.

Speaking of journalistic ethics and practices, it would have been decent of Breitbarts reporter to reach Mr. Landler for comment before going the route of innuendo.

An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that Mr. Landler was the recipient of an email from Anne-Marie Slaughter that referred to his article. In fact, that email was sent to Mrs. Clinton.",[]

THE Timess culture editor, Jonathan Landman, calls them exuberant pans  reviews so energetically negative that they seem to achieve liftoff. They blast into the media world with cosmic force. Everyone wants to talk about them in a did you see that? way. Sometimes, they become instant classics. And, it goes almost without saying, the critics fun is inversely proportional to how it feels on the receiving end.









The most recent example at The Times is the now-famous skewering of the Times Square restaurant recently opened by Guy Fieri, a Food Network star. The review, by Pete Wells, took an all-question approach, beginning: Guy Fieri, have you eaten in your new restaurant in Times Square?

He also asked: Were you struck by how very far from awesome the Awesome Pretzel Chicken Tenders are? and When we hear the words Donkey Sauce, which part of the donkey are we supposed to think about? and Why did the toasted marshmallow taste like fish?

As the review was going viral, I spoke with Mr. Wells, who told me that he had set out hoping to enjoy Guys American Kitchen & Bar. Although he knew it was not a sophisticated destination, I would have liked to write the man-bites-dog review  he wanted to be pleasantly surprised. Despite four visits, that was not to be. Of course, its not just restaurants that can end up as the unlucky targets of a critics ire. So can plays, albums, actors, art exhibits and movies.

And sometimes a critics dismissal becomes immortal. Who can forget Dorothy Parkers judgment that Katharine Hepburn could run the gamut of emotions from A to B, or Pauline Kaels vaporization of the director Paul Schraders Hardcore: For Schrader to call himself a whore would be vanity; he doesnt know how to turn a trick.

From Mr. Landmans point of view, the all-guns-blazing takedown shouldnt happen often. There are a thousand ticks between the greatest and the worst, he said, and a great critic is unerringly accurate in picking the right place on that scale.

Still, there are times when it is only right to wield a sharp knife. And those with the greatest verbal gifts do it memorably. Consider, for example, a 2006 review by Garrison Keillor of American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville, by Bernard-Henri Levy, a book meant to update another Frenchmans view of the New World. Mr. Keillor took aim at the pomposity: Monsieur Levy is a French writer with a spatter-paint prose style and the grandiosity of a college sophomore; he rambled around this country at the behest of The Atlantic Monthly and now has worked up his notes into a sort of book.

When he was done, you could practically see him blowing the smoke from the mouth of his six-shooter before nonchalantly replacing it in its holster. Or think of Jon Pareless demolition of the band Coldplay as it released its long-awaited X&Y album. I mentioned this review a few days ago to a 24-year-old journalist friend, and he surprised me by immediately reciting its key phrase verbatim. He was in high school when it was published in The Times in 2005.

Pareles began: Theres nothing wrong with self-pity. As a spur to songwriting, its right up there with lust, anger and greed, and probably better than the remaining deadly sins. Theres nothing wrong, either, with striving for musical grandeur, using every bit of skill and studio illusion to create a sound large enough to get lost in. Male sensitivity, a quality thats under siege in a pop culture full of unrepentant bullying and machismo, shouldnt be dismissed out of hand, no matter how risible it can be in practice. And building a sound on the lessons of past bands is virtually unavoidable.

And only then does he deliver the solar-plexus punch: But put them all together and they add up to Coldplay, the most insufferable band of the decade.

Or recall two theater reviews last year, both by Ben Brantley, of Spiderman: Turn Off the Dark  one while the troubled show was in its endless previews, the second after it was supposedly fixed. In the second review, he wrote: This singing comic book is no longer the ungodly, indecipherable mess it was in February. Its just a bore.

The Times film critic Manohla Dargis told me that, for critics, this is not the norm. (Mr. Landman, though, recalls her wickedly funny pan of The Cat in the Hat for The Los Angeles Times in 2003  written in Seussian rhyme.) Most movies are middling, she said. Theyre fine, but theyre not transporting you.

Ms. Dargis is acutely aware of how a bad review can hurt  not only feelings, but also commercial success. This is especially true for critics at The Times; a great deal rides on the judgment of the paper of record. Some blockbuster movies, though, are practically critic-proof, she said. When the subject is vulnerable, one solution may be to not review at all. But sometimes thats not practical. The Times can pass on reviewing, for example, an independent filmmakers fledgling effort or an art exhibit in a small gallery, but it is committed to reviewing major concerts, films and theater productions, whatever their quality.

Is it ever really acceptable for criticism to be so over the top, considering that there are human beings behind every venture? I think it is. That kind of brutal honesty is sometimes necessary. If it is entertaining, all the better. The exuberant pan should be an arrow in the critics quiver, but reached for only rarely.

As for Mr. Fieri, he responded as do many who have been similarly stung. He blamed the messenger. On NBCs Today, he accused Mr. Wells of an agenda: Its a great way to make a name for yourself  go after a celebrity chef who is not a New Yorker. My sense is that Mr. Wellss heart was pure, but that the material was irresistible  even if the cuisine, awash in Donkey Sauce, was not.",[]

When youre Donald Trump, bashing The New York Times must always seem like a good idea.









So it was no surprise to hear one particular sound bite during this months Republican presidential candidates debate. Asked about his proposal, made during a recent meeting with the Times editorial board, for a 45 percent tax on Chinese goods brought into the United States, he said: Thats wrong. They were wrong. Its The New York Times. They are always wrong. Apparently not; in this case, a recording of the meeting posted by the paper supports its account of what the candidate said.

As the most bizarre presidential campaign in memory gets real  with next months Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary  its more important than ever for The Times not only to keep checking the accuracy of the candidates but also to be painstakingly accurate and fair itself.

So, lets take a look. Hows it going so far, and what are readers saying about campaign coverage?

1. Checking facts. Examining the truth  or lack thereof  of political statements, is the greatest reader service that we do, Carolyn Ryan, senior editor for politics, told me recently when I wrote about The Timess new effort to embed fact check features within political coverage. So we are trying to be relentless and aggressive about it. The new presentation and emphasis make a strong addition to The Timess political coverage, and its going well, particularly during and after each of the debates.

The Times also needs to correct its own errors quickly, which it usually does. However, in one recent situation, it took too long to do so, waiting a month to set straight an error in a front-page story that gave Marco Rubio credit for undermining Obamacare by slipping in a provision to an omnibus spending bill. By the time it was corrected, a version of it had become part of Mr. Rubios narrative  and advertising.

2. Polling. The Times has long written stories based on public opinion polling during campaigns; for decades it has done so in conjunction with CBS News and it continues to do so. The plan is to conduct about one poll a month until November; the first came earlier this month.

John Broder, who heads the news surveys department, says the polls will focus on issues and trends, not on which candidates appear to be ahead. Partly for that reason, they are national polls, not state ones, he said. The January poll, for example, provided the underlying numbers for a front-page article last week on Mr. Trumps popularity with evangelical voters. That article augmented those numbers with interviews.

The Times has also increased its sample size to include more Latino voters, an ever-more-important part of the electorate. And it has begun experimenting with using online polling. That is less dependable, in some ways, than the gold standard of telephone polling, but it may eventually be inevitable, now that fewer people use landlines or answer their cellphones when they do not recognize the caller.

With so many other polls focusing on predictions, The Timess concentration on the bigger-picture issues is the right approach. We want to stay focused on the electorate, and not the horse race, Mr. Broder told me.

3. News judgment. Something Ive heard about relentlessly from readers is what they consider The Timess inadequate coverage of the Bernie Sanders campaign. Anne Bryan of Denver wrote to me last week: We get endless coverage of Trumps misbehavior, some coverage of Clinton but very little on Sanders and his plans, proposals and continuing support by thousands of citizens. By ignoring the only other viable Democratic candidate, The Times gives the impression that its all a done deal and the opinions of many people arent relevant.

A few months ago, I took a hard look at the amount of Sanders coverage in The Times and its tone. My conclusion was that while his candidacy had not been ignored, it had been played down. And the coverage sometimes seemed dismissive, even mocking. At the time, Ms. Ryan drew readers attention to a significant number of substantive Sanders articles, and strongly disagreed with the complaints about tone. Ive seen improvement in recent weeks, including the assignment of a reporter full time to the Sanders campaign. (By contrast, The Times assigned a Clinton reporter back in 2013.) One recent article detailed the enthusiasm gap that may favor Mr. Sanders. But, as readers point out, his campaign still is often viewed through the lens of how it affects Hillary Clinton, rather than on its own merits.

4. Tone and story choice. Political coverage certainly doesnt need to be deadly serious at all times, and in fact, it sometimes should reflect the surreal atmosphere of presidential campaigns. Conversational  even fun  writing is a welcome change of pace. But some readers think The Times goes too far at times, moving from conversational to frivolous  or even gossipy.

Joseph OKelly of Houston described an article on Marco Rubios much-discussed shiny boots as tabloid reporting. He wrote: I look to NYT to provide in-depth quality news reporting. I am appalled that this article now apparently passes for front-page news. (In fairness, the story did not run on Page 1. But it did appear on the Times home page. And it was not produced by the politics team; it was a fashion story. Still, it was a Times political reporter who got it all rolling with a tweet on the senators footwear, and the reporter did later write about the reaction for Times Insider.)

Many readers wrote to me objecting to the anonymously sourced lead-in to an article last week about Clintons support among women, and calling the story unfair to the candidate. And Richard Longworth of Chicago  describing himself as a yellow-dog Democrat who wouldnt mind if Ted Cruz fell under a bus, nonetheless objected to an article on Heidi Cruz, the candidates wife, calling its prominent mention of her 10-year-old near mental breakdown a cheap shot.

Ms. Ryan said that the Cruz story had been sensitively handled and that it offered a well-rounded portrait of her personality, her intellect and her life experiences, including moments when she has struggled. She noted that the Cruz campaign had expressed no complaints about the articles fairness and that Heidi Cruz has spoken about her crisis publicly in the past.

Ms. Ryan emphasizes that lighter or more personal pieces are supplemental to the news and issues coverage; they dont take their place. And, she said, they are a part of The Timess mission: to present all aspects of the candidates so that voters can be informed about the most personal decision they make in politics.

Personal stories like the one about Mrs. Cruz, and perhaps even light ones like those on Mr. Rubios boots, certainly have their place in the coverage. The story about Mrs. Clinton and women, too, was a legitimate subject  but its credibility took a self-inflicted blow with the sourcing.

As the campaign continues, Times readers tell me, they would like to see less obsession with Mrs. Clinton, less personality-driven coverage, fewer horse-race stories and more in-depth reporting on the critical issues facing the nation.

With Mr. Trumps dominance on the Republican side, and Mr. Sanders strength on the Democratic side, this campaign has flummoxed the conventional wisdom. More surprises lie ahead, no doubt. As The Times continues to confront them, it will serve readers best by focusing on the issues, with accuracy and fairness foremost.",[]
nytimes.com,2014-01-31 00:00:00,The Sound of a Tree Falling Is Not Ka-ching,"['Terre Roche', 'All Contributors', 'The Great Divide', 'The Conversation', 'Errol Morris', 'The End']","Measure for Measure: How to write a song and other mysteries.

For each member of a band the question may arise whether to do a solo project. Some bands consist of musicians whove already done projects on their own. But some people have known life only in the band, and the prospect of a solo venture can be both exhilarating and scary to ponder. I was of the latter variety.

In 1998, I put out my solo CD, The Sound of a Tree Falling. I was the tree in question, in a free-fall after having decided to stop working as one-third of The Roches. Ive always thought of myself as a tree, in part because of Catholic grammar school where kids pronounced my name Treesa.

The Sound of a Tree Falling has some of my best songs on it. The jacket defiantly proclaims the CD is Produced by Nobody, thus pointing another moniker at myself, who sat in the wee hours in my apartment recording the whole thing into an ADAT machine, the now-defunct self-recording innovation of the 1990s. This was remarkable because up to that point Id shown little to no interest in home recording. My first takes sounded cloudy and obscure so I called up the friend whod suggested what microphone I should buy. He asked me to describe my recording setup. It turned out I had sung into the back of the mike. Thats how tech savvy I was, to give you an idea.



The songs came fast and furious over the course of three weeks. They had a lot to offer, especially to me. They described my feelings about love, work, wanting to be a good person, life in my apartment, a ride in the cab of a Pakistani driver, the painful watching of an up-and-coming future rock star being disrespected in a dive bar, Francis my favorite saint, intense sexual craving, drinking too much, hearing devastating, life-changing news and feeling trapped. Rounding out the collection came a song called Blabbermouth, about the strain of being unable to hide a big secret.

I emerged from this tunnel of songwriting and realized Id made an entire CD. For a few days I entertained the idea of inviting friends and family members to help me arrange the music and give the songs a proper production job. My recordings were peppered with outside street noises, softly squeaking chairs and in two places, my cat Maxwell who for some reason got excited when I pressed the record button and couldnt hold back from joining in. All these performances, of course, would have to be redone.

Or would they? Listening to this nocturnal outpouring I began to fall in love with it. This is a real pitfall in the recording process. When in the studio listening back to a take, someone once cautioned me to trust my first response. The more you listen to it, the more you talk yourself into liking it. Even taking that into consideration, I felt differently about these songs. The whole thing had a magical combination of integrity and fragility. I heard my own voice, which was not a big, powerful one. I was the house cat who thinks hes roaring, but out comes meow. These were not big themes unless you were inside my head. And if they were genuine, there would perhaps be a small but present audience for this stuff.

I went the route of putting my own package together. I had the help of several friends, who mixed and mastered the tracks with me and designed the CD cover. That week, in a freak of nature, a tornado pitched a whole tree through the roof of my boyfriend Garrys house in New Jersey. He called me to say, I have your CD cover for you. I went out to the house, crawled up on the tree trunk with my guitar and Garry took a picture of me singing The Sound of a Tree Falling. The photo shoot was cut short when the people renting the house pulled into the driveway scowling at us. But wed gotten the picture of me with my guitar and a shot of the gaping hole in the earth made by the plummeting tree, which we used for the back cover, positioning the famous quote Know Thyself over the darkest depth of the earth. I went down to City Hall and registered myself as Earth Rock (my name in French) Wreckerds. For a publishing company I used the name Blabbermusic.

When I had my thousand copies of the CD, I went about the business of sending them out to everyone I could think of that Id ever met in the music business. Very few people responded, although The Sound of a Tree Falling garnered one wonderful review in Sing Out Magazine. The writer went into such detail about what he heard in the songs that his review stood between me and the feeling that indeed a tree falling in the woods makes no sound whatever.

Ive never had the urge to do another solo CD project. I suspect a solo career might be too lonely a life for someone like me. What I learned about myself is that Im not the wandering minstrel type. I thrive on interaction with other people and dont necessarily want to be the focal point. Getting older, Im more and more interested in the tribal aspect of music. In community. My songs seem to operate as a form of therapy for myself and anyone else whom they might benefit. But really, its no longer important to me that the songs I sing are my own. Once that happened I began to be more aware of my immediate surroundings and what they had to show me.

For 40 years, my friend Barbara Morillo and I have gone to Washington Square Park at Christmastime to sing traditional carols. Were the remaining two of a group that has at times swelled to 25 voices. People find out when well be there by word of mouth. This past December a crowd of revelers, many of whom had never met before, showed up. I was amazed when we ended with a rousing version of The Hallelujah Chorus that held together as if wed rehearsed for months!

A few blocks from my apartment, Metro Baptist church sponsors a wonderful array of arts events among their community outreach programs, which include after-school dance programs and a rooftop farm. In the past several years, Ive participated as the musical act, an improvisational dancer, a piano player, a storyteller and the bartender.

Photo

Finally, one of the most fulfilling musical experiences Ive ever been blessed to encounter grew from unlikely roots. The spring after 9/11, with the community of Battery Park City still traumatized, the Parks Conservancy decided to sponsor a group singing event. They called and asked me to lead it. This coming summer will mark its 12th year as the Sunset Singing Circle, which has grown into a popular Friday evening event in May and June. Folks bring their kids, guitars, banjos, drums, Frisbees and workweek stress. Sitting on the grass in the center of this eclectic circus of harmonies, I feel my true nature rooted deep down in the earth with any doubt of my place among popular songwriters muted by the joy of singing their songs.

First of two articles

Recently, I learned about an organization that stopped me in my tracks and has forced me to re-evaluate my assumptions about whats possible. Its called Thread. It rallies volunteer community support around underperforming students in Baltimore public high schools and gets results that defy all expectations.

Thread identifies students in ninth grade who are facing major life challenges: poverty, homelessness, family breakdown or single parents who are overwhelmed by work, illness or other problems. The students are in the bottom 25 percent of their classes academically and are often chronically absent. Thread connects them with a team of up to five volunteers who commit to support them in any way necessary, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, for 10 years.

The assistance may include wake-up calls or rides to school, food and clothing, child care or legal help, connection to community service opportunities, help finding jobs, tutoring, SAT preparation or college admission guidance. The philosophy is to do whatever it takes to help the teenager develop into an adult who can pursue a fulfilling life. A volunteer may literally go at 7 a.m. and try to pick the kid up for school, a second person may go at 10 a.m., another person at noon, explains Sarah Hemminger, a Thread co-founder and the chief executive. Volunteers take students to restaurants and movies; they hang out and talk about life; they go camping; they sometimes provide homes to students.

The offer is unconditional support. A student will not get kicked out, no matter how hard he or she tests volunteers. They have to agree to join and their guardian has to agree and sign a lot of paperwork, adds Hemminger. We tell students: Once you are in you cannot get out. This is serious. Its not something you can undo. Youre going to want to undo this, but once its happened, its happened.

Eddie Blackstone, 23, a graduate of Paul Laurence Dunbar High School who is now a junior at Towson University, planning to major in psychology, enrolled in Thread in 2007. In my ninth-grade year, my mom walked out of my life, my dad had just gotten out of jail, I was in the bottom 10 percent of my class, he recalled. One day, a teacher told Eddie that a woman would like to speak with him. It was Hemminger. She gave us a rundown of the program, he said. What initially caught his interest was her offer of free pizza.

One of the volunteers he made a strong connection with was Tong Zhang, who was pursuing a Ph.D. in immunology at Johns Hopkins University. She wasnt overbearing, Eddie recalled. She was like, I dont want to be all up in your business, but I would like to invite you to my house to play video games. Later, he grew close with another Thread volunteer, Rose Parkinson, Tongs friend who was also pursuing a Ph.D. in immunology.

They are two opposite sides of the same awesome coin, Eddie recalled: Tong was soft and loving; Rose damned if Im going to let you fail.

Over the past nine years, Eddie recalled, his life has become interwoven with theirs. People outside my race, age range, and blood family have become the people who are closest to me, he said.

During high school, Eddie and his father were homeless on several occasions for extended periods. Over the years, he has lived with Tong and her husband, and with Rose and her husband. During his senior year, when he was applying for college, he lived in an abandoned house without running water and heat. Rose bought him space heaters and made sure he had a place to do laundry and get showered. When it came to doing homework, applying for college, getting up on Saturday morning to attend SAT practice, staying on track in college, Tong and Rose, and other Thread volunteers, have consistently shown up, encouraged or cajoled or dragged Eddie out of bed, reminding him of his goals and dreams.

He has helped them, too. Tong had immigrated from China, and Eddies companionship helped ease her loneliness. When Roses mother died in 2011, Eddie attended her funeral in Pennsylvania. He was really there for me, Rose said. Now, when they get together, they talk about college and the future. Hes going to be uncle Eddie and teach my son all the things he knows, said Rose.

There were hard moments, too. One day I got into an argument and said something real hurtful to Tong, and she started to cry, recalled Eddie. I saw she was crying because she loves me. I had never had that. My mother wasnt even willing to cry when she was leaving me for a cocaine dealer. I was like, This relationships real.

Another time Rose grew angry with Eddie for saying that he didnt think he was good enough for college. She threw her keys in frustration. Eddie recalled: She was like: Eddie, we know youre better than everything youve been through in your life! We see it in you. Why cant you see it?

Youre not going to throw your keys at someone you dont care about, he added. It gave me a family feeling  like a feeling of being wanted.

Rose commented: Its definitely been challenging. Sometimes its uncomfortable confronting someone about their work ethic or their behavior. But I think the challenge is one of the benefits. Its really rewarding when you start to see changes, when someone starts to become more self-aware and they see they have control over something they didnt realize they had control over before.

For Eddie, the value is clear: If I wasnt in Thread, I would most likely be dead or in jail.

Eddie is an impressive person, but his story is not an outlier. He is one of 255 students who are enrolled in, or who are alumni of, Thread, a nonprofit organization with over 800 volunteers, most of them students from Johns Hopkins University. What they and the Thread students are achieving together deserves national attention.

Of the 176 students who have been in Thread for less than five years, 97 percent are still attending high school or have graduated. Of the 79 who have been in the program for over five years, 92 percent have graduated high school and 80 percent have enrolled in a two or four year college or certification program. (In Baltimores public schools, only 72 percent of students graduate high school within five years.)

Ive been here for almost 30 years and before that I was in various public jobs and I cant think of another program that is as effective as Thread is, and that is as shattering of preconceptions, said Robert C. Embry Jr., the president of the Abell Foundation, who has provided support and guidance to Thread.

Referring to disadvantaged youths, he added: A lot of people assert that if you dont get a child at 3 or 4 years old, or even at 1 or 2 years old, youve lost them. Here is a program that takes a ninth-grade child, not only low income but the poorest performers in their class, and gets them out of high school, which in itself is amazing. The fact that most go on to college, he added, is a sign that we dramatically underestimate their potential.

One of the ideas underpinning Thread is that poverty should be defined as a condition of isolation, not just a lack of money. Relationships are the key things that bring about real changes, said Sarah Hemminger, who co-founded Thread with her husband Ryan. For the two of them, this insight has personal resonance.

As an adolescent growing up in Indianapolis, Ryans home life began falling apart after his mother was badly injured in a car accident. She was unable to work, the family lost its home, and Ryans parents later became addicted to his mothers pain medication. Ryan would come home from school not knowing if there would be anything to eat, or if the house would be cold and dark because the heat and electricity had been cut off. School wasnt helping me meet my critical needs at the time, which was food, clothing and shelter, he recalled. In ninth grade he began skipping school and went from being an A student to failing most of his classes.

But he was fortunate. A group of teachers, led by Sargent Robert Lanam, the schools junior R.O.T.C. instructor, came together to help him. I was the first Thread kid, Ryan recalled. These teachers did everything they could: bought me clothes, paid utility bills, brought food to the house, and made sure I went to school. He started doing better, graduated, and later enrolled in the Naval Academy. Among other things, he has served as an officer on a submarine, worked as a financial adviser for Morgan Stanley, and now serves as the chief financial officer for the Baltimore City Health Department.

One day in 2004, during her first year of a Ph.D. program in biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Sarah found herself at a stop light in front of Dunbar High School. At school, shed been feeling disconnected, not feeling she belonged. She imagined that some of the students in Dunbar High were like Ryan  and she thought she might be able to relate well with them.

She met with the principal and persuaded him to give her a list of ninth-grade students who were academically struggling and facing challenges outside of school. She recruited seven volunteers from school to help with tutoring. Today, 80 percent of that initial group  12 of 15 students  have completed a four-year degree or professional certification program.

Today, the process has been systematized. Each student is connected to up to five volunteer family members who are led by a more experienced volunteer called the head of family. Up to eight heads of family, in turn, receive regular coaching from volunteer grandparents, who report to Thread staff members. Everyone receives backup from resource teams specializing in academics, college preparation and various health, social and legal problems. This model allows Thread, which had operating expenses of $1.1 million in 2015, to grow cost-effectively, while maintaining the long term focus and high volunteer to student ratio, both of which are crucial to its success.

Kids in extreme forms of poverty, often intergenerational, need multiple supports over multiple years, to make it, explains Robert Balfanz, a leading researcher who directs the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University School of Education. Things can be going fine and then something happens. They get evicted, lose a job, a parent gets incarcerated. Those things are continually happening. So you can have a great year, then you have a bad year. Even after you graduate, theres a million ways to fall off track.

The powerful things about Thread, he added, are that they stay with kids over time and get them to adulthood, and the insight to have a group of people do this, so it doesnt become an overwhelming commitment for one person. Those are two powerful innovations.

Thread has become a silent partner for our kids, explained Gregory E. Thornton, the chief executive of Baltimore City Public Schools. Its community is able to meet the needs of students in a way that high school teachers  who may teach 150 students  cannot, he said. The only problem with Thread is it needs to be bigger.

Theres another aspect to the work: What happens when so many diverse individuals and institutions in a city like Baltimore come together around a common mission?

Thread has 1,000 to 1,200 people connected to it, observed Rodney Foxworth, the founder of Invested Impact, a nonprofit mission investment organization in Baltimore, who serves as a board co-chair for Thread. That to me is where the real power is. As wonderful as the outcomes are, what brought me into Thread was the grander vision of a more equitable and inclusive city. We need great organizations to make change, but more than that we need movement making; we need a shift in perspective. Thread is going beyond the organization and building intersections between different communities.

Next week: A fuller examination of how Threads approach works.

BANGKOK  Hundreds of Indonesians have traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State over the past two years, and more than 50 have been killed there, according to the Indonesian government.









But in recent months, Indonesian jihadists appear to have increasingly sought targets at home. Now, security analysts say that the violence in the capital, Jakarta, on Thursday may portend a revival of an intermittent but bloody campaign, often against symbols of the West, that has plagued Indonesia for the past decade and a half.

In the last six months, weve seen a spike of planning for violence in Indonesia, said Sidney Jones, an expert on terrorism in the country and the director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in Jakarta.

None of it is a reaction to domestic politics, Ms. Jones said.

Its a desire to prove that jihadi groups are still alive and well in Indonesia and are committed to carrying out the ISIS agenda, she said, referring to the Islamic State.

Over the past two months, the Indonesian police have arrested more than a dozen people suspected of being militants, three of whom were accused of involvement in a small explosion on New Years Eve in Bandung, a city on the island of Java.

With more than 250 million people, Indonesia is the worlds most populous Muslim-majority country, but it also has a tradition of tolerance toward other religions. Only a tiny fraction of the population is radicalized, analysts say, but in recent years, the country has grappled with rising tensions between moderates and hard-line groups, some of them peaceful and others militant, promoting a purer interpretation of Islam.

Indonesias violent Islamists are made up of at least three overlapping pro-Islamic State groups, including Ansharut Daulah Islamiyah, a sort of umbrella group that claims to be the main Islamic State structure in Indonesia; Mujahidin of Eastern Indonesia, based in Poso, on the island of Sulawesi, whose commander, Santoso, leads a band of about 30 armed men including several ethnic Uighurs; and a group based in central Java that is believed to take instructions directly from an Indonesian fighter for the Islamic State in Syria.

The country is also home to the newly rebuilt Jemaah Islamiyah, a group that has been blamed for a number of deadly attacks in Indonesia but that is against the Islamic State and supports the Qaeda affiliate in Syria, the Nusra Front. It does not appear for the moment to be interested in violence in Indonesia.

Assaults against Western targets, churches and nonmainstream Islamic groups have preoccupied Indonesian security agencies for the past 15 years.

The most severe were bombings in 2002 on the resort island of Bali that killed more than 200 people, a majority of them foreigners. Tourist areas in Bali were targeted again in 2005, and 25 people were killed.

In 2003, an attack on the JW Marriott hotel in Jakarta left 12 people dead.

The JW Marriott was struck again in 2009, nearly simultaneously with the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Jakarta, and eight people were killed.

Navhat Nuraniyah, another analyst at the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, has estimated that about 2,000 people have joined rallies in Indonesia in support of the Islamic State or have pledged allegiance to the group.

Some were keyboard warriors rather than experienced combatants, she wrote in an article published in the fall in Inside Indonesia, an online magazine.

The target of the assault on Thursday in one of the busiest parts of Jakarta, which includes the regional offices of the United Nations, shopping malls and five-star hotels, remained unclear. One of the sites attacked was a Starbucks.

If it turns out Starbucks was deliberately targeted, rather than just the nearby police post, that would be the first attack on a Western icon since the hotel bombings in 2009, Ms. Jones said.",[]

Weve all heard the argument that philosophy is isolated, an ivory tower discipline cut off from virtually every other progress-making pursuit of knowledge, including math and the sciences, as well as from the actual concerns of daily life. The reasons given for this are many. In a widely read essay in this series, When Philosophy Lost Its Way, Robert Frodeman and Adam Briggle claim that it was philosophys institutionalization in the university in the late 19th century that separated it from the study of humanity and nature, now the province of social and natural sciences.

This institutionalization, the authors claim, led it to betray its central aim of articulating the knowledge needed to live virtuous and rewarding lives. I have a different view: Philosophy isnt separated from the social, natural or mathematical sciences, nor is it neglecting the study of goodness, justice and virtue, which was never its central aim.

The idea that philosophy was and still is isolated from other disciplines ignores much of its history.

The authors claim that philosophy abandoned its relationship to other disciplines by creating its own purified domain, accessible only to credentialed professionals. It is true that from roughly 1930 to 1950, some philosophers  logical empiricists, in particular  did speak of philosophy having its own exclusive subject matter. But since that subject matter was logical analysis aimed at unifying all of science, interdisciplinarity was front and center.

This was followed (in Britain) by two decades in which leading philosophers identified philosophy with informal linguistic analysis. Fortunately, this narrow view didnt stop them from contributing to the science of language and the study of law. Now long gone, neither movement defined the philosophy of its day and neither arose from locating it in universities.

Now in print The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments An anthology of essays from The Timess philosophy series, published by Liveright.

The idea that philosophy was and still is isolated from other disciplines ignores much of its history. From 1879 to 1936 the philosopher-mathematicians Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, Kurt Godel, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing invented symbolic logic, helped establish the set-theoretic foundations of mathematics, and gave us the formal theory of computation that ushered in the digital age.

In the field of linguistics, from roughly 1945 to 1975, the philosophers Rudolf Carnap, Saul Kripke, Richard Montague and David Kaplan developed ideas relating logic to linguistic meaning that provided a framework for studying meaning in all human languages. Others, including Paul Grice and J.L. Austin, explained how linguistic meaning mixes with contextual information to enrich communicative contents and how certain linguistic performances change social facts. Today a new philosophical conception of the relationship between meaning and cognition adds a further dimension to linguistic science.

Decision theory  the science of rational norms governing action, belief and decision under uncertainty  was developed by the 20th-century philosophers Frank Ramsey, Rudolph Carnap, Richard Jeffrey and others. It plays a foundational role in political science and economics by telling us what rationality requires, given our evidence, priorities and the strength of our beliefs. Today, no area of philosophy is more successful in attracting top young minds.

Far from fostering isolation, specialization in philosophy makes communication and cooperation among disciplines possible. This has always been so.

Philosophy also assisted psychology in its long march away from narrow behaviorism and speculative Freudianism. The mid-20th-century functionalist perspective pioneered by Hilary Putnam was particularly important. According to it, pain, pleasure and belief are neither behavioral dispositions nor bare neurological states. They are interacting internal causes, capable of very different physical realizations, that serve the goals of individuals in specific ways. This view is now embedded in cognitive psychology and neuroscience.

Philosophy also played a role in 20th-century physics, influencing the great physicists Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. The philosophers Moritz Schlick and Hans Reichenbach reciprocated that interest by assimilating the new physics into their philosophies. Today, leading philosophers  including David Albert, Hans Halvorson, Laura Ruetsche, Hilary Greaves and David Wallace  explain quantum physics to outsiders, while conceptualizing issues in ways physicists find useful. Philosophy of biology is following a similar path. Todays philosophy of science is less accessible than Aristotles natural philosophy chiefly because it systematizes a larger, more technically sophisticated body of knowledge.

Philosophys interaction with mathematics, linguistics, economics, political science, psychology and physics requires specialization. Far from fostering isolation, this specialization makes communication and cooperation among disciplines possible. This has always been so. William of Ockham, Descartes, Leibniz and Kant were heavily informed by the science and mathematics of their day. Locke and Hume responded to Newton not with envy and a sense of inferiority (which Frodeman and Briggle wrongly attribute to philosophers responding to 20th-century science), but with a desire to apply Newtons lessons to their natural philosophies of mind, which were then psychology-in-the-making.

Nor did scientific progress rob philosophy of its former scientific subject matter, leaving it to concentrate on the broadly moral. In fact, philosophy thrives when enough is known to make progress conceivable, but it remains unachieved because of methodological confusion. Philosophy helps break the impasse by articulating new questions, posing possible solutions and forging new conceptual tools. Sometimes it does so when sciences are born, as with 17th-century physics and 19th-century biology. But it also does so as they mature. As science advances, there is more, not less, for it to do.

Our knowledge of the universe and ourselves expands like a ripple surrounding a pebble dropped in a pool. As we move away from the center of the spreading circle, its area, representing our secure knowledge, grows. But so does its circumference, representing the border where knowledge blurs into uncertainty and speculation, and methodological confusion returns. Philosophy patrols the border, trying to understand how we got there and to conceptualize our next move. Its job is unending.

Although progress in ethics, political philosophy and the illumination of lifes meaning has been less impressive than advances in some other areas, it is accelerating. After an erosion of faith in ethical theory in the first third of the 20th century, and calls for its abolition in the middle third, John Rawls and Robert Nozick revived theories of justice in the early 1970s. Comprehensive ethical theories, including Thomas Scanlons and Stephen Darwalls, have also reappeared. Even discussions of death and the meaning of life have returned, led by Thomas Nagel, Samuel Scheffler, Shelly Kagan, Susan Wolf and others. As my colleague Jake Ross observes, the advances in our understanding because of careful formulation and critical evaluation of theories of goodness, rightness, justice and human flourishing by philosophers since 1970 compare well to the advances made by philosophers from Aristotle to 1970.

The knowledge required to maintain philosophys continuing task, including its vital connection to other disciplines, is too vast to be held in one mind. Despite the often-repeated idea that philosophys true calling can only be fulfilled in the public square, philosophers actually function best in universities, where they acquire and share knowledge with their colleagues in other disciplines. It is also vital for philosophers to engage students  both those who major in the subject, and those who do not. Although philosophy has never had a mass audience, it remains remarkably accessible to the average student; unlike the natural sciences, its frontiers can be reached in a few undergraduate courses.

Far from being years of enduring failure, the last 150 years have been philosophys best.

First of two articles

Recently, I learned about an organization that stopped me in my tracks and has forced me to re-evaluate my assumptions about whats possible. Its called Thread. It rallies volunteer community support around underperforming students in Baltimore public high schools and gets results that defy all expectations.

Thread identifies students in ninth grade who are facing major life challenges: poverty, homelessness, family breakdown or single parents who are overwhelmed by work, illness or other problems. The students are in the bottom 25 percent of their classes academically and are often chronically absent. Thread connects them with a team of up to five volunteers who commit to support them in any way necessary, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, for 10 years.

The assistance may include wake-up calls or rides to school, food and clothing, child care or legal help, connection to community service opportunities, help finding jobs, tutoring, SAT preparation or college admission guidance. The philosophy is to do whatever it takes to help the teenager develop into an adult who can pursue a fulfilling life. A volunteer may literally go at 7 a.m. and try to pick the kid up for school, a second person may go at 10 a.m., another person at noon, explains Sarah Hemminger, a Thread co-founder and the chief executive. Volunteers take students to restaurants and movies; they hang out and talk about life; they go camping; they sometimes provide homes to students.

The offer is unconditional support. A student will not get kicked out, no matter how hard he or she tests volunteers. They have to agree to join and their guardian has to agree and sign a lot of paperwork, adds Hemminger. We tell students: Once you are in you cannot get out. This is serious. Its not something you can undo. Youre going to want to undo this, but once its happened, its happened.

Eddie Blackstone, 23, a graduate of Paul Laurence Dunbar High School who is now a junior at Towson University, planning to major in psychology, enrolled in Thread in 2007. In my ninth-grade year, my mom walked out of my life, my dad had just gotten out of jail, I was in the bottom 10 percent of my class, he recalled. One day, a teacher told Eddie that a woman would like to speak with him. It was Hemminger. She gave us a rundown of the program, he said. What initially caught his interest was her offer of free pizza.

One of the volunteers he made a strong connection with was Tong Zhang, who was pursuing a Ph.D. in immunology at Johns Hopkins University. She wasnt overbearing, Eddie recalled. She was like, I dont want to be all up in your business, but I would like to invite you to my house to play video games. Later, he grew close with another Thread volunteer, Rose Parkinson, Tongs friend who was also pursuing a Ph.D. in immunology.

They are two opposite sides of the same awesome coin, Eddie recalled: Tong was soft and loving; Rose damned if Im going to let you fail.

Over the past nine years, Eddie recalled, his life has become interwoven with theirs. People outside my race, age range, and blood family have become the people who are closest to me, he said.

During high school, Eddie and his father were homeless on several occasions for extended periods. Over the years, he has lived with Tong and her husband, and with Rose and her husband. During his senior year, when he was applying for college, he lived in an abandoned house without running water and heat. Rose bought him space heaters and made sure he had a place to do laundry and get showered. When it came to doing homework, applying for college, getting up on Saturday morning to attend SAT practice, staying on track in college, Tong and Rose, and other Thread volunteers, have consistently shown up, encouraged or cajoled or dragged Eddie out of bed, reminding him of his goals and dreams.

He has helped them, too. Tong had immigrated from China, and Eddies companionship helped ease her loneliness. When Roses mother died in 2011, Eddie attended her funeral in Pennsylvania. He was really there for me, Rose said. Now, when they get together, they talk about college and the future. Hes going to be uncle Eddie and teach my son all the things he knows, said Rose.

There were hard moments, too. One day I got into an argument and said something real hurtful to Tong, and she started to cry, recalled Eddie. I saw she was crying because she loves me. I had never had that. My mother wasnt even willing to cry when she was leaving me for a cocaine dealer. I was like, This relationships real.

Another time Rose grew angry with Eddie for saying that he didnt think he was good enough for college. She threw her keys in frustration. Eddie recalled: She was like: Eddie, we know youre better than everything youve been through in your life! We see it in you. Why cant you see it?

Youre not going to throw your keys at someone you dont care about, he added. It gave me a family feeling  like a feeling of being wanted.

Rose commented: Its definitely been challenging. Sometimes its uncomfortable confronting someone about their work ethic or their behavior. But I think the challenge is one of the benefits. Its really rewarding when you start to see changes, when someone starts to become more self-aware and they see they have control over something they didnt realize they had control over before.

For Eddie, the value is clear: If I wasnt in Thread, I would most likely be dead or in jail.

Eddie is an impressive person, but his story is not an outlier. He is one of 255 students who are enrolled in, or who are alumni of, Thread, a nonprofit organization with over 800 volunteers, most of them students from Johns Hopkins University. What they and the Thread students are achieving together deserves national attention.

Of the 176 students who have been in Thread for less than five years, 97 percent are still attending high school or have graduated. Of the 79 who have been in the program for over five years, 92 percent have graduated high school and 80 percent have enrolled in a two or four year college or certification program. (In Baltimores public schools, only 72 percent of students graduate high school within five years.)

Ive been here for almost 30 years and before that I was in various public jobs and I cant think of another program that is as effective as Thread is, and that is as shattering of preconceptions, said Robert C. Embry Jr., the president of the Abell Foundation, who has provided support and guidance to Thread.

Referring to disadvantaged youths, he added: A lot of people assert that if you dont get a child at 3 or 4 years old, or even at 1 or 2 years old, youve lost them. Here is a program that takes a ninth-grade child, not only low income but the poorest performers in their class, and gets them out of high school, which in itself is amazing. The fact that most go on to college, he added, is a sign that we dramatically underestimate their potential.

One of the ideas underpinning Thread is that poverty should be defined as a condition of isolation, not just a lack of money. Relationships are the key things that bring about real changes, said Sarah Hemminger, who co-founded Thread with her husband Ryan. For the two of them, this insight has personal resonance.

As an adolescent growing up in Indianapolis, Ryans home life began falling apart after his mother was badly injured in a car accident. She was unable to work, the family lost its home, and Ryans parents later became addicted to his mothers pain medication. Ryan would come home from school not knowing if there would be anything to eat, or if the house would be cold and dark because the heat and electricity had been cut off. School wasnt helping me meet my critical needs at the time, which was food, clothing and shelter, he recalled. In ninth grade he began skipping school and went from being an A student to failing most of his classes.

But he was fortunate. A group of teachers, led by Sargent Robert Lanam, the schools junior R.O.T.C. instructor, came together to help him. I was the first Thread kid, Ryan recalled. These teachers did everything they could: bought me clothes, paid utility bills, brought food to the house, and made sure I went to school. He started doing better, graduated, and later enrolled in the Naval Academy. Among other things, he has served as an officer on a submarine, worked as a financial adviser for Morgan Stanley, and now serves as the chief financial officer for the Baltimore City Health Department.

One day in 2004, during her first year of a Ph.D. program in biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Sarah found herself at a stop light in front of Dunbar High School. At school, shed been feeling disconnected, not feeling she belonged. She imagined that some of the students in Dunbar High were like Ryan  and she thought she might be able to relate well with them.

She met with the principal and persuaded him to give her a list of ninth-grade students who were academically struggling and facing challenges outside of school. She recruited seven volunteers from school to help with tutoring. Today, 80 percent of that initial group  12 of 15 students  have completed a four-year degree or professional certification program.

Today, the process has been systematized. Each student is connected to up to five volunteer family members who are led by a more experienced volunteer called the head of family. Up to eight heads of family, in turn, receive regular coaching from volunteer grandparents, who report to Thread staff members. Everyone receives backup from resource teams specializing in academics, college preparation and various health, social and legal problems. This model allows Thread, which had operating expenses of $1.1 million in 2015, to grow cost-effectively, while maintaining the long term focus and high volunteer to student ratio, both of which are crucial to its success.

Kids in extreme forms of poverty, often intergenerational, need multiple supports over multiple years, to make it, explains Robert Balfanz, a leading researcher who directs the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University School of Education. Things can be going fine and then something happens. They get evicted, lose a job, a parent gets incarcerated. Those things are continually happening. So you can have a great year, then you have a bad year. Even after you graduate, theres a million ways to fall off track.

The powerful things about Thread, he added, are that they stay with kids over time and get them to adulthood, and the insight to have a group of people do this, so it doesnt become an overwhelming commitment for one person. Those are two powerful innovations.

Thread has become a silent partner for our kids, explained Gregory E. Thornton, the chief executive of Baltimore City Public Schools. Its community is able to meet the needs of students in a way that high school teachers  who may teach 150 students  cannot, he said. The only problem with Thread is it needs to be bigger.

Theres another aspect to the work: What happens when so many diverse individuals and institutions in a city like Baltimore come together around a common mission?

Thread has 1,000 to 1,200 people connected to it, observed Rodney Foxworth, the founder of Invested Impact, a nonprofit mission investment organization in Baltimore, who serves as a board co-chair for Thread. That to me is where the real power is. As wonderful as the outcomes are, what brought me into Thread was the grander vision of a more equitable and inclusive city. We need great organizations to make change, but more than that we need movement making; we need a shift in perspective. Thread is going beyond the organization and building intersections between different communities.

Next week: A fuller examination of how Threads approach works.

Have you thought of a clever product to mitigate climate change? Did you invent an ingenious gadget to light African villages at night? Have you come up with a new kind of school, or new ideas for lowering the rate of urban shootings?

Thanks, but we have lots of those.

Whatever problem possesses you, we already have plenty of ways to solve it. Many have been rigorously tested and have a lot of evidence behind them  and yet theyre sitting on a shelf.

So dont invent something new. If you want to make a contribution, choose one of those ideas  and spread it.

Spreading an idea can mean two different things. One is to take something thats working in one place and introduce it somewhere else. If you want to reduce infant mortality in Cleveland, why not try whats working in Baltimore?

Well, you might not know about whats working because theres no quick system for finding it.

Even when a few people do search out the answer, innovative ideas dont spread by themselves. To become well known, they require effort from their originators. For example, a Bogota, Colombia, maternity hospital invented Kangaroo Care  a method of keeping premature babies warm by strapping them 24/7 to Moms chest. It saved a lot of lives in Bogota. But what allowed it to save lives around the world was a campaign to spread it to other countries.

The Colombians established Fundacion Canguro and got grants from wealthy countries to bring groups of doctors and nurses from all over to visit Bogota for two or three weeks. Once the visitors had gone back and set up a program in their hospital, the foundation loaned them a doctor and nurse to help get them started. Save the Children now leads a global partnership to spread Kangaroo Care, with the goal of reaching half the world.

In short, this work requires dedicated organizations, a smart program and lots of money.

The other meaning of spreading an idea is creating ways to get new inventions out to people who need them.

When I talk to college students or anyone whos thinking about entrepreneurship or targeting global poverty, the gadget is where 99 percent of people start thinking, said Nicholas Fusso, the director of D-Prize (its slogan: Distribution is development). Thats important  but the biggest problems in the poverty world arent a lack of gadgets or new products. Its figuring out how people can have access to them. So D-Prize gives seed money, in chunks of $10,000 to $20,000, to tiny new organizations that have good ideas for how to distribute useful things.

This analysis may be familiar to regular readers of Fixes. Indeed, the first Fixes column, more than five years ago, focused on distribution: getting health care to people in rural Africa by putting health care workers on motorcycles and keeping the bikes running.

Fusso likes to use the example of malaria. The modern insecticide-treated bed net was invented in 1980, when one million people a year  the vast majority small children  were dying. What impact did the invention itself have? None at all, at first. Deaths each year rose gradually, and then rose sharply  to a peak of 1.8 million in 2004, when they began to fall.

What happened then? The world finally started putting money into fighting malaria, including distributing bed nets. Today, deaths from malaria are one third of what they were in 2004.

The invention was crucial, of course  but it was distribution that gave it impact.

Also in 2004, a French researcher named Pascaline Dupas, working in Kenya, was talking to a Kenyan colleague who was running to give some money to her high school-age sister. These girls have no money, and I dont want her to end up with a sugar daddy, the colleague said.

But thats crazy! Dupas replied. Doesnt she know she could get H.I.V.?

Perhaps she did know, but the vast majority of girls in Kenya did not. The assumption was widespread that someone relatively wealthy and established was unlikely to have the virus. Three quarters of 15-year-old Kenyans surveyed thought teenage boys were more likely to be infected than men over 25.

This was very wrong. H.I.V. rates were six times higher in men aged 20-24 than they were in boys 15-19, and the rates rose with each additional year of sexual activity.

Across the world, but especially in high-poverty countries, many high school girls look for boyfriends who are five to 10 years older, because those men have sophistication, stability and money. These sugar daddies give the girls gifts, pick them up from school in nice cars, pay their school fees and even help their families.

Moreover, girls are much more likely to have unprotected sex with a sugar daddy than with boys their own age. The power imbalance in the relationship makes it difficult to insist on condom use. And avoiding pregnancy is less important to them, as wealthier and more stable men make better husbands and are more likely to marry them than teen boys are.

Sugar daddies were one big reason that the H.I.V. rate for teenage girls in Kenya was five times higher than for teenage boys. Dupas wondered if simply providing the girls with correct information about the relative risks could change things.

She designed a 40-minute lesson to help girls in eighth grade (average age: 15) to understand the H.I.V. risks associated with sugar daddies. It started with a 10-minute video. Then a facilitator from a local civic group showed statistics about actual infection rates by age and gender. The class discussed the reasons for these patterns, and gradually came around to talking about sugar daddies.

This training was tested in 328 schools in western Kenya against the countrys standard school anti-AIDS curriculum, which promoted abstinence. Dupass message was very different: Your risks are far less if you choose a partner your own age.

It made us very popular with the young boys in the class, she said.

The next year, Dupas counted how many girls had become pregnant, and recorded the fathers ages. The group that heard Dupass lesson had a pregnancy rate 28 percent lower than those who received the standard abstinence-based curriculum. And their rate of child bearing with men five years or more their senior was 61 percent less.

Dupas didnt have money to do H.I.V. testing, so she didnt study the effects on H.I.V. incidence. But pregnancy is likely a good stand-in for unprotected sex, and therefore H.I.V. infections.

For a 40-minute single intervention at negligible cost, it was a stunning impact.

And then  nothing happened. One organization tried to replicate the study in Cameroon, but didnt collect the right data. Dupas submitted the paper to various journals, finally publishing it in the American Economic Journal in 2011. Still, nothing happened  perhaps because people who design anti-AIDS programs dont usually read economics journals, she said.

Finally, someone ran with it. But it was only because a young American, Noam Angrist, had studied at M.I.T. with Esther Duflo, a professor who was Dupass mentor. Angrist had also worked at J-PAL, a laboratory Duflo helped to establish to carry out scientific studies of anti-poverty programs.

In 2013 Angrist was living in Botswana, which has the second-highest H.I.V prevalence of any nation  45 percent of 40-year-old men. With some friends, he did some small experiments to see whether the same misconceptions about sugar daddies existed in Botswana as in Kenya. They did. When we showed them the actual graph, they would physically gasp, he said. Young1ove was in business.

The new organization quickly won $20,000 from D-Prize and formed a partnership with Evidence Action, a new organization that seeks to scale up proven inventions. So far Young1ove has taught the mini-course  adapted for Botswana  to 35,000 youths, operating in a third of Botswanas schools. As the program grows, a study is comparing schools that have it  taught two different ways  to schools that dont yet, to test both the programs impact and whether teachers or youth facilitators get better results. The organization is also carrying out small pilot programs in South Africa and Zimbabwe.

Earlier this month, Young1ove and Evidence Action won a $700,000 grant from the new Global Innovation Fund, whose donors are the overseas development agencies of the United States, Britain, Sweden and Australia, and the Omidyar Network. The prize money will go to finishing the study and, if the results are good, rapid growth.

Young1ove is the largest of at least three groups trying to distribute Dupass curriculum. Jeunes Braves is working in Togo, and Power2Girls is starting in Ghana. Both won D-Prizes as well.

Organizations like J-PAL and Evidence Actions parent, Innovations for Poverty Action, are sometimes called the Randomistas, because they do randomized control trials. Theyve led a shift in anti-poverty work toward using scientific studies to see whats effective. In the last seven, eight years, weve moved away from its all about the talented individual to its all about the impact, said Gabriel Broadbar, director of the New York University Reynolds program in social entrepreneurship (which runs its own mini D-Prize).

The Randomistas have identified programs that work well and cheaply: bed nets, school-based deworming to rid children of parasites, installing chlorine dispensers at village taps, among others. The logical step now is to scale them up.

This is what Evidence Action tries to do. Karen Levy, the groups director of global innovation and beta, said that the challenges differ greatly from those of inventing something new: How do you fit the program into a countrys policy and regulatory framework? Whats a sustainable business model? How do you make it easy for lots of people  not just your original staff  to do well?

She used the example of deworming. Rather than send people to every single school, how do you design trainers of trainers in a cascade so it can be delivered by tens of thousands of teachers with the same results? she said.

Philanthropists and government aid agencies are only starting to get interested in the challenges of distribution  one new philanthropy that does have this focus is Good Ventures. As for academia, it still rewards invention almost exclusively. Theres a lot of attention and award-giving and prize-giving and credit to people who come up with fancy new ideas instead of reaching people and having impact, said Brodbar. The incentives arent aligned. The culture of social entrepreneurship needs to change.

Recognizing the true value of spreading an idea would also allow people who arent inventors (which is most of us) to get involved in social change. The notion that if you want to engage in [social entrepreneurship] you have to have the big idea does a disservice to this space and people who want to play a role in it, said Brodbar. Its a much wider front door.

nytimes.com,2014-06-21 00:00:00,The New York Times,"['Barbara Dafoe Whitehead', 'All Contributors', 'The Great Divide', 'The Conversation', 'Errol Morris', 'The End']","The Great Divide is a series about inequality.

In a referendum in November, voters approved as many as seven new casinos to join New York States existing nine gambling facilities. And New York is hardly alone. In recent years, 23 other states have legalized and licensed commercial (as opposed to Native American) gambling facilities. In the casino-dense Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, where 26 casinos have opened since 2004 and at least a dozen more are under development, most adults now live within a short drive of one.

Not surprisingly, the closer casinos come to where people live, the more likely people are to gamble at one. As casinos have spread into de-industrialized cities, dying resorts and gritty urban areas, the rate of gambling participation has grown among lower-income groups.

In Americas increasingly two-tier economy, casino industry leaders realized that they didnt have to cater exclusively to well-heeled consumers in order to rake in profits. Payday lending, rent-to-own stores, subprime credit cards, auto title loans and tax refund anticipation loans all evolved to extract high profits from low-income groups. And the newly established state-licensed casinos have their methods, too.

A research team from the University at Buffalo and SUNY Buffalo State has conducted studies that offer new evidence of the exploitative effects of casino gambling on lower-income Americans. For example, the researchers found that the rates of casino gambling participation and frequency of visits have increased among lower-income groups. Easy access to casinos is a key factor. Living within 10 miles of one or more casinos more than doubles the rate of problems from excessive gambling. Another factor is easy access to slot-machine gambling. Women and the elderly have become more likely to gamble in recent years, partly because of a preference for nonskill slot-machine gambling.

The casinos method is to induce low-income gamblers to make a huge number of small bets per visit, to visit the casino several times per month, or even per week, and to sustain this pattern over a period of years. The key to executing this method is the slot machine.

Most regional casinos are essentially slot parlors. Slot machines are nowadays sophisticated computerized devices engineered to produce continuous and repeat betting, and programmed by high-tech experts to encourage gamblers to make multiple bets simultaneously by tapping buttons on the console as fast as their fingers can fly. Natasha Dow Schull, an anthropologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has written the definitive work on gambling-machine design, notes that as gamblers deepen their immersion, they become less interested in winning itself than in simply continuing to play.

Slots will accept bets in denominations as small as a penny  one reason they are attractive to small bettors. But even penny bets placed on each of multiple lines for each spin, after hundreds of spins, can result in large losses.

The goal, though, is not to clean out the gambler in a single visit; its to provide an experience that will induce the gambler to prolong the time spent on the device. The slots achieve this by carefully regulating the rhythm, tempo and sound ambience of the play, while doling out occasional small wins even as the players losses slowly increase.

One way these computerized pickpockets milk their customers is by generating near misses, whereby the spinning symbols on the machine stop just above or below the winning payline. The feeling of having come oh so close to a win prompts further play.

A second goal is to ensure that gamblers visit more often and continue to do so over time. Through player loyalty cards and other marketing programs, casinos collect a vast amount of information on their customers. This enables them to devise customized strategies to get gamblers to adhere to this pattern of frequent play over long duration.

Casinos also gather information on their customers worth, as well as their predicted lifetime value. From this information, we might be able to calculate what percentage of customers come from the bottom half of median income distribution, as well as how much these low-income gamblers lose as a percentage of their income. We might also be able to tell how the regional casinos catering to lower-income gamblers are affecting income inequality in their localities.

The casinos do not, of course, disclose this information, and the states that share in the revenues generated through gambling losses do not press their commercial partners to do so. As a result, the limited data available to the public on the impact of casino gambling has been gathered by a few outside sources.

A large-scale survey of adults, conducted by the Buffalo group in 2000, found that lower socioeconomic and minority groups who visited casinos had more gambling-related problems, including financial difficulties. This suggests that their losses, as a share of their income, were greater than those in the upper income distribution.

Examining 15 types of legal gambling, the researchers came to a striking conclusion: Casino gambling had by far the most harmful effects on people at the lower end of the income ladder.

nytimes.com,2016-03-02 00:00:00,How Trump's 'Off the Record' Remarks Crept Out,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Updated, Friday, March 4, 2016.

A reader, Ken Fitzpatrick, read about what has been called a secret recording of Donald Trumps meeting in January with the Times editorial board. On that recording, an article by Buzzfeeds editor in chief Ben Smith suggests, Mr. Trump says that his extreme position on deporting immigrants is not anything he would necessarily carry out in real, postelection life, but rather might be a starting point for negotiation.

Mr. Fitzpatrick writes:

Can you please elucidate why the NYT is conducting any part of an interview with a Presidential candidate off the record? Obviously if you have informed someone that part of the interview is off the record, going back on that would be unethical. But why, oh why, would you ever agree to that in the first place? Youre not interviewing someone whose cat was rescued from a tree. These are candidates for PRESIDENT. Youve created a situation where a candidate may have told NYT editors something that is illuminating and worth reporting on, but they are restrained from doing so.

I asked the editorial page editor, Andrew Rosenthal, to address the question. He told me that the editorial boards meetings with presidential candidates are often done on an off-the-record basis, at the candidates request. These meetings with candidates are not for the purpose of writing news articles, he emphasized, but are intended as informational sessions for the board so that board members can make observations, challenge the candidate on his or her positions, and eventually consider an endorsement.



The editorial board, an 18-member group that writes The Timess editorial positions, is a distinct entity from the reporters and editors in the newsroom.

Often, the sessions are recorded so that the board members can refer to the conversations as they make their considerations.

The endorsement interview with Mr. Trump on Jan. 5 was different for two reasons. One, it was attended by Dean Baquet, The Timess executive editor, who runs the newsroom staff. He is an occasional guest of the editorial board, he told me Tuesday.

Two, it was partly on the record because that was Mr. Trumps preference. This made it fair game for news coverage, particularly after a question arose about Mr. Trumps stance on tariffs. (The tariff portion of the meeting was on the record.)

So that the news side could check that on-the-record information, Mr. Rosenthal sent a digital copy of the recording to a newsroom editor whom he declined to name, with the reminder that there had been an agreement to treat portions of it as off the record.

These sessions are not about news gathering for stories, he told me. And, responding to those who are calling for the recording to be released publicly, he said: Its not as if we are sitting on a news story here, or holding something back from publication.

Is there a big story here? I dont know what Mr. Trump said in the meeting, nor do I have access to the recording. If Mr. Trumps statements are as Buzzfeed describes them, they may not be all that new. Mr. Trump has made similar comments before, including in an on-the-record interview with the Washington Examiner in January. (The Intercepts Glenn Greenwald made reference to this in a piece published Tuesday.)

Mr. Baquet told me that he didnt know who had spoken to Buzzfeed to describe the off-the-record portion of the session, and that he didnt intend to pursue it.

I dont know how it got out, but Im certainly not going to do a leak investigation, Mr. Baquet told me. He also said that he found the idea of an off-the-record agreement when there are 30 people in the room to be difficult to enforce and probably impractical.

Update: Mr. Baquet elaborated on what happened and his reaction in an interview with CBS This Morning on Thursday.

After Buzzfeeds report, many others followed, often with criticism of The Timess practices. The Times itself published an article that mentioned the dust-up later Monday.

My take: Having agreed to an off-the-record conversation, The Times (both editorial department and news side) was and is obligated to honor that arrangement, as Mr. Fitzpatrick rightly notes. The trouble here had to do with the mixing of editorial and news side, the mixing of on- and off-the-record, and the well-intentioned but hazardous sharing of a recording that involved off-the-record information.

Should The Times continue to host off-the-record sessions with candidates, so that the editorial board can consider endorsements? Im certainly no fan of The Times taking information from politicians or government officials that cannot be used or attributed, as Ive written endlessly. But this opinion-side practice for pre-endorsement meetings is a long-established one that can serve a worthwhile end, if everybody observes the rules.

What got The Times in trouble was the mixing of purposes (opinion and news), the blending of on- and off-the-record material in a single candidate session and the sharing of the recording  including among those who evidently didnt care much about an off-the-record agreement. All of that amounted to an accident waiting to happen.",[]
nytimes.com,2015-06-26 00:00:00,The New York Times,"['All Contributors', 'The Great Divide', 'The Conversation', 'Diana Spechler', 'Errol Morris', 'The End']","Anxiety: We worry. A gallery of contributors count the ways.

Im almost unmedicated. Each morning, I take just 100 milligrams of bupropion. At bedtime, I take a quarter milligram of lorazepam. Ive eliminated trazodone. And Im single. My ex and I are friends again  we were friends for years before we dated  and now that my heartbreak has receded, I dont miss the upstream swim of that relationship. I still pop awake in the middle of the night, and often stay awake for two or three hours, but theres a peacefulness to my days now. Summer is helping. It always does.

My worst depression comes not from heartbreak, but from feeling trapped. Yet Ive sought out relationships again and again.

For the first time since age 12, Im not engaged in the compulsive relationship pattern that those close to me have often questioned, that Ive often questioned, too: I neither have a serious boyfriend nor want one. I spend a lot of time thinking about one man (its hard to imagine quitting that vice), but hes 2,600 miles away without a working phone or a passport.

I didnt make a conscious decision to take a hiatus from serial monogamy. At other times in my life, I have tried militantly to stay single, knowing that a steady stream of boyfriends is not the antidote to depression, but Ive always wound up panicking and tumbling into a relationship. I just feel something different now, as if a cord thats usually pulled tight has slackened.

Ive been single for only four months; I dont deserve a medal or induction into a convent, but its interesting to me that as I decrease my meds, the urgency I feel around men subsides.





Nothing has troubled me more consistently than romantic love. Youre afraid to be alone, Ive been told, and thats true. But then again, isnt it true of most people? Arent we taught from a young age to fear that?

Between relationships, I always forget loves shortcomings, envision it to be something magical and curative. I forget about the annoying parts  the beloved clipping his toenails in bed. I forget about the darkness  that the beloved might suffer from depression, too; that the beloved might face tragedy or sleep with someone else. In her memoir, The Odd Woman and The City, Vivian Gornick describes her decision to give up romantic love: It haunted the psyche, was an ache in the bones; so deeply embedded in the makeup of the spirit, it hurt the eyes to look directly into its influence. It would be a cause of pain and conflict for the rest of my life.

For me, it is a cause of pain just as surely as its a distraction from pain  love is all meshed up with my depression. Im sick with anxiety when I fall for someone, unsure if he loves me back, but simultaneously, Ive often relied on that crazed feeling to take me out of my own head. I find it endlessly sad that the falling-in-love sensation is fleeting; even sadder is the crash that inevitably follows, when real life must be faced.

The end of a relationship is a kind of high, too  theres nothing more life-affirming, more hope-inspiring, than a fresh start. After my first long-term relationship unraveled, I started running. I would wake at five in the morning and run while the world slept. I would run until I vomited. I couldnt get enough. I was so excited, so energized, that walking felt like sitting still.

My worst depression comes not from heartbreak, but from feeling trapped. Relationships, even those with the best beginnings, often infuse me with a sense of entrapment. And yet, Ive sought them out again and again, certain that if I find the right one, it will open a window and let the fresh air in while all of my problems fly out.

According to popular culture, to be a single woman is either pathetic or empowering. On television, single women are either eating ice cream and crying or drinking cosmopolitans with their spirited girlfriends and trashing the men they go to bed with. Historically, my singledom has erred more on the side of pathetic  I never fail to make leaps of logic, including No one will ever love me again. But this time is different. I wouldnt say I feel empowered, but I am finding single life relaxing. I should have figured this out years ago, what my friends have always told me  that I dont need a relationship. Im reminded of the time a woman stopped me on the street to point out that I was the only person with an open umbrella, that it hadnt been raining for quite some time; I was so happy to collapse that thing, to shove it into my bag, to finally have my hands free.



I always want to reiterate how grateful I am for meds, how meds saved my life. But as I taper, I do have a sense that Im floating gently back to reality, that Ive been separated from reality for years, that reality is greeting me. Reality is surprisingly tolerable  I can live on tiny doses of medication and I can live without a boyfriend. In the past month and a half, Ive been experiencing intense laughing jags. Ill start laughing about something semi-funny and find myself unable to stop. Sometimes I laugh so hard, I cry or get a cramp. It is the best feeling Ive ever had. That laughter is restoring something inside me, or restoring me to the world. Someone close to me who kicked a heroin habit told me he had the same experience when he was getting clean.

I met the man who lives 2,600 miles away while I was spending the month of May in Mexico. One night, after wed been friends only a few days, I stayed out late with him and couldnt get home to my meds because the buses had stopped running. I was terrified by the prospect of spending a night without lorazepam. I could hardly speak as we walked three miles along the highway to his house. Every shadow looked alive. The occasional headlights assaulted my vision. My whole body trembled. The source of my fear felt nebulous, and so I was afraid of everything.

In his living room, he showed me to an air mattress on the floor, and then went outside to the garden. When he returned, he arranged rosemary beside my face. He laid rose petals on my sweaty palms, said something about my chakras. I felt itchy and squirmy. My stomach hurt. Could I trust this person? Who was he anyway? I kept thinking of Francisco Goldmans New Yorker series about those 43 missing students. Wasnt Mexico dangerous? Werent men?

His dog climbed on top of me and licked my face, chin to forehead. He kept licking me until I started to laugh. My friend was laughing, too. Leave her alone! he yelled at the dog. Shes trying to be depressed!

I hesitate to share to what happened next. I dont want to sound like those television shows I was criticizing  the final frame where the single woman struts confidently down the sidewalk. I dont want to admit that my emotions, which Ive always hailed as complicated, sharpened to a clear and simple point: I was going to be O.K., I realized. Not just on this air mattress while I waited for the buses to start running, but in a grander sense  soon I was going to be meds-free and I was going to survive it.

When the sun broke through the dark and turned the sky lavender, my friend and I walked outside. We ran into his neighbors, who offered us a ride to my place. We climbed into the back of their pickup truck.

How are you feeling? he asked as we sped over the cobblestones.

There was wind on our faces. Its almost impossible to feel bad when theres wind on your face and the days just beginning. To our right, the lake unfurled, a ribbon of blue. Beyond it, the mountains zigzagged against the sky. In a few minutes, I would say goodbye to the men, hop out of the truck, and be alone with myself and my unmedicated thoughts.

I remember that before I answered, I was curious to hear how these words would sound because I was going to mean them: Im fine.

nytimes.com,2013-04-02 00:00:00,"The Times, Too, Is Reconsidering the Term 'Illegal Immigrant'","['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","The Associated Press made a bold move on Tuesday in dropping the term illegal immigrant from its influential stylebook.

The Times, for the past couple of months, has also been considering changes to its stylebook entry on this term and will probably announce them to staff members this week. (A stylebook is the definitive guide to usage, relied upon by writers and editors, for the purpose of consistency.)

From what I can gather, The Timess changes will not be nearly as sweeping as The A.P.s.

It will provide more nuance and options for what term to use, said Philip B. Corbett, associate managing editor for standards. In the past, for example, the term undocumented has practically been banned as a euphemism. That position is very likely to be softened in the revision, and other ways of describing those who are in the United States without proper legal documentation probably will be allowed and encouraged.

I would be surprised to see The Times ban the use of illegal immigrant, as The A.P. has done. Kathleen Carroll, the A.P.s senior vice president and executive editor, told Poynter.org that terms like this end up pigeonholing people or creating long descriptive titles where you use some main event in someones life to become the modifier before their name.

The Timess changes will probably be more incremental.

Its good to see these moves taking place. Language evolves and its time for these changes. Early in my tenure as public editor, I considered this question and came down in favor of the continued use of illegal immigrant, because it was a clear and easily understandable term. My position on this has changed over the past several months. So many people find it offensive to refer to a person with an adjective like illegal that I now favor the use of undocumented or unauthorized as alternatives.

Its important to state that I have not taken part in The Timess discussion about the changes and that I have no policy-making role.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-02-10 00:00:00,Times Reporter: 'I Would Never Cut a Deal Like That',"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Heres an ugly term: Transactional journalism  also known as a quid pro quo.

Hardly an unfamiliar idea, it came up this week with the disclosure that a writer for The Atlantic made a deal to use a particular word  muscular  in describing a 2009 speech by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in order to get an advance copy of the speech. Her aide also required the writer, Marc Ambinder, to favorably mention a State Department delegation attending the speech.

In emails that were made public by Gawker, Mr. Ambinder agreed (got it, he wrote of the instructions from Philippe Reines of Mrs. Clintons staff) and received his advance copy. The practice rightly was termed corrupt by Erik Wemple of The Washington Post, though he gave Mr. Ambinder credit for appropriate contrition. (The Atlantic has appended an editors note to the article.)

A New York Times reporter, Mark Landler, whose article on the speech also used the word muscular and also mentioned the delegation, told me in the strongest terms on Wednesday that he had not made any sort of similar arrangement and would not do so. That would be a very serious breach of journalistic ethics, Mr. Landler told me by phone.

Earlier, in an email, he wrote: No, I would NEVER cut a deal like that. My use of the word muscular may have reflected a lack of originality, but it did not reflect collusion.

I asked Mr. Landler about it because I had heard from a reader, Ian Frazer, who saw an article in Breitbart, the conservative news and opinion website, that pointed out the use of the word and the description in Mr. Landlers article. Mr. Frazer wrote that the suggestion that any Times reporting was guided by its subject in order to gain access is very troubling and should be disclosed if true.

I agree that it would be very troubling  and possibly grounds for dismissal. Mr. Landler told me that he did not recall receiving an advance text of the speech (a common enough practice) but that he certainly had not cut such a deal, and would not ever do so.

Its worth noting that the word muscular came up often in a search of Mr. Landlers articles of that period. He told me that more recently, he has made an effort to use the word muscular far less often because it tends to equate a hawkish foreign policy with a good foreign policy. Its been reasonably criticized as a value-laden term and its a good idea to stay away from it, he said.

Mr. Landler also noted that the State Department wasnt happy with his article, which put the speech in the context of her trying to regain her relevancy in the administration, after a period in which she seemed to have been sidelined. He said he has seen an email from Anne-Marie Slaughter to that effect. And he said that Mrs. Clinton had mentioned the delegation during her speech, which is what drew his attention to it.

I have been critical of Washington reporting that functions as a government mouthpiece, especially through the use of unnamed government sources. And while the practice described in the emails is shocking in how blatant it is  at one point, Mr. Reines instructs Mr. Ambinder to write something, but in your own clever way  lets not be naive: this kind of deal cutting is not entirely surprising.

Having said that, I find Mr. Landler thoroughly credible about all of this. And I was glad to hear his condemnation of this practice.

Speaking of journalistic ethics and practices, it would have been decent of Breitbarts reporter to reach Mr. Landler for comment before going the route of innuendo.

Correction, February 11, 2016:

An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that Mr. Landler was the recipient of an email from Anne-Marie Slaughter that referred to his article. In fact, that email was sent to Mrs. Clinton.",[]

Mr. Snyders administration has been criticized as slow to respond to residents concerns about their water.

Flint, which had long received water from Lake Huron provided by Detroits water utility, began drawing its water from the Flint River in 2014 in an effort to save money while a new pipeline was built. Residents soon complained about rashes and strange odors from the river water, but city and state officials mostly insisted that it was safe to drink. Last year, elevated levels of lead were found in childrens blood, and in October, Flint switched back to Detroits water system. Mr. Snyder, a Republican, said Tuesday that the emergency declaration would allow for more state resources to be used in addressing the effects of the tainted water.",[]

Q.

It may seem a bit circular, but its true: One of the topics that receives the most questions and comments to the public editor is online commenting itself. So what youll find below are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions on The Timess policies and practices on this subject. The answers were provided by Sasha Koren and Bassey Etim, who manage social media and online commenting for The Times. The questions were assembled by my assistant Joseph Burgess, who often fields these reader queries as he combs through the public editor e-mail each day. Many thanks to all of them.

The New York Times produces hundreds of articles and blog posts each day. What is the process for selecting which articles receive comments and why some allow commenting periods longer than others? Additionally, what factors does The Times consider when it is choosing articles for comment?

A.

We open approximately 17 articles per day for comments. In addition, every blog post is open for comments by default. The process, in general, looks something like this: A member of the community staff consults with the news desk, which runs the home page, about the articles that are likely to be published that day, then decides which should be open to comments. That list is revised throughout the day as the news evolves and new articles are published. In addition, the Opinion department chooses a number of articles to open in discussion with the community team.

Generally, we consider four factors when deciding which articles should be available for comment: news value of the story; the likelihood of reader interest in the story; whether we can moderate the likely number of comments in a timely fashion; and whether we have recently hosted comments about the issue in question.

Q.

When an article does allow for comment, what is the average duration that commenting is allowed before it is closed? Besides duration, what else would necessitate an end to commenting on a piece of content?

A.

On average, comments are left open for 24 hours, although we often close comments the day after an article has been published in the newspaper, regardless of how long the thread has been open.

We also often close comment threads when we feel the discussion has run its course and there is nothing substantial to gain from having more comments on the article. The community team asks itself the general question: Would our readers be better served by seeing another 1,000 comments on one article on a hot-button issue, or by finding 1,000 comments across four or five different articles on a variety of topics?

Q.

Readers who live on the West Coast are upset when they wake up to find that a David Brooks column or a front-page article has already stopped accepting comments by 8 a.m. local time. Has The Times taken any steps to ensure longer comment periods on the most popular content, like Op-Ed columns and front-page news articles?

A.

Yes, the community team will be adding staff members soon to better handle the influx of Op-Ed comments we receive overnight and into the morning.

Q.

Is every comment that is received read by a Times staffer? In essence, do any fall into a black hole? Additionally, why is there sometimes a substantial time lag between when a comment is posted by a reader and when it is moderated by The Times?

A.

Yes, all comments that are submitted are read.

The reason for the time delay is that we believe in moderating by hand. The rewards of this approach are in the quality of our discussions, in which we take great pride, not least because we feel we offer a safe space where people of all political persuasions can make their case without fear of a barrage of childish insults or insubstantial or off-color remarks.

The drawback is equally clear to anyone who has tried to comment on one of our busier stories  it can take some time for the comments to be reviewed and posted.

To us, the trade-off is more than worth it, although we know some readers disagree. We see these comments as an extension of our journalism. We value the input of a majority of our commenters and are not willing to have their words devalued by running them alongside personal attacks, innuendo and obscenity. Our bet is that when you visit NYTimes.com, youre looking for urbane and literate content, and our comments sections seek to live by that same standard.

Q.

The Times has reduced the character count to 1,500 characters from 5,000 characters to allow the moderation staff to moderate comments more quickly. Some readers post 25-30 comments per day. Has The Times considered imposing a maximum number of comments per user per day, so that more readers have the ability to comment?

A.

No, we have not considered limiting readers to a maximum number of comments per day and have no plans to do so. We want commenters to have ample opportunity to discuss as many topics as they like with as many points as they want to make. Our practice of hand-moderating all threads reduces the risk of one person dominating a given discussion.

Q.

What are the most common reasons The Times rejects a reader comment? What are some things readers can do to ensure their comments are within The Timess guidelines?

A.

The most common reason for rejection is for being inflammatory. We dont allow name-calling, even for public officials in most cases. Rudeness to fellow commenters is also frowned upon, and usually rejected. We also reject comments for being off-topic, incoherent, unsubstantial and spam, and for using obscenities.

If a comment is respectful, on-topic and avoids YELLING, then it will most likely be approved. One more thing to ensure approval: When you make an argument, defend it. Simple declarative statements like Obama/Romney is so dumb! will be rejected. Obama/Romney is so dumb because of X, Y and Z will be approved.

For more information on our moderation standards, see the Comments FAQ.

Q.

A number of other news organizations have implemented Facebook into their commenting systems to promote real-time identity and enhance the level of conversation. Is The Times considering any features that would reduce commenter anonymity?

A.

We encourage commenters to use their real names, but also see an advantage to allowing for anonymity. While we notice that those who comment under real names (or what appear to be real names) tend to leave more coherent and well-written comments that are civil in tone, we have heard from a number of readers that they value the ability to comment under a handle or pseudonym. For example, someone making a comment in an article about the business practices of her employer may not want to be publicly identified, lest she suffer retribution. A commenter undergoing treatment for a medical condition he would rather not discuss with family and friends has good reason to keep his observations private, even if he has valuable experiences to share on a story about his illness.

Q.

What are some new features that The Times has added (or is planning to add) that will enhance the overall commenting experience on NYTimes.com?

A.

We have enhancements in the works, but they are still in the early stages and were not yet prepared to discuss them. But we hope to start some exciting new features in the coming months.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Perfectly Reasonable Question: Must 'Best Comments' Be True?,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Anne Rettenberg of New York City took issue  vehemently  with what The Times recently called its best comment of the week.

Starting last month, a new Times feature began identifying the top 10 comments of the week on our digital platforms, as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment.

Last weeks No. 1 comment read as follows:

I am so disappointed in the Sanders supporters. All votes matter. Black votes, Latino votes, White votes, Southern votes. Older voters. Mrs. Clinton is winning the popular votes. The delegates votes. And yet the Sanders supporters sneer at these votes, and almost in a racist and patronizing way suggest these voters do [not] know what is good for them. Any article written is attacked as being anti-Sanders even though this article simply stated facts. Should we get rid of the black votes, Southern votes and anyone who dares not to vote for Sanders? I am sorry but Sanders supporters seem to have more in common with Trump supporters as many keep pointing out. No grace in defeat.

Ms. Rettenberg, a Sanders supporter, called this a defamatory lie. She wrote: Neither I nor any Sanders supporter I know sneers at votes by voters who are black, Latino, white Southern or anything else. And she added, This type of almost nonsensical, shrieking broadside is apparently the best tactic Hillary supporters can muster, which is sad.

I asked The Timess community editor, Bassey Etim, to respond. He said that moderators had noticed the growing disagreement among commenters between Sanders and Clinton supporters.

We just wanted to capture a bit of that interchange with the top two comments on the list, he said. (The second of the best comments was a reply to the first, but didnt address the point Ms. Rettenberg brings up.)

And, more generally, Mr. Etim explained the selections of best comments:

Editorially, were also trying to find comments on popular stories or stories where the comments really strike a personal chord. But those comments need to be excerpt-able in 100-150 words and also make sense absent any other context. So we cant always just include the most popular comment, but we always lean toward the most popular ones. And we also make an effort to include a few of the top 10 most recommended comments across the site each week. Recommendations alone, though, arent the best indicator of comments quality, because you have to balance that against the number of total visitors to the article and the time of the comments publication vs. the time of the articles peak visits. So basically, being #1 is a function of:

 How well the exchange represents the wider nytimes.com conversation.

 How popular was the comment among readers?

 Is this in reaction to a major news item?

 Did moderators think the comment was high quality.

The Times does not make a practice of fact-checking reader comments, which would be an overwhelming task. But moderators do make many judgments about whats appropriate for publication.

As for the question of accuracy, Mr. Etim didnt find that to be a salient issue in this case. I didnt think there was really a factual issue  the comment referred to previous comments from Sanders supporters in the article and made a subjective argument against them.

In this occasional series of Perfectly Reasonable Questions, I ask a Times editor to respond to a readers question, and I present the question and answer, usually without comment. Feel free to submit questions to public@nytimes.com. (As always, I reserve the right to determine what is perfectly reasonable.)",[]

For the past painful year, the Republican presidential contenders have been bombarding Americans with empty propaganda slogans and competing, bizarrely, to present themselves as the least experienced person for the most important elected job in the world. Democratic primary voters, on the other hand, after a substantive debate over real issues, have the chance to nominate one of the most broadly and deeply qualified presidential candidates in modern history.









Hillary Clinton would be the first woman nominated by a major party. She served as a senator from a major state (New York) and as secretary of state  not to mention her experience on the national stage as first lady with her brilliant and flawed husband, President Bill Clinton. The Times editorial board has endorsed her three times for federal office  twice for Senate and once in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary  and is doing so again with confidence and enthusiasm.

Mrs. Clintons main opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, has proved to be more formidable than most people, including Mrs. Clinton, anticipated. He has brought income inequality and the lingering pain of the middle class to center stage and pushed Mrs. Clinton a bit more to the left than she might have gone on economic issues. Mr. Sanders has also surfaced important foreign policy questions, including the need for greater restraint in the use of military force.

In the end, though, Mr. Sanders does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that Mrs. Clinton offers. His boldest proposals  to break up the banks and to start all over on health care reform with a Medicare-for-all system  have earned him support among alienated middle-class voters and young people. But his plans for achieving them arent realistic, while Mrs. Clinton has very good, and achievable, proposals in both areas.

The third Democratic contender, Martin OMalley, is a personable and reasonable liberal who seems more suited for the jobs he has already had  governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore  than for president.

Mrs. Clinton is a strong advocate of sensible and effective measures to combat the plague of firearms; Mr. Sanderss record on guns is relatively weak. Her economic proposals for financial reform reflect a deep understanding of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, including the ways in which it has fallen short. She supports changes that the country badly needs, like controls on high-frequency trading and stronger curbs on bank speculation in derivatives.

Mr. Sanders has scored some rhetorical points against Mrs. Clinton for her longstanding ties to Wall Street, but she has responded well, and it would be comical to watch any of the Republican candidates try to make that case, given that they are all virtually tied to, or actually part of, the business establishment.

One of the most attractive parts of Mrs. Clintons economic platform is her pledge to support the well-being and rights of working Americans. Her lifelong fight for women bolsters her credibility in this area, since so many of the problems with labor law hit women the hardest, including those involving child care, paid sick leave, unstable schedules and low wages for tipped workers.

Mrs. Clinton is keenly aware of the wage gap for women, especially for women of color. Its not just that shes done her homework  Mrs. Clinton has done her homework on pretty much any subject youd care to name. Her knowledge comes from a commitment to issues like reproductive rights that is decades old. She was well ahead of Mr. Sanders in calling for repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which severely limits federal money to pay for abortions for poor women.

As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton worked tirelessly, and with important successes, for the nations benefit. She was the secretary President Obama needed and wanted: someone who knew leaders around the world, who brought star power as well as expertise to the table. The combination of a new president who talked about inclusiveness and a chief diplomat who had been his rival but shared his vision allowed the United States to repair relations around the world that had been completely trashed by the previous administration.

Mrs. Clinton helped make it possible to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, which in turn led to the important nuclear deal now going into effect. She also fostered closer cooperation with Asian countries. She worked to expand and deepen the dialogue with China and to increase Washingtons institutional ties to the region. Mrs. Clinton had rebuked China when she was first lady for its treatment of women, and she criticized the Beijing governments record on human rights even as she worked to improve relations.

In January 2011, before the Arab Spring, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech that criticized Arab leaders, saying their countries risked sinking into the sand unless they liberalized their political systems and cleaned up their economies. Certainly, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis deepened during her tenure, but she did not cause that.

Mrs. Clinton can be more hawkish on the use of military power than Mr. Obama, as shown by her current call for a no-fly zone in Syria and her earlier support for arming and training Syrian rebels. We are not convinced that a no-fly zone is the right approach in Syria, but we have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton would use American military power effectively and with infinitely more care and wisdom than any of the leading Republican contenders.

Mrs. Clinton, who has been accused of flip-flopping on trade, has shown a refreshing willingness to learn and to explain, as she has in detail, why she changed her mind on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She is likely to do more to help workers displaced by the forces of trade than previous presidents have done, and certainly more than any of the Republicans.

Mrs. Clinton has honed a steeliness that will serve her well in negotiating with a difficult Congress on critically important issues like climate change. It will also help her weather what are certain to be more attacks from Republicans and, should she win the White House, the possibility of the same ideological opposition and personal animus that President Obama has endured. Some of the campaign attacks are outrageous, like Donald Trumps efforts to bring up Bill Clintons marital infidelity. Some, like those about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server, are legitimate and deserve forthright answers.

Hillary Clinton is the right choice for the Democrats to present a vision for America that is radically different from the one that leading Republican candidates offer  a vision in which middle-class Americans have a real shot at prosperity, womens rights are enhanced, undocumented immigrants are given a chance at legitimacy, international alliances are nurtured and the country is kept safe.",[]

BILL GRUESKIN remembers being an editor at The Wall Street Journal in 2004 when Farnaz Fassihis e-mail, meant for a few friends eyes only, began to circle the globe. Ms. Fassihi, an Iranian-American, was a reporter for The Journal, and the exposure of her views about the deteriorating situation in Iraq, provocative and incisive, was shocking. Published outside the normal bounds of painfully balanced journalism, her missive gave readers an unfiltered blast of reality.









It was startling to read it, and the reaction was explosive, said Mr. Grueskin, now the academic dean at Columbia Universitys Graduate School of Journalism.

Since then, the debate about whether reporters should expose their personal views has only gathered power and velocity. The debate  in a different form  flared again a few weeks ago when I wrote on my blog about The Timess Jerusalem bureau chief, Jodi Rudoren. Ms. Rudoren, writing on Facebook, had expressed personal thoughts about Palestinians in a way she later regretted. But some observers, saw an important lesson in the situation.

Journalists thoughts and beliefs DO matter, enough of this objectivity myth, Jillian York, a free-speech advocate, wrote on Twitter.

The message from some readers: We dont want a reporters personal beliefs covered up, even if we disagree. One who commented on my blog, Mark from Sydney, wrote:

I think the instinct to maintain the old fiction that professional journalists can free themselves of their personal views and habits of mind is doomed to failure.

In an increasingly polarized society, this is an increasingly important subject, and a complex one. Does objectivity matter? Is the idea of impartiality worth preserving? Lets acknowledge upfront that it is a two-headed beast: partly about the personal biases that reporters may bring into their work, and partly about the middle-ground reporting that muddies the truth in the name of fairness.

Jay Rosen, a New York University journalism professor, believes that traditional notions about impartial reporting are fundamentally flawed. For starters, he thinks journalists should just come out and tell readers more about their beliefs.

The grounds for trust are slowly shifting, he told me recently. The View from Nowhere is slowly getting harder to trust, and Heres where Im coming from is more likely to be trusted.

Pushing back are editors like Philip B. Corbett, The Timess associate managing editor for standards. I flatly reject the notion that there is no such thing as impartial, objective journalism  that its some kind of pretense or charade, and we should just give it up, come clean and lay out our biases, he said. We expect professionals in all sorts of fields to put their personal opinions aside, or keep them to themselves, when they do their work  judges, police officers, scientists, teachers. Why would we expect less of journalists?

Neither of these thoughtful journalists, though, is black-and-white on the subject.

Mr. Rosen wont go so far as to say that The Timess Washington bureau chief, for example, should have a Web page summarizing whom he voted for, whether he believes in abortion rights, and what political party he is registered with. While he believes that is the right direction for journalists, I also understand that there are lots of practical problems, including the simple fact that the Washington bureau chief will get attacked for saying that.

And for his part, Mr. Corbett doesnt expect reporters and editors to be faceless, impersonal entities. He encourages them to take part in Web-based chats where readers can get to know the people behind the bylines. He supports Times journalists use of Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms to communicate in a more personal way.

But thats a far cry from making public declarations of political opinions, a practice he believes would erode our credibility and feed the false notion that there are no real facts, no impartial reporting or analysis  just spin and polemic.

I agree with Mr. Corbett that The Timess credibility would be damaged if its reporters began declaring their partisan beliefs. As he notes, readers already have a hard time accepting that reporting is fair-minded.

But I also appreciate an element of Mr. Rosens philosophy. In his view, objectivity is problematic when it involves taking the midpoint between opposing sides and calling that neither/nor position impartial.  Hes dead right about that.

As Ive written before, what readers really want is reporting that gets to the bottom of a story without having to give opposing sides equal weight. They also want reporters to state established truths clearly, without hedging or always putting the words in a sources mouth.

Theyre most interested in truth. Smart journalists may reasonably differ on how to get there. Mr. Rosen says, Tell us where youre coming from. Mr. Corbett says, Check your personal beliefs at the door.

Ill offer these conclusions:

The idea that transparency is the new objectivity, as the author David Weinberger puts it, has merit. Journalists can let readers get to know their backgrounds, their personalities and how they do their jobs. The Times has embraced that move toward transparency, through social media, Web-based chats with journalists, and even its employment of a public editor who explains the paper to readers.

But there should be limits, especially for news reporters, as opposed to opinion writers. The Times should continue to enforce its rules that bar journalists from the most visible forms of partisanship: contributing to campaigns, joining rallies or making public shows of support for candidates or causes. It would be hard for readers to believe that a reporter who contributed to a campaign or carried a sign in an abortion-related rally could report without bias.

If impartiality means an even split between opposing beliefs in every article, the concept deserves to be tossed out. Get at the truth, above all. But getting at the truth can require setting aside personal views to evaluate evidence fairly. If thats impartiality, it remains not only worthwhile but crucially necessary.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-02-03 00:00:00,Unanswered Questions Resurface in James Foley Film,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Updated, February 4, 2016.

Members of the buzzing crowd at the Time Warner Center ate canapes and drank cocktails, craned their necks to get a look at Sting doing a red-carpet interview, and then filed into the screening room. Once they did, the party atmosphere quickly turned somber.

The film, an HBO documentary, is about the life and death of James Wright Foley, the American journalist who was kidnapped by ISIS in Syria, and later was executed, as shown in a horrific video seen around the world. Jim: The James Foley Story left the audience quiet and, in my case at least, in tears. Then things got still more emotional, as the journalists parents, John and Diane Foley, stood at a lectern and spoke briefly  and with incredible grace  about their son.

I met them afterward and introduced myself to another of their sons, Michael Foley, with whom I had significant phone and email contact last year after he vehemently complained about some of The Timess coverage of his brothers time in prison. He objected, for example, to the description of his brother as an enthusiastic convert to Islam.

I considered his complaints, and others I had heard about, in a Sunday column, and I tried to take on some of the broader, and very thorny, issues involved in covering Americans who have been kidnapped by terrorists. Times coverage broke important ground when Rukmini Callimachi reported that American hostages often suffered because of their governments policy on opposing the payment of ransom.



Many of the same issues arose in the documentary  again, leaving a great deal unanswered and unresolved. Directed by a childhood friend of Mr. Foleys, Brian Oakes, the documentary celebrates the journalists life and his character as a man for others. Relying heavily, and effectively, on family interviews and on those with former hostages imprisoned with Mr. Foley, it gives only a glancing treatment to the role of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Obama administration in failing to secure his release. And, for the most part, it skirts the larger geopolitical issues.

This film leaves a lot of questions, the elder Mr. Foley said afterward. And that, his wife added, was done by design. The Foleys have established a foundation devoted to freeing American citizens imprisoned abroad.

Despite the lingering questions, and its troubling subject matter, the film, which recently won a Sundance award, is certainly worth seeing; it debuts Saturday on HBO.

Separately, it is of the utmost importance that The Times continues to dig deep into ISIS coverage. The executive editor, Dean Baquet, recently told me that this is among his highest priorities for the newsroom in the year ahead.

nytimes.com,2013-03-29 00:00:00,An Officer's Secretly Recorded Words About 'Stop and Frisk' Cause a Firestorm,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Who, exactly, are the right people for the New York Police Department to stop, question and frisk?

Is that frequently used expression actually a racist code for young black and Hispanic men? Or is it simply police shorthand for people whose suspicious activities make them a legitimate target of police attention as they try to reduce the citys crime rate?

Thats one of the questions at the heart of a federal trial that began last week in New York. In recent months, The Times has covered the stop-and-frisk program aggressively, questioning in many articles whether it is enmeshed with the reprehensible practice of racial profiling. And now it is covering the trial.

But one article  a Page 1 story last Friday by Joseph Goldstein  has caused a firestorm of criticism. It has drawn sharp and sustained protests from the Police Department and its legal department, and tough words from sources as diverse as the frequent police critic Leonard Levitt, a former Newsday columnist who writes the NYPD Confidential blog, and Heather Mac Donald, who frequently takes the Police Departments point of view, writing in City Journal, a publication of the Manhattan Institute.

Her assessment: The Timess article has twisted the taped conversation into a poisonous indictment of the police.

Essentially, Mr. Goldsteins article reported that, in at least one police precinct, race is a factor in the directions that street cops get from their supervisors on whom to stop, question and frisk.

Over the past week, Ive considered the complaints of the Police Departments chief spokesman, Paul J. Browne, and from the N.Y.P.D.s legal department. Ive read various articles criticizing the article, heard from readers commenting on it, and talked with the reporter, Mr. Goldstein, and the Metropolitan editor, Carolyn Ryan. Ive also heard the audio of the secretly recorded conversation between Officer Pedro Serrano and his commanding officer, Deputy Inspector Christopher McCormack, and Ive read the transcript.

The essence of the complaint against The Timess story is that, according to Mr. Browne, The article provided a distorted picture of what the interchange between the inspector and a disgruntled, race-baiting cop was all about. Officer Serrano had been criticized for making only two stops in a year, while working in the high-crime 40th Precinct in the South Bronx.

Ms. Ryan provided this response to the criticism in an e-mail (I later talked in person with her and Mr. Goldstein):

To us the story captures the essence of the argument between civil libertarians and the N.Y.P.D.: Are the police using the stop-question-frisk tactic as a blunt instrument to target certain groups of people, or are they acting, as the Supreme Court requires, on reasonable and individualized suspicion? The N.Y.P.D. has repeatedly said publicly that it uses the tactic only when an officer reasonably suspects a person has committed, is committing or is about to commit a crime. But the reality of how that policy is communicated to officers in the station house appears quite different, as the story demonstrates. And in this case, it seems, the commanding officer of a precinct is suggesting an entire demographic be placed under suspicion. The full transcript of the roughly 20-minute conversation shows Officer Serrano, who has been faulted for making too few stops, demanding guidance about whom to stop. He is told by his commanding officer, Inspector McCormack, to stop the right people at the right time, the right location. This is an oft-used N.Y.P.D. description of how the strategy is employed: they frequently talk about the right people or the right stops. It is obviously very vague. At the end of the conversation, Inspector McCormack suggested that, in Mott Haven, given crime patterns there, the officer should stop male blacks 14 to 20, 21. This is not a specific description of suspects, such as black male, 14 to 20, wearing red hoodie and blue sneakers, or black male, known to hang out in xyz location or associate with xyz people. It is an entire demographic. And Inspector McCormack does not appear, on the tape, to be talking about one specific crime for which particular young black males are wanted. He is describing the precincts two biggest categories of felony crime, grand larcenies and robberies, of which there are close to 1,000 a year. And, most significantly, in his course of this lengthy conversation with Officer Serrano, he defines the right people in terms of the broad demographic, rather than by their suspicious conduct  like peering into apartment windows or evading police  which is the only lawful basis for a stop, according to the Supreme Court. To critics of the N.Y.P.D., this is akin to racial profiling. And to us it suggests that the way the departments strategy is communicated to officers is quite different from what N.Y.P.D. brass have described publicly.

Shes right on many counts and says it well. I disagree, however, that the inspector said the officer should stop male blacks, but rather that male blacks were given as an example of those associated with past crimes.

Whats more, the article is not presented as one about how strategy is communicated. Its presented as something close to proof of racial profiling..

Mr. Levitt, for one, does not think it comes close. He wrote on his blog: If federal judge Shira Scheindlin concludes that the NYPDs Stop and Frisk is a racist policy shell need more proof than last weeks testimony of the 40th precincts commanding officer, Deputy Inspector Christopher McCormack.

In a phone interview, Mr. Levitt  who rarely pulls his punches against the Police Department  noted that a front-page article in The Times carries enormous weight, and, he said, to me, there is a much more nuanced picture than the one portrayed there.

The way The Times handled it just seemed unfair to McCormack, he said, given that so much of the violent crime in the city is committed by young, black males. You can yell and scream about the impropriety of what he said, but its true. And the victims are very often black, too.

Mr. Levitt also noted that Inspector McCormack emphasizes  on the recording  that 99 percent of the people in this community are great, hardworking people, who deserve to walk to the train, walk to their car, walk to the store, without becoming crime victims. But that context is dismissed, far down in the article, as something that the inspector is lecturing his subordinate about.

Mr. Browne, the police spokesman, is correct when he says that the description of young black males was tied to specific crimes that had already occurred  the robberies and larcenies in the Mott Haven neighborhood. Note the use of the past tense in Inspector McCormacks exact words: The problem was what, male blacks ... And I told you at roll call, and I have no problem telling you this, male blacks 14 to 20, 21.

On the other side, Ms. Ryan is totally correct when she says that whats left unsaid is crucially important; the inspector never speaks about reasonable suspicion as a basis for possible stops.

Ill offer some final thoughts, but first want to state the obvious:

Racial profiling is not only reprehensible and illegal; its also immoral. No individual should be prejudged as suspicious based on his or her age or the color of his skin. I cant be the judge of whether thats occurring in the context of stop and frisk  a federal trial will try to come to terms with that overarching question over the next month or more.

The Timess article strikes me as essentially accurate. But with its emphasis on one sentence  without enough context  and its presentation on the front page, it comes off as clear proof of racial profiling in the New York Police Department. (And theres no doubt that it was interpreted just that way by a wide variety of readers. The Rev. Al Sharpton quickly demanded Inspector McCormacks suspension, and a Times editorial the next day was headlined Walking While Black in New York.)

The facts, though certainly newsworthy, dont rise to that smoking gun level.",[]

MANCHESTER, N.H.  Heres how we analyzed the fifth Democratic debate, and our live fact checks.









_____

Hillary Clinton has been speaking in public for decades. But in recent days, political observers have called her voice loud, flat, harassing to the ear. They have said she has a decidedly grating pitch and punishing tone and called her shrill.

I think a lot of it with Hillary Clinton has to do with style and delivery, oddly enough, said Bob Woodward, the veteran Washington Post editor, on MSNBC on Wednesday. She shouts, he said, adding that there was something unrelaxed about the way she is communicating.

Mrs. Clinton, who admits she does not have the natural oratory skills of her husband or President Obama, has been tailoring her voice and tone for years. But only in recent days has her speaking style been thrust back into a heated debate about women, sexism and public speaking.

Mrs. Clintons allies berated Mr. Woodward for what they viewed as a gender-based critique of her impassioned tone on the campaign trail, pointing out that the stock in trade of her Democratic rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, were his rousing remarks delivered in forceful tones.

It is 2016 and I cannot believe  cannot believe  we are having this conversation, said Stephanie Schriock, the president of the group Emilys List, which works to elect female candidates, in an interview. If Mrs. Clinton is shouting, what is Bernie Sanders doing? she asked.

Even Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor whose 2004 campaign became immortalized by a widely mocked scream, said the criticism of Mrs. Clinton was sexist. If she were a male and she were making these kinds of speeches, would people be criticizing her? Mr. Dean said on Fox News.

Mrs. Clinton can be partly credited for igniting the debate.

After the first Democratic debate in October, when Mr. Sanders said all the shouting in the world would not fix the countrys problems with gun control, Mrs. Clinton said, sometimes when a woman speaks out, some people think its shouting. The campaign later blasted out that line on Facebook and in fund-raising emails to excite female voters.

Asked Thursday about Mr. Woodwards comments to MSNBC, Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, directed a reporter to the outraged response on social media from many women.

In todays America, when a woman is loud its shouting, when a man yells = enthusiasm. Where am I? Sudan? Joyce Karam, the Washington bureau chief at the Arab newspaper Al-Hayat, wrote on Twitter.

In general, Mr. Fallon said, that type of criticism gets leveled at women more than it does at men.

Privately, even Mrs. Clintons friends and supporters say that lately she does seem to be raising her voice more than usual. The tonal shift came in the waning days of the Iowa caucuses, when Mrs. Clinton displayed a fire-in-the-belly determination on the campaign trail that helped her eke a victory against Mr. Sanders.

It is partly a reflection of the changing nature of Mrs. Clintons events. She devoted the early months of her candidacy to speaking to a handful of voters in round-table discussions, and then shifted to larger town-hall-style events where she took questions and nodded intently as voters asked her about issues like Social Security and climate change.

As the voting in Iowa neared, Mrs. Clinton held larger rallies, drawing hundreds of supporters who chanted and waved her Fighting for Us campaign signs. And because Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state and first lady, believes in the importance of 12-point plans, rather than sweeping campaign promises, she often raises her voice when mentioning arcane policy points, which can seem jarring to people unfamiliar with her delivery.

Its called an inversion, but I call it a perversion! is one of Mrs. Clintons favorite lines, referring to the complicated loophole that allows corporations to avoid paying taxes.

And Im going to invest in infrastructure! she often says, lifting her vocal reach as she promises to rebuild roads and bridges and construct high-speed railways.

She grows forceful when emphasizing that the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory legislation includes a provision to break up the big banks, something Mr. Sanders has called for through reinstating the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act. Folks, we already have the authority in Dodd-Frank, Mrs. Clinton says, bringing her voice back down to a near whisper.

In settings such as a forum on CNN on Wednesday and in the Democratic debates, Mrs. Clinton seems comfortable, able to string together paragraphs of complex policy talk off the cuff. But that does not always come through when she speaks to large groups, public speaking experts said.

Theres a lot of wisdom to the old adage that you almost garner more attention when you whisper, said Terri Sjodin, a public speaking consultant based in Newport Beach, Calif. But theres an adrenaline that gets high when youre in a large venue, an auditorium, and a natural tendency to shout or get louder.

In some ways, the debate over Mrs. Clintons speaking style is a reflection of the larger phenomenon of her candidacy  and that she is the first woman to have a serious shot at becoming a major political partys presidential nominee.

Some research suggests women can be competent or likable, but not both, said Denise Graveline, a former aide in the Clinton administration and the author of The Eloquent Womans Guide to Moderating Panels. She pointed to the 1984 election, when Geraldine Ferraro, the first female vice-presidential candidate, struggled to find the right tenor.

Ms. Ferraro lacked the credibility of a male candidate, adopted a stronger, more masculine style that may have suited her less, Ms. Graveline said.

The tendency to yell on the campaign stump is not gender specific, but the public is much less accustomed to hearing a womans voice in such settings, said Ruth Sherman, a public speaking coach who advises chief executives and celebrities.

Youve got a whole generation of new voters who have never heard her in this way before, Ms. Sherman said of Mrs. Clinton.

But, she added, the former secretary of state, like many public figures male and female, could afford to work on her delivery.

She tends to substitute volume for expression, Ms. Sherman said.",[]

nytimes.com,2016-02-26 00:00:00,Bruni and Douthat Agree: #OscarsSoPolitical,"['The End', 'Frank Bruni', 'The Conversation', 'Ross Douthat', 'The Great Divide', 'Errol Morris', 'All Contributors']","ROSS DOUTHAT: Frank, its a pleasure to once again be together to talk about the glorious silliness of the Oscars, and a special pleasure to engage in some prognostication that doesnt involve the outcome of either presidential primary. (It wont be Trump it wont be Trump la la la la la la I cant heaaar you.)

FRANK BRUNI: The prognostication, as you put it, may not involve Donald Trump, but before the Oscar ceremony is over, it will involve him  somehow, some way. Hes shown a knack for hijacking every news cycle, every conversation. Maybe he goes on the attack against the statuette, says its too little, a loser, low energy. He promises not only to make America great again, but to upsize Oscar and make it gleam again.

DOUTHAT: In our own quest for greatness, lets start at the bottom, with the lowest form of Hollywood life  our fellow writers. The Oscar for best original screenplay seems guaranteed to go to Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer for Spotlight. Thats a worthy enough choice.

BRUNI: I agree that it will win, and I agree that its worthy.

Photo

DOUTHAT: But if I had a vote, I would give it to Alex Garland for Ex Machina  a knotty, twisty little dose of sci-fi/war-between-the-sexes poison thats more genuinely original than its competition. (To dip a toe into troubled #OscarsSoWhite waters, Ryan Cooglers Creed probably deserved a nomination in this category more than Straight Outta Compton, whose spine was very biopic-conventional, notwithstanding its convention-smashing subjects.)

BRUNI: The winner should be Inside Out, for the sheer audacity of its imagination. It turns the human psyche into animation and makes observations about the delicate balance of the human ecosystem that graver, more somber movies havent managed half as well. Im hoping for a sequel focused exclusively on Trumps emotional ecosystem. Rated R and titled The Id of the Deal, it would play only in Imax-3D and never be dubbed or subtitled in Spanish.

DOUTHAT: In best adapted screenplay, Id bet on Charles Randolph and Adam McKay for The Big Short, which does an interesting job of translating Michael Lewiss complicated story to the screen. Interesting, but to my mind a little smug and showy, which is why Im rooting for the more modest but also nearly flawless Brooklyn. Yes, its hard to explain mortgage-backed securities in a screenplay, but adapting a Colm Toibin novel strikes me as a harder task over all than adapting Lewiss movie-friendly prose, and I think the (very un-Toibin like) Nick Hornby aced it.

BRUNI: Im glad you mentioned Nick Hornby because I think hes emerged as one of the nimblest, most assured screenwriters working today and because Brooklyn, interestingly, marks the third time in a short span that hes been the deft teller of a woman-centric story. He adapted the memoir Wild and, before that, An Education. All three screenplays reflect a brisk, unpretentious style. Hes efficient in the best possible way.

But Id give best adapted screenplay to the movie that I, like you, predict as the winner: The Big Short. You say that Lewiss prose is movie-friendly, and its certainly terrific prose, but Im struck by the way that his books had to be sliced, distilled and reconfigured very aggressively to become movies. Thats true not just of The Big Short but also of Moneyball (my favorite of these adaptations ) and even The Blind Side, which in book form was as much about the peculiarities of modern football as it was about the Southern-fried pluck of a woman later played by La Bullock gone blond.

Can we move to people much more interesting than writers? (That could include anyone, really  film editors, sound technicians, you name it.) Lets talk about best supporting actress and the absurdity of this years nominees. Rooney Mara (Carol) is a lead. Alicia Vikander (The Danish Girl) is a lead. Kate Winslet, a superb actress, has a now-you-hear-it, now-you-dont Polish accent in Steve Jobs. Rachel McAdams barely has a character to play in Spotlight. You mentioned Brooklyn, and Id vote for the spirited, perfect performance that Julie Walters gave in that movie, but she wasnt nominated. So Ill root for Jennifer Jason Leigh in The Hateful Eight, though I think Vikander will win, partly for her astonishing work in Ex Machina.

DOUTHAT: I, too, expect Vikander to win for supporting Eddie Redmaynes Bruce Jenner  er, sorry, Einar Wegener in the transition into womanhood. And if we can count it as a twofer for The Danish Girl and Ex Machina, I suppose we can pretend that its deserved. But the fact that Vikander was nominated for the mediocre period-transgender drama and not the great little sci-fi part is a good example of what drives so much discontent with the Oscars  some of the racial discontent included.

Sonny Bunch had a good piece about this recently for The Washington Post, in which he cited Redmayne  an almost-automatic winner as Stephen Hawking last year, an automatic nominee as a sex-change pioneer this year  as a case study in how so many Oscar nominees just feel, well, engineered, to the point where you can guess who will be nominated for a supposedly merit-based award without having seen a second of that persons performance.

As Bunch notes, this squeezes out all sorts of interesting performances and movies (including many that his fellow conservatives, and mine, tend to favor). But for black actors, specifically, it means that Oscar glory can be theirs (and often is) only so long as theyre making a Very Serious Movie thats somehow about their race  and more ideally, about slavery, or Jim Crow, or both.

BRUNI: Im going to give you a pass on that unnecessary Jenner joke because I think you make some excellent points about the academys attitude toward performances by black actors. But the academy is a small part of a larger problem, which is that were still not seeing black actors nearly often enough in meaty roles that could be played by performers of any race. Denzel Washington has been cast in a few of those, but who else? I think the Internet buzzed with so much excitement about the suggestion of Idris Elba as the next James Bond because theres an ever more widespread recognition that Bond and Bond-style parts neednt always go to white actors. A Clancy protagonist, a Bourne analogue or an Indiana Jones could (and occasionally should) be played by a black actor. And the same goes for black women, who rarely get the sorts of roles reserved for the Bullocks, Anistons and Witherspoons of the movie world. #OscarsSoWhite because #BigPartsSoWhite.

Oscar Favorites vs. Predictions Should win Key: Will win Frank Bruni Ross Douthat Ex Machina Inside Out WRITING (ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY) Spotlight Spotlight Brooklyn The Big Short WRITING (ADAPTED SCREENPLAY) The Big Short The Big Short Alicia Vikander, Ex Machina (not nominated) Jennifer Jason Leigh, The Hateful Eight SUPPORTING ACTRESS Alicia Vikander, The Danish Girl Alicia Vikander, The Danish Girl Tom Hardy, The Revenant Mark Rylance, Bridge of Spies SUPPORTING ACTOR Mark Rylance, Bridge of Spies Sylvester Stallone, Creed Matt Damon, The Martian Matt Damon, The Martian LEAD ACTOR Leonardo DiCaprio, The Revenant Leonardo DiCaprio, The Revenant Brie Larson, Room Brie Larson, Room LEAD ACTRESS Brie Larson, Room Brie Larson, Room George Miller, Mad Max: Fury Road Adam McKay, The Big Short DIRECTING Alejandro G. Inarritu, The Revenant George Miller, Mad Max: Fury Road Room and Mad Max: Fury Road (tie) Spotlight BEST PICTURE The Big Short The Big Short

DOUTHAT: I agree, and I think thats a big part of why it frustrated so many people that Michael B. Jordan didnt get nominated for Creed, or Elba for Beasts of No Nation. Here were actors in movies  one of them a big hit  that were about black people as people, good or bad, not just as martyrs under white oppression, and the academy apparently didnt have time for them.

Anyway, onward to best supporting actor, where Creed has its one nominee  Sylvester Stallone, an underrated actor, and the betting favorite. Im not going to bet on him, though, because I suspect the controversy will make voters wary of rewarding the white star of a movie whose African-American lead and director were snubbed.

BRUNI: I think youre wrong about Stallone, and hell get the statuette because Oscar voters sentimentalism will prevail.

DOUTHAT: Maybe! But Ill bet on Mark Rylance, the oddsmakers second choice, even though (confession!) Bridge of Spies looked like a Spielbergian snooze, and I havent even seen it. And then my pick for the rightful winner is Tom Hardy in The Revenant.

BRUNI: I did see Rylance in Bridge of Spies, which had a great first half and a ho-hum second half, and in my opinion hes the rightful winner, not Hardy, who, in The Revenant, gives a performance like those he did in The Drop (which was terrific and underrated) and Warrior (which is even more terrific and underrated). Its technically and formally dazzling, but its also mannered and somewhat inaccessible.

Lets take a short break from the acting awards and look at best director. Some Oscar pundits are persuaded that George Miller will win for Mad Max: Fury Road, in what would be a combined recognition of career achievement and the difficulty of choreographing action sequences this busy. Others predict a second trophy in a row for Alejandro G. Inarritu, for The Revenant, while there are still others who believe Tom McCarthy (Spotlight) will take home the prize.

Photo

DOUTHAT: Now that the Oscars allow more than five nominations for best picture, you can usually use best director snubs to figure out which best picture nominees dont have a chance  which is bad news for The Martian, Brooklyn and Bridge of Spies. (I liked The Martian less than most people, for reasons we kicked around last fall, but I did think highly of Scotts work.) And then, of course, the actual winner of the best director statue is usually a big, fat indicator of which movie will actually take home the biggest prize.

In this case, though, it wouldnt be a complete surprise if the two awards diverged, because giving the ancient Miller the statue for his insane and insanely impressive choreography in Fury Road would be a good way to garland that movie without stooping (as academy voters might think of it) to giving a post-apocalyptic chase movie best picture.

BRUNI: I remain stunned that Ridley Scott wasnt nominated for The Martian, which is some of the best work hes ever done, and without him in the category, I cast my personal vote for Adam McKay, who contrived the right tempo, tone and camera angles to turn arcane financial shenanigans into populist comedy and drama in The Big Short. My best guess, though, is that Miller notches this victory.

DOUTHAT: As I say I wouldnt be surprised if Miller won, and I hope he will, since I think Oscars should go whenever possible to filmmakers who show us something extraordinary, unexpected, new. But the safe money is still on Inarritu, because The Revenant has a clearer shot at best picture and because (like most of his films) its directed within an inch of its life, with all kinds of complicated set pieces and unexpected camera angles. For better or worse, you can always feel him working, even sweating, to set up every shot  and I suspect that sweat will be rewarded.

Which brings us to best actor, where Inarritus star, Leonardo DiCaprio, is about to follow in the footsteps of his frequent mentor, Martin Scorsese, and finally win an Oscar for a role that isnt even close to his best work (or the best work in the movie, where hes overshadowed by Hardy). Its not the most impressive roster of nominees, so his winning doesnt bother me that much, but its still a little disappointing to see Leo finally rewarded for yet another entry in his grunting, scowling, (in this case) bearded attempts to bury his boy-wonder good looks and prove that hes a Grown-Up Actor. When the reality is that while hes ... fine in these kind of roles, his greatness lies elsewhere, in movies like Catch Me If You Can, The Great Gatsby and The Wolf of Wall Street, where he plays the charming man-child to the hilt.

BRUNI: I think this naysaying about DiCaprio has gone too far. Is The Revenant the pinnacle of his career and of the best actor category this year? Probably not. A little grunting in the snow and grimacing in a shallow grave go a long way. I was exhausted and exasperated by him and the movie in the end.

Photo

Still, when he wins this Oscar  which he will  Ill be fine with that, though Id actually prefer, and vote for, Matt Damon. Its so easy to be impressed by showy suffering like DiCaprios, but what Damon does in those many scenes in The Martian when hes creating a video diary from Mars  and talking directly to the camera  is arguably trickier. How to make it persuasive, natural? How to weave that comic touch into a desperate situation? Hes tonally perfect and preternaturally engaging. The movie not only depends on him, it works as well as it does because of him.

DOUTHAT: Id probably vote for Matt Damon, too, since he had to sell that story almost single-handedly. But if you want the Oscar, it seems, you need to grow a beard and fight a bear.

BRUNI: I dont know about that. Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin spent nearly an entire movie  much longer than the one (incredible) sequence in The Revenant  fleeing and fighting a bear in The Edge, and they didnt even get nominations. But maybe thats because they grow their beards only as the movie proceeds and as their time in the wilderness lengthens. Its some hairy-come-lately disqualification.

The best actress category this year includes three performances that are magnificent and deserving of Oscars: Cate Blanchett in Carol, Saoirse Ronan in Brooklyn and Brie Larson in Room. You and I havent talked previously about Carol, which had a few glaring and puzzling flaws, chief among them the inscrutability of Maras thinly drawn character. But Carol was, for me, immensely moving. It avoided the issue-movie trap of sententiousness while communicating the sadness and injustice of a bigoted culture standing in the way of two womens happiness. And it had a stirring romantic spirit that so many other movies labor and fail to achieve.

DOUTHAT: If the best actor crop seemed thin to me, the best actress field is incredibly rich. I share your take on the quality of Blanchetts and Ronans work.

BRUNI: But Blanchett will rightly lose to Larson, who has been given the meatiest role in this category and takes full, harrowing advantage of it.

Photo

DOUTHAT: I also really enjoyed Jennifer Lawrence in the unjustly underrated Joy  that was a star-quality turn, whatever you thought of the story that surrounded it. And I rather wish that Charlize Theron had been nominated for carrying Mad Max and putting every other lady action hero in her shade.

But in the end I agree: It has to be Larson, who gave the rawest performance of the year in its darkest fairy tale.

And Theron and Larson together provide a pivot to the final prize, best picture, because their movies were this years yin and yang for me  Therons big and wild and better than just about every other overhyped blockbuster put together, Larsons claustrophobic and intimate and shot through with terrible emotion. Neither one is likely to win the Oscar: The race, everyone seems to agree, is between The Revenant, The Big Short and Spotlight.

BRUNI: This is a fascinating year in terms of the mixed signals sent over the pre-Oscar period. The Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture (Drama) went to The Revenant. But the Screen Actors Guild gave the equivalent of its best picture award to Spotlight. The Producers Guild went for The Big Short.

I think the race is really between Spotlight and The Big Short, because The Revenant would be a second-year-in-a-row win for a movie directed by Inarritu, and its just not good enough for that. Plus Spotlight and The Big Short both do two things Oscar voters love: They employ lots of actors in talky, meaty parts, and they appeal to Hollywoods liberal moral vanity. Spotlight does this by justly flogging the Catholic Church, and the fact that the movie was recently screened at the Vatican could give it the decisive edge over The Big Short.

DOUTHAT: Ill go out on a limb and predict that The Big Short will steal it, in a directing/best picture split.

BRUNI: I am so angry at you, Ross. I am livid! Because I was waiting to shock our readers with my own pick of The Big Short to win best picture, and now youve stolen my thunder. Bad Ross!

DOUTHAT: Well, if I had my way it would be a dead heat, a shared statue, for Room and Mad Max: Fury Road. No matter who wins, thats the pair that Ill remember.

BRUNI: Im as much a fan of Room as you are, but if I had my way, the statue would go to Spotlight, just because it fires so perfectly on all cylinders: storytelling, acting, worthy subject matter. But Im sticking with The Big Short as my prediction. Income inequality and Wall Street shenanigans are issues much more of this exact moment than is sexual abuse in the church; you could argue that The Big Short is a companion piece to Bernie Sanderss populist uprising. Never mind that The Big Short turns the very financial speculators who profited from other peoples lost homes into underdog heroes  nifty trick, that! It concludes on a shaming note, with sweeping observations about the ways in which the stock market and the banking system are corrupt and rigged, eventually victimizing middle-class Americans. I think right now, in the midst of an intensifying presidential campaign, Hollywood voters will find that message as irresistible as New Hampshire and South Carolina voters found Trump. There you go, Ross. One more, last mention of your political hero.

DOUTHAT: Thanks for nothing, Frank.

BRUNI: Youre welcome.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-01-15 00:00:00,Lopping Off Stars for Per Se: The Back Story,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","The ending of Pete Wellss review of Per Se, the glittering restaurant atop the Time Warner Center, summed up his findings memorably:

Its possible to pass an entire meal in this no-fun house without a single unpleasant incident apart from the presentation of the check. The gas flames in the glass-walled hearth are a cheerful sight, and the view of Central Parks tree line past Columbuss marble head is an unbeatable urban panorama. But are they enough? Is Per Se worth the time and money?

In the last sentence, Mr. Wells answered his own question: In and of itself, no. The review downgraded Per Se from four to two stars. (As a result, only five of the citys restaurants now bear the top star rating: Del Posto; Le Bernardin; Jean-Georges; Sushi Nakazawa; and Eleven Madison Park.)

Soon, the review had over 1,000 comments, some expressing what the food editor, Sam Sifton, terms populist schadenfreude  a sense that a negative review somehow is a well-deserved comeuppance for the 1 percent and their dining choices. Others, like Susan Miller, had something to say about income inequality: Well, Ive been on the fence for a while now, but this column has helped me make up my mind. Im voting for Bernie Sanders!

I talked with Mr. Wells and Mr. Sifton on Thursday about the reaction to the review and the issues it raises for readers, including the whole idea of paying attention to restaurants where a dinner bill for four people came to $3,000.

Mr. Wells, who makes it a point to visit all levels of restaurants  including, recently, Senor Frogs in Times Square  told me that he takes no pleasure in writing a negative review. (Though surely a line like this must have given him some satisfaction: I dont know what could have saved limp, dispiriting yam dumplings, but it definitely wasnt a lukewarm matsutake mushroom bouillon as murky and appealing as bong water. And his brilliant pan of Guy Fieris Times Square restaurant, which went viral in 2012, certainly exuded a sense of fun, even though he told me at the time that it was anything but.)

Meanwhile, the actress Dana Delany wondered, on Twitter, if the review didnt create some opportunistic glee at The Times. But Mr. Wells said he certainly didnt feel that way.

Its not a joy ride, he told me. Theres an awful lot of hair-pulling. We really squeezed every word just to make sure that it was exactly what I meant to say and to consider fairness. He said he was aware of the pain that its going to cause among Per Ses staff, owners and management.

Mr. Wells made it clear that he had thought a great deal about what he does for a living, and how the most expensive restaurants fit in.

If were going to cover restaurants at all, we have a duty to cover the most expensive and the most acclaimed, he said. There are people who save their money to go to a place like this, and they should know what level of service and quality they will find.

Mr. Wells said he sometimes received emails from people who live outside New York who want to have one splurge.

Naturally, he said, they look at restaurants that have received four stars with the idea that this is the best you can get.

He also understands that the subject of food often has moral overtones because it is such a stark reminder of those who go hungry around the world.

But, he noted, people spend as much on many other things without censure.

Ive never seen the same level of finger-wagging about stereo components or laptops, he told me. If one accepts that travel and culture are legitimate topics of coverage (and of spending), he said, then food and restaurants are, too.

Mr. Sifton, who was one of two Times critics (the other was Frank Bruni) who gave Per Se four stars in previous years, told me that it was important to revisit the top-rated restaurants. We cant simply anoint a place and walk away forever, he said.

And, he pointed out, cost versus value is at the center of what Mr. Wells wrote. He, too, has made this calculation  once, very memorably, with a review of Nello on the Upper East Side, which he called in our conversation a hedge-fund diner.

We rated it fair, he said, but really I wanted to rate it unfair.

Mr. Sifton said that reviews of expensive restaurants come in for more than their share of criticism because eating is such a universal experience.

Not everybody wants to go to the opera, but everybody eats and goes to some sort of restaurant, he said.

Heres my take: Mr. Wells does his job responsibly and often entertainingly, and its completely legitimate for The Times to pay attention to restaurants, including the most expensive ones, just as it does to high culture of all kinds.

That kind of coverage may not be the papers core mission, of course. Ive written previously that Id like to see more consistent attention paid to societys (and the citys) have-nots.

After all, theres a lot more in The Times about wealth management and penthouse hunting than there is about homelessness  and yes, hunger.

While theres room for improvement in that mix, I appreciate what Mr. Wells does and how he does it. More so, this week at least, than the people at Per Se probably do.",[]
nytimes.com,2015-03-25 00:00:00,A Water Dilemma in Michigan: Cloudy or Costly?,['Mitch Smith'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

FLINT, Mich.  Depending on the day, Melissa Mays says, the water flowing out of her homes faucets might have a blue tint. Or it might smell like mothballs. Or it might fill her home with the scent of an overchlorinated swimming pool.









Lately, Ms. Mays, who is 36 and works in marketing, has not been turning on her tap much at all. After Flint changed the source of its drinking water last spring, Ms. Mays said, she noticed a change in the waters color and odor. Then she started having rashes, and clumps of her hair fell out. When the city issued a boil order, she stopped using the water for drinking and cooking. Now her family spends roughly $400 a month on bottled water.

My cat gets bottled water, our plants get bottled water, our fish gets bottled water, said Ms. Mays, who has helped organize marches to protest the water conditions and is on a city commission seeking input on how to move forward. It takes four to five bottles of water to fill up a pot for spaghetti.

Flint officials insist that the citys water is safe. They say that the issues of odor and color are separate from the question of whether the water meets federal standards, and that no link to health problems has been proved.

Photo

We understand the concerns about discoloration and odors, said Gerald Ambrose, Flints state-appointed emergency manager. We tell everyone who complains that we would be more than happy to come out to their house and test their water.

Mr. Ambroses position hints at deeper issues in Flint. Though the city has not declared bankruptcy, it has been in state receivership since 2011 and has deep-seated financial problems, which Mr. Ambrose was appointed to help untangle. Add to that a plummeting population and violent crime rates that rank among the nations worst, and the water question becomes one headache among many.

The problems, almost everyone agrees, started shortly after the city, in an effort to save money, switched from the supply of treated Lake Huron water it had long purchased from Detroit and started drawing water from the Flint River, treating it locally.

On Monday, Flints City Council voted to do all things necessary to reconnect to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Mr. Ambroses response was swift. Flint water today is safe by all federal and state standards, he said in a statement Tuesday. Water from Detroit is no safer than water from Flint, he said. Users also pay some of the highest rates in the state because of the decreased numbers of users and the age of the system.

A sign downtown still refers to Flint as Vehicle City. Older residents recall growing up in a place that 200,000 people called home, where good-paying jobs in the General Motors factories were plentiful. Today, many of the auto plants are gone, the population is below 100,000, and once-prosperous neighborhoods are dotted with abandoned homes and vacant lots.

Photo

As Flint has shrunk, its network of water pipes built for a much larger metropolis has deteriorated. With fewer customers, water sometimes languishes in the system, becoming discolored. Moreover, water bills in Flint are far higher than those in neighboring communities. Officials say the switch away from Detroit water saves the city $12 million a year.

Its a very sore point, particularly when you have a population with a high degree of low-income folks, Mr. Ambrose said. To me, the conversation we need to be having is, how do we lower those rates?

Some residents say they would rather not debate the cost until they are confident that the water is safe. When fecal coliform bacteria showed up in parts of the city last summer, residents were told to boil their water before using it. Officials addressed the issue by pumping extra chlorine into the system, but in solving one problem, they created another.

The high chlorine levels led to elevated levels of total trihalomethanes or T.T.H.M., which required another public notice in January. Residents will again receive a notice of elevated T.T.H.M. levels in the mail later this month, Mayor Dayne Walling has said. Long-term consumption of water with high T.T.H.M. levels can lead to liver or kidney troubles and an increased risk of cancer, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Some here say Flint had been on the verge of a rebound when the water problems started. The walkable downtown area, just steps from the University of Michigans campus here, is now home to the Flint Crepe Company and other new restaurants. And perhaps most significant, the emergency manager was expected to leave office in the coming weeks, handing power back to the elected mayor and City Council.

We continue to deal with a number of longstanding challenges with concentrated poverty and high crime and expensive, old infrastructure, said Mr. Walling, a Flint native who returned to his hometown after studying at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar. But were now 30 years past the major General Motors plant closings in the 1980s, and people are ready to move forward, so the new problems with water have been a huge setback. Mr. Walling said he and his family drank city water.

Mr. Walling and Mr. Ambrose conceded that communication should have been better when water problems emerged. But they say the city is reaching out to residents and answering questions. Officials installed a T.T.H.M. monitor at the treatment plant and hired a consulting firm to suggest improvements there, and they have asked state and federal officials for help. They also note that the switch to the Flint River is not permanent. A new pipeline connecting Flint to Lake Huron is expected to be completed next year.

Many in Flint, though, seem unconvinced. Saterra Hill, 17, a health sciences major at the University of Michigan-Flint, said she and her father purchased several gallon jugs of water each month instead of drinking tap water. Vernon White, 57, said he often bought soda to avoid the water.

For many, the water issue stirs emotions. On a recent weekday afternoon, dozens of people filled the basement of the citys transportation center for a meeting of a water advisory committee.

Tony Palladeno Jr., who arrived at the meeting in a red Flint baseball cap, was escorted out by a police officer for repeated outbursts. Mr. Palladeno, 53, keeps a bottle of yellowish water with a layer of sediment that he said came out of his tap in January. He said local officials had not acted quickly enough to fix the problems.

I dont feel hopeful, Mr. Palladeno said. At one time, I loved this town. I still love it. Theres good people here. But the governing is killing us. I think we need a federal intervention.",[]
nytimes.com,2013-04-01 00:00:00,Gender Questions Arise in Obituary of Rocket Scientist and Her Beef Stroganoff,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Yvonne Brills accomplishments as a scientist made her a natural subject for a Times obituary last weekend. Those staff-written obituaries, which recognize only the tiniest fraction of people who die on a given day, are intended not as tributes but as news stories of those who lived highly distinctive lives.

When this particular obituary appeared online Saturday, though, it caused many readers to do a double-take because of its emphasis on Mrs. Brills domestic life.

When it initially appeared online and in the first print edition, the first two paragraphs read as follows:

She made a mean beef stroganoff, followed her husband from job to job and took eight years off from work to raise three children. The worlds best mom, her son Matthew said. But Yvonne Brill, who died on Wednesday at 88 in Princeton, N.J., was also a brilliant rocket scientist who in the early 1970s invented a propulsion system to keep communications satellites from slipping out of their orbits.

Many people responded negatively to what they saw as sexism.

Typical was this Twitter message from Aaron Bady:

Hey, @Sulliview whats up with that disgraceful obituary for Yvonne Brill? was also a brilliant rocket scientist? For real?

Others, like Amy Alexander and Ron Charles  humorously but with an edge  wanted The Times to know how they would like to be remembered when the time comes.

For the record, please note that my #Obit Dish is my mean penne farfalle with zucchini. Just #FYI @nyt @JAWS @sulliview

Dear NYT, just in case youre prewriting obits of obscure book critics, everybody says I make delicious chocolate chip cookies.

Amy Davidson, a senior editor at The New Yorker who writes its Close Read blog, said on Twitter that it was striking how Mrs. Brills work was both mentioned and somehow invisible, given the emphasis in the obituary. Ms. Davidson also noted that the eight years off from work apparently wasnt entirely the case; Mrs. Brill continued to work part time as a consultant during those years, the obituary said further down.

Later on Saturday, after the flurry of negative attention, the culinary reference dropped out and some other language changed in the online version of the obituary. And when it appeared in later print editions, its first paragraph still mentioned her family life but also included her profession, and the beef stroganoff was nowhere to be found. (Its not unusual for The Times to make changes to articles online. When a factual error is corrected, that is drawn to the readers attention, but otherwise, incremental changes are not generally noted.)

This didnt satisfy everyone:

Julie Rehmeyer, a freelance science writer from New Mexico, e-mailed:

The change in the lede for Yvonne Brills obituary only makes it worse, in my opinion. Yes, the original reference to beef stroganoff was inappropriate in the extreme  but having any reference to her parenting or spouse in the first paragraph of her obituary is also inappropriate. Fixing the beef stroganoff reference without fixing the misguided nature of the article as a whole doesnt solve the problem; it minimizes it through its insufficiency. An additional problem with the article is mentioning the Diamond Superwoman award immediately after her National Medal of Technology and Innovation, as if the two awards were comparable.

You can see the changes on NewsDiffs.

Others disagreed with those who complained.

Jennifer King, a journalism student who is studying obituaries for her masters thesis at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, wrote to me:

I feel Mr Martin was subtly pointing out the irony of a woman in that era not only being a remarkable scientist but also a great wife and mother. The reference to her cooking was, I believe, to add context to Mrs. Brills extraordinary achievements in an era where women were not encouraged to be anything other than Domestic Goddesses. Anyway, I think it has been an all round learning experience for everyone and has drawn attention to the art of obituary writing, which cant be a bad thing! Best of all, while some may be critical of the obituary, at least we now all know about Yvonne Brill, which must be a positive outcome, dont you agree?

This all may seem to be a tempest in a Crock-Pot, but it actually raises some significant questions related to gender  which is under much discussion at a time when Sheryl Sandbergs Lean In has hit the top of the nonfiction best-seller list.

When its highly unusual for a woman to do what she did professionally, to what extent does that merit notice? Should gender be ignored in a profile or obituary? Should it be treated as the main event?

A recent article in Columbia Journalism Review gives guidelines for writing about women in this context. Curtis Brainard quotes the science writer Christie Aschwanden, who objects to journalism about women in science that treats its subjects sex as her most defining detail.

I talked to William McDonald, the obituaries editor, on Monday morning about the reaction.

Im surprised, he said. It never occurred to us that this would be read as sexist. He said it was important for obituaries to put people in the context of their time and that this well-written obituary did that effectively. He also observed that the references in the first paragraph to cooking and being a mother served as an effective setup for the aha of the second paragraph, which revealed that Mrs. Brill was an important scientist.

Mr. McDonald said that he was consulted about the changes on Saturday night by editors who were working then and who believed that the negative reaction should be listened to. But, he said, he would have preferred to leave the obituary as it was.

The Times clearly would never have written about Mrs. Brill if her major accomplishments had been merely or mostly domestic, he noted. It was her role as a scientist that made the obituary worth doing, and that caused it to be displayed as the lead obituary in Sundays paper.

The writer, Douglas Martin, described himself as just so full of admiration for this woman, in all respects.

I was totally captivated by her story, he said, and he looked for a way to tell it in as interesting a way as possible. The negative reaction is unwarranted, he said  a result of people who didnt read the obituary fully but reacted only to what they saw on Twitter about the opening paragraph.

It hasnt changed his mind about how he wrote it: I wouldnt do anything differently.

Heres my take: It was fine for the obituary to point out how unusual it was for a woman to be a successful rocket scientist at midcentury and what the obstacles were.

And the way she handled her role as a wife and mother certainly had a place, given the era in which she did her work. Cultural context is important.

But if Yvonne Brills life was worth writing about because of her achievements, and all agree that it was, then the glories of her beef stroganoff should have been little more than a footnote.

The emphasis on her domesticity  and, more important, the obituarys overall framing as a story about gender  had the effect of undervaluing what really landed Mrs. Brill on the Times obituaries page: her groundbreaking scientific work.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-02-10 00:00:00,"When Women Fire Back, Are They 'Ferocious'? When Is a Critic a Scold?","['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Last week, The Times prominently displayed an analysis piece which explored the matter of sexist language and speech in the presidential campaign. Through interviews and other research, it showed how negative words such as shrill or shouting have been applied to Hillary Clinton, but not to her male rivals.

The piece was well reported and an interesting read. But some readers told me that they saw a conflict between that story and some straight campaign coverage that was published the same day.

An article on the fifth Democratic debate depicted Mrs. Clinton lobbing her harshest assault yet in the campaign. She appeared tense and even angry. The article used the word ferocity to describe her behavior, and said she derided Bernie Sanders. By contrast, Mr. Sanders kept his cool. His remarks were well-honed.

Teresa Kopec, a reader, wrote to me, objecting to the choice of words in the debate news coverage. She saw the debate as spirited but respectful on both sides, and found the language choice offensive.

Ms. Kopec wrote: Compare and contrast the words used to describe Mr. Sanders and Ms. Clinton. Sanders: cool, reiterated, well honed. Clinton: harshest, cutting, vitriol, deriding and tense. This is ridiculous. The NYT ought to be ashamed.

The journalist and author Rebecca Traister, who perceptively took up some of the gender issues in the presidential campaign in a recent New York magazine column, told me that she was struck by this, too.

There is no imaginative room for another read like she finally took the gloves off, or was forceful, or impassioned or drove home her point. Theres simply no room for this to have been anything other than a screwup that people will hate her for because she was unhinged. Meanwhile, our babysitter came in this morning and said, THAT was a relief! She finally told him off! I have been waiting for that! but the idea that anyone could have a positive reaction to a loud woman is beyond the scope of imagination.

And, Ms. Traister said, this depiction was especially irritating given Mr. Sanderss characteristic impassioned demeanor: He is always loud and combative.

A few days later, another gender-related issue brought reader mail. A headline on an article about two longtime feminists urging young women to support Mrs. Clinton read as follows: Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright Scold Young Women Backing Bernie Sanders. (The online headline has been changed and now reads, Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright Rebuke Young Women Backing Bernie Sanders.)

A reader, Dora OShaughnessy of Charlotte, N.C., wrote:

Scold? Nothing like treating these two amazing trailblazers like nagging old harpies. It feels like the person who wrote the headline is framing this like a catfight. The word criticize would not have been so offensive.

Another reader, Nadine Berrini, agreed: If the former secretary of state was a man, would your headline writer have chosen the word scold? I doubt it. Given the earlier article on gender and language, she observed: Right hand not talking to the left, it seems.

I took up the criticism with Philip B. Corbett, the standards editor, who writes the After Deadline blog on style and usage in The Times, and is the resident expert on language.

We have to be very aware of the perception of sexism and the impression that women are described differently, he said.

At times, Mr. Corbett said, it is more perception than reality. With a word like scold, we have many, many examples, he said, of the word being applied to men, including male candidates. However, he said, in describing women, it may carry a different tone and we really need to be sensitive to that. And, he said, perception matters; one cant simply blame readers for somehow reading it wrong.

Similarly, readers sometimes complain about descriptions of womens appearance in articles. In fact, Mr. Corbett noted, mens appearance is often noted, too, but the long history of defining and judging women by their appearance may mean that these descriptions are read differently.

As for the language in the debate story  derided for Mrs. Clinton, and reiterated for Mr. Sanders  he sees such reportorial interpretation as legitimate. But he had a caveat. Its largely what readers are paying us for, the ability of our reporters to be able to characterize what they are observing, he said. But, he said, We have to be aware that we gravitate to writing about conflict. That, he emphasized, can sometimes go too far.

Heres my take: The Times is obviously aware of the gender pitfalls, especially in a presidential campaign with a prominent female candidate, and generally avoids overtly sexist language or framing. (And yes, Bernie Sanders supporters, I know! I am well aware that Mrs. Clinton has nothing to complain about in terms of the relative amount of attention she has received in The Times; I happen to agree with you on that, and have pointed it out several times.)

But in articles where gender plays a role  just as in those involving race  unconscious framing needs attention, too. Cultural biases can creep in unannounced and should firmly be shown the door. Greater awareness (you could even call it consciousness-raising) would help.

Forceful, after all, doesnt have to equal ferocious. And a scold may just be someone whose passion is showing.",[]

Photo

There is a photograph of my father and grandfather, taken on Sunday, Aug. 27, 1939, at a spot overlooking the Rhine above the Lorelei Rock, where the chasm of the river tightens and the quickened flow makes a murmuring sound, which has mystical resonance for the Germans.

My dad had emigrated to Canada in 1934. He was in Germany that summer visiting his parents for the first time in five years. His name was Hermann, but even his German friends called him Billy. My grandfather was Heinrich, but his Anglo-Irish wife called him Bobs.

They had come out from Frankfurt, on a Sunday jaunt, in a little car that my father had borrowed from a friend. Their lives were insecure, jangled by history, and dressing well was very important to them. They always had to be perfectly tailored and groomed, as they are in the photo. Bobs ordered suits he really couldnt afford from his English tailor in Hamburg. The American soft-collared shirt hes wearing in the picture was a present from his son, who had made a quick stop at Brooks Brothers on Madison Avenue between getting off his train from Montreal and boarding the New York, a Hamburg-American liner.

Five days after the photograph was taken the German Army invaded Poland and the Second World War began. When I look at the photo, it seems to me my grandfather is seeing the war coming down the river. Billy has a hand on his fathers shoulder, as if to reassure him  but Bobs sees what he sees. Or maybe hes listening to the Lorelei. In some legends the rivers murmur is a bewitching sound made by a beautiful woman, luring men to their death in a dangerous place.

Maybe shes whispering, War.

They were Catholics, not Jews, not socialists, so not especially vulnerable. Bobs had been scolded by a febrile shopkeeper, a local Nazi Party boss, for declining to return the German greeting, the Heil Hitler gesture, but that was nothing compared with the insults and terror that others experienced.

My grandparents had met and were married in London. They were living in a seaside villa on the Isle of Wight when World War I began in August 1914. Bobs was arrested and interned as an enemy alien for four and a half grim years, then deported. His health was shattered. Their savings were exhausted. English Quakers gave them enough money to pay for their tickets and food on the journey to Germany. Along the way their trunks of clothes and household goods were looted by French occupation troops.

When they stepped off the train in Frankfurt in January 1919, neither my grandmother nor my father spoke a word of German. She never learned, but Billy taught himself by reading and rereading the novels of Karl May, romantic tales of German adventurers and noble Apaches on the high plains of Texas and New Mexico. May was Einsteins favorite writer. Hitlers, too.

That summer of 1939 Billy had hoped to persuade his parents to leave Germany. But applying for exit visas meant posting bonds and paying an extortionate flight tax, with no guarantee the visa would even be granted. And my grandfather doubted that England, Ireland or Canada would welcome him, well-dressed or not, any more than they welcomed German Jews. He was a deportee. If they did let him in, he was sure to be interned if another war began.

Five days after that moment on the Rhine, with the war underway, Billy received a telegram from the British consul in Cologne, warning of strained relations between His Majestys Government and Germany and suggesting he leave the country immediately.

He had booked his return on another Hamburg-American liner sailing for New York in the first week of September. But waiting that long was risky. And he couldnt afford to be caught aboard a German-flagged ship if England declared war (which it did on Sept. 3). According to the Nuremberg racial laws he was a German. The Nazis wouldnt recognize his British passport in time of war; he would owe the same duty to the Fatherland as anyone else. Which meant military service or a one-way ticket to Dachau.

He decided to aim for Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, and a Holland America ship. His train from Frankfurt was oversold. The mood on the platform was near hysteria: In a few hours Britain would declare war on Germany. He said goodbye to his parents, in English. Bobs was concerned the German border police would board the train as it approached the frontier and take Billy off, but he reached Rotterdam safely. After three fraught weeks, he was able to get passage on a ship for New York. Reaching Montreal, he immediately applied for a commission in the Royal Canadian Navy. He was turned down for being too German.

My father did not hear from his parents for years, didnt know they were still alive until a friend serving in the Canadian Army found them living in the rubble of Frankfurt in 1945.

My grandparents were not Jews. Nothing else in their story probably mattered more than this: They werent Jews. Theyd bartered their English shoes and silver picture frames for potatoes, their city had fallen down around them, but they were alive.

Decades later I was with my father in a hospital room in Montreal. He was dying, and slipping in and out of a coma. No one had shaved him or combed his hair in a couple of days and he wore one of those demeaning hospital johnnies. He looked pretty wild. Every now and then hed start climbing out of bed. Then hed calm down and, sounding very lucid, ask me to fetch his suit out of the closet, and his shoes, and help him get dressed, quickly. Properly dressed, because the last train was leaving for Rotterdam, and he had to get himself aboard, and across the frontier.

First of two articles

Recently, I learned about an organization that stopped me in my tracks and has forced me to re-evaluate my assumptions about whats possible. Its called Thread. It rallies volunteer community support around underperforming students in Baltimore public high schools and gets results that defy all expectations.

Thread identifies students in ninth grade who are facing major life challenges: poverty, homelessness, family breakdown or single parents who are overwhelmed by work, illness or other problems. The students are in the bottom 25 percent of their classes academically and are often chronically absent. Thread connects them with a team of up to five volunteers who commit to support them in any way necessary, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, for 10 years.

The assistance may include wake-up calls or rides to school, food and clothing, child care or legal help, connection to community service opportunities, help finding jobs, tutoring, SAT preparation or college admission guidance. The philosophy is to do whatever it takes to help the teenager develop into an adult who can pursue a fulfilling life. A volunteer may literally go at 7 a.m. and try to pick the kid up for school, a second person may go at 10 a.m., another person at noon, explains Sarah Hemminger, a Thread co-founder and the chief executive. Volunteers take students to restaurants and movies; they hang out and talk about life; they go camping; they sometimes provide homes to students.

The offer is unconditional support. A student will not get kicked out, no matter how hard he or she tests volunteers. They have to agree to join and their guardian has to agree and sign a lot of paperwork, adds Hemminger. We tell students: Once you are in you cannot get out. This is serious. Its not something you can undo. Youre going to want to undo this, but once its happened, its happened.

Eddie Blackstone, 23, a graduate of Paul Laurence Dunbar High School who is now a junior at Towson University, planning to major in psychology, enrolled in Thread in 2007. In my ninth-grade year, my mom walked out of my life, my dad had just gotten out of jail, I was in the bottom 10 percent of my class, he recalled. One day, a teacher told Eddie that a woman would like to speak with him. It was Hemminger. She gave us a rundown of the program, he said. What initially caught his interest was her offer of free pizza.

One of the volunteers he made a strong connection with was Tong Zhang, who was pursuing a Ph.D. in immunology at Johns Hopkins University. She wasnt overbearing, Eddie recalled. She was like, I dont want to be all up in your business, but I would like to invite you to my house to play video games. Later, he grew close with another Thread volunteer, Rose Parkinson, Tongs friend who was also pursuing a Ph.D. in immunology.

They are two opposite sides of the same awesome coin, Eddie recalled: Tong was soft and loving; Rose damned if Im going to let you fail.

Over the past nine years, Eddie recalled, his life has become interwoven with theirs. People outside my race, age range, and blood family have become the people who are closest to me, he said.

During high school, Eddie and his father were homeless on several occasions for extended periods. Over the years, he has lived with Tong and her husband, and with Rose and her husband. During his senior year, when he was applying for college, he lived in an abandoned house without running water and heat. Rose bought him space heaters and made sure he had a place to do laundry and get showered. When it came to doing homework, applying for college, getting up on Saturday morning to attend SAT practice, staying on track in college, Tong and Rose, and other Thread volunteers, have consistently shown up, encouraged or cajoled or dragged Eddie out of bed, reminding him of his goals and dreams.

He has helped them, too. Tong had immigrated from China, and Eddies companionship helped ease her loneliness. When Roses mother died in 2011, Eddie attended her funeral in Pennsylvania. He was really there for me, Rose said. Now, when they get together, they talk about college and the future. Hes going to be uncle Eddie and teach my son all the things he knows, said Rose.

There were hard moments, too. One day I got into an argument and said something real hurtful to Tong, and she started to cry, recalled Eddie. I saw she was crying because she loves me. I had never had that. My mother wasnt even willing to cry when she was leaving me for a cocaine dealer. I was like, This relationships real.

Another time Rose grew angry with Eddie for saying that he didnt think he was good enough for college. She threw her keys in frustration. Eddie recalled: She was like: Eddie, we know youre better than everything youve been through in your life! We see it in you. Why cant you see it?

Youre not going to throw your keys at someone you dont care about, he added. It gave me a family feeling  like a feeling of being wanted.

Rose commented: Its definitely been challenging. Sometimes its uncomfortable confronting someone about their work ethic or their behavior. But I think the challenge is one of the benefits. Its really rewarding when you start to see changes, when someone starts to become more self-aware and they see they have control over something they didnt realize they had control over before.

For Eddie, the value is clear: If I wasnt in Thread, I would most likely be dead or in jail.

Eddie is an impressive person, but his story is not an outlier. He is one of 255 students who are enrolled in, or who are alumni of, Thread, a nonprofit organization with over 800 volunteers, most of them students from Johns Hopkins University. What they and the Thread students are achieving together deserves national attention.

Of the 176 students who have been in Thread for less than five years, 97 percent are still attending high school or have graduated. Of the 79 who have been in the program for over five years, 92 percent have graduated high school and 80 percent have enrolled in a two or four year college or certification program. (In Baltimores public schools, only 72 percent of students graduate high school within five years.)

Ive been here for almost 30 years and before that I was in various public jobs and I cant think of another program that is as effective as Thread is, and that is as shattering of preconceptions, said Robert C. Embry Jr., the president of the Abell Foundation, who has provided support and guidance to Thread.

Referring to disadvantaged youths, he added: A lot of people assert that if you dont get a child at 3 or 4 years old, or even at 1 or 2 years old, youve lost them. Here is a program that takes a ninth-grade child, not only low income but the poorest performers in their class, and gets them out of high school, which in itself is amazing. The fact that most go on to college, he added, is a sign that we dramatically underestimate their potential.

One of the ideas underpinning Thread is that poverty should be defined as a condition of isolation, not just a lack of money. Relationships are the key things that bring about real changes, said Sarah Hemminger, who co-founded Thread with her husband Ryan. For the two of them, this insight has personal resonance.

As an adolescent growing up in Indianapolis, Ryans home life began falling apart after his mother was badly injured in a car accident. She was unable to work, the family lost its home, and Ryans parents later became addicted to his mothers pain medication. Ryan would come home from school not knowing if there would be anything to eat, or if the house would be cold and dark because the heat and electricity had been cut off. School wasnt helping me meet my critical needs at the time, which was food, clothing and shelter, he recalled. In ninth grade he began skipping school and went from being an A student to failing most of his classes.

But he was fortunate. A group of teachers, led by Sargent Robert Lanam, the schools junior R.O.T.C. instructor, came together to help him. I was the first Thread kid, Ryan recalled. These teachers did everything they could: bought me clothes, paid utility bills, brought food to the house, and made sure I went to school. He started doing better, graduated, and later enrolled in the Naval Academy. Among other things, he has served as an officer on a submarine, worked as a financial adviser for Morgan Stanley, and now serves as the chief financial officer for the Baltimore City Health Department.

One day in 2004, during her first year of a Ph.D. program in biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Sarah found herself at a stop light in front of Dunbar High School. At school, shed been feeling disconnected, not feeling she belonged. She imagined that some of the students in Dunbar High were like Ryan  and she thought she might be able to relate well with them.

She met with the principal and persuaded him to give her a list of ninth-grade students who were academically struggling and facing challenges outside of school. She recruited seven volunteers from school to help with tutoring. Today, 80 percent of that initial group  12 of 15 students  have completed a four-year degree or professional certification program.

Today, the process has been systematized. Each student is connected to up to five volunteer family members who are led by a more experienced volunteer called the head of family. Up to eight heads of family, in turn, receive regular coaching from volunteer grandparents, who report to Thread staff members. Everyone receives backup from resource teams specializing in academics, college preparation and various health, social and legal problems. This model allows Thread, which had operating expenses of $1.1 million in 2015, to grow cost-effectively, while maintaining the long term focus and high volunteer to student ratio, both of which are crucial to its success.

Kids in extreme forms of poverty, often intergenerational, need multiple supports over multiple years, to make it, explains Robert Balfanz, a leading researcher who directs the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University School of Education. Things can be going fine and then something happens. They get evicted, lose a job, a parent gets incarcerated. Those things are continually happening. So you can have a great year, then you have a bad year. Even after you graduate, theres a million ways to fall off track.

The powerful things about Thread, he added, are that they stay with kids over time and get them to adulthood, and the insight to have a group of people do this, so it doesnt become an overwhelming commitment for one person. Those are two powerful innovations.

Thread has become a silent partner for our kids, explained Gregory E. Thornton, the chief executive of Baltimore City Public Schools. Its community is able to meet the needs of students in a way that high school teachers  who may teach 150 students  cannot, he said. The only problem with Thread is it needs to be bigger.

Theres another aspect to the work: What happens when so many diverse individuals and institutions in a city like Baltimore come together around a common mission?

Thread has 1,000 to 1,200 people connected to it, observed Rodney Foxworth, the founder of Invested Impact, a nonprofit mission investment organization in Baltimore, who serves as a board co-chair for Thread. That to me is where the real power is. As wonderful as the outcomes are, what brought me into Thread was the grander vision of a more equitable and inclusive city. We need great organizations to make change, but more than that we need movement making; we need a shift in perspective. Thread is going beyond the organization and building intersections between different communities.

Next week: A fuller examination of how Threads approach works.

When I rented my first city apartment, I discovered it came with a roommate. We did better than make do: We bonded.

I had just been dumped by my boyfriend and was living in Jersey City and working in Manhattan, far away from my closest friends. I was lonely. My roommate cheered and comforted me, although I only ever glimpsed her  a blur  from the corner of my eye. (The her was a guess  I thought of us as two girls on our own.) In the evenings after work, while I drafted an unpublishable novel about my ex, my roommate pattered discreetly around my desk. As I lay on my futon at night, I heard her scampering underneath, and felt loved.

Some loves, though, are better kept secret. Shes a runaway hamster, I told people at work. Not a pet. My friend.

My bosses stared at me. Alison. Thats. Not. A. Hamster. They warned me that my roommate would chew my eyelids while I slept. They lectured me on hygiene, disease, sanity, Grey Gardens and my obligations to humanity  by which they meant private pest eradication, not fighting the systemic injustice that forces hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers to live in grossly infested housing.

Seeing an infested home turned into a spectacle of wonder and mercy, light, play and life, astonished me.

I buckled and bought a trap. Three nights later I came home from work to find my roommate, indeed, not a hamster, but an 18-inch-long rat  yes, that long, tail included  lying dead, broken-necked, in the trap. I used a pair of grill tongs to pick her up, trap and all, and buried her in the trash. It didnt occur to me that Id murdered my friend for fear of being called a filthy, creepy ratgirl. I guess my love wasnt worth much. No wonder my ex had dumped me.

I didnt question the killing. In the six New York apartments Ive lived in since then, Ive killed ants and roaches. Ive jumped into a cab with my tongs and rubber gloves to rescue the friend who couldnt face the cat-decapitated rodent lying on her kitchen counter. Ive fished a dolma-size roach out of a shoe and flushed it down the toilet. Ive thrown out bedbugs along with half my belongings. When the mice arrived, I walked miles on my knees, stuffing crevices with steel wool and scrubbing all the cabinets with bleach, once, twice, five times. Finally, over the objections of the other resident life-form, my husband, Karl, I set mousetraps. Not the humane kind.

Karl, who doesnt like killing, is a scholar of medieval thought on animals. Ask him if theres any exegetical precedent for compassionate, or at least tolerant, cohabitation with vermin, and hell tell you that in the fifth century, St. Augustine described the passengers on Noahs Ark as including not only such as mice and lizards, but also locusts, beetles, flies, fleas, and so forth. Did Noah invite these creeping things to come aboard? No, wrote Augustine, they just infested the Ark as they pleased. Did Noah freak out and set mousetraps? No, he didnt, for the most sacred mystery of saving vermin wasnt Noahs mission: it was Gods.

Neither of us believes in God, but Karl gave me a significant look.

Karl and God notwithstanding, I killed the mice. My cabinets were triumphantly clean. Until, one night, our upstairs neighbor came home drunk, clogged her sink, left the faucet running and flooded both apartments, causing the ceilings in our kitchen and bedroom to collapse.

Mice arent the worst neighbors, remarked Karl, scooping plaster and drowned roaches out of our bed. Mice dont unleash retaliatory floods, either, but when youve been Biblically chastened, you dont look for direct causation. I pondered my lapsed vegetarianism and my knee-jerk commitment to killing. Id known there were better ways to live but, like Augustine, whod prayed, God grant me chastity and continence, but not yet, Id postponed my reckoning with conscience.

After the Flood, Karl and I gave up housekeeping for a while. We roved, stayed with friends and eventually found ourselves in Portland, Ore., in the house of one who welcomed all comers  and not just humans. Houseflies and moths made themselves comfortable; mites seethed inside a jar of rice; mildew flourished in the shower. I detected mouse dung. Ants. Chicken feathers. All of this somehow harmonized, along with the joyous beagle, the worms nestling in the garden herbs, and friends who came for music, drawing workshops, meals and bonfires. It was a place of profound peace, hospitality, and literal liveliness, and it profoundly disturbed me.

I had no idea how this could work back in Brooklyn, until, on a river hike, I met an artist named Alex Branch. We got tangled in a bramble while hunting seed pods; we counted a flock of cedar waxwings; she talked about her work with sea gulls and urban gardens. On another walk, through the the traffic and fishy runoff of Canal Street, she mentioned her Mouse Zoetropes. Alex lives in a mouse-ridden building, but instead of getting embattled and obsessive, shes installing zoetropes, made of exercise wheels, in her basement. The wild mice can run on them, playing little movies in the dark. The beauty and humor of the Mouse Zoetropes, turning a Bed-Stuy infestation into a spectacle of wonder and mercy, light, play and life, astonished me.

It also shamed me. For the first time in years, I thought of my rodent roommate. By animal lovers standards, thats years of stunted empathy. By most peoples standards, its unthinkable to suggest that living with a feral rat is sustainable. But now Im dissatisfied with my solutions, even humane trapping and barriers. Im troubled by my automatic assessment of other lives as contemptible, my arbitrary decisions about where humans and other animals do and dont belong, and my dismissal of small acts of fellowship as misplaced and perverse.

I probably wont change my mind about bedbugs. Ill still panic at the advance of a shrieking raccoon or a squirrel jumping onto my neck. However, Id prefer to be surprised and delighted by the strange possibilities for our living together in the world, and, with Robert Burns, to say, Poor beastie, thou maun live!

As for my roommate, I wish Id followed the example of one woman, around the year 1300, who wept and prayed in anguish to a holy man, Thomas of Cantilupe. She begged him to restore the life of a dead dormouse, whod been stepped on.

Thomas resurrected the dormouse.

That miracle was included in Thomass dossier for canonization; in 1320, the pope made him St. Thomas. It wasnt only the dormouse-lover whod regarded the saving of a tiny rodents life as an act of grace.

nytimes.com,2016-02-23 00:00:00,Notes From Psychiatry's Battle Lines,"['All Contributors', 'The Great Divide', 'The Conversation', 'Errol Morris', 'George Makari', 'The End']","Couch is a series about psychotherapy.

I have two offices, one for answers and another for questions. As a clinical psychiatrist, I begin my day in a room filled with soothing art and soft leather chairs, where my pharmaceutical prescriptions and psychological interventions are intended to meet the pressing needs of my patients. Here, Im supposed to have answers, or at least thats the hope.

Then, at some point near noon, I descend 12 floors, cross a cobblestone drive, pass into an old granite building and settle into a cubicle that overlooks Manhattans East River. Here, by a blackboard filled with arrows, scribbles and circles, and surrounded by hundreds of color-coded files and books, I do my work as a historian of psychiatry. It now becomes my job to critically pick apart the assumptions and beliefs of my own practice, my own field.

Two separate rooms, two different modes. Is that true? I was daydreaming recently, searching for a simple response to a question often asked of me  namely, how does my practice as a psychiatrist relate to my historical studies?  and that was what I first came up with.

Unfortunately, after but a moment of reflection, my neat division collapsed. In clinical psychiatry, perhaps more than in any other field, you incessantly ask questions, and the right question can often become an answer. Not good enough for what? may be all that is required from me to help a patient comprehend a sudden depressive turn. Likewise, historians, though driven by skeptical questioning, certainly can generate solid answers about what happened and why.

Better to say, then, that I inhabit two deeply related realms that have long been divided by mutual suspicion and conflict.

Consider this: Like most clinicians, I am eager for scientific progress, something new that will yield more clarity and provide my patients with faster or deeper relief. However, as I take stock of a new neuroenhancer, or the latest genetic correlation that may point to the cause of an illness, or a suddenly popular diagnosis, the historian in me senses ghosts beginning to stir.

Historians have shown that psychiatry has long suffered from the adoption of scientific-sounding theories and cures that turned out to be dogma. Perhaps the clearest example of such scientism was psychiatrys embrace, in the early 19th century, of Franz Joseph Galls phrenology, in which all mental attributes and deficiencies were assigned to specific brain locales, evidence be damned. During much of the 20th century, psychoanalysis proposed far more conclusive answers than it could support, and today, the same could be said for some incautious neurobiological researchers.

These exaggerations are not merely academic errors. Over the years, scientism has persuaded mental doctors to do bad, even terrible things. Ice-pick lobotomies, refrigerator mothers, insulin shock: The list is not short. The most notorious example involved the father of psychiatric genetics, Ernst Rudin, who during the Nazi era sought to cleanse the German population of so-called degenerative heredity through the sterilization and euthanasia of the mentally ill.

Much less extreme, everyday infiltrations of ideology can be discerned in the portraits that psychiatrists have drawn of their field. Most of these accounts have been self-serving affairs, in which the past was ravaged so as to justify present clinical certitudes. Nearly every generation has featured a proud practitioner who dismissed his predecessors and lifted the flag of victory, only to have it snatched away some years later. Since 1800, the end of history in psychiatry has come with the triumph of the asylum, followed by Romanic medicine, brain anatomy, genetics, psychoanalysis and, most recently, drugs like Prozac.

And so, as my morning sessions end and I cross over to my scholarly retreat, I am acutely aware that my present commitments as a doctor might undermine my capacity to fairly envision the past. Then I settle in before my archives and books and my troubles multiply.

For the past three decades, the reigning model among historians of my field has been dubbed antipsychiatric. Following the work of Michel Foucault, the fashion has been to argue that psychiatry emerged as a police arm of the modern state. Mental doctors were self-deluded or malevolent, their treatments cunning, at times barbaric, methods of control. Mental illness itself, they argued, was a false construct used to control dissidents, rebels and outcasts.

Some fine work along these lines has exposed the creation of bogus diseases that served to pathologize wrong behaviors, such as homosexuality. Researchers have shined light on the supposed madness of runaway slaves in antebellum America and political dissidents in the Soviet Union. They have also explored diagnostic fads, disappearing diseases like hysteria or sudden epidemics of ailments like attention deficit disorder.

However, this vein of research has been tarred by its own crude ideology. If scientism can falsely turn ethical and political issues into matters of disease, and grossly exaggerate what we know about the nature of mental illness, Foucault and his acolytes are prone to an antithetical failing: radical social constructionism. Madness, they would have us believe, whether it is schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder or anorexia, is not grounded in any biological reality. Greedy commercial interests and a repressive society, they claim, have falsely transformed human differences and personal choices into psychiatric disorders.

Arguments of this sort can be morally compelling, for they appeal to the liberal ideal of toleration and argue for the civil rights of stigmatized minorities. However, no one is a Foucauldian in an emergency room. I was a medical resident in psychiatry when I first studied Foucaults arguments, and I got the distinct impression that his madness was often just a metaphor with which to challenge authority, not much related to the shaking, hallucinating teenager that I would soon return to on the wards.

To me, Foucault and his followers seemed impossibly naive, even complacent. Had they ever encountered severe obsessive-compulsive disorder or suicidal depression? Had they ever seen a manic patient take lithium and be restored? Psychiatrists might be blinded by their commitments as insiders, but this academic view seemed sustainable only by remaining on the outside looking in.

Over the years, in my dual roles as practitioner and historian, I have watched each camp become more strident, thanks in part to a lack of dialogue. Too often, psychiatrists dismiss the disturbing lessons from the past, while historians roll their eyes at the very possibility of progress in psychiatry. In these isolated worlds, scientism and radical social constructionism flourish.

Perched as I am between the disputants, lucky to be supported by a unique interdisciplinary institute and a group of like-minded colleagues, I have sought to reconcile my quarreling loves. Its been a bit like marital therapy, in which profoundly intertwined partners mostly ignore each other, then occasionally pipe up to loudly dismiss each others perspective.

Amid such conflict, in my work with patients and in my writing, I do my best to explore contradictions, look for specifics amid abstractions, search for syntheses and, in the face of real uncertainty, advocate for polyphony, a multiplicity of explanatory perspectives. And I have come to distrust unstable dualities like mind or brain, artificial divisions like nature or nurture, and seductive dichotomies that should not end but merely begin an inquiry  such as having one office for answers and another for questions.

nytimes.com,2012-10-10 00:00:00,A Twitter Outburst and Another Chance for Andrew Goldman,"['Http Topics Nytimes Com Top Opinion Thepubliceditor Index Html', 'Margaret Sullivan']","Is it ever acceptable for a journalist to ask a successful woman if she has slept her way to the top?

If he does, and a female reader criticizes him for it, is it a forgivable offense for him to suggest that she is complaining only because she wishes that she, too, could have had that opportunity?

Can you believe were talking about this in 2012?

And that the journalist in question writes regularly for the New York Times Magazine?

It all began when Jennifer Weiner, a former newspaper reporter who has written nine best-selling novels, read Andrew Goldmans latest Talk feature in last weekends Times Magazine.

The interview was with Tippi Hedren, the actress who starred in The Birds and is the subject of a new HBO movie that takes up her relationship with the director Alfred Hitchcock. Mr. Goldman, a freelancer who regularly writes the Talk feature, asked Ms. Hedren if she had ever been tempted to help her career along by having sex with directors.

Ms. Weiner was appalled  especially because she recalled an earlier instance in which Mr. Goldman had asked a female celebrity, though jokingly, if she had used her body to boost her career.

And, so, like every modern writer, Ms. Weiner turned to Twitter, where she wrote:

@jenniferweiner: Saturday am. Iced coffee. NYT mag. See which actress Andrew Goldman has accused of sleeping her way to the top. #traditionsicoulddowithout

Mr Goldman responded on Twitter (his account has since been deactivated):

@jenniferweiner sensing pattern. Little Freud in me thinks you would have liked at least to have had opportunity to sleep way to top

From there, if you can imagine such a thing, it only got uglier, with the New Yorker TV critic Emily Nussbaum joining the fray, and with Mr. Goldman then suggesting he had no choice but to counterattack. In that response, he used a strong obscenity.

Finally, on Monday, he apologized to Ms. Weiner. (A full Storify of the incident can be found here.)

I asked Hugo Lindgren, the editor of the Times Magazine, about the incident sending him a blog post that raised questions about some of Mr. Goldmans earlier questions to women he interviewed, including one with the NPR journalist Terry Gross and one with Whitney Cummings, both of which had elicited criticism from some female readers.

My questions and his responses are below:

1. How do you respond to the complaints that Mr. Goldmans questions are frequently sexist and misogynist?

We dont publish material we believe to be misogynist or sexist. The blog post you sent me cited 3 examples, out of probably a thousand published questions that Andrew has asked since he took over the column. In the context of the full interviews, none of them struck me as sexist or misogynist. There were frank, sensitive questions, not declarations or assertions of his own. In the Terry Gross interview, Andrew is not making his own presumption about her sexuality. He is referring to an anecdote that was published in the introduction of her own book, which was made even clearer when she makes a joke about how widespread this misperception is. The Whitney Cummings question is perhaps a little cheekier but still refers to something other people have said about her  On those Comedy Central roasts, your fellow comedians liked to joke about how you slept your way to fame. How accurate is that criticism?

2. What is your view of the specific question to Ms. Hedren about sleeping her way to the top? Did you see it in advance? If not, would you have approved it?

I saw it and approved it. This is the full question: The worst abuse happened after you rebuffed his advances. Actors have been known to sleep with less powerful directors for advancement in show business. Did you ever consider it? The whole reason for the interview is a new HBO movie about how Hitchcock sexually harassed her. It was an unsavory decision she was actually faced with, so he asked her about it: He made no assertions about what she should or shouldnt have done. Andrews questions acknowledge and refer to sexism in the world, but they are not, in and of themselves, sexist.

For what its worth, his editor and top editor are both women. They did not object to the question. But I take full responsibility for it all the same.

3. What is your response to the Twitter back and forth as detailed in the piece Ive attached here?

I thought Andrew was needlessly rude and insulting, and I told him that. He apologized to Jennifer Weiner, and she accepted it.

4. Could you clarify Mr. Goldmans position with the magazine? Is he a freelancer? A part-time staffer? Does he do other work than the Q&A?

He is a freelancer. He has not yet contributed to the magazine in other ways, but has an active assignment.

5. Is he in good standing at this point? Are you providing any coaching/feedback/disciplinary measures? Does all of this change his standing with The Times?

I made it clear to him that kind of behavior he exhibited in this Twitter exchange would not be tolerated, and he was contrite and accepted that without argument. My feeling is that he had an unfortunate outburst, and that he will learn from it. He works very hard on these interviews and does a good job. Readers are entitled to whatever opinions they have of his work, and he needs to be comfortable with that and engage thoughtfully when appropriate, or not at all.

I talked by phone with Jennifer Weiner on Wednesday. She said that she enjoyed some of Mr. Goldmans work but had found some of it offensive.

I dont see myself as a humorless, schoolmarm-y scold approaching the Magazine with a highlighter in hand, she said. But Andrew Goldman is sometimes on the wrong side of the really offensive line.

And when she found fault with his question to Ms. Hedren, the response shouldnt be shut up, youre ugly, and no one wants to sleep with you,  she said.

He is talented, and funny. I would like to see him do his job better, she said.

It sounds as though hes going to get that chance. Given his misbehavior on Twitter and his status as a highly replaceable freelancer, I think his editors are extraordinarily generous to give it to him.

And, given the level of obscenity and hideous misjudgment in Mr. Goldmans Twitter messages, a clear social media policy at The Times may be in order.",[]

Margaret Sullivan, the public editor of The New York Times, is leaving to join The Washington Post as its media columnist, the two newspapers announced on Monday.

Ms. Sullivan assumed her role at The Times in 2012, and her tenure was scheduled to end in August. In a memo to the staff, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., The Timess publisher, praised Ms. Sullivan, saying she had ushered the position into a new age.

He said that she would remain at the paper for a number of weeks and that the search for a successor was underway. We will be in a position to name Margarets successor very soon, he wrote.

As the fifth public editor appointed by The Times, Ms. Sullivan wrote about journalistic issues and ethics in regard to Times coverage, addressing a range of subjects including fairness and stereotyping.

Its been a real privilege and an honor for me to represent the readers of The Times as their advocate, Ms. Sullivan said in an interview. Its been really enjoyable at times and really difficult at times, but over all a great experience and one that Im extremely grateful to have had.

Ms. Sullivan, who worked as editor and vice president for The Buffalo News before joining The Times, said she strove to hold the organization to its own high standards. Among the issues she particularly remembered writing about were the use of anonymous sources and the practice of allowing sources to approve quotations in articles after the fact. She has also tackled the tension between speed and accuracy as organizations like The Times move into the fast-paced realm of digital news, most recently in a column about reporting on the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.

Her position as public editor, Ms. Sullivan said, had prepared her well for her new role as a media columnist.

Ive been immersed for the past three and a half years in the hotbed of the New York media world, she said. Im well aware of many of the issues that are the most pressing right now, so I feel as though this new position is a really natural outgrowth of what Ive been doing.",[]

ASKED what we prefer to eat for dinner, many of us will virtuously claim a diet of salads and whole grains, never mentioning lifeboat-size portions of penne alla vodka or our addiction to flourless chocolate cake. Asked what we serve the kids, we will nod dutifully to lean proteins and green vegetables, while double-cheese pizza and tater tots will go unmentioned.









But what if a hidden camera recorded what we actually eat or put on the family dinner table? Would farro and steamed broccoli really dominate?

Similarly, what about our consumption of political news? Times readers often write to me saying they want substantial information about the important issues confronting the nation: immigration, income inequality, international conflict. And they complain that thats not what The Times is feeding them.

We really want to be informed, Gregory McKinney of Arlington, Tex., wrote to me recently. Instead, what Mr. McKinney sees in The Timess political reporting is this: easy horse-race, fight-night, lets get ready to rumble! coverage with terms like jab, and graphics of who attacked whom.

And Matt Richter of Woodside, Calif., wrote to me concerned that after the first Republican debate, most of the coverage emphasized winners and losers. When less than 50 percent of the political coverage is about content, you should start to worry.

With these concerns in mind, I analyzed The Timess political reporting, including First Draft and Upshot articles, in recent weeks. Are these readers impressions accurate? And, despite what readers may claim, what do they actually prefer to read?

With plenty of help (thanks to Joumana Khatib, Jaclyn Peiser and Evan Gershkovich), I looked at 14 days of Times political reporting, beginning Sunday, Feb. 14, and ending Saturday, Feb. 27.

And while examining only two weeks of coverage may not tell us everything we need to know, it was revealing. The findings: Of the 234 political stories in that period (an astonishing number in itself), 180 could reasonably be called horse-race stories. Thats more than three of every four articles.

Here are some headlines from each category.

First, the horse race:

Hillary Clinton Rallies Large Crowd in Boston Before the Primary

Rivals Chase Donald Trump Into Nevada Caucuses

Now the issues:

Donald Trump Wants to Hold to Middle Ground on Mideast, for Now

Left Leaning Economists Question Cost of Bernie Sanderss Plans

Of the remaining quarter, some were issues-oriented, some were a blend of horse-race and issues, and some were simply hard to categorize. In that category:

Donald Trump on Protester: Id Like to Punch Him in the Face

This Weeks Trump Insults: The R.N.C., a Poll and (Sort of) Pope Francis

And even among the issue-oriented articles we found in the two-week period, many treated the issues only glancingly, and very few compared the stances of various candidates in a way that might be most helpful to readers.

Another piece of the puzzle is that the horse-race stories seemed to attract more readership. Looking just at one measure, The Timess most popular articles of the last two weeks, we found five of 10 in each week to be about who seemed to be up, and who down. Not a single issues article made either weeks list.

But is that a chicken-or-egg problem? Which comes first  The Timess relative inattention to issues, or the readers smaller appetite?

I talked last week with Dean Baquet, the executive editor, and Matt Purdy, a deputy executive editor, about my findings. Both said that the horse race is so important at this point that it merits this expansive coverage.

I think the horse race gets a bad name, Mr. Baquet said. That makes it seem like mindless head-counting, but the truth is that we are in one of the most compelling races in a generation.

Mr. Purdy referred to a horse race for the ages that is well worth the attention its getting. Both editors made the point that when the candidate field is narrowed (I spoke to them during the day of the Super Tuesday primaries), journalistic attention naturally will turn away from horse-race coverage and more toward substance.

But even now, both editors argued, The Times is not neglecting substance.

If horse race was all we were doing, we would not be honoring our commitment, but thats not the case, Mr. Baquet said. He mentioned the recent deeply reported series on Hillary Clintons policies as secretary of state before and after the 2012 attack on the American diplomatic mission in Libya. This, he noted, was an important example of digging beneath the surface on behalf of readers. Hes right, and there certainly are other examples of coverage that holds the candidates accountable.

The reader quoted above, Mr. Richter, had a suggestion for The Times to limit horse-race coverage: Instead of feeding at this trough like an alcoholic with an open tab at a bar, why not summarize the candidates daily activities and provide regular compare-and-contrast articles on policy issues.

In fact, The Times has produced a standing graphic on candidates positions, but as of late last week, it apparently had not been updated in weeks. It still featured candidates who dropped out long ago, including Martin OMalley and Carly Fiorina.

Its true that the competitive story has been a fascinating one for the past several months, and it certainly deserves plenty of coverage. In addition, many of the candidates (Bernie Sanders is a notable exception) arent always raising the issues in a substantial way. Nevertheless, The Times needs to consider its readers desire for serious, comparative information on the candidates positions, presented clearly and accessibly.

After all, as voting citizens, Times readers face a big decision, and the stakes are high. Reporters and editors ought to provide as much help as possible, even if that means tearing their gazes away from the riveting spectacle of those steeds rounding the clubhouse turn.",[]
nytimes.com,2016-03-11 00:00:00,Carmakers Form Partnerships With Niche Brands to Stand Out,['Jonathan Schultz'],"Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Automakers have long worked with shopping-mall-friendly lifestyle brands, global fashion houses and the occasional rap star to burnish or amplify their product messages.









Lately, though, manufacturers are leaning on highly specialized niche brands to distinguish themselves in an ever more crowded and competitive luxury vehicle market.

Small, craft-oriented brands can speak to authenticity, said Mario Natarelli, a managing partner at MBLM, a global branding agency. The firms New York office published a report in 2015 on what it labeled brand intimacy, and among the top 10 companies it highlighted were four automakers, all cited for their ability to inspire bonding and aspiration among consumers.

Mr. Natarelli said that shrewd relationships forged with small, highly specialized brands can feed those impulses.

Top-end buyers particularly appreciate these partnerships, he said. That combination of rareness, of quality, when somethings bespoke and not everybody knows about it  that can provide extra luster.

The trend is most prevalent in the uppermost reaches of the market.

Reinvigorating its ultraluxury Maybach subbrand in 2015, the Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler hired the German silversmith Robbe & Berking to fashion twin Champagne flutes for rear-seat passengers in the Mercedes-Maybach S600. Land Rover announced its Holland & Holland Range Rover in February, a collaboration with the British maker of sporting rifles.

Yet niche brands are also appearing in midlevel luxury cars. Volvo contracted with Orrefors, the Swedish glassworks, to design a gear selector for its XC90 sport utility vehicle and its coming S90 sedan. The crystalline knob is etched with the studios name, along with Sweden  a nod to national pride that automakers like to showcase.

For us, I think the product synergy was really about British craftsmanship, John Edwards, managing director of special operations at Land Rover, said of the companys new limited-edition S.U.V. Like Land Rover, Holland & Holland is a royal warrant holder, which for centuries has been a sign of prestige among craftsmen that they can serve the royal court, he said. The buyer of a luxury gun is the buyer of a luxury yacht is the buyer of a luxury car, so it just makes sense, he added.

Limited to just 40 vehicles globally in 2016, the Holland & Holland Range Rover contains enough leather, burl walnut and hand-wrought curios to rival an Oxford Classics professors study, and at $244,500, it is by far the most expensive vehicle in Land Rovers lineup.

It certainly doesnt do our brand any harm, Mr. Edwards said of the partnership. We dont enter in thinking its going to have mass appeal.

In the United States, Jeep has followed the trend, in conjunction with American Expedition Vehicles, a customizer in Michigan.

The Filson AEV Brute begins life as a Jeep Wrangler four-wheel drive. If a buyer wants, American Expedition Vehicles will fit the Wrangler with upgraded tires, winches, skid plates and other additions for off-road driving. The Wranglers seats are then upholstered in twill, with brown leather accents embroidered with the logo of Filson, an outdoor apparel and accessories company based in Seattle.

The whole thing came about through some mutual friends, said Matt Feldermann, marketing manager at American Expedition Vehicles. Both Jeep and Filson have similar customer profiles, he said, which led them to explore a partnership.

Compared with the cost of developing an all-new model, a shrewd relationship with a small brand can efficiently shift or reinforce consumer perceptions for a carmaker.

Its a relatively easy way to show a brand can innovate, Mr. Natarelli of MBLM said. He added that its not so different from a veteran pop star plucking an underground producer to remix her new single.

Bigger carmakers typically forge partnerships with highly recognizable brands, but one outlier was the Call of Duty edition Jeep Wranglers, offered for the 2011 and 2012 model years. That tie-up presumed a buyers knowledge of Call of Duty, a military-themed video game franchise.

It may have spoken to just a small segment of the Wrangler buying audience, but it was a segment that we valued, and that we hadnt spoken to before, Kim Adams House, head of Jeep brand advertising, said. Bottom line, the relationship has to be authentic. Ms. House noted that the Call of Duty Jeeps sold more quickly than their unadorned equivalents.

Such partnerships also may put a car on the radar of a new buyer. Before, I might have never looked at the Jeep lot on the way to work, but now I do, said Nicholas J. Correnti, founder of a private-jet company in Columbus, Miss. Mr. Correnti bought the second Filson AEV Brute produced.

It came out, and I thought, Thats something that nobody else is going to have,  he said. I love things that are different.

The Filson connection strengthened Mr. Correntis desire for the four-wheel drive vehicle. You can buy a Coleman cooler or a North Face jacket and theyll last for a couple years, but the Filson stuff, my kids will still be using it, he said. Mr. Correntis vehicle receives so much attention that he stenciled the name of his company, Nicholas Air, on its flanks.

There are only so many niche brands, however, that make sensible fits. Carmakers will have to work harder to keep consumers on their toes, especially at what Mr. Natarelli calls the connoisseur level.

Youre going to have to find more narrow examples, more hidden treasures for the buyer and the car to feel special, he said. Then, remembering Pope Franciss whirlwind tour of the United States last year in a Fiat 500L, Mr. Natarelli was struck by inspiration.

The Pope Edition Fiat, Mr. Natarelli said. Now theres a brand affiliation.",[]

When the residents of Villamartin heard that the landmark castle near their small town in southern Spain was up for restoration, they probably envisaged a thoughtful restoration of the medieval stronghold to something approximating its former glory.









Instead, what they have been left with is something that many feel more closely resembles a multistory parking garage.

The repair of Matrera Castle, perched on a ridge in the Andalusia region, has infuriated locals and provoked the ire of some conservationists. Images of the castle before and after the restoration have recently fueled bemusement and ridicule on social media.

Its a barbarity, one town resident was quoted as saying by the Spanish news channel La Sexta. I dont like what theyve done at all, said another. It looks like theyve used builders instead of restorers, a third said, using a mild expletive to assess the quality of the work.

Hispania Nostra, a preservationist group that advocates the protection of heritage sites, was similarly unimpressed.

The work is truly lamentable and has very badly surprised locals and foreigners, the groups vice president, Carlos Morenes, said on its website, calling the project an example of the massacre of Spanish heritage.

The architect behind the restoration, Carlos Quevedo Rojas, acknowledged that his results were not to everyones taste. I understand the criticism of local people used to seeing the tower look a certain way, he said in a phone interview, but the principle objective was to prevent the collapse of the structure.

Mr. Quevedo Rojas said that modern standards for restoring historic buildings discouraged efforts to make them look as they might have when first erected. You have to distinguish and maintain the historical value and architectural integrity, he said. You cant make the structure have the same appearance as the original. You cant falsify the appearance. It has to be clear which parts are new and which are old.

According to Mr. Quevedo Rojas, plans to restore the castle, which is privately owned, were drawn up in 2011, but had to be altered when the north wall collapsed in 2013 because of floods in the area. In this case, the first objective is to consolidate the structure so it doesnt suffer further collapses, he said.

The project, he said, cost hundreds of thousands of euros  he would not be more precise  and did not involve public funds. Town authorities and the culture and environment departments of the Andalusia regional government approved the project, he said.

Attempts to repair objects of historical significance have gone awry before in Spain. In 2012, a case of suspected vandalism in a church in the northeastern village of Borja turned out to be among the worst art restoration projects of all time: an 83-year-old widow and amateur painter admitted having tried to restore a nearly century-old fresco of Jesus crowned with thorns.

That story had a somewhat miraculous ending  the botched restoration was so appalling that the church has become a tourist attraction.

While the renovated Matrera Castle seems unlikely to enjoy the same fate, the makeover does have its defenders. Jose Maria Gutierrez Lopez, the director of Villamartins small history museum, said critics were simply ill informed.

I think the criticism comes from people without any knowledge of the criteria of modern restoration, he said. They wanted it to be restored to the same condition as it was before, but thats not what happens.

Mr. Gutierrez Lopez, who has written a book about the castle and the history of the surrounding area but was not involved in the repairs, expressed surprise at the negative attention it has received.

When there was the collapse in 2013, we couldnt even get 100 signatures together to restore the building, he said. Now theres been this restoration, theres been an outcry. It makes me very frustrated.

It looks fine to me, he added. I dont think its out of place at all.",[]

A black protester being escorted out of a Donald J. Trump campaign rally on Wednesday in Fayetteville, N.C., was sucker-punched and shoved by a Trump supporter, several videos on social media show.

The protester, identified by The Washington Post as Rakeem Jones, 26, was being walked by sheriffs officers up an aisle at the Crown Coliseum, amid loud boos from the crowd, when a white man in a cowboy hat stepped toward Mr. Jones, punched him in the face and shoved him off-balance.

Mr. Jones stumbled, then could be seen on the floor surrounded by sheriffs deputies. In some of the videos, at least two deputies who were following Mr. Jones up the arena steps could be seen walking past the man who had just punched Mr. Jones.

But on Thursday, WRAL, the local NBC television affiliate, reported that a 78-year-old man, John McGraw of Linden, N.C., had been charged with assault and battery and disorderly conduct. The station cited the Cumberland County Sheriffs Office. Messages left with a spokesman for the sheriffs office were not immediately returned.

It was not the first violent incident at a Trump rally, nor the first with racial overtones. Another African-American protester, a female student at the University of Louisville, was pushed and jostled at a rally in Louisville this month and called leftist scum and other racial slurs.

Hope Hicks, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, called such incidents unfortunate but said the campaign had no control over its supporters behavior. She did note that the campaign plays a safety announcement before each event, instructing the crowd not to touch or harm protesters.

We obviously discourage any kind of physical contact or engagement with protesters, she said.

Later in the Fayetteville rally on Wednesday, when another in a series of demonstrators was being led out, Mr. Trump himself lamented what he called the good old days when someone who acted up would be carried out on a stretcher.",[]
